Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25959292], score=None, time=1611938347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959032, text='&gt;Where&#x27;s the pump and dump?<p>Whether this specific instance counts as a pump and dump is irrelevant. The point is that it&#x27;s illegal and &quot;free speech&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid defense. Furthermore, comments elsewhere in this thread have mentioned that intentionally causing a short squeeze is also illegal.<p>&gt;Look it up under market manipulation. A oversized hedge fund overselling a stock will certainly be able to set the price where they want and then profit.<p>And the same isn&#x27;t true of the people in WSB gobbling up GME?')
