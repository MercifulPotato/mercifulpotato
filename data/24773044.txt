The enjoyment ratio between a vacay and no vacay is way more and hence isn&#x27;t a suitable comparison. Heck, spending $2000 on a vacation seems more worth it than the phone (to me).<p>It&#x27;s a bloody phone. You&#x27;ll browse stuff with it, do email, maybe tweet and Instagram or Facebook. None of that demands that budget today. Heck it wouldn&#x27;t even feel different in those apps in the way an Audi or bmw would.<p>I use a phone that&#x27;s plenty performant for all of that (and I don&#x27;t insta or FB), with plenty memory (6gb) and storage (128gb) that I paid $150 for.')
