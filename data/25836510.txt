But the connection isn&#x27;t presented, it is assumed. And in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt;As a media historian, I find more than a little similarity between the stand those stations took back then and the way Twitter, YouTube and Facebook have silenced false claims of election fraud and incitements to violence in the aftermath of the siege on the U.S. Capitol â€“ noticeably by silencing the claims of Donald Trump and his supporters.<p>If you&#x27;re going to link accusations of election fraud with Nazism you need more than &quot;more than a little similarity&quot;.<p>And bundling up accusations of election fraud with incitements to violence is very sloppy. Someone can believe fraud happened without advocating violence.<p>If we don&#x27;t allow that seperation, then anyone who is critical about anything to do with the election is inciting violence. Of course, when this standard is applied it won&#x27;t be done evenly. Instead it will be targeted to certain groups. At that point it becomes political persicution.')
