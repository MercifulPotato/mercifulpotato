He has been direct and harsh when needed (there is a world of difference between this and the phrases you have used), otherwise he has shown a lot of restraint. For example, he has said that due to the nature of email communication, one has to be direct since a lot of non-verbal and personal nuances cannot be conveyed which is exactly right.<p>I am sure we can all recollect email chains&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;meetings where nothing was ever achieved because people did not want to offend somebody with thin skin in spite of the fact that they were squarely to blame. Being direct and calling them out is not being obnoxious&#x2F;arrogant but simply moving things along towards a goal. To be nice&#x2F;kind does not mean everybody has to be mollycoddled and tip-toed around due not wishing to &quot;hurt their feelings&quot;. Engineering is a hard science and while we have to follow social mores and etiquettes this should be regulated (i.e. we should know when to break them) so that progress towards the end goal is not derailed.')
