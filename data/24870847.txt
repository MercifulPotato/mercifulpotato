FiveThirtyEight&#x27;s modeling includes sources of uncertainty beyond just the margin of sampling error of the individual polls.<p>They&#x27;ve tallied up how much the polling consensus erred for past elections, and have found that while it is not consistent which <i>direction</i> the polling consensus will err for a give election cycle, it <i>is</i> possible to quantify what is a typical <i>size</i> of polling error. Or to put it another way, which methodological shortcomings matter changes from one election to the next, but that doesn&#x27;t stop you from estimating how big an effect it is likely to have.<p>Assuming that the polls are likely to be collectively wrong by some amount is why the FiveThirtyEight forecast&#x27;s probability distribution is so wide, with their 80% confidence interval for Trump&#x27;s electoral college vote total currently spanning roughly 120 to 280.<p>(They also include uncertainty factors for how much the true state of the electorate&#x27;s opinions could shift between now and election day, but those factors are fading out of the forecast model as election day approaches.)')
