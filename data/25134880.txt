That is something completely different.<p>What I am trying to bring across is: there are multiple &#x27;simplest&#x27; solutions. It helps to know how, in the future, you are expecting to abstract away from that solution to newer &#x27;simplest&#x27; solutions.<p>For example, one might want to use a FP-ish approach, because simplest solutions within that space tend to abstract better than an OOP approach. Or in the recipe example, we could have modeled the steps as objects with dependencies. Given the right programming language, that solution might be as simple as the OP, but provide many more extension points.')
