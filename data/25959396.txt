I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between HN and the likes of Facebook or Twitter. As far as I can tell, HN mods focus more on how you say something rather than what you say. If you&#x27;re civil, respectful, and on-topic you&#x27;re seemingly allowed to present just about any idea.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, most other social media platforms seem content to let other people be complete pricks to each other as long as they don&#x27;t present any ideas which the platform have decided are wrong or &quot;dangerous&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s as much to this observation as it seems.  Firstly, HN is a different site than Facebook, which means it has a different userbase with different moderation problems.  It&#x27;s not like people are civilly and respectfully planning insurrections here, and if they were, the moderation would probably shift to stopping those &quot;wrong or &#x27;dangerous&#x27;&quot; things.  Also, the kinds of dis- and mis-information the the major social networks are fighting hasn&#x27;t gotten much of a foothold on HN, and is often moderated away when it shows up.<p>Secondly, to your earlier point: HN has human moderators who can (more or less) keep up.  While Facebook has human moderators too, there aren&#x27;t enough of them to keep up, so it relies heavily on automation and crowdsourcing.  They don&#x27;t have the capacity to pay attention to &quot;how you say it,&quot; even if they wanted to.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like day care: if you have one teacher and ten students, the teacher is doing a good job if each student gets a lot of high-quality personalized attention; if you have one teacher and fifty students, the teacher is doing a good job if she manages to just barely keep them from hurting themselves.')
