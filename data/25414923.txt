Item(by='auganov', descendants=None, kids=[25415151], score=None, time=1607937031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411589, text='&gt; I think the text is probably too small but I don&#x27;t realise because in proportion to the smaller screen size it looks large.<p>My laptop is 1366x768 and it feels &quot;wrong&quot; to be zooming-in when screen real estate is already so limited. But once you get over the initial weirdness, you&#x27;ll just keep doing it. Right now, on my desktop, I have HN at 250% zoom. I can make out 100%, 150% is perfectly readable, but 250% just feels great. Also many sites, including HN, have unlimited or very long paragraph widths so zooming fixes that too.')
