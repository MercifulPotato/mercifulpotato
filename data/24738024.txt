I&#x27;m not sure what gave you that idea in this thread.<p>Requiring permissions from users to access data is good, and an actually well curated app store is just as useful.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that it shouldn&#x27;t be possible to install through different avenues as well (still requiring the users permission).<p>Yes you would get a lot of shitty software if you started installing everything you stumble upon, but the apple store quality would probably increased significantly, because they could deny significantly more apps, as they&#x27;d have an alternative approach to get to users that really want it')
