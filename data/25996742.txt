Agreed, it&#x27;s uncomfortable to read.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m very embarrassed and ashamed of my ADHD (hence the throwaway account here), so I try to minimise what I consider its scope as much as I can. When I was eventually diagnosed, even though I sought out being investigated for ADHD, I was disappointed! I said to the psychiatrist, I was hoping you&#x27;d tell me it&#x27;s something else. But no, it was ADHD, and the medication does help.<p>Also if I am explaining it to someone for whatever reason, I&#x27;ll make sure to point out that it might be a reason for some things, but not an excuse. I hate the thought of not taking responsibility. I mean, it&#x27;s still my broken brain at fault, even if I didn&#x27;t break it myself.')
