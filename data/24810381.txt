My initial RSUs had appreciated by 5x by the time I left. Every time they vested I took the money off the table.<p>My colleagues loved me, I got great performance reviews, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I was learning or growing. I was severely burnt out after working on a couple projects that exploded due to organizational problems. I went through 3 managers in a year because of reorgs and departures. Ultimately I left that job because I tortured myself - what was I doing, what value did I add? How would I get a job after this when my skills were out of date?<p>Meanwhile the company&#x27;s stock has tripled <i>since I left</i>. Even if I had sold every time my stock vested I would be a millionaire by now. I grew up poor, and the security of having that money in the bank would be life-changing. Instead I&#x27;m at a new startup where I&#x27;m not any happier, but I also don&#x27;t get a million dollars.')
