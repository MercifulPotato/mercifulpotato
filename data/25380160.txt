Frequently gets itself into a state where &quot;WindowServer&quot; is consuming half my memory, or some network kerfuffle stops me being able to reach anything for a few minutes, or it kernel panics.<p>Not to mention the bloody updates which unlink GCC&#x2F;CLANG but kinda keep it around which means I have to go clean my drive manually and crap. Ugh, exhausting.<p>Sometimes I consider going back to linux for work honestly.')
