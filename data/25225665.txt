If you are discovered and you gathered evidence, you might have that evidence confiscated or you might just be dead. If you are discovered but didn&#x27;t manage to get the evidence, you might be charged with wiretapping. (Or they might just kill you anyway.) Even if all works out in the end, you&#x27;re looking at a legal battle. (Most people don&#x27;t want to be the one fighting a case that sets precedence even if federal courts largely seem to rule in their favor.) And all that struggle is for evidence that might not even convince anyone to start an investigation and&#x2F;or may not be admitted to court.')
