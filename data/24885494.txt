I don&#x27;t know the history of The Book&#x27;s date of publish&#x2F;development vs blandy&#x27;s book enough make this any more than a conjecture: it seems like blandy&#x27;s book is a re-take on the book.<p>also, i am not saying The book is any good beyond a tour of the language. come to think of it, it&#x27;s actually less like TC++PL or D&amp;EC++, and more like the tour of c++.')
