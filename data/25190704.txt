In C, the size of the integer primitives isn&#x27;t defined.  What is defined is that sizeof(char) will always be 1 (one).  However, it is entirely implementation defined what that 1 refers to.  On most systems, it is the number of 8-bit bytes, but it could refer to a larger or smaller amount of memory.')
