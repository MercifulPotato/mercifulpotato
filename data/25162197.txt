Many &quot;types&quot; used in JavaScript libraries are horribly complex. For example, the type signature of jQuery&#x27;s `$` function, or moment.js&#x27;s main function, or `server.listen` in Node.js, etc.<p>In fact I think the opposite argument from yours could be made with a straight face: not having to declare types encourages <i>more</i> complexity. I don&#x27;t really agree with that either, though; in my experience this is more a matter of developer discipline and API design skills.<p>One thing I&#x27;m certain of is that if libraries are going to have complex types, I&#x27;d much rather have them be explicit and machine-verifiable vs hidden&#x2F;implicit&#x2F;hope-the-developer-wrote-a-good-docstring.')
