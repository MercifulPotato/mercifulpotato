Considering some mysterious people mentioned in a single line in Genesis as being of similar stature as Christ also goes against the idea of Christ as part of the Trinity.<p>Also, Christianity considers all people to be children of God (though apparently not &quot;begotten&quot;). On top of that, almost every Christian interpretation of the Bible seems to skip over that mention of the nephilim like it&#x27;s not there. There&#x27;s far more reason for Christianity to argue <i>against</i> translating this as &quot;sons of God&quot; than for it.')
