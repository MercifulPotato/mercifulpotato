Ex:<p>{\n  “birthdate”: [“date”, “01-02-1991”]\n}<p>And then in your codebase you know that all the values in your data are actually a list of (type, value). In this specific case I’d decide a “date” as “mm-dd-yyyy”<p>These <i>are</i> trivial problems. We have all solved them.<p>The root of the problem is wanting to put all your trust&#x2F;hope&#x2F;faith in the regular old JSON.encode and JSON.decode methods. Reading between the lines that is what I believe the author is frustrated with. It sounds like they want the equivalent to a Python’s pickle or PHP’s serialize. But of course you will quickly run into limitations there, too.<p>The lesson being: we will all need to augment vanilla serialization tools with little tweaks and enhancements to fit our specific use cases. Again, blaming the tool is not productive. JSON is not the problem. JSON can do all of the things the author wants it to do. The issue is that JSON.stringify cannot.')
