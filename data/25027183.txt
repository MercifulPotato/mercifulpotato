The client was outright hostile to people who would pick up their tickets. It was extraordinarily hard to please them. They&#x27;d also leave bad reviews on the tickets once completed, which would impact our bonus (!)<p>So the eventual outcome was no one would pick up their requests from the queue, and this made them even more angry and difficult. I flat out refused to do them, directly to my managers, since they wouldn&#x27;t consider voiding the inevitable bad reviews. Just dumb all around.')
