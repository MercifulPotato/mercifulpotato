Item(by='XCSme', descendants=None, kids=[25645354, 25646475, 25646122], score=None, time=1609845682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641205, text='The video is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen, really makes me excited for the product.<p>As for the product itself, I think the biggest &quot;feature&quot; is the ability to cut the audio by cutting the transcript, which makes it easier to quickly edit files. Transcribing is pretty common, the dubbing also sounds interesting but depends on how good the quality is.<p>I think the use-case for this is not YouTubers who expect high-quality, but social-media users who want to generate more average-quality content in a short amount of time.')
