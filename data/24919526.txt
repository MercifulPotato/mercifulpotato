Mainly, I used python and matlab, but I want to extend my programming range to include a compiled, systems language because lots of digital signal processing is written on embedded devices.<p>To me, it seems Rust is so much better than C&#x2F;C++ in many ways: lots of Python-like abstractions, rigid compile time safety checks... A modern language designed from scratch without a hodge podge of welded on features.<p>Rust could also turn into something big, by the looks of it, in the next 10 years.<p>So I have two questions: how much does it make sense for me, in my circumstance, to learn Rust as my first systems language, and the second question is how much, in general ignoring my circumstances, does it make sense to learn Rust first?')
