Perhaps it should be sold over the counter at pharmacies? A licensed pharmacist can advice the buyer of the risks and can connect them with resources to help with addiction if there is a desire for that.<p>We already massively promote and sell alcohol nearly everywhere. It&#x27;s a deadly drug that is more dangerous to use than many illegal drugs. Tobacco is similarly broadly distributed, yet causes cancer and early death in millions of people.<p>If drugs were regulated based on their risk level, then it&#x27;s likely that tobacco would be sold in plain packaging at pharmacies and MDMA would be available in a vending machine...')
