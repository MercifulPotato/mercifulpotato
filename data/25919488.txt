Inevitably, I think, your anarchist society would end up being a society with a government - just not the same government as we currently have. Maybe the power would be more hidden, or less responsible to the people, but there would still be a government managing it. That&#x27;s not to say it wouldn&#x27;t be better in some ways - but people have to coordinate in order to solve large problems, and that&#x27;s what governments do.<p>In an ideal version of your system, everything is great. In an ideal version of my system, everything is great. Comparing your ideally functioning system to the Soviet Union is like comparing a perfectly ripe apple to a decaying, moldy orange from 20 years ago. Likewise, the EU is an imperfect example of the thing it is trying to be, but it is still better than the things that preceded it. The pains of Brexit we are seeing now are not &quot;growing pains&quot; or &quot;adjustment pains&quot;, IMO - they are the pains of moving from a better way of doing things (which had its own sets of downsides) back to what a worse way of doing things, where &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; mean &quot;more efficient at helping people get what they need and do what they want&quot; and &quot;less efficient and helping people with those same things&quot;.<p>The likely reality is that if a system is populated by people incentivized to behave badly, it will suck to exist in for a lot of people, probably most. A good system is one populated mostly by people incentivized to act well. The incentive could come in many forms - cultural expectations, religious teachings, economic incentives, and so on. You could definitely establish an allegedly anarchist society that had the right cultural and societal incentives to be stable - if you could set up those incentives first. Ditto with a communist society. The problem is not what we call the organizations responsible for managing cooperation between people at scale, it&#x27;s how we train humanity to interact with and consider them.<p>Therefore, the right system to pick is whichever one we can achieve that is most likely to be an improvement on the one we have given the current set of incentives - and right now, given the scale of the problems facing global society, I think a more globalized, less isolated, more open system is the one to choose. Brexit is a step back, to me, because it moves us more towards systems that will not work for the challenges we face, no matter what we call them or how we culturally couch them, because it disincentivizes people from caring about others at the scale necessary to solve problems common to both.')
