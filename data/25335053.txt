Item(by='TuringNYC', descendants=None, kids=[25335210], score=None, time=1607364800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334816, text='&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not looking for the most interesting work at that point, they&#x27;re looking to keep their job and raise a family - it&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>&gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t that a risk to move to a place without as many employment options? Yes. The reason for that risk is you can raise kids in a nice house for $500k rather than in a tiny, old, 2 bedroom apartment for 1.5M.<p>You <i>exactly</i> summarized my thought process three years ago. To be fair, i&#x27;m very happy here. But it is a mixed bag.<p>Housing is great compared to the bay area, but $500k is a stretch for DC&#x2F;Virginia (check it out on zillow) though not impossible, there is a ton of inventory if you are willing to drive out a bit. Unlike FAANG folks out-buying houses from you, you have lobbyists and government&#x2F;intelligence contractors outbidding houses from you. Def better than Bay area though.<p>Except i&#x27;m in one of like five growth startups in the area and there are rarely any senior positions open, and the senior workforce appears larger than the pool of interesting senior jobs. Its a <i>huge</i> bet on your employer in addition to the already huge bet you&#x27;re making w&#x2F; taking, say, illiquid early stage stock. So your career growth is much slower.<p>OK, so what if you are OK w&#x2F;o an interesting job? Then you have plenty of options. Also, plenty of options if you&#x27;re willing to be a consultant and travel, but  now you&#x27;re making a 2nd tradeoff.<p>All in, very happy but not a panacea and certainly multiple tradeoffs.')
