Item(by='fanf2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607283790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326001, text='My plan is that the geometric algebra operations will be generic in Rust like they are in maths, but application code will be more concrete, using type aliases for points, rotations, etc. So the programmer can choose to be as abstract or specific as they want, depending on what makes sense in a particular situation. For example, if I have something like a polyhedron, I&#x27;ll declare that as an array of points. A function for something like intersecting a line with a face (raytracing) will be generic internally but have a more concrete signature.<p>I don&#x27;t yet know how well this will work in practice :-)')
