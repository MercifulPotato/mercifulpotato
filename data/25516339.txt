For example, I will spend a week trying to perfect a dish I just learned. I do it over and over everyday, trying different ways and failing until I make it great.<p>But for most of the time, I&#x27;d rather not have to do it.<p>&gt;<i>Just be aware that it&#x27;s rather expensive in the long run.</i><p>True.
