For example:<p>&gt; However, there’s a clear nudge for developers to publish their recompiled apps to Apple’s store.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Where is the &quot;nudge&quot; coming from? The article doesn&#x27;t make any argument for how that works, given that you can share universal binaries outside the App store. Apple Silicon isn&#x27;t changing anything that would &quot;not so gently nudge&quot; developers into the App Store.<p>Similarly, old apps only compiled for x86 being compatible in the future is... not really about control. PowerPC apps aren&#x27;t compatible with intel Macbooks; that&#x27;s just an inevitable outcome of switching the ISA. There&#x27;s nothing about platform control in that.')
