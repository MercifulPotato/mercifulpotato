You&#x27;d have 0% probability if you picked the wrong one.<p>Only if you picked one at random you&#x27;d have 50% probability of being right. You can see that the 50% comes from the process you used to pick the answer not from how the answer relates to reality.<p>Imagine you are tossing a coin to choose what you are going to believe in about whether we live in a simulation or not.<p>Before you toss a coin you have 50% of holding the correct belief. But after you tossed it you have either 100% probability that you hold correct belief or 0% depending on how coin toss aligned with reality.')
