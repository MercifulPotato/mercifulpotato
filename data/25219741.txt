It&#x27;s not like you create a separate branch and work independent of master. It&#x27;s more like working on a kind of local pre-release ahead of master.<p>You work on the development&#x2F;pre-release, then consolidate by cherry-picking or otherwise, leaving all the todo&#x27;s, spinoffs, experimental, personal notes in the pre-release. Like a reptile shedding its skin.')
