Apple calls those binaries “Universal binaries”.  Rosetta is more like running different arch binaries through qemu. A brief look through Google says that there was a FatELF specification created years back, but never really went anywhere. Presumably because Linux users tend to know what arch they are using.<p>Fat binaries would make distribution easier, but would double (or triple) the size of a binary. I doubt it would be worth the size trade off.')
