Trying to type on the sofa or in bed means my hands are at all the wrong angles and touch typing completely fails me. (I wrote this not looking at the keyboard at all.)<p>The couch is fine for reading a tablet.<p>For me the trick when moving back and forth between the office and home was to have an external drive with everything on it and carry it back and forth. A better approach is probably remote desktop or remote login.<p>I travel with a cheap laptop loaded with only what I anticipate needing on the trip. It eases my mind to not worry too much about having it stolen, lost, or smashed.')
