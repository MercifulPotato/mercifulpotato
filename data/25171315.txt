I&#x27;ve seen a huge spread in quality from my colleagues which definatley impacts opinions on WFH.<p>For me we built an office in our garden around 5 years ago. Good size, ethernet connected from the house. Kids came along around 3 years ago and I was hardly using it (wife wouldn&#x27;t let me escape so easy!) now it&#x27;s been a lifesaver since March, by far one of the best investments I have made.<p>Having said all this I do miss the office, I just don&#x27;t need to be there 5 days a week.')
