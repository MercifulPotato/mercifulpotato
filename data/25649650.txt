Meaning even Syrian refugees who fled the country cannot find a proper job.<p>Your country is destroyed, your life is ruined and yet you cannot restore your career.  Being denied your right to work is the worst thing that can happen to anyone after war.<p>Yet, I think this is the right decision. Good job GitHub and congrats to our fellow Iranian developers.')
