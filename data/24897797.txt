Walton&#x27;s bio pop biz book was widely read (early 90s). Starbucks was considered very progressive for the time (by us &quot;carpet walkers&quot;, what the blue collar workers called us office workers). Lot&#x27;s of happy worker bees.<p>But at some point, Walmart took a hard turn to the right.<p>And to my own shame, I didn&#x27;t understand how anti-labor Starbucks was at the time. There was always grumblings and heresay. It was easy to dismiss as sour grapes and cranks. Then Schultz became a candidate for President and all the knives came out.<p>Moving forward, I just want what&#x27;s fair. I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s okay for the top of the heap to become billionaires while the minions are making starvation wages. It doesn&#x27;t have to be 50&#x2F;50 even split of the spoils. But upgrading from 1&#x2F;99 to 10&#x2F;90 or even 20&#x2F;80 would materially improve the lives of millions of people.')
