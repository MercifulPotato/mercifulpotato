Canada does have laws against hate speech and I&#x27;d mistakenly thought the US did as well. In any case, speech intended to incite lawbreaking, whether a hate crime or otherwise, is not protected under the first amendment. If you tell your Twitter followers to go burn down all the Jewish-owned business or whatever, and they do, your speech is illegal. So there are at least <i>some</i> limits.<p>And I agree that freedom of speech goes beyond the first amendment. But the &quot;significant public figure&quot; of that is important: not anyone could get published in the New York Times, you already had to have reach and notoriety. They wouldn&#x27;t have published articles by some random basement crackpot moon conspiracist, because that person wouldn&#x27;t have a chance to get famous in the first place. They probably also don&#x27;t publish opinion pieces with easily-disproven counterfactual statements. YouTube&#x27;s algorithm, by default, makes no distinction: any idiot can go viral and get tons of reach on a video loaded with outright lies. YouTube has provided a platform that makes the spread of misinformation much easier and in my opinion it&#x27;s their responsibility to take action to correct that.')
