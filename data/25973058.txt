Existing and future green energy plants (solar&#x2F;wind&#x2F;water) won&#x27;t be enough to charge 60% EV&#x27;s in 10 years without nuclear or fossil backup, if all current oil-based traffic was now using EVs. But as soon as you start generating energy for EVs from fossil fuel, the COÂ² balance reverses due to an even lower efficiency factor than combustion in modern ICEs.<p>Either we accept nuclear energy as &quot;clean&quot; and massively stock up in this area (also investing massively in next generation nuclear, like fusion power), or we&#x27;ll face a huge backlash in a few years. Or we invent a next-generation battery which is cheap enough (on resources) and improve upon existing energy storage by at least one order of magnitude.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;prod&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;f69&#x2F;GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;prod&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;f69&#x2F;GITT%20I...</a>')
