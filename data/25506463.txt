Saying that you need to sanitize disabled or normal fields in “crypto websites” is like saying that you need to put handrails on 7th floor of a red building to prevent falling down. But in reality you may fall from any height that has no handrails, and 7th floor and a red decoration aren’t specific requirements for falling.<p>I’m not trying to nitpick here, my confusion was genuine. These sorts of statements are hugely misleading even for seasoned folks (“what if I missed something in disabled inputs? why crypto suffers from that?”), and in novice developers it creates magic recipe thinking instead of generic awareness that you never want to execute(user_input).')
