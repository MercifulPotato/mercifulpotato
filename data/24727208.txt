But in the recent year, Dropbox has added a lot of unnecessary features to the tool that slow down my machine significantly. I really don&#x27;t like that. I only want a plain simple file synchronization app that works for files, symlinks and UNIX permission. That&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t need friend list or complicated document collaboration feature. This is personal use only. I don&#x27;t mind paying money but I don&#x27;t want to buy pain.')
