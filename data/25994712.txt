Funny - HPE sold that last batch of hardware, but they refused to sell software to go along with it - you have to go over to VSI to get that.<p>It’s just an Ingres database and batch processing data into and out of it.  Can you believe Ingres is still around?!?<p>The replacement is a DataBricks&#x2F;Spark system, but it’s years behind schedule - that’s why they had to buy new servers before production ended.  It makes me sad that to match the performance of a 2nd-gen dual core Itanium (the entry-level processor back then - 10 years ago), we need a 10-node cluster and all the guys are hand tuning their partition parameters just to get to that performance level.')
