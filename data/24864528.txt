The top-rated comment from the release on HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9224" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9224</a><p>&gt; I have a few qualms with this app:<p>&gt; For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.<p>Now that Dropbox is a unicorn (and there are dozens of other competing products, some of them unicorns in their own right), it&#x27;s easy to pass this off as an obvious idea. But plenty of people at the time thought it was a bad bet.')
