I had basically the same point of view when I was dating and never strayed from it.<p>The only thing that did change was that I made myself start dating and I was extremely honest. I told anyone that I asked out (or the rare &quot;asked me out&quot;) that I wasn&#x27;t looking for a serious relationship. The first time I said it was after a bad breakup because I didn&#x27;t think I was ready for it, but I was shocked at how well this was received.<p>What I accidentally discovered is that women often want to go out, they want to go on a date, get to know you and see if there&#x27;s a mutual connection there. What they don&#x27;t want is to be stuck if they decide it&#x27;s not and you become overly clingy, so they have to concoct ways to let you down easy or break it off without hurting your feelings.<p>It&#x27;s been 18 years so forgive me if I can&#x27;t remember exactly how I phrased it, but I think at some point in a conversation I&#x27;d say something along the lines of &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m not looking for a serious relationship right now but I like you. Would you like to [have dinner|catch a movie|hang out] sometime?&quot;<p>It was great. No pressure on anyone (including sexual pressure), no serious hard feelings from any of it. Actually made a lot of life long friends. Over the course of 1 year I went out with about 12 different people and met my wife. We&#x27;ve been married for 16 years now.')
