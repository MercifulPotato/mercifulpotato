Chances are you didn&#x27;t arrive at your current processes entirely in a vacuum, and it&#x27;s already a mishmash of ideas from the zeitgeist, filtered to not being the worst on all dimensions by the fact that you&#x27;re still around to observe it.<p>You really need to be able to pick out the good ideas from the bad ideas, and that doesn&#x27;t come readily to everyone.')
