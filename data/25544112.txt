Item(by='amelius', descendants=None, kids=[25544409], score=None, time=1608997817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544025, text='&gt; you can see that the lever is pushed by its center, hence both sides have the same length. So the same force is applied to both wheels.<p>This is not necessarily true. Imagine a similar symmetric lever with a weight on one side, and a force on the axis that accelerates rotation. The acceleration of both ends of the lever are equal, but the force is not equal (since the weight is 0 on the other end).<p>Anyway, the point of my comment was that a thorough analysis of this configuration is more involved than this video of which it was claimed that it &quot;perfectly&quot; explains how this works.')
