I object to the idea that Yglesias &amp; Klein share a bucket with Greenwald and Taibbi; the former are serious policy pundits, the latter are trolls.<p>People talk about how Yglesias is unable to speak his mind, but David Shor is _ubiquitous_ in the mainstream media right now; nobody ever did anything better for that guy&#x27;s career than the Civvis Analytics people who fired him. Not that you should let any of those people off the hook, the moral dimension of what they did is unchanged, but it&#x27;s a strong bit of evidence against the idea that Yglesias was somehow being suppressed at Vox or anywhere else.<p>Yglesias will do better on Substack than as a cog at a media company, and that&#x27;s fine. (I like him too.)')
