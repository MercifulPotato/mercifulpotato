Item(by='brianjunyinchan', descendants=None, kids=[25455236], score=None, time=1608177795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441662, text='“Search while writing” reminds me of an idea I’ve had passing fanciful interest in: a device that universally ingests all the content I’ve read, words I’ve typed or said, and topics I’ve heard.<p>If there was some agreed-upon standard for “hierarchy of information” in the world (e.g. a piece of information is marked as ‘Topic’ vs ‘Detail’ and categorized, akin to biological taxonomy), everything I know could be organized.<p>One would have this program accompanying them everywhere, communicating with standardized protocols with other tools our species uses, and configurable for what types of information the user wants to ingest&#x2F;process or not, etc.<p>Then, when writing anything new, one could have this program at their side, with a display constantly updating with relevant things they’ve heard before about the thing they’re currently typing. Maybe add some bells and whistles for greasing “brainstorming” and automating suggested topic connections.<p>It’s along the spirit of the recent backlinking&#x2F;passive info processing trend... and reflecting on how enabling the standardized protocols of the Internet have been. Anyways...<p>Did want to leave some useful feedback. I think it’d be clearer if a quick summary sentence of ThinkType’s functionality came in a block before the inspiration-monologue part. Reading that while searching for the gist of ThinkType sapped at my curiosity a bit.<p>At the moment I use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;foambubble&#x2F;foam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;foambubble&#x2F;foam</a> with VSCode and have repurposed the backlinking functionality as my tag system (I make a blank file with its name as the tag). This helps assuage my concern that I might miss something when searching for it later, eg if I don’t choose the correct term to search for, or had a typo in the original note. I also like that, when looking at a tag, I can see what docs I’ve mentioned that tag in. (“What notes have I written that have the [[SCI-FI-THOUGHTS]] tag?”)<p>It also helps that CMD+P enables fuzzy search for an existing note file by its name, and ctrl-click on a [[backlinked]] phrase takes me to that page.<p>If there was a separate desktop app where all this functionality was first class, I would use it, because then I could use CMD+Tab to switch to that app, while keeping my VSCode windows for my coding.<p>I also tried Obsidian but it was too clunky. Haven’t tried Roam.<p>Anyways, nice work so far!')
