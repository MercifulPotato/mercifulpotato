Growing up around Southern hospitality set a high bar, but even compared to less friendly parts of the States, it was hard to strike up random conversations that were deeper than anything superficial. It&#x27;s a hard culture to break into if you&#x27;re obviously a foreigner because of the high language barrier, and you start seeing the same faces in the expat circles after a while. Still a great city where I made a lot of deep connections, and I wouldn&#x27;t pass up an opportunity to park myself there for a few years.')
