It doesn&#x27;t break in my browser.<p>The use of &quot;Username is a&quot; forces the use of a non-vowel starting word in the users description of themselves.<p>The photo doesn&#x27;t stay in the original aspect ratio, which I can work around, but it would be nice to avoid that surprise.<p>My email doesn&#x27;t show up on my page<p>I do like the Oauth signup, instead of yet another password to get compromised.<p>Good luck!<p>[Edit] - 3.3 Megabytes of code for my page is quiet a lot. However, the real danger <i>for you</i> is that profile pictures aren&#x27;t scaled, and seem to be stored at original size.<p>None of the above is unfixable...
