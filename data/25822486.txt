We&#x27;ve been fostering for over 6 years and every one of our kids have gone home to family.  That should be the goal. People like to think, &quot;oh I&#x27;d be able to provide for this kid much better than their family.&quot; Maybe that&#x27;s true financially.  But family is family and if there&#x27;s ANY way to reunite the family, that should be the way forward.')
