Item(by='Kednicma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602689692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777052, text='We shouldn&#x27;t be charitable to racism, sexism, delusional religious beliefs, or fascism; they are too harmful to the world. In this case, you&#x27;re asking me to be charitable to a sexist article whose author does not justify their credentials beyond being a professor of philosophy; perhaps they are only accidentally sexist here?<p>Seriously, do some close-reading. The very first sentence:<p>&gt; It’s uncontroversial among biologists that many species have two, distinct biological sexes.<p>Note the word &quot;many&quot; here; not <i>all</i> species, but just some. In other words, many species do <i>not</i> have two distinct biological sexes. They then continue:<p>&gt; It does so despite the fact that there are no more than two biological sexes in any species you’re likely to have heard of.<p>Ah, so while many species do not have two sexes, we&#x27;re not likely to have heard of them. Okay, that&#x27;s a fair cultural idea, I suppose... And then, suddenly, a one-two punch:<p>&gt; Not all species have biological sexes, and biology seeks to explain why some do and others don’t.<p>Wait, okay, so some species have more than two sexes, and some don&#x27;t have sex at all? This is a confusion tactic, because the <i>very next sentence</i> is:<p>&gt; The fact that no species has evolved more than two biological sexes is also a puzzle.<p>We&#x27;ve done it. We went all the way from some species, to no species that we&#x27;ve heard of, to no species at all having more than two sexes. This is a famous rhetorical technique known as Iago&#x27;s whispers [0]. By carefully restating the original thesis over and over, but gently changing it each time, the meaning of the entire article is shifted.<p>Now with this discrediting in hand, the author can continue safely down their binary-gender-theory path, writing slapstick like:<p>&gt; Now imagine if there was a whole species like this, where three different kinds of gametes combined to make a new individual – a sperm, an egg and a third, mitochondrial gamete. This species would have three biological sexes. Something like this has actually been observed in slime moulds, an amoeba that can, but need not, get its mitochondria from a third ‘parent’.<p>You see, the idea of more than two sexes is now <i>imaginary</i>, relegated to thought experiments. And we see species that are <i>like</i> having more than two sexes, as a simile. But the author&#x27;s carefully removed the actual physical reality from consideration.<p>HN rules forbid me from accusing folks of not having read the original article.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iago" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iago</a>')
