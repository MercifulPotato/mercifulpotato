They&#x27;ve done similar things with Redis and MariaDB, both of whom also offer commercial solutions. The SAs all insist that &quot;no it&#x27;s a partnership&quot;. I don&#x27;t fault them they&#x27;re parroting the marketing line. With the new Grafana stuff that seems more like a real partnership because you have to purchase the enterprise features and support from the marketplace. What they&#x27;ve done to Redis and partiularly Elastic is pretty shameful.<p>The Elasticsearch Service has problems: you can&#x27;t join the cluster like you can with the normal version, permissions are janky at best, it&#x27;s slow, and it&#x27;s expensive. For those reasons the projects my team used it on opted to roll our own elasticsearch cluster which proved a better solution long term beyond the initial annoyances. I say that to say it&#x27;s not a one to one product, which will probably be their defense.')
