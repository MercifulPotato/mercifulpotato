Item(by='robin_reala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602436581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746543, text='Yes, but how do you know the original image is out of copyright? It’s mostly obvious for older pieces, but for newer ones it’s not always obvious when an artist painted a work. Even with apparently older images, the worry is that the photo is actually of a reworking of an older piece that isn’t out of copyright.<p>This would be solved by linking each photo back to the originating gallery.<p>(I contribute to Standard Ebooks – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;standardebooks.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;standardebooks.org&#x2F;</a> – and would like to use Artvee’s imagery for covers, but without a link back to the originating site to check for a CC0 grant it ends up being a trawl through Hathi looking for photographic proof that the image is out of copyright.)')
