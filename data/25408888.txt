Item(by='paulpauper', descendants=None, kids=[25409086], score=None, time=1607884727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407583, text='&gt;This article places an emphasis on where the bottlenecks and problems have been forming in the system, explains why a continued weak dollar over a 3-5 year period remains my base case, and shows why some of these growing pains seem to be leading to a new re-ordering of the global monetary system over this decade.<p>3-5 years isn&#x27;t really saying  much especially given that the US dollar does not have  much movement, and that this is effectively the same as being bullish on the Euro and Pound and Yen, which are the biggest competing currencies. I do  not see any reason why those currencies will see a sudden inflow. That last time that happened was in 2002-2008, but that was when there are much more interest in foreign assets , whereas today foreign assets are shunned in favor of domestic assets and tech. Pensions, hedge funds seek safe US assets such as investment-grade corporates bonds and treasury bonds, not riskier foreign assets.<p>I do not expect any sort of fraying of the US dollar as the global reserve currency system though.<p>Some of the conclusions the author draws are wrong or dubious, such as the purported inverse relationship between the US dollar and corporates profits. The dollar surged in 2014 but corporates profits did not fall.')
