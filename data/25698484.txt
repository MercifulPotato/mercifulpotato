Later the same company had a giant dataloss outage when the hot spare Veritas head, an expensive Sun machine, decided it was the master while the old master also thought so, and together they trashed the entire Oracle database.<p>Both hardware and software in those days were, largely, steaming piles of shit. I have a feeling that many people who express nostalgia for those old Unix systems were probably 4 years old at the relevant time. Actually living through it wasn&#x27;t any fun. Linux saved us from all that.')
