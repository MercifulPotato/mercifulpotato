It would be understandable if you share those beliefs that you wouldn&#x27;t have any disagreements, right?<p>And I&#x27;m not sharing with HN the details of my family and workplace discussions, sorry. But maybe someone else here will be willing to. If you don&#x27;t believe me, then that&#x27;s OK, that&#x27;s up to you.<p>Edit: I mean, the media even covers the near constant revolts of activist employees at Facebook, Twitter, Coinbase, and many other tech companies. Do you want me to find you some articles? Is this new to you?')
