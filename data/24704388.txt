But this has been out of random chance rather than design. The program needs calibration.<p>The H-1B visa program currently requires to have a &quot;bachelor&#x27;s degree&quot; or equivalent. When you open the door to any &quot;bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent&quot; from anywhere in the world, results are pretty random. You can get a freaking genius, or a person that cannot implement fizzbuzz, and anything in between.<p>I think the solution is to give priority to the most skilled applicants in the pool, in this way, the cheaper talent will be left behind and wage depression becomes harder to achieve.')
