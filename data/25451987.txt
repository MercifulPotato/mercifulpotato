Computer &#x27;languages&#x27; are extremely restricted, and are primarily logical.<p>Unlike human languages: English (and probably most others) has hundreds of words that can be used to nuance, imply, suggest, refine, gradate, distinguish, obscure, conceal, intimate, impute.<p>If we don&#x27;t know what they mean we can often skip right past them. (Computers don&#x27;t do &#x27;gist&#x27;.) Illogic is not only permitted, it&#x27;s often essential.')
