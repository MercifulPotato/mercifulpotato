(and of course, to complicate the situation further, the latter may want to disguise themselves as the former)<p>As to why you see so many posters affirming they don&#x27;t support Trump - that&#x27;s because HN readers aren&#x27;t Trump&#x27;s target demographics: Trump only got 12% of the vote in San Francisco in 2020. IMHO it&#x27;s believable that on HN, free speech advocates simply outnumber Trump supporters.')
