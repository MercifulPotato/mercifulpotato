It doesn&#x27;t go nearly as fast, it exposes you to the elements, it can&#x27;t carry very much. But it&#x27;s easy to tune and maintain yourself with just a few simple tools. It does require effort on your part, but the exercise can be enjoyable. You don&#x27;t need to worry about refueling, accidents aren&#x27;t so dangerous, you can go on winding little trails and skip the freeways. Traffic isn&#x27;t an issue. You end up paying more attention to your surroundings and noticing details more on a bike ride than you would in a car.<p>One option is very deliberately simple and low-tech, and despite that it ends up being (for some people) a more pleasant and beneficial experience.')
