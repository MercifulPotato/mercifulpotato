There are so many little gotchas all over the place that people just paper over&#x2F;memorize, when Vue 2&#x2F;3 basically works as advertised right out of the box, need(ed?) less hacks, and you can get reasonably productive and performant in &lt;1 day after reading all the docs.<p>Also I want to point out that &quot;react&quot; is almost always react + redux + react-router + webpack at the end of the day. The combined complexity is not worth it when compared to Vue in my opinion. These days if I want to use something, I do vue + vue-router + parcel and call it a day, and get productive much quicker though the ecosystem isn&#x27;t quite as big. For uber-simplicity I like mithril[2][3] though -- but it falls down when you start looking at advanced features like SSR&#x2F;rehydration.<p>React has the best third party support&#x2F;ecosystem because of the amount of hype and OSS friendly companies that are using and benefiting from React. It also is the best corporate choice -- react developers are more fungible, you will benefit from more of the free work done by the F&#x2F;OSS crowd, etc.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;react-shouldcomponentupdate-demystified-c5d323099ef6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;react-shouldcomponentupdat...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backbonejs.org&#x2F;#View" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backbonejs.org&#x2F;#View</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MithrilJS&#x2F;mithril.js&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MithrilJS&#x2F;mithril.js&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MithrilJS&#x2F;mithril.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1838" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MithrilJS&#x2F;mithril.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1838</a>')
