History shouldn&#x27;t be dependent on some random person&#x2F;org paying to host them. I thought things would be safe with Google and I was wrong. I&#x27;m definitely less confident that usenetarchives.com will be around forever.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;827233&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;827233&#x2F;</a>')
