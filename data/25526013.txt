There is sample data which is statistics, and the objective function is also statistics, eg mean square error or negative log-likelihood or ELBO. And if you’re using stochastic gradient descent or a form of it, then that has statistical properties.<p>I don’t see any clear distinction between machine learning and statistics. Machine learning is a type of statistical model which relies on iterative optimization.<p>Bayesian inference on the other hand is a specific type of statistical model where the aim is to model distributions, not just the output variable (which is what ML is traditionally focused on).<p>And yes there is overlap, you can take a Bayesian approach to machine learning and that can make total sense sometimes.')
