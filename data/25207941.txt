And the only GC code most people run is garbage collected on apple too - it&#x27;s Java Script on the web.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with MacOs, are the apps there mostly managed code? Even if they were and even if refcounting on Mac is that much faster than refounting on PC - refcounted code would still lose to manual memory management on average.')
