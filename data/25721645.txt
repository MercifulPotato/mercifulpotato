Compare programming in 2000 vs programming today, what changed? We used C in 2000 and now we use Go.<p>The problem with visual programming is that it doesn&#x27;t scale past the size of your display. We have been capable of data flow programming with a gui for over a decade, it just isn&#x27;t a great way to program complex systems.<p>I expect there will be more code and more of it will be written in languages like go. The biggest constraint on programming is comprehending big code bases, and languages like Go help with that.<p>We need an actual advance in programming to avoid a future that looks like today except with 10x as much code to understand before you can do anything.')
