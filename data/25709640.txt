This might be a solution, but it is not &quot;the&quot; solution.<p>I really, truly believe that any startup idea has to pass the child pornography test. Most B2C companies have to deal with this at some point if they allow user to user interaction.<p>A decentralized platform as advocated for could not survive if it&#x27;s not capable of censuring things. You have to censure for child pornography--it&#x27;s illegal to host it. Court actions around torrents have held that the sites hosting them are not decentralized--The Pirate Bay is at fault for hosting illegally obtained content. Same thing with this--as long as hosting child pornography is illegal (and it should be, not debating that) you won&#x27;t have a mainstream &quot;decentralized&quot; social media site[0].<p>This follows for all the other stuff that&#x27;s going on. Inciting violence is illegal. That, plain and simple, is why Trump was removed from Twitter. Twitter even waited until his violence actually killed people. Even Parler recognizes this[1] and has started censuring, because it could be sued into the ground for inciting violence. If you think that there&#x27;s a technological solution for this problem--you&#x27;re missing the bigger picture. Big social media tech _loves_ this stuff--people talk about it all day--they even donate to the groups that help organize it[2].<p>We&#x27;re not missing a technological solution--we&#x27;re missing a legislative one.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;parler-pornography-problem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;parler-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;parler-reportedly-removed-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documented.net&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;republican-attorneys-general-dark-money-group-organized-protest-preceding-capitol-mob-attack&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documented.net&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;republican-attorneys-general-...</a>')
