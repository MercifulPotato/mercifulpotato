As long as it solves a problem, it seems useful to me. And there may be people out there who aren&#x27;t super familiar with Ruby or forward proxies who can learn a lot from this implementation.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say doing hard stuff is bad either. I&#x27;ve written simple servers in C as well, and those are fun projects that you can learn a lot doing. But I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s anything wrong with posting stuff like this.')
