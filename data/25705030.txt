All of these incidents were linked to white supremacist ideas that the right has been flirting with for decades. Trump has just been dispensing with the dog whistles.<p>All four of these incidents had white perpetrators, btw. To extrapolate from mainstream Republican positions, we clearly need a complete and total shutdown of all white immigration until we figure out what is going on.<p>Back to the present day: the climate of lies about the election from Republican leadership up to and including Trump was obviously a factor in the violence in DC. On top of that Trump was there that day, speaking to that crowd immediately before they took action, directly inciting them to violence. There&#x27;s no deniability to be had.<p>Appeasement has only emboldened these people to attack America, it&#x27;s institutions, it&#x27;s people, and it&#x27;s values. We must have law and order, and that requires accountability for Trump and his enablers.')
