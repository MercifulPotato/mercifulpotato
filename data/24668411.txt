It&#x27;s a lot different today than it was back then.  Early on, I knew several people who had &quot;experimented&quot; in college, and they were denied clearances.  (Actually the government never officially denied them because that would require an explanation of the criteria used for the denial.  Instead, it was perpetually &quot;pending&quot;.)\nAnyway, the basis for their denial was the potential for blackmail, which is a serious national security threat.  Sometime within the past 25-30 years, they seem to have revised their policies so gay&#x2F;bi people can get cleared, as long as they are open about it.')
