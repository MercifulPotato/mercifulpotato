When commenting out code with &#x2F;&#x2F;, it&#x27;s easy to mistakenly leave out a line containing a closing bracket for example. When using &#x2F;* , you have to manually insert the closing * &#x2F; at the exact right spot.<p>On the other hand, #_ simply operates on the logical form that follows it, instead of operating blindly on characters. You know it&#x27;s going to do the right thing whether you want to comment a long multiline form, or a single function call in the middle of a line.<p>Using structural editing (Paredit) to navigate and reorganize code is an incredible experience for the same reasons.<p>I&#x27;m one of these people that doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;flow&quot; or get in the &quot;zone&quot; when working (leading me to sometimes wonder what I&#x27;m missing out on, or if I&#x27;m lacking something, although my career is fine so far). But writing Clojure is probably as close as I can get. :)')
