At first I did not even have backward axes. But people care much more about XPath than they care about my city<p>I also was doing too much competitive programming back then, where you have to discover and implement a highly complex algorithm in a few hours<p>If such a complex implementation takes a few hours, I could not imagine implementing anything else taking much longer (especially when the spec already says what needs to be implemented and it does not need to be discovered). A few days at most...<p>But now  I am still working on it 14 years later')
