The only thing you can do as a person is always to improve yourself and strive hard. In that sense, I don&#x27;t think either &quot;high self-esteem&quot; or &quot;grit&quot; are anything negative at all. Surely they&#x27;re infinitely better than the contrary which would be &quot;low self-esteem&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t work hard&quot;?<p>I think a more realistic and helpful formulation would be &quot;1. Believe in yourself, but don&#x27;t expect to succeed magically without great sacrifices. 2. It may well be that luck &gt; systematic barriers &gt; individual effort, but that&#x27;s irrelevant, since your own effort is the only thing you can control&quot;. Then you would be mentally well-prepared for failures but still strive hard regardless.<p>I agree with a comment that in terms of thinking about public policies, it&#x27;s debatable whether too strong an emphasis on bootstrapping is a good thing. But that shouldn&#x27;t be confused with teaching individuals work ethics. Those two can be viewed separately. You may not succeed with strong self-belief and a lot of efforts, but you will <i>definitely fail</i> with an overly cynical outlook and no efforts. It&#x27;s not that complicated.<p>Maybe what this whole discussion reveals more is that, when a huge amount of people in a country deeply doubt meritocracy or self-made success, there must be some deep, entrenched systematic problems with the country, which may well be in decline in a lot of ways (when a country is growing and a lot of opportunities are open, the ethos would be well different). But still, as mentioned above, this doesn&#x27;t change much the way in which one should perceive and approach their individual behaviors when they want to succeed.<p>---<p>P.S.: As a side note.
