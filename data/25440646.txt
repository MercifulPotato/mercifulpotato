This will simplify infrastructure monitoring and application monitoring in AWS with widespread Prometheus+Grafana stack. The only downside is quite high prices for Managed Prometheus. They can be explained by high operational and infrastructure costs for the underlying system - Cortex. There are other Prometheus-compatible scalable long-term storage systems, which could require much lower costs [2]. I hope costs for Amazon Managed Prometheus will be reduced in the long run.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25432729" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25432729</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FAQ#what-is-the-difference-between-victoriametrics-and-cortex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FAQ#...</a>')
