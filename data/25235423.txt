Approvals are all done in paper form and are extremely easy to forge and the IT systems in place similarly to the US equivalents are so antiquated that they wouldn&#x27;t even notice if there was a large leak happening.<p>In the UK you can walk into a lot of hospitals IT room and just plug stuff in without noticing.<p>So no, basically nobody will protect your privacy other than yourself(which oftentimes is not possible).<p>The main difference is that it&#x27;s a little bit harder for private big tech to get access to your data, so if that is your concern you will have a little bit better protection there.<p>However it&#x27;s worth noting that even though German is considered one of the countries with the toughest data protection laws, they&#x27;re not actually enforced for public institutions and that the current health ministry has been pushing hard to make unanonymized data available to insurance companies.')
