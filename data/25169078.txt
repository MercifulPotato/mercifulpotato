Can you beat this with, say, a 3 years discounting plan for the savings? In a lot of cases the answer actually is &quot;clearly not&quot;.<p>Sometimes you can eek out very sizeable gains, but always do the capitalist homework first (and the engineering homework of profiling second) before trying any fixes.<p>Also, if it&#x27;s performance that you need look into &quot;stupid&quot; solutions first. Can you move the DB to flash with just a few config options? Can you mlock() it in RAM? You&#x27;d be surprised how many things fit in RAM, especially if your DB is a managed distributed solution, and still be very cheap compared to engineering salaries.')
