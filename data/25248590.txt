There are clear limitations, primarily that on older chips the gpu never fully powers down when not offloading, but that was pretty clear from the start.  And that&#x27;s on Arch, using a port of a tool that was <i>made</i> for Ubuntu.  On newer computers, it works even better.  No matter what, there isn&#x27;t much room for debugging, be that a good or bad thing.')
