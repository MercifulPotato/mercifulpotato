I&#x27;ve seen people order &quot;and no bun.&quot; I want to get in and out, so i just order the quarter pounder and throw away the bun.<p>Wolfram Alpha tells me a quarter pounder is 42g carbs, and it also tells me that the bun is 23g. So the quarter pounder that I just ate goes in my diary as 19g carbs, and the bun goes in the trash.')
