Other big name companies are short, of course, and the WSB community has picked a side in this battle.<p>So the idea that WallStreetBets is a significant player in all this is nonsense and actually might be propaganda flak coming from the &quot;responsible&quot; people in the media, etc - journalists in the financial sector love rumors and such things and it is a nice cover story as &quot;fog&quot; to hide the fact Wall Street is so manipulated by the big players.')
