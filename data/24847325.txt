Yes, stock prices don&#x27;t always instantaneously reflect true value, but on a long enough time scale, months to years, they do.<p>The time scale is usually dependent on the transparency of the company&#x27;s financials to investors.  For public companies, the time scale is measured in quarters.  For private companies, it could be measured in years or decades.<p>And this actually lines up with the EMH - stock prices reflects all <i>available</i> information.  Nothing about the hypothesis says it reflects the true value when key information is unavailable (e.g. fraud or a private company that doesn&#x27;t open their books).')
