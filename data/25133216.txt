Exporting PDFs just doesn&#x27;t cut it; the point of keeping your notes digital is being able to (a) maintain them as living documents and (b) use them on hardware of your choice.<p>Buying an Android-based device like Onyx Note Air gives you an option to use apps like Xournal&#x2F;Xournal++ (best-in-class for handwritten notes, but unfortunately still in alpha on the mobile), or Stylus Labs&#x27; Write. This means that your notes are available, in their original form, on virtually any platform, in an open format. This is way, way more important than being able to root or ssh your gadget du jour.')
