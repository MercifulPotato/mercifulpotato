Item(by='Kaveren', descendants=None, kids=[25520370], score=None, time=1608701823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508119, text='&gt; Citizen&#x27;s United infamously set that in stone.<p>The alternative is that you can&#x27;t make documentaries about a candidate&#x27;s bad climate change policy and monetize it as you would a non-contentious issue.<p>&gt; That the average American has approximately zero influence in politics is a mathematical, deliberately orchestrated truth.<p>Neither does the individual &quot;economic elite&quot;, defined as anyone in the top 10%.<p>People can complain about the two party system all they want, but ranked choice voting was just rejected in Massachusetts, the most liberal state there is (and I&#x27;d be correct to assume that Democrats have more reason to desire this than Republicans).<p>Gerrymandering is bad and needs to be disposed of. We aren&#x27;t an oligarchy because there&#x27;s some gerrymandering.<p>Money in politics is vastly overrated, and there isn&#x27;t even that much money in the field to begin with. Bernie Sanders didn&#x27;t lose his 2020 primary because of money, Trump didn&#x27;t win his 2016 primary because of money.')
