There is heaps more money sloshing around in Silicon Valley than anywhere in Europe.<p>Then market dynamics have come in and you fund 1 company with a gazillion dollars it pays Market + 30% then another company gets a gazillion and it pays Market + 30% + 30% (of course it isn&#x27;t all cash it&#x27;s tied up in options, and bonuses etc).<p>So when someone at google say earns 350k&#x2F;annum* it&#x27;s not as insane as that sounds to a european because they actually mean something like: 180k (money) &#x2F; 100k (shares) &#x2F; 70k bonus (I mean it&#x27;s still insane). So having companies and a healthy stock market, and bonuses are usually tied to performance of individual and&#x2F;or company so It&#x27;s possible in a bad year they dont get their bonus and their shares reduce heavily in value.<p>* No idea if this is even ballpark, but just random names and numbers for example sake')
