Didn&#x27;t do anything, didn&#x27;t show any noticeable result over like 4 months.<p>Then I hopped on a rowing machine (above preparation probably helped to be ready for it) because I wanted to see something happen.  I&#x27;m not that special.  Do something to your body and it will probably do the same for you as it does for other people, you just have to stick with it.   I stopped thinking &quot;eh, it won&#x27;t do anything for me&quot;.<p>I rowed each day before the weights workout, 10 minutes super intense, until I felt like I was gonna puke as I fell off the machine.   Heartbeat way elevated, out of breath, blood coursing through body, and soaked.<p>In conjunction with not eating quite as much (that rowing machine does something to your appetite) I dropped I would say 1 pound per week.  Doctor asked if anything was wrong the next time I went in for physical and got weighed.  Felt great.<p>Exercise is a part of my routine now.  I don&#x27;t eat junk any more.  I now say the thing people always say after such things, but you don&#x27;t internalize or believe it until you try: &quot;I wish I had done it sooner&quot;.')
