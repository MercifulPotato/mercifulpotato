Do not mess with the package.json. I cant stress this enough. Actually, the most important file in your whole application is the package.json. Almost nobody should be allowed to add additional dependencies because is the main point to generate chaos and problems in the long term.<p>Also, the design system matters a lot. Have a small team working on the UI components to tailor and extend the design system. Dont allow the rest of the teams to extend the ui components with new libraries. Stick with the design system \n as much as you can. The rest of the teams should minimize the amount of CSS they have to write to components placement.<p>Usually the datagrid is the soul of any enterprise application. Choose it wisely and be sure it covers as much functionality as you can and also that it is customizable on an &quot;easy&quot; way. There is always a team with the need of a datagrid that sorts, groups, filters the data with dynamically adjustable cells and multi header items without pagination. Welcome to hell.<p>Use one pattern: hooks, central store, whatever you want. If at some point you have to change it you have to know which teams are using which one. Dont allow team members of the same team follow different patterns. Code reviews must take care of this.<p>Hope this small tips help one or two teams out there. I have worked on the migration of 5 big enterprise applications from angularjs to react or from legacy desktop application to react or from server pages to react.<p>I made a lot of mistakes that costed a lot of dollars. I have tried to learn from them. Also, dont take me very seriously, I am pretty sure I am about to discover another mistake I have made.')
