It they don&#x27;t value it they don&#x27;t value it, having the government mandate and tell you what&#x27;s good for you helps no one in the long run.<p>The big companies have no real problem complying with the regulations, it&#x27;s quite clear that consumers don&#x27;t actually give a damn. All you&#x27;ve now succeeded in doing is making sure any startup has a tonne of bureaucratic nonsense to wade through to get it right.<p>What you need to do is identify where a transaction has not been made between two parties for fair recompense. One potential area is to say that without adequate repair cover you are now forced to dispose of your electronics and pay for the safety disposal so that it does not pollute the environment for everyone else. Then a consumer might see the need for repair rights and make an informed value decision.<p>Assuming that top down legislation will not have some unforeseen interaction that drives terrible outcomes is the fallacy of big government, it just consistently fails at it, I&#x27;ve seen it so many times over my life time that it&#x27;s farcical.<p>As an anecdotal example; circa 2011 the australian goverment brought in legislation to make portable A&#x2F;C units more efficient. Great, right? Wrong, the government in it&#x27;s infinite ineptitude managed to word so that it only effected dual vent portable A&#x2F;C units and left single vent A&#x2F;C units unaffected. Instead of making dual vents more energy efficient the companies pulled all dual vents from the market and now you can only get single vents which are woefully inefficient. This is not the companies faults, they did exactly what you would expect them to do. The government fixed the legislation 11 months ago but unfortunately we can still not get dual vent A&#x2F;C at all in Australia.')
