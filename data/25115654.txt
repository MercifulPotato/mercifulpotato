When someone sends an email, the recipient often wants to be able to prove that they did so. We think of email as something capable of leaving a paper trail, proof that certain people sent certain emails. It&#x27;s reasonable for secure messaging to want to fill a different niche, more like private conversation. I&#x27;ve seen messaging apps advertised on the basis that they will delete all messages after a certain time, making them basically equivalent to talking to someone, in terms of non-repudiation and being ephemeral by default. But people frequently want email to be more like letter writing than private conversation. The tradition with letters was to sign your letters to prove that you sent them. People talk about having a certain thing &quot;in writing&quot;, so that they can use it in litigation. Insofar as email is supposed to fill that niche, its reasonable to expect it to provide repudiable messaging.')
