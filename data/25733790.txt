When I studied portfolio management, I had to learn not just how to talk to people about their risk tolerances, but how to ascertain whether they knew their own tolerances. The concept was called &quot;calibration&quot; - or - how well is someone able to know that they are wrong&#x2F;don&#x27;t know something. Basically, &quot;high calibration&quot; is the opposite of Dunning-Kruger in my mind.<p>The text cited a study that measured calibration by profession. The highest calibrated profession was meteorologists. It makes sense if you think about it: I prognosticate rain tomorrow, tomorrow comes and it&#x27;s sunny - I am forced to confront the fact that my prognosis was wrong. So not only is there a way to know who&#x27;s better and who&#x27;s worse, but also constant reminder that &quot;I can be wrong despite my best work&quot;<p>The lowest calibration profession was doctors. Which also makes sense. Imagine I am a doctor and I miss an early sign of a disease. The patient dies 5 years later - I may not even know, and even if I do, very unlikely am I confronted with the specific point in time 5 years prior where I made the wrong call.<p>So the thing that matters with expertise is - how often is the person getting feedback. In the article they cite chess as having &quot;real experts&quot; - of course. Because a chess player gets feedback on how good they are every time they win or lose a match.<p>On the flip side, how often is someone in a very soft field getting feedback? What&#x27;s the way for an &quot;expert&quot; in say Gender Studies, to wake up in the morning and be confronted with &quot;the thing I did yesterday didn&#x27;t work?&quot;<p>The other thing about experts is they are optimizing for a single thing. Eg ask your compliance person at work if you can do something, the answer is &quot;NO&quot; because they are optimizing for not being sued, but in reality that&#x27;s not the only concern. Or in the pandemic, ask the economist if we should lock down - they&#x27;ll say no because they understand the financial consequences. Ask a medical person and they&#x27;ll say yes because they are focused solely on the number of sick people. In reality the world is complex and there are tradeoffs.<p>Related, experts are often concerned with high-impact issues which may be different from individual issues. EG: in the USA, by default, kids get the Hep B vaccine on their first day of life. On country level this makes sense because there are a lot of mothers out there who have Hep B and don&#x27;t know it. But when my wife was giving birth, we knew to opt out despite the recommendation because we understood that the experts are optimizing for a thing that doesn&#x27;t relate to us.')
