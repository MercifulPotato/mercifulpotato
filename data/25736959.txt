Item(by='egfx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610399155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731419, text='I created <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2fb.me" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2fb.me</a> because I felt content was being confined by the constraints of the &quot;network&quot;. There is no one network, or there shouldn&#x27;t be as the author eludes, but an entirely new network will never reach the &quot;network&quot; effects it needs. Instead a protocol between the existing monoliths breaks through the confines and the content cannot be deleted all at once, as it will exist as a copy somewhere else. In short if the account goes down on Twitter then the existing tweet from that account will exist on Facebook unless it&#x27;s deleted there too. IMO, this is how to to create a better social network where there isn&#x27;t one authority, using what exists already.')
