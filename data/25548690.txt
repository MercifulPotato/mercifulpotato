Copying them from macos onto docker hub violates the macos software license.<p>- They change with each version of MacOS. You can&#x27;t mix &amp; match them.<p>I guess you could mount them into docker&#x27;s filesystem, but then whats the point of using docker? And even if you did that:<p>- They&#x27;re macos mach executable files. Linux (and therefore docker) doesn&#x27;t know how to run mach executable files.<p>- Even if you could somehow embed them and get them to run, the libraries wouldn&#x27;t work because they expect to be making syscalls to Darwin. They can&#x27;t do that from inside a linux virtual machine.<p>You could probably make a weird RPC proxy involving a native macos process receiving network commands. But it should take a herculean effort to make it work at all, and even if you got it working it would probably be buggy (since everything would suddenly become async) and slow.')
