Great! I want to be convinced! <i>That</i> is hard evidence! However, [8] does not contain details.<p>What <i>specific</i> forensic details, though?  I have followed that rabbit hole. There was a limited release of the forensic details: the unclassified, public forensic evidence does not and cannot show the allegations to be true. It doesn&#x27;t refute them, either, but it only shows that someone used (outdated!) malware that is available to any script kiddie, not state-level superhackerware. Stuxnet it ain&#x27;t.<p>There are allusions to classified evidence that irrefutably demonstrates that Russia and Putin were involved. So, again, if you are inclined to believe the story, then &quot;The CIA and NSA have evidence, but it&#x27;s classified&quot; is enough. Maybe it&#x27;s true? Unknown.<p>If you are disinclined to believe it, or want hard evidence before you decide, then it looks suspicious. Destabilizing governments and throwing FUD is what the CIA <i>does</i>. This is documented. That&#x27;s its expertise. That&#x27;s its hammer. It doesn&#x27;t mean that they are lying <i>this</i> time, but ... I mean, come on, it&#x27;s the CIA. Reasonable people can be suspicious that the spooks are lying, here. Perhaps they are partisan Democrats, distracting from the <i>content</i> of the emails. Perhaps they are never-Trump Republicans. Perhaps Trump is a Russian asset indeed. Who knows? They don&#x27;t show their hand. Nor hard evidence.<p>Hard evidence is not &quot;Trust us, we have names, dates and credible intelligence&quot; with lots and lots of footnotes<p>Now that you know what hard evidence would convince me, would you mind going through that list of links and finding it? If it&#x27;s not there, consider that hard evidence does not exist. So, to recap: specific forensic evidence is great! Specifically &quot;forensic details in the malware&quot;. That. Show me that. Or something equivalent<p>Links to people saying they have reviewed the forensic evidence and concluded Russians were involved, testimony before Congress, CIA reports without that forensic evidence, HN discussions, affidavits and such are not it.')
