If you’re not a developer, you will be questioning why you’re doing this and the less-technically inclined will simply never do it (like my wife)<p>And it is not entirely nefarious as you suggest. It limits the damage that sideloaded extensions did roughly 2010 and earlier. The WebExtension API was another assault on extensions. These days, chrome and Firefox have essentially closed a huge attack vector even though extensions are a shadow of their former selves. I was a skeptic for a long time (why should power users pay for the faults of everyone else?) but no more. Kudos.')
