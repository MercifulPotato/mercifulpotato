In our two main influences, shell and Python, newlines are significant.<p>However Oil uses {} for blocks, and it also has dicts.<p>Originally I thought we should have something like %{} for dicts to give the lexer and easier job when deciding when newlines are significant.  Oil uses Python&#x27;s rules of newlines being ignored between () and [], and it would make sense to ignore them inside {} but not %{}.<p>But I found I could just makes newlines significant within {} and then put them in the grammar for dicts, as well as for blocks.  It seems to work fine.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;big-changes.html#dicts-are-not" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;big-changes.html#dicts-...</a><p>I am open to feedback if anyone wants to kick the tires :)')
