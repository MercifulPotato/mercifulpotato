I guess it&#x27;s possible Apple would find corporate pushback is too strong, but maybe not.<p>Don&#x27;t use things you don&#x27;t trust. If you trust Apple&#x27;s proprietary software at least you are getting exactly what you signed up for. Apple gets to do whatever they want, which you apparently trust them to do. Will they accidentally let in bad guys? Maybe. You signed up for that too.')
