A Tesla has enough battery to last maybe 10 minutes at the rate big tractors use power. A Tesla might  put out 500 horsepower for 3 seconds, but then it is up to the speed limit and you back off to 20 horsepower for the rest of the trip.  A tractor starts off putting out 500 horsepower, and maintains that for 10 hours or so.')
