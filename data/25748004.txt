But this where we get back to &quot;aggressive&quot; interviewing technique.<p>Suppose someone makes the claim that tax cuts for the rich, or for capital gains, improves the economy. Journalist&#x2F;host says &quot;what evidence do you have of that?&quot;. Politician&#x2F;pundit says something misleading, irrelevant or demonstrably false.<p>This is the crux point. The journalist&#x2F;host can at this point either (a) move on (b) drill down into the claim made by the politician&#x2F;pundit. But (b) will be clearly seen as oppositional by both the politician&#x2F;pundit and by the audience (and correctly so, because that&#x27;s the whole point).<p>In the current media landscape, this journalist&#x2F;host will shortly end up with no significant guests at all, and will be described as &quot;confrontational&quot; and &quot;partisan&quot;.')
