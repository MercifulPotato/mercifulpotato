With GraphQL each request can depend on how the client constructed the query; with REST, every time you hit an endpoint, and assuming good practices such as idempotency are followed, you know exactly what data is being returned.<p>Sure, these same restrictions are what can lead to the necessity of versioned APIs, but on their own, they make the API in general a little easier to reason about, and test, at least in some ways.<p>[1]: Which is not to say that I prefer them nor I think them better overall. Much like TFA says, I think both approaches, and others, have their uses.')
