It&#x27;s often proposed by the literature that the firmware should read the on-die temperature sensor constantly, and when it&#x27;s outside the nominal operating range, halt execution, and possibly erase secret.<p>However, while it&#x27;s often proposed as such, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually useful - thermal fault injection is a real threat, but I said &quot;theoretical&quot; since it&#x27;s the least of your problems when the attacker has physical access - both clock and power fault injection are easier. Nevertheless, at least a countermeasure to thermal faults is reasonable if you are just protecting a smartcard where everything is on a single chip. On the other hand, for a computer motherboard, such a sensor looks pretty useless. The target is simply too large to be protected (unless you can seal the entire system in a box fitted with sensors like a hardware security module). But I guess it is still a theoretical security feature, thus it was listed as such despite its uselessness.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;190.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;190.pdf</a><p>&gt; [...] We further presentheating faults by operating the devices beyond their specified temperature ratings. The efficiency of this kind of attack is shown by a practical attack on an RSA implementation. Finally, we introduce data remanence attacks on AVR microcontrollers that exploit the Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) property of internal SRAM cells. We show howto recover parts of the internal memory and present first results on an ATmega162. The work encourages the awareness of temperature-based attacks that are known for years now but not well described in literature. It also serves as a starting point for further research investigations.')
