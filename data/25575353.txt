This is like running in Valgrind all the time, and makes writing leak-free code part of normal development.<p>2. I think OP&#x27;s point about comptime being TOO powerful is potentially true.  It might be manageable by creating cultural &quot;best practices&quot;, and maybe even labelling them as such.  For example in zig stdlib, std.Mutex is, to my eyes, an &quot;interface&quot; pattern and std.Allocator is a &quot;factory&quot; pattern.  Rules-of-thumb for when you want to use which pattern and solid examples would probably help greatly.')
