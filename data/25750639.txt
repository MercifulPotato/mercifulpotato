The code it produces seems, in general, slightly slower than chicken, but with a more uneven profile.<p>On the other hand it seems like a nice environment! It uses cheney on the MTA, which mean free call&#x2F;cc among some other things.<p>Other than that? It seems like package managers are finally coming to scheme. Good. Chicken has been the only one with a proper one for quite some time.<p>Roughly the same speed as chicken means fast enough for most tasks. Probably some orders of magnitude faster than python for things that are actually written in python and not just glue between C function calls.')
