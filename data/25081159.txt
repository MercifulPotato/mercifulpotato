I cannot demonstrate proof of this.<p>I do not believe that the Snowden slides show proof of collusion by any of those companies. All the slides do are indicate that data is being collected from those companies and the program is called PRISM.<p>If for example, there was also a slide that indicated payments were being made in exchange for the data, then that would be an entirely different thing. That would indicate collusion and be more believable.<p>I am not denying or refusing to accept Snowden&#x27;s whistleblowing. I think it is highly likely that PRISM exists. What I refute are the speculations that the companies listed are complicit.<p>I will also add that PRISM and &quot;beam splitting&quot; are a bit too close for coincidence.<p>Room 641A at 611 Folsom Street, SF is where &quot;beam splitting&quot; was done. That info leaked. The NSA isn&#x27;t stupid, I doubt they wanted to repeat that sort of discovery - which is why I think it is believable and likely that the companies listed on the slides have no idea what has been done.<p>[edited to fix grammar and that there was more than one slide leaked]')
