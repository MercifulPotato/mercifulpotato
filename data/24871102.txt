Item(by='wastedhours', descendants=None, kids=[24871350], score=None, time=1603470051, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870840, text='&gt; It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the effective opposition eventually comes from some sort of grass roots movement towards open hardware and open software<p>Would be nice to see, however I see it coming more from one of the major players screwing up - whether a large scale hack, huge amounts of downtime or a verrrry public issue migrating a high value customer, regulatory break up, or pushing prices just too high.<p>For a large amount of users of Microsoft&#x27;s products in enterprises, local government, even SMBs, the experience will likely be better though. &quot;Dumbed down&quot; software is a feature, not a bug. Usage based renting is a preference, compared to large scale IT capex.<p>I&#x27;m just waiting for the O365 + Surface subscriptions to start (unless I&#x27;ve missed it and they have already?). Hardware, software and services for one monthly payment. They&#x27;re already doing something similar for Xbox and the Game Pass in some markets I believe.<p>&gt; rather than from any of the established tech giants voluntarily changing strategy within that time frame<p>They&#x27;ll go where the money takes them. If the market starts moving, they&#x27;ll undoubtedly stick their toes in the water. If the current picks up, they&#x27;ll look to turn the ship to go along with it.<p>All of the above being said, it still I think reinforces the point that Microsoft&#x27;s shift from boxed software to services is superbly well done. Whether or not we want that as our future, they&#x27;ve handled the shift toward the current vision of the future well.')
