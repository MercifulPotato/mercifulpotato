Especially in the early grades. I say this with utmost respect for the teaching profession, some teachers are not good enough for 1st grade. This kind of bullying, complaining, and blaming is absolutely not appropriate for any teacher, and especially one that is supposed to be modeling behavior for 1st graders. If she&#x27;s spending her Saturday grading, well that sucks, but railing about it to the children is not the way to deal with it. What a disgrace.')
