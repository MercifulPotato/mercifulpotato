Before the release of the M1 laptop and Mac Mini it could have been argued that the more traditional machines were more powerful and expandable.<p>But there&#x27;s literally no difference between the hardware of a Macbook, Mac Mini, and iPad Pro apart from peripherals (e.g. screen, keyboard, touchpad). Why would a developer even need two devices when the laptop runs the same hardware and is only missing things (modem, touch screen, sensors, cameras)?')
