But I still count myself lucky, since a lot of people everywhere have had it much worse.<p>Regarding work, I was a dumbass actually. I didn&#x27;t share with any superior what was going on, spent months both hating myself and also fearing being &quot;found out&quot;. But recently I felt so overwhelmed that I had to bring it up. I was afraid to do it, only to find out I should&#x27;ve done it much earlier. My manager and my skip-level were incredibly understanding and accomodating once I shared with them, and even offered to reduce my &quot;available capacity&quot; when planning next quarter&#x27;s work, with no reduction in salary or anything. Truly amazing.<p>I&#x27;m still quite low in productivity, but it&#x27;s great to have the space to be so while I sort things out.')
