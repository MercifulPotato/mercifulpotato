Not all crap is generated outside of the team but you need to get ride of it.<p>* the crap shield is transparent so the team can see what&#x27;s happening outside without being covered in it<p>* the crap shield is retractable so you can let some into the team&#x27;s atmosphere. Not enough to cause harm, but keep them grounded in the imperfect world in which their work will live.<p>* the crap shield has a window lock, and you the manager are in control of it. This is for the same reason the driver of a car can lock the windows in the back seat to stop the kids from opening them when you&#x27;re in the car wash.')
