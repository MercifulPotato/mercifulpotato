But what you&#x27;re saying matches, roughly, my understanding of what happened. Perhaps their issue is with the way it is phrased, sounding sort of like rhetoric.<p>So I&#x27;ll add because I&#x27;m more or less with you: I&#x27;m sincerely confused how we can spend years alleging Russian interference and now that on a really close election, with contention over the way the ballots were counted, it&#x27;s being called by the media without presenting doubt despite polling being pretty off? The inconsistency is concerning, in my opinion. What am I not understanding?<p>If I&#x27;d introduced a new system in at work (my understanding is the mass mail-in ballots are new at this scale, but please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) and was testing it and it gave a weird result, I&#x27;d at least double check it.')
