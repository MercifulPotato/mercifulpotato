They feel powerless, have no idea what to do, and they are apathic. They accept their shackles like they deserve it. They know they are abused but since they are human, they use coping mechanisms to continue using apps they believe are actually not so nice for them.<p>Of course they have thoughts like &quot;actually, my picture is not private anymore&quot;, but for their sanity of mind they carry on because of network effects&#x2F;ease of use&#x2F;etc. They choose to push those thoughts off, as they are outside of their control. To us, it might sound like they just don&#x27;t care. That&#x27;s wrong!<p>At least, that is what I conclude after talking with non-techies about this stuff.<p>I am sure you can sell privacy as a big plus, but you need to deal with above aspects as well.')
