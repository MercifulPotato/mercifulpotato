Convenience might even be worth it to some people, but I think it&#x27;s more often a problem of ignorance. Any TV ad for a Kindle is going to focus on the broad selection and ease of use. Telling those people about the DRM isn&#x27;t participating in the same conversation that sold them the device.')
