One specific problem I&#x27;ve been wanting solved for a long while is difficulty with sharing podcasts with friends across podcast apps. If you&#x27;re not using the same podcast app as your friend, it&#x27;s always a pain to manually search and find the podcast in your own app. I&#x27;d love a universal podcast url, something like `podcast:&#x2F;&#x2F;&lt;podcast_url&gt;` that individual podcast apps can understand, which links you to the podcast within your desired app, similar to the &quot;default browser&quot; behaviour on mobile and desktop. Has anyone come across something like this?')
