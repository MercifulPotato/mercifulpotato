I view an iteration as including the iteration expression (i-- in this case) at the end. So during 7 iterations, i-- has executed 7 times, so the value of i is -7. You seem to be saying the iteration expression belongs to the next iteration as opposed to belonging to the currently ending iteration.<p>I think my view is the widely accepted view. Check out how cppreference rewrites a for loop:<p><pre><code>    {\n        init_statement\n        while ( condition ) {\n            statement\n            iteration_expression ;\n        } \n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn our specific case:<p><pre><code>    {\n        i = 0;\n        while (i &lt; 6) {\n            printf(&quot;.&quot;);\n            i--;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;language&#x2F;for" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;language&#x2F;for</a><p>Also the article doesn&#x27;t say &quot;running |INT_MIN| + 1 iterations&quot; it says &quot;after |INT_MIN| + 1 iterations&quot;. I think in that case, even if you don&#x27;t consider the final i-- to be part of the &quot;n + 1 iterations&quot;, you would still consider the final i-- to be done &quot;after |INT_MIN| + 1 iterations&quot;.')
