That said, good point mentioning location, I&#x27;m in the US and have mainly worked in the US and W. EU, no context on bribery and the like outside of there. That said, I&#x27;d still be skeptical about someone from a big company based in the U.S. that could be hit by the U.S. govt by fines like Microsoft having a lot of bribery going on anywhere in its operations')
