If we want 3D models, someone has to make them. That person might be a traditional modeler working in Blender, or a sculptor in ZBrush, or might be someone with a 3D scanner doing photogrammetry. The tools are changing, but it is still people using the tools.<p>Just like how we invented an “automatic programming” system where the computer will do programming for you, and it turns out that once we’ve made automated programming we have <i>more</i> programmers and not fewer. The tools for making 3D models are getting better and easier to use, and as photogrammetry is being used more and more, we see <i>larger</i> teams of modelers, not smaller.')
