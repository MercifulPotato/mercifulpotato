Accidents happen because people don&#x27;t pay attention, not because cyclists wear all dark clothing at night and during bad weather. The number of people I see in their cars using their phones while driving is staggering. Especially commuters in cars overestimate their focus while driving while they&#x27;re telling themselves that their route to work is routine by now.<p>I&#x27;m seeing so many modern bikes in the street and they all feature bright LED lights that quite often even are far too bright for traffic as soon as they&#x27;re improperly adjusted and motorists still manage to miss these mobile torches.')
