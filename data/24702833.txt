Society&#x27;s relationship with politics tends to be oscillatory. If you push too hard in one direction (liberal or conservative), things swing back the other way and you end up with two steps forward, one step back and a loss of power for your team.<p>A more productive approach would be to set the cruise control just left of center and not get greedy. If you do that and simultaneously monitor and manage externalities of policies you see as progress, you&#x27;ll probably see more mileage.<p>The complete lack of concern for externalities of policies and disregard for second and third order effects is why I&#x27;ve largely abandoned supporting most democrat positions. It&#x27;s gotten so destructive that I&#x27;d rather stick with the devil I know than the devil I don&#x27;t. And I would rather avoid oscillating between which devil has power since it&#x27;s at the point in the reversal of political direction that the worst authoritarian abuses from either side happen.')
