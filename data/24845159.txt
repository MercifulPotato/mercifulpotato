Otherwise things like momentum trading wouldn&#x27;t work (i.e. price would just gap to the true value if markets were indeed efficient). If tech analysis works at times for me it would show that markets aren&#x27;t that efficient as a whole.<p>IMO markets can&#x27;t be efficient because we as humans aren&#x27;t - our perception of value itself can be subjective and influenced by many things including FOMO, safety in numbers perceptions, risk aversion (usually), etc etc.')
