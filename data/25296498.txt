The post is about a database that can be wiped and effectively recreated from scratch. There wouldn&#x27;t really be a need for rollback scripts when you can just rerun the entire workflow from scratch. Even easier if you have a hot&#x2F;warm&#x2F;cold setup.<p>In this sort of setup, changing a db function isn&#x27;t unlike making a change to db-interfacing code in that it&#x27;s not changing the underlying data, just the interface to it.<p>I&#x27;ve built similar systems that instead of making changes to db functions, changes are made to materialized views. The underlying data doesn&#x27;t change, but its presentation does. No huge need for rollbacks. It works really well!')
