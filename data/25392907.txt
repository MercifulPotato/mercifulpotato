Additionally they promoted themselves as an open forum in the beginning.<p>Ideally, discrimination should not exist in something that is promoted as a public forum.<p>If YouTube only wanted to serve a certain type of genre or they had the same censorship policies from the beginning then that is one thing.  But they promoted themselves as open and free speech and then once they achieved critical mass they changed their mind to push their own agenda.<p>That is dishonest and an abuse of public trust.<p>As a contrasting example, censoring porn, while still not free speech, would be fine for YouTube to continue to do since they had this stance from the beginning and people chose to join the platform knowing this.')
