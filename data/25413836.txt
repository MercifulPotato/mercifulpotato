Instead they would connect only to WebTorrent Desktop peers and other Web peers. The WebTorrent team of course is doing incredible work, and they&#x27;ve been able to convince some of the native torrent clients to support Web Torrent - so it kinda works in practice.<p>So for a new protocol, the hard part would be to make all the non-browser peers speak WebRTC - which is nowhere as easy&#x2F;robust as writing a TCP&#x2F;UDP based peer [1].<p>[1]: Add - Things have certainly improved on this front. eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webrtc-rs&#x2F;webrtc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webrtc-rs&#x2F;webrtc</a>')
