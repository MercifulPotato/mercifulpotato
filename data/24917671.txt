Our software streams a video game session from your computer to your mobile device over the internet, so you can play your favorite games on your phone or tablet from anywhere you have a strong internet connection. It automatically detects the games installed on your computer, so launching a game is as simple as selecting the game you want to play in the app.<p>NexGame is in open beta and available for Android and Windows. I would love your feedback on anything from the landing page to the core functionality to games you would like to see added.<p>Website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexgame.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexgame.io</a>\nPlay Store: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.app.nexgame" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.app.nexgam...</a>\nDemo Video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qVK9HWx55vY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qVK9HWx55vY</a>')
