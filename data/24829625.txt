Firefox and Windows changes caused minor, obvious problems which I was able to resolve quickly. On Android I found several apps were so badly programmed they simply displayed blank screens, or showed other strange failures, when the required SSL certs were distrusted. Steam, Naver Line and tumblr were the three that I recall fell under this. There were a few apps which immediately threw a human-readable error about certificates, and hence were easier to resolve.')
