Services can aggregate all of these moderation&#x2F;rating feeds in realtime, and provide to their users a list of all of the different &quot;social credit rating agencies&quot;, or moderation feed publishers.  You as a user could then choose your moderators from across the internet, then their own moderation decisions are applied to your feeds.  It&#x27;s sort of like outsourcing the management of your block&#x2F;mute list.  You could, of course, disable all of the moderation feeds and see the firehose of slurs and spam, or switch to different ones.<p>We solved this with email (poorly, and over a long period of time), and RBLs were part of that process.  We&#x27;ll eventually see the same for federated&#x2F;p2p systems as well.')
