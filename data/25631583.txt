A union that relies entirely on industrial action (a.k.a. strikes) to get a company to change, isn&#x27;t a good union. If a union walks into every negotiation with just an ultimatum, then very quickly the otherside is going to get fed up of their bullshit.<p>If those unionized googlers are worth their salt, can&#x27;t they use more aggressive negotiation tactics, at least like a DDOS?')
