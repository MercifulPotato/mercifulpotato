I think I may have been sloppy in expressing my criticism of the original article. At a certain level I think my comment was &#x27;sociological&#x27; - the aliens, as intelligent creatures, should have a strong intuition that humans as other (somewhat) intelligent creatures can&#x27;t be spending so much time and attention on something that is nothing more than a coin toss.<p>This sociological intuition should drive further inquiry into the mechanics of the game.<p>&gt;  if they are limited to that extent, then they are not going to determine that it is a game of rules, no matter what their philosophy and no matter how much they suspect that it is<p>Indeed, in that case the aliens are forever stuck. However, IRL you probably can&#x27;t be absolutely sure that you&#x27;re forever stuck, so in this case the &#x27;philosophical&#x27; attitude might matter. An anti-realist might say - to hell with it, no worth trying, we&#x27;ll never get better predictions out of more complex theories. A realist however, might pursue a theory not because it makes more accurate predictions, but because he&#x2F;she has an idea that the theory is truly closer to the truth than the idea of a random coin toss. This intuition might take you through a dark period towards a higher reward (see moving from a local maximum to a valley, towards a yet unforeseeable global maximum).<p>PS:<p>flubert has a nice excerpt from Jaynes&#x27; Probability Theory: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25648965" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25648965</a>')
