Perhaps the buttons have click events intercepted by an analytics library, and the async requests to load analytic libraries have to time out first? Can you network tools the load? I’m not saying the new site is fast or anything but it surely doesn’t take a minute to become interactive in most cases.\nAlso are you using any dns based blocking like pi holes? Sometimes this can cause a network request to time out rather than instantly fail.')
