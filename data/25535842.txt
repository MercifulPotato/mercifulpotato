(The UK, US and I think most other western countries used the same contact tracing early on that kept Sars out of those countries. It didn&#x27;t work. You also don&#x27;t see this discussed much, because it doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative - except to attack the UK government for discontinuing the contact tracing once it failed.)<p>The one thing that did work well early on is restrictions on travel, which the WHO, China and the press in Western countries campaigned against. The only Western country I know of that applied reasonably sensible travel restrictions early on is the US, and very soon it&#x27;s going to get a new president who campaigned on the extremely dubious claim that those restrictions made things worse which went basically unchallenged by the press. (In particular, Italy&#x27;s travel restrictions - which are often pointed to as proof the US ones were stupid and pointless - only blocked people from travelling directly from China, so they could just travel via other countries and Italy had no record of where they came form. I know the UK&#x27;s government-funded experts concluded that was much less effective than banning people who&#x27;d visited China recently.)<p>Those travel restrictions also wouldn&#x27;t work for any country geographically or geopolitically close to Italy - they were still reporting basically zero cases at a point when a substantial proportion of the population was infected. This probably put countries which were closer to China than Italy at something of an inherent advantage.')
