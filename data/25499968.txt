I&#x27;ve had my Model 3 for over two years now, and I still cannot reliably cancel a turn signal, or &quot;soft push&quot; the signal so it only blinks 3 times.  It&#x27;s infuriating to inadvertently signal left, then right, then left again, as you frantically try to just cancel the turn signal.  I&#x27;m broadcasting confusion and incompetence to the outside world, when inside the car I know exactly what I&#x27;m trying to do.')
