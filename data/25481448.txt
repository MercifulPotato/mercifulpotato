I&#x27;m also chiming in from the 50+ hours crowd and the only bugs I&#x27;ve experienced have been a bit silly, but nothing game-breaking yet. Clearly this thing needed more time in QA based on other people&#x27;s experiences, but plenty of us are playing and loving the game all the way through.')
