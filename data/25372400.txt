It worked for the PDP-7 because that computer was fairly simple and because Thompson wrote the operating system primarily for his own amusement.<p>&gt; Any operating system that would be maintained and updated by multiple programmers and would run on the more sophisticated hardware available at the time would need to be written in a high-level programming language.<p>&gt; Thus, when Bell Labs purchased a PDP-11 for the department in 1971, Thompson decided it was time to rewrite Unix in a high-level programming language, as he told Brian Kernighan on stage at VCF 2019.')
