Most commenters on the issue expect that there&#x27;ll need to be more bills next year.<p>There is a lot to blame the federal government for in this pandemic, but the lack of nurses just isn&#x27;t one. The federal government has very little leverage to increase the supply available, since the vast majority of nurses are employed by the private sector or state systems. Congress could provide more money to underwrite training and nurse salaries, but they&#x27;d just be setting up for mass layoffs once the demand for that form of labor returns to historical norms. And there is very little chance that these new nurses would be trained in time to make a difference.<p>Maybe the federal government could undo the residency program that constrains the supply of doctors, but at best they could flush out all the doctors waiting for residency to complete right now. That would provide a small boost, but at most they could add 3 extra years worth of new doctors at once. Nothing the federal government could do would drastically increase the supply of doctors other than relaxing immigration requirements for foreign trained doctors, but that still takes time and is uncertain.<p>If there&#x27;s any aspect of this pandemic that I&#x27;d lay right at the feet of the federal government, it would be the lack of PPE. Both Congress and the executive branch have all of the tools at hand to goose the production of PPE domestically should they have decided to do so, and yet our medical personnel continue to reuse N95 masks nine months into this pandemic. An extra supply of N95 masks would have also reduced the attrition of medical personnel, as actual sickness and perceived risk has been a big drag on the supply of properly trained personnel to fight this pandemic.')
