Not only was pirated content more accessible, it also often had <i>better</i> subtitling. Official subtitles seem to have <i>way</i> more localization than fansubs. This might be great to capture a broader audience, but it also means that the fans that are already there don&#x27;t want to use your subs. Sometimes they&#x27;d just rather not watch a show than put up with your subs.<p>Stuff like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WjUtoQaRfE0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WjUtoQaRfE0</a><p>What they probably should&#x27;ve done is what Qidian ended up doing with webnovel.com. They should&#x27;ve approached the fansubbers and the release groups and offered them a job. That way they would&#x27;ve retained the expertise and fanbase. It would&#x27;ve likely caused a lot of issues like Qidian did, but they would&#x27;ve likely had far more success.<p>Alternatively, putting anime on places like Steam could&#x27;ve also been a good choice.')
