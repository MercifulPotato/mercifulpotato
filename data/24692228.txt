Some of the things I&#x27;ve seen excel spreadsheets contorted to do horrify me.<p>I once got spreadsheet dumped on me to debug because it wasn&#x27;t working. A colleague used the spreadsheet to &#x27;generate&#x27; interest rates that were then input into a mainframe. Dug into the VBA spaghetti mess, turns out this 15 year old script that took 15 minutes to run originally hit a bunch of Oracle&#x2F;External APIs and performed calculations was now just copying the rates in from a csv file on a shared drive.<p>The error was caused by an excel formula ticking over a new year causing it to look for a directory it did not need to access that didn&#x27;t exist. I thought it was pretty funny until I heard that the entire asset finance business had been unable to write any loans for days because of this.')
