Where I work we have rules about what we can say in written communication. Hyperbole and jokes will not be interpreted that way if an audit or subpoena finds it. A court might decide that we didn&#x27;t mean exactly what we said, but we don&#x27;t even want to deal with a court case in the first place. Not only because it directly consumes money to put up a defense but also because it can restrict our ability to make money and could tarnish our name.<p>We also have rules against talking to press. We can send them to a department that will handle that communication, but in general they won&#x27;t get anything from us because it&#x27;s easy to put a negative spin on anything we say.')
