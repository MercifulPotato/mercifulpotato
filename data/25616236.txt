Technically 9% but you can deduct 7.75 of those 9 diectly out of the tax you owe.<p>It’s 9%. That’s the money that goes into the health insurance system. You can’t run a universal health insurance system with a 1.25% tax.<p>If you can take a deduction on your personal income tax for what you pay in health tax, then you have to compare those personal income tax rates as well. The proper way to do this is to look at the tax wedge: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;tax&#x2F;tax-policy&#x2F;taxing-wages-poland.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;tax&#x2F;tax-policy&#x2F;taxing-wages-poland.pdf</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;tax&#x2F;tax-policy&#x2F;taxing-wages-united-states.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;tax&#x2F;tax-policy&#x2F;taxing-wages-united-state...</a><p>The tax wedge for an average single worker Poland is 36%, right at the OECD average. For the US it’s 29.8%. The Poland number includes health insurance, and the US number doesn’t. For workers who have to purchase an ACA plan, the effective tax rate probably works out to the same number.<p>But 70% of US workers get health insurance from their employer, which is a benefit on top of their income (so it’s not factored into the OECD tax wedge data).')
