As much as I love Atlanta and the gigantic house I was able to afford, landscape-wise it doesn&#x27;t even come close to what the bay area has to offer. Beltline is pretty neat but you will find it rather disappointing if you have ever been to one of the coastal trails in the bay. Not to mention the lack of skiing options (sorry but Gatlinburg ain&#x27;t Lake Tahoe).')
