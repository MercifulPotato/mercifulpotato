Perhaps HN can solve the eternal question!<p>How does a person accurately assess their strengths, weaknesses, good habits, bad habits etc. when they only have their own subjective experience of these things?<p>Explicit feedback can be useful, especially in a professional setting, but relies on good communication and for the person receiving feedback to appreciate (in both senses of the word) what is being said. I&#x27;m sure we all have examples of advice we didn&#x27;t fully understand until we were older (and had made the mistakes we were warned about).<p>In the past I have found meditation useful, but it is obviously subjective too. Personally, I have found it too easy to slip from self-inquiry to disproportionate self-criticism, though perhaps that is a stage on the journey.')
