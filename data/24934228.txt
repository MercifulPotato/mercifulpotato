Item(by='bmitc', descendants=None, kids=[24934746], score=None, time=1603998161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931749, text='&gt; Space exploration has already created many significant benefits for humanity on Earth, by advancing hundreds of new technologies with terrestrial applications and launching satellite networks<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a strong supporting argument because it applies to any major technological development. Anytime you invest people, billions of dollars, etc. into major technological goals, you&#x27;re going to get advances and spinoffs that have broader applications. Space exploration is already  basically a spinoff of military projects, goals, and investing, just like a huge amount of existing and future technology.<p>&gt; that support a safer, more peaceful world for humans, with improved agricultural efficiencies as well as advanced warning and a better understanding of extreme weather events and climate trends<p>A citation would be very helpful there in terms of creating a more peaceful world for humans, as I do not think it&#x27;s so cut and dry. Further, one could argue that exploring the oceans instead of space would be far more beneficial to understanding life, climate, ecosystems, etc. and would have just as much if not more technological spinoffs as sending man to the Moon or Mars.<p>My personal viewpoint on space exploration is to currently concentrate on drones and robots being sent out to space and to turn the money that would otherwise be invested into manned missions towards understanding the ocean and Earth itself. It&#x27;s difficult to imagine a more perfect place for sustainable life than Earth, and yet we are not sustaining. That is a big gap and a big goal for humans: sustain life on Earth in a healthy way. If we can&#x27;t do that on Earth, then I truly do not understand how we&#x27;ll do it anywhere else.')
