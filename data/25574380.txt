I had an athletic build both before and after. Probably good for a lot of people but weightlifting really puts it into question.<p>It&#x27;s not like weightlifting is something only few men can do; most men can weightlift. Then they end up having healthy body fat levels, but end up with BMI in the overweight category. If something as simple and straightforward as weightlifting messes up a measure, then it&#x27;s not a good measure.')
