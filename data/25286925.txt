I want to say that things like form validation are faster and easier now, but no, they&#x27;ve just been reinvented a few times with changing underlying technology. I want to say that they solved the ORM problem, but nope, still crap, and again because of having to re-invent the wheel for a new language, environment, and generation of developers. Did the existing tools and languages improve much? Also no, at least not that I know of, still wouldn&#x27;t use Hibernate if I can help it.<p>So in many ways things feel like they have advanced, but at least speaking for myself, at the same time things feel like they are still the same.<p>At least for the moment my Go application recompiles &#x2F; restarts much faster than the old Java &#x2F; Spring applications I used to work with. Which puts it on par with the PHP experience from before that.')
