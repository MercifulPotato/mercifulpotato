I don&#x27;t think I learned until I was 17 or 18 that there were non-British pilots involved on the British side. And I live in England! We should know!<p>I&#x27;m glad the article isn&#x27;t quite as blunt as the headline suggests. If GCHQ are saying that public perception of Bletchley&#x27;s role is overrated... well, they&#x27;re entirely correct about that. But if you actually go to Bletchley Park they&#x27;re quite clear about the role of Polish intelligence in breaking the Enigma machine.')
