They also violated orders by Justice Alito to keep mail in votes separate and votes by incoming date separate.<p>Their State courts also rules to extend the voting deadline for mail-in, which goes against their own laws and may end up going against the constitution.<p>PA has not been confirmed on some media sites; and been switched back to grey. It will likely make it to the Supreme Cort.<p>Please stop spreading misinformation. There is a lot of credible voter irregularities. Due process violations occurred in PA and NV (observers not allowed access) and in Detroit (observers were told to go home when 120k votes came in at 4am .. and then those votes changed to 12k).<p>There are a lot of questionable aspects to this election and they all need to be investigated. Please at least realize that investigation needs to happen. If there are no issues, investigations should not be a big deal. So far every state in question has been actively hindering transparency.<p>This could turn into one of the most disputed elections of our time and the media is trying to dismiss all the irregularities. This is incredibly dangerous, as we could potentially see riots that would make May look like a Canadian hockey game after party.')
