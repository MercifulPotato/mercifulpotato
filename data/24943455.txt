AFAIK Influenza B has always been the more severe and deadly type of the flu and to skeptics like myself this underlines even more the suspicion that we have falsly attributed a lot of deaths in our last Winter to COVID when it might have been the flu in many cases. Previous studies have already proven that when a patient had tested positive for the flu and COVID that all these cases have been only counted as COVID deaths. Things like this make it problematic to build trust in the wider population and ask people to follow silly rules when there is so much ground for mistrust in the severity of COVID.')
