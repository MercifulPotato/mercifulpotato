To be honest if they ARE using the same creds in prod as they are in dev, this is the first thing they should fix because it would have easily prevented the whole mess.<p>I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that it wasn&#x27;t the case and that it&#x27;s unlikely that a dev or OPs person was tunnelling through a bastion of some kind to run the script.<p>If they pulled their credentials from a store and populated the config object that way, it&#x27;s very possible someone actually loaded the production credentials by mistake into the development secrets file. The CI&#x2F;pipeline system has permissions&#x2F;network access to deploy to any environment, hence how it ran the script to drop the table.<p>I&#x27;m purely speculating another alternative to the much worse case of the tunnelling scenario outline.')
