All it takes to avoid the standard tourist traps is having interests that influence your travel, talking to locals, or firing up something like Groupon to find something to do in a new area. I&#x27;ve always figured that so many people hit up classic tourist spots because that&#x27;s what they actually want to do.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t have any real insight into the tourism market and won&#x27;t be shocked if this works out well for Airbnb. I personally try to avoid crowded tourist spots like the plague and this could just be my bias talking.')
