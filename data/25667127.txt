Even still though, 4ghz*8c isn&#x27;t anything new, and isn&#x27;t really that remarkable besides the low TDP (which is incidentally dwarfed by the display, which draws up to 5x more power than the CPU does). I think the big issue is that Apple has painted themselves into a corner here: ARM won&#x27;t play nice with the larger CPUs they want to make, and the pressure for them to provide a competent graphics solution on custom silicon is mounting. They spent a lot of time this generation marketing their &quot;energy efficiency&quot; and battery life, but many consumers&#x2F;professionals (myself included) don&#x27;t really care about either of these things.')
