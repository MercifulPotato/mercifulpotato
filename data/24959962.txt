It&#x27;s all negotiable, welcome to consulting!<p>For long projects (years), you will need to agree on a billing schedule from the moment you draft and sign the contract up to the delivery. There should be periodic billings and milestones. Definitely do not work a whole year for free :D<p>Unlike the comment above (anti pattern!), you don&#x27;t want to redefine the goals every week and make payment contingency on the goals (it&#x27;s too much time drafting formal agreements and it allows the client to not pay you by arguing the goal is not reached). What you usually prefer is to bill for the time spent on the project (weekly or monthly) irrelevant of any goals.<p>There&#x27;s a fundamental struggle in consulting: you should get regular feedback and make sure you&#x27;re building something the client is happy with... while you need to make sure you get paid, irrelevant of what exactly was completed and of the shifting will of the client... while you can&#x27;t waste all the time doing paperwork&#x2F;contracts to cover your ass. Long story short you always end up billing by time, except for some short specialized work you&#x27;re very confident you can handle.')
