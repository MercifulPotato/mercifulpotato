Firebase is popular because it&#x27;s easy to set up, and it&#x27;s realtime functionality on the client side mean you don&#x27;t need to write a client-side data management layer, you can just use firebase&#x27;s realtime functionality.<p>The issue is that firebase is completely untyped, isn&#x27;t relational, and has limited queries. So you end up writing gnarly non-transactional code that makes many round-trip requests to query basic stuff.<p>I think there may be an opportunity product that combines the performance of and client-side tools of firestore, the ease of use of airtable and the real-time query and materialized view functionality of materialize into a database platform for businesses that want to scale their product.<p>Big ask obviously, but I know that a product like that would help me launch products much faster, I&#x27;d pay a lot for it.')
