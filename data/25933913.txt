That&#x27;s $500,000&#x2F;person, right here on Earth where breathable air and protection from cosmic radiation is completely free of charge, and you don&#x27;t need to launch anything out of Earth&#x27;s gravity well.<p>So if Musk had a realistic way of reaching $200,000&#x2F;person, he could start doing it on Earth and completely fund his Mars project purely from the profits of selling the Earthside city to someone else here on Earth.')
