Many information systems fit well with the notion of an information base that is updated in the same way that it&#x27;s read, adding CQRS to such a system can add significant complexity. I&#x27;ve certainly seen cases where it&#x27;s made a significant drag on productivity, adding an unwarranted amount of risk to the project, even in the hands of a capable team. So while CQRS is a pattern that&#x27;s good to have in the toolbox, beware that it is difficult to use well and you can easily chop off important bits if you mishandle it.')
