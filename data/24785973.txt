Producers discovered that most series attracts more viewers during their first episodes, then numbers start either exploding if the series is deemed to become a huge success, or slowly fading year after year. Therefore they already know that cancelling a series to replace it with a new one after some strong advertising will without any doubt pay in the short time.<p>How could they solve the problem without leaving watchers with unresolved plots and those awful cliffhangers? To me there are two possible solutions: either produce less series so that they&#x27;re not competing against themselves, or offer by contract a way to resolve plots by guaranteeing that a certain number of episodes will be produced anyway after the cancellation decision. I don&#x27;t see why implementing either, or even both, could be detrimental in any way to the business, unless they&#x27;re counting profits by the cent with total disregard to their customers.')
