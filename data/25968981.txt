Item(by='Diggsey', descendants=None, kids=[25969088], score=None, time=1612014168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968415, text='&gt;  What you&#x27;re missing in your time line is that the first AZ vaccines that fulfilled UK orders were produced in Europe, namely in Germany and Netherlands.<p>First, that was only the initial vaccines. All vaccines since then were produced entirely within the UK. Second, the UK paid for the development of those vaccines, the EU did not. Without the UK funding and the collaboration with Oxford, AZ was not even planning to develop its own vaccine variant, and so those facilities would not have been producing <i>any</i> vaccine at all.<p>&gt; While the UK and USA have their production capacity only for themselves AND still get production from Europe.<p>As mentioned, the UK and USA paid to develop these products. The EU is expecting everyone else to pay the cost of development, and then just get the vaccine <i>at cost</i> when it arrives, <i>and still have priority</i>?<p>&gt; So something isn&#x27;t adding up here, and yes, it fucking stinks. I hope they block all vaccines exports until EU deadlines&#x2F;stock is replentished.<p>Good luck with that. All the vaccine manufacturers are suffering shortfalls, and the UK is not reliant on exports from the EU. I hope that further vaccine production goes to countries that didn&#x27;t have the economic means to build their own vaccine supply, rather than those too short-sighted to build one.')
