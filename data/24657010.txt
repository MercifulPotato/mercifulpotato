That they continue to plow ahead while users vote with their feet causes a lot of hopeless bitterness. The fact that the executives are paying themselves so much while marketshare is steadily dropping just adds insult to injury.<p>Every negative poster was a rabid Firefox partisan 10 years ago. Now they barely hold on because they don&#x27;t want a blob on their system and they want uBlock to work. Sadly, I have no confidence that Firefox won&#x27;t declare next year that shipping a blob is necessary to the health of the web, and that some API uBlock relies on could be confusing to users and will be removed.<p>tl;dr it&#x27;s a coordinated campaign alright, but it&#x27;s coordinated by Mozilla&#x27;s behavior, not by communication between the 90% of users that have left (30% to 3%) or the large percentage of those remaining users who are only staying because of their disgust for Google, closed source and ads.')
