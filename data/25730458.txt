Amazon (or any entity) is free to choose with whom they do business (oh the irony!). They are dropping Parler because the the current political climate has manifest in such a way that they think it will cost them <i>more</i> financial and&#x2F;or political capital than the alternative (recall there is a lot of antitrust sentiment out there right now).<p>Too bad so sad. Sorry not sorry. This is exactly the kind of &quot;freedom&quot; for which many of the above platform&#x27;s users would advocate. Parler&#x27;s PR team is missing the opportunity to applaud AWS for exercising their freedoms.')
