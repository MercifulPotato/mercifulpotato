I used to produce high quality work all day and have fun. I thought it was the next logical step because my boss knew I was intelligent and I did big projects all on my own. Managing people especially older people has been awful, I&#x27;m not trying to be rude it is just what I&#x27;ve experienced. There are so many more things you have to care about and when I became a software developer I did it because I did not want to put on a smile for customers at a cash register all day. It&#x27;s awful don&#x27;t do it and don&#x27;t get tricked by your boss when he calls it &quot;tech leader.&quot;')
