The emphasis of a social network is on &quot;propagation&quot; aka, propaganda.<p>Social networks push opinions into people&#x27;s face, it promotes, markets and advertises messages in ways that people can&#x27;t avoid reading even if they&#x27;re not looking for it.<p>They&#x27;re not designed to make accessible information for those looking for it, but to allow you to advertise yourself and your ideas to others. And definitely not designed in any way to filter for accurate and high quality information.<p>What social networks do is make it really easy to voluntarily subscribe to propaganda and be subjected to it day in&#x2F;day out. It&#x27;s bonkers when you think about it that we all agree to participate in this.')
