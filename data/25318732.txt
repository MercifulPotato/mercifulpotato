Nietzsche is very different from Kant for example.<p>One book I really want to recommend you:<p>Sigmund Freud - The Interpretation of Dreams<p>It&#x27;s more a psychology book, but it is deeply philosophical.<p>Freud tries to analyse how the brain works, using logic and observation of human behaviour.')
