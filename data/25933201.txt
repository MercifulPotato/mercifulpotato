They also had a certain look and feel to them that made them stick like a sore thumb compared to other apps, and a lot of people knew by looking when an app was made with Java.<p>Java was actually pretty fast even back in the early 2000s, but thanks to Swing et al (and to the JDK requirement) desktop apps its reputation was much worse than Electron or slow websites are today. Especially among non-programmers.<p>Strangely, OTOH, Visual Basic had a terrible reputation among programmers, but most Windows users had no idea about it since it used native widgets.')
