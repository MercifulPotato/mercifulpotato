It&#x27;s a trilogy. The first book came out in 2007, second in 2011, and nothing has been seen of the third, and presumably, final book.<p>Brandon Sanderson treats writing books as a job, thus he writes every day. Now you could argue that his books aren&#x27;t as entertaining to you (subjective) or that his prose isn&#x27;t as good (a bit less subjective), but he does treat his job like a job. Whereas Rothfuss and GRRM seem to try to do literally anything but continue writing their books.<p>Sanderson isn&#x27;t a bot but he has something a lot of people lack, work ethic.')
