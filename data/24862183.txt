While the geometric intuition in the post being discussed is quite visual, thinking of matrix elements as directed arrows generalizes easily to high-dimensional vector spaces, and also makes it very easy to understand the behavior of sparse transformation matrices, and motivates a nice correspondence between linear algebra and graph algorithms (ref. graphblas)')
