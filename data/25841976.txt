I have never used medication before (started 6 weeks ago), originally was put on Vyvanse (at the suggestion of another HNer ! haha) but I found the stimulant aspect too strong.  In a way, the bupropion feels too weak but I am giving it time (supposedly they effect the same neurotransmitters except Vyvanse is a direct stimulant&#x2F;acts of synthetic dopamine and buproprion merely inhibits the natural process that removes these).<p>What do you think naltrexone would do to help?  I&#x27;m not sure I am following your reasoning.  I actually do have some leftover naltrexone, never thought about combining it.<p>So naltrexone + buproprion = more naturally occuring dopamine&#x2F;norepinephrine?<p>My concern with bupropion is that it stops the process of removing dopamine from the brain, but what if I am not producing enough to begin with?<p>Here are two links I found helpful:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodtherapy.org&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;antidepressants.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodtherapy.org&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;antidepressants.html</a> -explains the mechanism of action for lots of antidepressants including bupropion.  I believe the different uses for the drug basically comes down to dosage + marketing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leonardsax.com&#x2F;stimulants.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leonardsax.com&#x2F;stimulants.htm</a> - a psychologist is against the use of stimulants in kids due to potential for long term damage.<p>Side note, just by presenting myself well and speaking clearly (and looking like a professional), I felt my psychologist was willing to let me try most things.  I was very much in the driver&#x27;s seat as far as what drug to take and at what dose.  Next time we meet I may see if they are open to prescribing modafinil, which I have used in the past and thought it worked great (as a stimulant, even complimentary to caffeine) with no side effects.<p>For a time I took both Vyvanse and Buproprion.  I was able to study for 10 hours a day and passed a professional certification that week.')
