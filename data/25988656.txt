They live in modern houses, use snow mobiles and helicopters for herding the reindeers (many work in &quot;regular&quot; jobs), buy most food from shops just as anyone else. Of course they are well aware of their roots and proud of their history.<p>Just an anecdote: my grandmother was born as Sámi, so I could officially have the Sámi status as well (but my kids not anymore), although I don&#x27;t speak the language nor have much connections with the culture.')
