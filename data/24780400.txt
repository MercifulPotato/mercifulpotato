Maybe lots of people think this I just haven&#x27;t been talking to them.<p>We agree that &quot;limited and targeted (high bang-for-buck) measures&quot; are called for, I guess we just disagree on what sorts of things they plausibly should be?  I&#x27;m not sure why you are making this into a disagreement on &#x27;a priori&#x27; or whatever.<p>The thing with a 50-person limit is it is easy to understand and easy to comply with. A limit about number of people per cubic meter... the harder it is to know if you are doing it or not, the lower compliance there will be, whether voluntary or with penalties. It makes sense to approximate for comprehensibility -- since it&#x27;s based on imperfect data in the first place, we certainly don&#x27;t know the exact risk level of various densities or types of gatherings, only guesses based on imperfect data. (It would be really good to be investing in trying to get better guesses.) It&#x27;s <i>already</i> an approximation no matter what. That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be effective at limiting infection, it is not damned by being an approximation, whether expressed in terms of people per cubic foot or no gatherings over 50 people.<p>Telling people &quot;hey, just a as a rule of thumb you should &#x27;distance&#x27;, to whatever degree you think appropriate, but it&#x27;s up to you&quot; will, I am pretty confident, have very little effect on anyone&#x27;s behavior. At least not in the U.S. Maybe in Sweden.')
