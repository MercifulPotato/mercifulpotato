They leave it on the media-keys mode... which is the same as the touchbar&#x27;s default values, but without needing to know what mode it&#x27;s in.<p>With the physical media keys, if they want to mute, it&#x27;s always the same button.  Pause music, always the same button.  They&#x27;re great in a way that the touchbar completely destroys.<p>(and yes, I know you can change this setting, but if we&#x27;re assuming non-techy-users we also generally have to assume default settings.)')
