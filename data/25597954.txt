Capitalism is simple: it is an economic system where the means of production are owned and controlled by private citizens and operated for profit (the definition of profit is not always making lots of money). Nothing more, nothing less. A lot of the startup and tech economy is based squarely on private ownership of the means of production (i.e. companies). GDP and the focus on GDP growth is somewhat exclusive of whatever ism your country&#x27;s economy is based on.')
