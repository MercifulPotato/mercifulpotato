I ran a team in London where we really explored pushing the capabilities of the Flash player.<p>Granted we were just operating in a digital marketing context, in an environment where more involved gaming was already occurring, but we still delivered what feel like pretty decent 2d-gaming experiences, such as Professor Green and the Eco-Rangers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gUY2bVnhm44?t=85" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gUY2bVnhm44?t=85</a>.<p>Back then I remember key figures from the Adobe team visiting our London office and candidly telling us the reason Flash was being blocked, esp. on mobile, was entirely due to commercial reasons by Apple, and not for technical reasons.<p>I believed them at that stage, but in hindsight it does appear there were serious performance, energy and security issues, but ex-Adobe engineers might want to chime in on that...<p>As someone who lived through that phase of web indulgence, I&#x27;m not mournful of a more indulgent time. It was a beautiful, exploratory phase, but the explosion in pointless, nonsense preloaders and custom UI represented usability ignorance and was not something to cherish.<p>In recent times the creativity and complexity has increased significantly in areas where it matters, such as web gaming, whereas in areas where it doesn&#x27;t, such as UI interfaces to explore and understand information, it has gotten marginally or a lot better, depending on the context...')
