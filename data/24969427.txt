Item(by='II2II', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604332436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968815, text='&gt; There is no such thing as a conspiracy theory. Every conspiracy theory in existence can be explained in terms of math, technology, physics, psychology and behavioral biology.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether that is true of every conspiracy theory, but here is one example that supports your point:<p>While finishing up teacher&#x27;s college, I was paired with a maths teacher who believed in 9&#x2F;11 conspiracy theories and who mentioned them in class.  From his point of view, a delayed &quot;explosion&quot; lower down in the tower was evidence that the destruction was planned.  Left in an awkward position, I did the only thing I could think of: I used math.  Simply put, the time that it would take a shock wave to propagate through the steel structure matched the delay so the &quot;explosion&quot; did not prove his conspiracy theory.  That was one heck of a teachable moment that transformed an otherwise abstract math lesson into something that could be applied to every day life.<p>(Edit: clarification on the intent of the calculation.)')
