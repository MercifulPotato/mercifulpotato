The ability to configure more RAM into a system is key for marketing (even if this RAM is soldered onto the motherboard: like LPDDR4x, it wouldn&#x27;t be too expensive to make different motherboards especially in a niche $10,000 computer like the Mac Pro).<p>But if Apple did go with HBM2 itself... well... then its physically unable to go above 32GB (today), or maybe ~64GB (if bigger HBM2 modules come out next year).<p>--------<p>Sticking with LPDDR4x just seems like the most obvious, and best, decision for Apple. So that&#x27;s my expectation. But then again: making a 8-way decoder + fat-as-heck execution pipeline wasn&#x27;t part of my expectation either. So maybe Apple will surprise us again.')
