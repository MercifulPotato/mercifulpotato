You&#x27;d learn about pipelining as well, and scalar architectures for that matter. I guess my point is that even if you didn&#x27;t, if you wanted a head start, it&#x27;s sufficient to know at least the basics of what microarchitectures are, and how to reason about a computational model of complexity, even if you need to adjust it later (for a particular console, or GPU, or architecture).<p>As for quaternions, I can derive them (no really, I&#x27;ve written a ton of code in this space, although I prefer the GA formulation), but I want to know, does the candidate understand why they&#x27;re mathematically advantageous (blending properties, linearity, etc). Can they productively read a paper that uses it and apply the technique, etc.')
