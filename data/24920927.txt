If not then I&#x27;ll just set up the robots.txt and observe whether that does indeed solve the problem. But I&#x27;d much prefer to just set up the permissions I know I want on my own running instance than spend time making inferences about the reasons bots are abusing my instance&#x27;s inputs.')
