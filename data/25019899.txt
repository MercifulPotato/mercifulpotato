People do not want land, they want residential units.  Strong demand can be handled by building up.  Making it possible to build up where land values are high would solve a lot of problems.<p>California high speed rail is a different, specific, and complex system to evaluate.  Just to throw out one major issue there is increasing demand for travel between LA and SF but capacity of existing roads, air corridors, railways, and ferries is already approaching fundamental limits.  Space for roads is limited so the only other real option is more airports everywhere which might end up being necessary either way.')
