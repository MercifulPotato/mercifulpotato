Ha! --great find.<p>I didn&#x27;t read the entire thread but I wonder if any of the people who commented then are still around? And, if so, what [with 40&#x2F;40 hindsight] they make of their strongly held opinions back then. Especially the one who said he&#x27;d been mining 50 BTC a fortnight and selling them to &#x27;idiots for $20 a pop&#x27;<p>Unfortunately my crypto portfolio is minuscule. I never had enough spare cash to invest anything much. But I did buy 0,14 of a BTC when it was around €500 and got myself 4 ETH when they were around €80. So, while I&#x27;m not going to retire on my nest egg, it might pay a few bills.')
