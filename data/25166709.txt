It seems to work okay switching back and forth between AirPlay 1 and 2, so I can temporarily take over from Airfoil and use them as an AP2 stereo pair, in which case they sync well for video.<p>Supposedly Airplay 2 was cracked about a year ago, but there still aren&#x27;t any usable third-party implementations. Really a shame that Apple hasn&#x27;t opened up the standard.')
