Probably nobody ordered the 10 gigabit upgrade.<p>I bet they’re only upgrading it because it was essentially free. They already developed it for the developer transition kit.<p>I commend the idea of a small enthusiast mini desktop like a NUC but I don’t think the market is really there, or if they are, they’re not interested in a Mac.')
