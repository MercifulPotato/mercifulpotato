Compilation step is missed. Compiler will refuse to compile the invalid code.<p>IMHO, the same situation is for Godel numbers. We can use math to generate numbers, which are equivalent to formulas, BUT why these formulas must be accepted? Initial set of axioms was carefully chosen by human, so it not an open set, where anybody can add anything.')
