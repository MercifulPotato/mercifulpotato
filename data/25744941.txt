Who defined it as illegal? The elected Government of the people right? No one voted for Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg. People voted for their own elected representatives who make the laws.<p>Private companies must follow what is in the law. If hate speech doesn&#x27;t exist in the law people should lobby their elected representatives to enact laws governing hate speech which is then enforced by private companies. If private companies start making their own rules and regulations that go against freedom of speech (again don&#x27;t bring in the first amendment as it applies only to US Citizens. Free speech in my country is not the same as Free speech as defined in first amendment) then it becomes problematic. Who is the final arbiter of free speech? It is the Government, the Court or the private company? If private companies start deciding what is illegal and what is not illegal then why the heck should I elect a Government? Just let private companies handle everything and let&#x27;s dissolve the Government.<p>At the end of the day it should be the law of the land which decides what&#x2F;which content is illegal and which is not. It should never be in the hands of private companies to decide. They have Section 230 precisely for that reason. They aren&#x27;t liable for anything that happens on their platform except for what is defined as illegal in the Constitution. If there is something that is unsavoury and there isn&#x27;t a law for it yet, the companies aren&#x27;t held liable for it. When a law is passed deeming that unsavoury thing illegal then and only then will private companies be liable if they do not censor it. You get what I am trying to say? Laws should be implemented by the legislature. Period. Private companies can decide whatever rules they want to set for their <i>employees</i>. I am a <i>user</i> of the public platform they provide. Not their <i>employee</i>. They cannot regulate my speech unless it is required by law to censor anything illegal I say.')
