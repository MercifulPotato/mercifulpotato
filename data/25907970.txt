Item(by='bilkow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611604809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906207, text='&gt; I think you&#x27;ll have to make &quot;can do&quot; more precise for this question to have a meaningful answer. All mentioned languages are Turing complete and thus equivalent on that level.<p>I actually agree, I was just arguing with the point of the above comment which implicated you can&#x27;t do lots of things in Rust that you can in C++. I don&#x27;t know what the author was referring to, so I can&#x27;t be more specific.<p>&gt; I can wrap a file in a ByteBuffer in java and the JVM will (make a best effort to) perform native I&#x2F;O on that. Does that pass as &quot;access raw memory&quot;?<p>I was referring to directly accessing the memory &quot;owned&quot; by local variables (the stack), the bytecode of the program itself (on von Neumann architecture), etc. It was a counterpoint in that implication that every other language (akin to publishing systems) had no limitations where Rust had. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s actually a problem as (if that&#x27;s ever needed) you can FFI to another language that can do that stuff and (as you said) all those languages are turing complete.<p>Sorry if it sounded like I was attacking Java &amp; Python, for most applications I don&#x27;t think the &quot;runtime&quot; limitation isn&#x27;t a problem and comparing them to facebook is still hyperbolic.')
