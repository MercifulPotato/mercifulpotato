There were very few articles on the internet that went beyond some of the basic stuff (e.g. create file =&gt; fsync directory) and perhaps one article explaining what needs to be considered when using sync_file_range. Docs and POSIX were useless. I noticed that there seemed to be inherent problems with I&#x2F;O error handling when using the page cache, i.e. whenever something that wasn&#x27;t the app itself caused write I&#x2F;O you really didn&#x27;t know any more if all the data got there.<p>Some two years later fsyncgate happened and since then I&#x2F;O error handling on Linux has finally gotten at least some attention and people seemed to have woken up to the fact that this is a genuinely hard thing to do.')
