I agree that it’s repetitive, but you can at least put common expressions into build variables, so the overall build script size should scale about linearly with the number of files.<p>142MB is massive! How many files are being built and how much work is being done per file? 142,000 files with 1KB of unique command-line flags each?<p>Also, even though that’s a very large build script, I would have thought generating it should only take seconds, not minutes. How is the script being generated, and how long is spent generating it versus executing it?')
