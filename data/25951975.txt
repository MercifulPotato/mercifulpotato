But rating the app as 1 star is not enough. We need to take our money out of Robinhood even if we end up having to pay a few dollars per trade. Also I have not made any plays on gme or the other stocks and I would not recommend anyone else do so but this type of market manipulation is unacceptable and needs to be punished.')
