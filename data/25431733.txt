If many people use language X, then it makes sense for an IC design company to optimize for that language (unless there is a near-monopoly situation and they don&#x27;t care about what the market wants).<p>&gt; But there are plenty of other examples (ever wonder why no one seems to be able to replicate Apple&#x27;s great trackpads?).<p>I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll have to provide some more context, because the connection between your argument and both hardware and software seems missing.')
