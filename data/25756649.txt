They are fiction.<p>The events in these books don&#x27;t even necessarily reflect the beliefs of the authors. An author might simply write what would be entertaining to read, or what has been written in the genre before. Even if these fictional megacorps do reflect the widely held belief of genre authors, that doesn&#x27;t serve as any kind of factual basis on which to base public policy.')
