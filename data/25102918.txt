It allows receiving the stream directly and operating on it without latency.<p>Not sure if relevant though, it&#x27;s using their SIP product also. If the original service isn&#x27;t using Telnyx, you could get creative and have a Telnyx shadow user join the group call to receive the stream, etc.')
