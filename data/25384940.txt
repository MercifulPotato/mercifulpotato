Why impose on people happy minding their own business?<p>That&#x27;s the same argument, word for word, that people used to defend businesses not serving coloured folk - after all, can&#x27;t they just go elsewhere? And we as society decided no, they shouldn&#x27;t have to go anywhere - if you run a business, you have to serve everyone, end of story. I think it&#x27;s time to do the same for Apple - if you want to run an app platform, you have to allow choice. And if your choice is to stay with App Store and only install apps curated by apple - that&#x27;s perfectly valid. No one is taking that away from you.<p>Again, how exactly does that inconvenience you, personally? No one is forcing you to use these other stores, no one is imposing anything on you. They will just exist somewhere for people who want them. Again, I&#x27;m on Android but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m losing anything by the mere existence of the Amazon App store - it&#x27;s there if you want it, if you don&#x27;t then that&#x27;s cool.<p>And yes, I absolutely think you are overexaggerating the technical difficulty behind allowing people to do this - all Apple needs to do it allow apps to install other apps from packages. It&#x27;s hardly a groundbreaking architectural change, come on.')
