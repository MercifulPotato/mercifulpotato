To <i>grossly</i> oversimplify: if all of space is east-west, and time is north-south, the Big Bang is the north pole. Only the universe is the map rather than the globe, and the globe doesnâ€™t have to exist for the map to exist and to have the same expansion in space (&#x2F;longitude) with respect to time (&#x2F;latitude).<p>Also there may or may not be a Big Crunch&#x2F;south pole, this is all just a way to get into the nature of the geometry by way of a convenient frame of reference.')
