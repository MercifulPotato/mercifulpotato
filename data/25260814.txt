I&#x27;ve had to start reading labels a lot more after moving to the US, since some of the products I&#x27;ve used at home actually do have sugar added in the American version.<p>For example, this pasta sauce has sugar in the American version (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classico.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;00041129077023&#x2F;italian-sausage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classico.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;00041129077023&#x2F;italian-saus...</a>) but not the Canadian one (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kraftwhatscooking.ca&#x2F;brands&#x2F;classico&#x2F;product&#x2F;classico-di-basilicata-italian-sausage-peppers-onions-pasta-sauce-00057000330002?categoryid=20050001" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kraftwhatscooking.ca&#x2F;brands&#x2F;classico&#x2F;product&#x2F;cla...</a>). The funniest thing about it is that the Canadian version still says &quot;Product of USA&quot; on the jar, they just cut out the sugar for that market.<p>Some of the local foods in the US also have off the charts levels of sweetness, such as southern sweet tea and sweet potato casserole with marshmallows. Bread and pizzas also tend to be on the sweeter side in the US.')
