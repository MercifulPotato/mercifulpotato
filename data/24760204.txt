Most interviewers will <i>not</i> give any feedback because there’s no upside for the company and a strong chance of pissing the candidate off, making them feel they were treated unfairly or engendering resentment toward the company, or causing them to want to start negotiating or arguing, which is essentially wasted time. If you don’t believe me, start giving rejected candidates feedback and I think you’ll quickly see what I mean.<p>It’s not fair but that’s been my experience.')
