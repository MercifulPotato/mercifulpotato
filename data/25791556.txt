This is considered safer than having a hard to trigger mechanism and less user caution, because of greater chance of it failing to be triggered when needed. You could have some sort of complex signal sent that switches them, but it&#x27;d make the devices much more complex, and since they are very hard to service, and need to respond when triggered, they are designed to be simple. Users of these devices aren&#x27;t supposed to have phones near them anyway.')
