If you don&#x27;t, then you buy one: Apple sells them, everyone else sells them.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to talk about: I&#x27;ve thrown my last two included chargers in a box, where they languish next to my Lightning-cable-equipped EarPods. I&#x27;m unlikely to get a new phone in this cycle, but if I did, the difference would be two gizmos which I won&#x27;t use, won&#x27;t be included.')
