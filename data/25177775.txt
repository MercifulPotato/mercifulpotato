The constitution&#x27;s free speech protections are sufficient to grant companies the right to decline to publish whatever they choose to. Although the government can compel speech in certain specific circumstances -- think medical disclosures -- generally they cannot compel political speech. State laws cannot override the constitution in this regard.')
