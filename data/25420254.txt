There is more to development than minor performance benefits from a slightly faster processor.<p>Do you need to run VMs for your development? How about docker? Do you compile your binaries locally?<p>If you deploy your code to x86_64 systems, you&#x27;re most likely better off with an x86_64 machine. Even if you are developing for arm machines which are not M1 macs or iPhones or iPads, you are most likely better off with an x86_64 machine.')
