Helping utilities replace energy capacity lost to closures of coal fired power plants.\n\n   2. Providing power and heat to off-grid industrial projects such as mines and oilsands developments. \n\n   3. Replacing diesel fuel as a source of energy and heat in remote communities.\n</code></pre>\nThe size seems to fit between off-grid diesel and modern natural gas plants. Since it is unlikely to be cost competitive with natural gas in Canada, a fourth use case emerges: meet zero-emissions requirements in jurisdictions not suitable for wind and solar.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terrestrial_Energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terrestrial_Energy</a>')
