How does &quot;news&quot; work when most of the content creators go out of business? (Edit: Huh. I guess we already know, because that&#x27;s exactly what happened.)<p>Compare news to other OC, like books, music, video, podcasts, and apps.<p>Musicians get paid. Kinda. (I&#x27;m not smart enough to figure out if Apple&#x2F;Beats is some kind of label, meaning underwriting (?) OC.) And music videos definitely get ad revenue sharing (YouTube &amp; Vevo).<p>Book authors get paid. Kinda. Isn&#x27;t one of Amazon&#x27;s properties now an imprint, or publisher, or whatever that segment&#x27;s underwriters (?) called?<p>Video definitely gets paid. Streaming, snippets (Vine and now TikTok style), vlogging, sports, episodic TV, movies, miniseries (Netflix), etc. EVERYONE is paying for OC video. It&#x27;s a strategic differentiator.<p>Podcasters get paid. (Per power laws distribution.) Like video, EVERYONE is trying to get into the game, funding OC.<p>Ditto apps.<p>--<p>So why is &quot;news&quot; different?<p>If I was Apple, today, I&#x27;d set up some kind of huge trust with the sole purpose of funding any and all new &quot;journalism&quot; OC. No strings attached.<p>I&#x27;d open the flood gates for funding OC. Huge, big, and small. Copy every kind of philanthropic funding idea. Have a huge fund for traditional news organizations serving int&#x27;l, national, state, and local markets. Do whatever Corp for Public Broadcasting does for PBS. Dump money into other trusts funding OC, directly or thru partnerships. One off grants for indie bloggers and investigative reporters. Recurring funding for activism style journalism. I&#x27;d reinvent &quot;new bureaus&quot; to recreate &quot;embedded&quot; journalism, so reporters can get paid to cover city hall.<p>I&#x27;d create infrastructure for fund raising. So other listener supported media can more easily replicate the success of KEXP.<p>I&#x27;d figure out a &quot;startup school&quot; incubator so that wannabe working journalists and bloggers learn how to get paid. Music and film and writing communities have their own ecosystems of conventions, workshops, meetups. Fund the same for journalism.<p>And just like the new style purpose driven philanthropists, I&#x27;d have some kind of metrics. Internal and external. Rewarding both effort and successes. Imagine funding an arts critic, say someone(s) reporting on the ballet and dance community. Their victory conditions would be very different than someone reporting on current events.<p>Edit: Two more ideas: Endowments for schools of journalism. Create and fund more awards, prizes.<p>--<p>It&#x27;s painfully <i>unobvious</i> to me why journalism, reporting isn&#x27;t being funded. Google and Facebook benefit tremendously, economically, from OC.<p>Are these parasites worried they&#x27;ll kill their hosts?<p>Why suggest Apple? I dunno. Two reasons.<p>It just seems to me that they&#x27;d understand best how to benefit from PBS style shoutouts like &quot;This programing was made possible thru the generous support of Apple Community Trust and other supporters just like you.&quot;<p>And like privacy, their hands-off relationship with journalism OC would be a terrific &quot;brand laddering&quot; strategy that Facebook (Zuck) and Google (Page, Brin) are unable to replicate, because they are constitutionally incapable of ceding control. Seeing how Bezos seems to have managed Wash post, future Bezos may have something closer to enlightened altruism.<p>I can kinda imagine Jack Dorsey creating a trust for OC. His recent giving pledge org is impressive. But given Twitter&#x27;s continued schizophrenia, I just don&#x27;t think he has a compelling (reality based) thesis or worldview for journalism. And insert the cliche about asking someone who created the problem to then turnaround and fix the problem.<p>Bonus third reason: Maybe Apple would be better are coaxing journalists to optimize for Apple News. Something like WWDC for written OC.<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Reactions?')
