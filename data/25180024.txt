Really, really appreciate how many improvements are going to be attributed directly to you.<p>Second - sorry for the delayed responses. I&#x27;m working through emails &#x2F; messages &#x2F; comments and promise to get back to you - I just don&#x27;t want to rush through bugfixes and conversations, so it might take longer than I&#x27;d like.<p>Third - There have been a few reports of email verification breaking, and also of features not being fully enabled with Early Adopter subscriptions. This is my bad - the email verification flow didn&#x27;t take into account case-insensitivity. Should be fixed now (for anyone impacted, you should have a new verification link in your inbox). Features should also be enabled by EOD today - the complexity of feature-by-feature upgrades is coming back to bite me now.<p>Fourth - I&#x27;ve authored a couple more notes to answer questions that have popped up:<p>Bizdev strategy &#x2F; vision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karma.fm&#x2F;p&#x2F;SdjVjdj&#x2F;the-pmalerts-strategy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karma.fm&#x2F;p&#x2F;SdjVjdj&#x2F;the-pmalerts-strategy</a><p>How closely does PMAlerts listen?: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karma.fm&#x2F;p&#x2F;rk3HI4d&#x2F;how-closely-is-pmalerts-listening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.karma.fm&#x2F;p&#x2F;rk3HI4d&#x2F;how-closely-is-pmalerts-liste...</a><p>Thank you again,<p>- mick')
