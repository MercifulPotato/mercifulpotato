I can&#x27;t remember the last game I played that was Windows-exclusive.<p>To some, that&#x27;s not a relevant fact. Consider someone like me who plays only one game that&#x27;s only for Windows and consoles. It&#x27;s never been released on Linux and I had a terrible experience playing under Wine.<p>I got a KVM switch to play it on my secondary PC. I think there are a lot of people out there for whom one game or one app doesn&#x27;t work or only works poorly on Linux, and they keep a Windows PC or dual boot just for that.')
