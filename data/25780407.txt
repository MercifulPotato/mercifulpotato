Regulating how sites handle speech just adds an additional hurdle for new, better platforms to enter. I should not have to have an expensive lawyer on retainer to read injunction requests just for running a &lt;$2&#x2F;month IRC server because some random important&#x2F;popular people decided to use publish their manifesto on it.<p>This has already been tested in court in the Prager University vs Google, LLC [1] trial and was resolved very quickly. Freedom of speech does not mean another individual has to assist you in publishing or advertising your speech. You are free to shout from a soap box but no one has to provide you that soap box.<p>I really think people over emphasize the power that social media sites have. They own a lot of eyeball market share but they do not have the power to prevent you from publishing your opinions. Anyone can make their own website, their own Mastadon instance (see Gab if you want proof), their own Peertube instance, a lot of work is done by the open source community to make it easy to publish content not reliant on large corporations.')
