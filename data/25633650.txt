What I mean is that if they come across information that hurts their narrative, they won&#x27;t share it, while continuing to posture as honest investigators in search of the truth. And for the readers it&#x27;s hard to detect this fundamental dishonesty (how do you know what you haven&#x27;t been told?).<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that there are no conspiracies, and people aren&#x27;t justified in looking for explanations, but this mechanism of deceit is what makes it a controversial&#x2F;goofball topic.')
