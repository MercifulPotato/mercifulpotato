It’s exceptionally challenging for me because of my lack of knowledge in computer vision.<p>The particularly challenging thing is that in order for it to be usable in web, utilising GPU is essential, but I’ve never written any webgl code before. I tried a couple of things and finally got an interesting idea of using tensorflow. I found that tensorflowJS has a well written core API with webgl backend, and I finally coded a version on top of that. Nope, I’m not using it for machine learning! :)<p>I believe the library has reached to a state that could be valuable for anyone interested in web AR. I’m also looking for engineers&#x2F;researchers who would be interested to collaborate. I could definitely use some help in a lot of area.')
