They suck up attention, which is a scarce resource. It is just like you start a web browser to look up some documentation, and it shows a dozen of interesting sites you might want to read because the browser developers got some money from these sites, or whatever.<p>Good software typically has a sparse feeling (depending on which are its intended users), in the sense that it does not distract.<p>But this is just a symptom of a bigger issue that they are not really friendly to the developer.')
