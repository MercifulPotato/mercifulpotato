Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=[25482732], score=None, time=1608408845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480581, text='I don&#x27;t mean &quot;naively&quot; in the &quot;the author is neutral&quot; sense.<p>I mean that it is not framed like an encyclopedia or conventional investigative journalism print. It is framed as the story of the investigation. It isn&#x27;t &quot;<i>my conclusions after investigating this for 2 years</i>.&quot; This frames has a lot of room for shades of uncertainty than conventional ones.<p>In that sense, this is actually a better<p>Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t think she has any obligation to investigate terrorism in other religious communities at all. The editor might have an obligation similar to do that, depending on newsworthiness. But I don&#x27;t see how it applies here anyway. Once ISIS&#x2F;L established territory in Syria they became the most newsworthy topic of the decade. Ot&#x27;s normal that careers are made on the biggest story of a decade.<p>I&#x27;m not saying she has no biases. Journalists have biases. Political biases, biases to certain archetypal narratives, the importance or truth of their own story, etc. But, moreso than most, Caliphate did portray a detail rich picture. You can make your own judgements with facts she provides, even if they are different to hers. That&#x27;s honest journalism.<p>&gt;&gt;Her association with the NYT is also shameful, because she is more Fox News quality w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t balance<p>I guess this is the reason I wrote the comment originally. It&#x27;s disingenuous to portray this as a low watermark for NYT (or most other big newsorgs). There are many worse offences.<p>Since you are comparing to fox news and balance, I assume you are comparing to &quot;opinion reporting,&quot; and such. If we include that, then half the ship is under water. Opinion writing is outside of the journalistic standards allegedly violated here. But by layman standards, Callimachi is <i>far</i> more honest and balanced than any opinion at NYT... and obviously cable news stuff.')
