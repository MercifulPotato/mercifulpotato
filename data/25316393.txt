My example was copied from some code I&#x27;d written but looking at it again it&#x27;s more verbose than necessary.<p>Re: compile time vs runtime errors, it is a valid point.  In Scala (which I use in my day job) I will generally question any use of `case _ =&gt;` in a pattern match because of this, particularly because you don&#x27;t get the nice compiler error when someone (for example) adds a new type to a sealed trait hierarchy without making sure all business logic that touches that type handles the new case correctly.  I guess in C++ it feels painful for a non-expert like myself to get those types of compile time guarantees while functional languages like Scala (for example) make it easy.')
