Item(by='freetime2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608621009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25503101, text='&gt; One dangerous example being the distortion of the truth about COVID-19 spread in the run up to the Olympics. I expect the same over the next few months.<p>Can you give an example? I read a lot of speculation on the internet that there was some conspiracy by the Japanese government to conceal the extent of covid infections prior to the Olympics, but have yet to see any concrete evidence.<p>In fact, I would give Japan pretty high marks for their handling of pandemic thus far. They rank 140 in world currently in deaths per 1M population [1] (meaning 139 countries have suffered more deaths), despite taking a fairly soft stance toward lock downs. And in my opinion the government has done a good job delivering clear and consistent messaging about the number of new infections, what actions they are taking to prevent the spread of the virus, what types of things residents should avoid doing, etc. [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;</a><p>[2] NHK Covid page (in Japanese, but translates reasonably well in Chrome) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;special&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;special&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;</a>')
