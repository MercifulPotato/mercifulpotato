I’d like to think I could be persuaded otherwise, but the arguments I heard in favor of AB5 or no on 22 didn’t seem that strong.<p>The sense I got from friends voting no was it was mostly driven by anti-Uber motivated reasoning without much thought about existing incentives and unexpected negative consequences.<p>The sense I took away from reading about AB5 was that it’s a push to get drivers marked as employees so the teamsters could unionize them and collect fees.<p>Basically a political battle behind the scenes is the real fight and this other stuff is just confusing the issue.<p>In that context Yes on 22 seemed like a good option.')
