Indoor weddings, funerals, and other big events have contributed too. While people wear masks (badly) outdoors and in shops, I think the root cause is bars, clubs, shebeens, etc. The government is also reluctant to introduce a new lockdown for fear of the damage to the economy.<p>I’ve just come from the UK, and while rules were less strict for a while, and people weren’t wearing masks as much, I’m less certain if people were social distancing. We certainly were in preparation for travel, but I imagine schools, college holidays, etc contributed just as much as any variant.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timeslive.co.za&#x2F;news&#x2F;south-africa&#x2F;2020-12-08-1300-gauteng-teens-urged-to-quarantine-after-attending-kzn-matric-rage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timeslive.co.za&#x2F;news&#x2F;south-africa&#x2F;2020-12-08-130...</a>')
