Lex is not an electrical engineer.<p>I know people actively working in the AI&#x2F;ML field who don&#x27;t even have a B.A.&#x2F;B.S. - they&#x27;re literally self-taught from watching YouTube videos; reading books, textbooks, articles; and listening to podcasts. And after all, wasn&#x27;t that supposed to be the ultimate end-goal of all this high technology we&#x27;ve created for ourselves? To smash the Ivory Tower? To democratize knowledge for anyone who&#x27;s willing to pursue it? These people don&#x27;t understand the finer points of programming and they damn sure don&#x27;t understand the finer points of CPU design... why should they? You have <i>finite time</i> in your day, and every hour you spend understanding the intricacies of one thing, that&#x27;s an hour you&#x27;ve lost to understanding something else.<p>The promise of the Internet was supposed to be something to interconnect humanity so we could share amongst each other. Well part of that promise is relying on the expertise of others to help us, instead of having to acquire that expertise for ourselves.')
