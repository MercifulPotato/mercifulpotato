Take the Uigher issue, it is ALWAYS reported with a lack of context.<p>No mention of the bombings, the mass killing events, the huge domestic terrorism issue it has caused China for the last 20 years. Instead we just get reports of China &quot;randomly&quot; persecuting these people for seemingly no reason.<p>When you have people showing up at one of the largest train stations[0] in the country openly representing an ethnic minority and randomly stabbing men, woman and children of Han decent... what is the correct government response?<p>This isn&#x27;t even the debate that we have. We don&#x27;t ask this question at all, we instead publish photos of prisons, and reeducation camps, but no one ever seems to ask &quot;Why is china doing this?&quot; because the assumption that Western Media would like you to make is &quot;Because they are just evil communists&quot;.<p>It would be like reporting on Guantanamo as an &quot;off shore prison where America kidnaps people from foreign countries and keeps them there for no reason, most have never even been the the US&quot; --- There would be uproar if news was reported that way. But when it&#x27;s China, everyone is happy to have their blinders on, and not understand or explore the full context of a difficult issue.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;88941&#x2F;not-again-knife-attack-at-train-station-in-southern-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;88941&#x2F;not-again-knife-attack-at-train-stati...</a>')
