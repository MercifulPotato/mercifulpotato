The anthropomorphism is used to argue that companies should be allowed to harvest data on a massive scale, because you can not reasonably expect your neighbor not to look out of the window. I find that ridiculous and reject the argument. It also paints a romanticized picture that makes people emphasize with an abstract inhumane entity as if its brand was a person within ones social circle, and that is biased by design. That can be seen when i try to explain the data harvest by some such corporations within the limits of the analogy: my counter example requires metaphors you find absurd and which you describe as &quot;tin foil hatty&quot;, because they don&#x27;t normally happen outside in villages - yet you probably have an extension in your browser that blocks trackers, know how those work and know perfectly well what i reference with the trenchcoat wearing agents of adtech.<p>&gt; most people do understand that and they simply don&#x27;t care<p>That&#x27;s the thing: if they are well informed, of the appropriate age, and give consent, that is fine by me. But in my opinion the relationship between the mega-corporations and the people is one sided and abusive, so such careless consent isn&#x27;t worth much. Imagine a village and i say to you &quot;hey that farmer is beating his wife&quot;, would you say &quot;well that is how they do things here, most farmers are beating their spouses, and they don&#x27;t seem to care&quot;? There is something wrong with that village. But i think the corporations as people analogy is overused. For most data farmers the users are more like cattle, not spouses or neighbors. This asymmetry can be seen with other freedoms as well: many people don&#x27;t read contracts anymore, leave alone know about the freedom of contract. They simply have accepted that the corporations give them one and they sign that unread. After all, what alternatives exist to <i>&lt;monopolised proprietary technology everyone uses&gt;</i>?<p>&gt; What realistic future do you see where that <i>[unregulated data farming]</i> comes back to bite them<p>A change of society away from &quot;Liberal Democratic Capitalism&quot; to &quot;Totalitarian Surveillance Capitalism&quot; enabled by mega-corporations abusing their position as gatekeepers for social communication, capitalist markets and even government services.')
