Any hrowser has PDF viewing, .zip support is already there (since Win2000), it has basic image manipulation and text editing, screenshot editor, and i think even desktop-recording. Sure, none of these things is a “best in class” app, but that’s normal (and leaves market space for developers). Anything beyond that is not “basic” and I wouldn’t expect it on MacOS either.')
