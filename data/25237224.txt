And arguagbly the standard is just as much a problem as an advantage (look at all the very useful extensions in clang and gcc which will never make it into the standard, and the C standard libary is still essentially a snapshot of what was already the least common denominator in 1989, and far from the &quot;state of the art&quot; even back then).<p>As long as a language only has a single implementation or &quot;reference compiler&quot; (like Rust), standardization only adds needless bureaucratic overhead.')
