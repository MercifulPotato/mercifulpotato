That means the USA is the government with the most influence on Amazon to have taps placed or connection logs handed over.<p>I&#x27;m not an networking guy but can you explain this more? I&#x27;m actually curious and what better place to get actual info than HN? If you have a sealed sender then shouldn&#x27;t this be impossible? Shouldn&#x27;t the size of the message be sealed as well and when the message is received you&#x27;d see that 1) it is signed by a different key and 2) the message size doesn&#x27;t match? Shouldn&#x27;t this be rejected? 3) Shouldn&#x27;t this also apply to any app because traffic is going to bounce through some US based (or US company owned) server? My understanding is that sending data from San Francisco to Berkeley can route through Seattle or Tokyo depending on optimal routing, server configurations, and loads.<p>&gt; Other than, say, your real-life-identity-tied user ID of course.<p>This is why I&#x27;m excited for the usernames.
