Or you&#x27;re on an unsupported platform and all code is interpretted.<p>Because it&#x27;s all or nothing, testing the OTP release should uncover any JIT bugs; you won&#x27;t have the hard to track bugs sometimes seen in other systems where a function&#x27;s correctness depends on whether or not it was JITed and that depends on runtime state. That won&#x27;t mean no JIT bugs, of course, but they should be easier to track down.')
