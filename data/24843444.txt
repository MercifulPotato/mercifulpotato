Different neighborhoods get different phases, so they&#x27;re roughly balanced loads.<p>Industrial (and some consumer) users get two (208V) or three phases (480V), and they get power from the difference between the phases (for their higher-voltage loads).<p>Now, if you&#x27;ve ever looked at an oven or a dryer (in North America at least), you&#x27;ll know that they are higher voltage, and look like they are two-phase... But it&#x27;s really more like one phase that&#x27;s been mirrored.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice diagram:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electronics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;146420&#x2F;obtaining-240v-from-480v-3-phase" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electronics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;146420&#x2F;obtai...</a>')
