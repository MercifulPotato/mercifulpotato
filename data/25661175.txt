I&#x27;d implore you to do a multi-month to year trial of no downvotes on comments - I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll piss off those who like to think they&#x27;re right at half-or-less attention and regularly downvote click for that sweet sweet dopamine - and ironically those who normally downvote may actually comment their grievances&#x2F;complain that there aren&#x27;t downvotes.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to pick a fight, though I&#x27;m really curious how you see these truths I explained above? Having downvotes seems to support a lower quality, less discussion, and less requirement for attention - which seems contrary to what you seem to be working towards?')
