Cole (Snake Diet guy), had an interesting comment&#x2F;hypothesis, when your exercise is intense you burn sugar (easily accessible). Your body senses that it needs a lot of energy (fight or flight scenario)and this leaves you craving to replace that energy that you burned (sugar).<p>When you do a low impact cardio exercise (walking below 4 MPH), your body doesn&#x27;t want to burn that sugar you have, saving it for an emergency (flight&#x2F;fight). It sees you have all this fat and determines that your energy burn rate can be sufficiently supplied by burning it. So it ends up using fat instead of sugar. Maybe burning through this fat (walking long walks) and not burning through your sugar reserve, remodels appetite hormones (Leptin).<p><i>Leptin is secreted mainly by white adipose tissue, and levels are positively correlated with the amount of body fat</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2829242&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2829242&#x2F;</a><p>The trick is keep it low impact, slow walking, for 2 or more hours a day. Combined with short 48 hour fasts and a 2500 Kcal re-feed day, it&#x27;s a game changer.')
