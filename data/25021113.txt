BLM protests are probably biggest event in US political scene since Tea Party . That said, I am not sure, they are bigger than civil rights movement or Vietnam war protests. They are more visible due to social media. Thankfully, they seem less widespread though.<p>Even this is nothing new. The &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s saw widespread political protest and violence in America. Think the Weather Underground bombings. Political violence settled down around the Reagan administration in a brief lull (probably in exuberance&#x2F;realignment from the end of the Cold War), but seems to be flaring up again.')
