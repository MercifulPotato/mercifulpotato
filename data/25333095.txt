Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25333732], score=None, time=1607355196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332101, text='I really like Tailwind but has anyone figured out how to get it to run quickly in development with Webpack?<p>For example Tailwind 2.0 out of the box produces around 3.5mb of CSS and Webpack 5+ on an SSD takes 5+ seconds to start things up. This is a problem with Docker because if your main app container needs to be restart it involves stopping Docker Compose and then upping things. This means your app is delayed 5+ seconds from starting. In production it&#x27;s no problem with purge CSS and your build step producing the final assets out of band, but I think having a top notch dev experience is really important.<p>You can do some hacks around how Tailwind imports its fils to make CSS updates happen nearly instantly but the initial Webpack start up time still suffers.<p>Currently I get around this by enabling Webpack&#x27;s filesystem cache but this seems like a band-aid solution.<p>Any suggestions?<p>On a non-SSD machine I noticed the start up time being 28 seconds btw. It&#x27;s a non-issue for me but if you want to make open source projects that others use, a ~30 second start up penalty in development is a killer for a pretty large chunk of people.')
