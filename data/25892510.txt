But, it also means more work, and you might as well update your distro if you go down that path. I&#x27;m reluctant to build &amp; ship my own python for a very simple reason: you then take on the role&amp;responsibilities of the distribution maintainers. I&#x27;ve taken over these roles in the past, and I recognize that this is hard, thankless work.
