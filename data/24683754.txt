The success of electric vehicles makes the calculus less good, but it&#x27;s just another term in the equation for a company doing business in F1. Honda are still in other ICE motorsports.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth pointing out that Honda staying this long was a surprise in itself because, to be blunt, they were absolutely awful in their first years and no better than their rivals now.<p>Also, the issue for a battery powered racing series isn&#x27;t really efficiency at the moment but actually just being able to actually do the race distance at an acceptable speed. If they could make Formula E cars go fast enough they&#x27;d have already switched, or at least put pen to paper.')
