Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610642578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778254, text='&gt;  Okay, compare this to the ratio of recreational knife use (including kitchens) to violent knife use and you&#x27;ll see why guns are a problem.<p>In the US, stabbings are the second most common cause of murders after shootings, and a higher incident of assaults.  In the UK, stabbings are significantly more common than shootings, to the point they are establishing very similar regulations around knife purchase and possession.<p>An honest look at the data on violence would indicate two things:<p>1. Violent behavior and the tool used are disconnected.  E.g. People with an intention to be violent will act violent regardless of which tools are available.<p>2. When someone is violent they&#x27;ll use the most efficient tool available.  E.g. Once someone has made a decision to act out violently they&#x27;ll identify and use the best tool available to carry out their violence.<p>In effect, there are two ways to approach violence in society.  You can try to reduce the number of available tools to carry out violence so people are restricted to their bare hands (note strangulations and beatings just barely trail stabbing in the US as a cause of murder).  Or you can address the social issues that result in people acting violently at all, to reduce the incidence of violence and violence-adjacent behaviors in society.<p>Levering #2 is easier but less impactful, Levering #1 is harder, but has much wider positive impacts.<p>No matter what you do, violence will never be entirely eliminated.<p>I think assessing the data honestly and coming to the conclusion &quot;guns are a problem&quot; is either a result of bias or naivete, because it&#x27;s not a logical conclusion following from the available data, either US-centric or globally.')
