They&#x27;re performing lewd acts for strangers on the internet. Nobody is seizing control of their sexuality, just expressing supreme disappointment and disgust at their reckless, perversive choices therein. Don&#x27;t you dare suggest that I do not have the moral high ground over literal prostitutes.<p>2) Don&#x27;t be facetious.<p>3) I&#x27;m not even quite sure what your point is here. Is a man &quot;in the passenger seat&quot; if he&#x27;s seeking a nice woman? I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re implying. At some point, these women are going to want to settle down- yet their trove of online pornography will make it very very difficult to attract a good man. Their &quot;purity&quot; has absolutely been tarnished. Nobody wants a hooker tucking their kids in at night.<p>I could go on. Pull your head out. It&#x27;s unconscionable to facilitate a social collapse where impressionable young women are perverted for the sexual and sadistic satisfactions of strange men.')
