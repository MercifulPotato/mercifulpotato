I don&#x27;t wish to call anybody stupid. I&#x27;m offering the OP an alternative approach, on the assumption that they&#x27;re asking because they&#x27;ve tried and failed to find that meaning themselves.<p>Any approach that gets you up and out of bed in the morning is a good approach. I&#x27;d prefer that it be one that also helps other people get up and out of bed, and I think under most circumstances, those two goals coincide. There are circumstances where they don&#x27;t, as you outline, and I&#x27;m not sure how to advise people in that state. I&#x27;ve found that their mental states are such that they end up asking completely different questions.<p>The one caution I&#x27;d give -- and I apologize that I&#x27;m probably reading incorrectly between your lines -- is that if your meaning of life incorporates requiring me to accept your meaning of life, then it may not be working as well for you as you believe. There are other ways to struggle through life and my only concern is to find one that works for each person.')
