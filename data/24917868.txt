Of course, the humble lobster, jellyfish and hydra [2] (along with other animals) don&#x27;t seem to undergo senescence but IMO the jury is still out on whether hominids are biologically amenable to such feats of genetic engineering.<p>The other question besides whether such a thing is possible is whether it is desirable. Depending on one&#x27;s viewpoint, one could look at immortal humans as a cosmic cancer. At least the cycle of death and birth limits the harm a bad actor can do. What would you do if your least favorite fascist were also immortal and invulnerable? And I do mean that somewhat rhetorically. It&#x27;s a messy ethical subject to think about, personally. I kinda prefer life and death.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hayflick_limit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hayflick_limit</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Biological_immortality#Organisms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Biological_immortality#Organis...</a>')
