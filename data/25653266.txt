I have no idea if it&#x27;s pricing is competitive with other ways of doing this. A big selling point in using FBA in the first place is that&#x27;s what Amazon.com customers want. Without that big piece in the equation it might not be worth it to use Amazon&#x27;s fulfillment centers, at least not at whatever price they&#x27;re charging.')
