When I was a student, Oregon State had one campus.  They still have their main campus but a major second campus almost 3 hours away by car.<p>Also, they have had a growing online presence.  The three &quot;campuses&quot; are basically treated the same as far as being admitted, scheduling, etc.<p>Arizona State is another public school that has a huge online presence.  I would think that those schools were better suited for the current environment because so many of the staff and instructors are already doing online courses or supporting it.<p>Articles over the summer said that being on campus was going to feel like being in a minimum security prison or a monastery.   She&#x27;s not excited about being home but she didn&#x27;t think it would be great on campus.')
