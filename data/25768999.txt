Item(by='jandrese', descendants=None, kids=[25769144], score=None, time=1610577708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765736, text='16GB DDR4 2400 DIMMs run about $67 retail.  So about 1&#x2F;10 of the total cost of that board.  It&#x27;s a little apples and oranges, but since it seems like they just plucked down the same 8 chips you&#x27;d find on a DIMM right to the board maybe not that much.<p>I note that it has a PCIe x8 slot, but they don&#x27;t have drivers for a video card (or any card) yet so it&#x27;s kinda useless.')
