But it&#x27;s a great option for those who value users&#x27; experience (fastest possible content load time, no font loading reflow, etc) over maintaining some nebulous notion of a consistent brand image through fonts on content&#x2F;UI. The former tangibly benefits users, while the latter only (marginally) benefits the company&#x2F;brand (99.9% of your users couldn&#x27;t care less what font you used as long as it&#x27;s not horribly out of place or ugly).<p>I would go as far as to say say this is the right tradeoff for most product&#x2F;brands where your primary product&#x2F;service isn&#x27;t text-based (books, articles, other publications).<p>And if your layout is brittle enough to need pixel-perfect control over font dimensions, that&#x27;s something better addressed through a more dynamic layout since it will also become a maintenance nightmare, as that&#x27;s basically the antithesis to a responsive layout.')
