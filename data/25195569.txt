Consider a guitar: excluding the two thinnest strings, each string is tuned exactly 5 semitones up from the last. Each fret is one half-step up. Guitar players don&#x27;t get lost!<p>&gt; You seem to think that making the keyboard more symmetrical, or more uniform, or different somehow, makes it easier to learn.<p>Yes, and for good reason. It means the student can skip learning 11&#x2F;12ths of the required muscle memory. That&#x27;s a very significant, and very measurable gain.<p>&gt; The field of music and music instrument technology is alive and well and waiting for your invention.<p>That remains to be seen. In fact, the very article we are discussing shows how difficult it is to make the world-changing introduction of <i>a piano with slightly smaller keys</i>.<p>&gt; Also, altered dominants and the various minor modes, in addition to the major scale modes I mentioned. Yes that adds up to probably 300 or 400 scales. Which takes a lot of work, regardless of whether you have a standard keyboard or a WWWWWWWWWWWW keyboard.<p>And then you multiply that 400 by <i>twelve</i>, and you learn just how much muscle memory is required to play the piano.<p>Since you seem to think this is such an impossible task, note that it has already been accomplished: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cK4REjqGc9w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cK4REjqGc9w</a><p>The only way Janko&#x27;s keyboard is not fundamentally superior is that it isn&#x27;t widely available.')
