When a company or companies get large enough that they monopolize a niche, when they apply arbitrary restrictions, said restrictions can be challenged in court.<p>If Uber prevents people from working from them who disagree with a certain party, people can sue them and argue that it isn&#x27;t a justified restriction. Preventing people from working who don&#x27;t pass a background check is justified, because it protects the safety of customers (assuming the background check doesn&#x27;t unfairly weed out certain groups).<p>Whatever restrictions are required &#x2F; allowed &#x2F; banned is up to society as a whole. Probably we would generally err on the side of allowing things, because we like freedom, but ban anything which most agree is illegal, immoral, or dangerous.')
