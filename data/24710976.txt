For HTTP traffic (as distinct from other upgraded protocols like WebSocket) HTTP&#x2F;2 is mostly better for users than HTTP&#x2F;1.1, but TCP head-of-line blocking is its one particularly serious problem. For users, I would characterise HTTP&#x2F;3 as generally just the best of both worlds, and once you have it there there’s no reason at all for HTTP&#x2F;2.<p>HTTP&#x2F;1.1 will remain popular indefinitely for compatibility with older servers and clients that aren’t being updated to the latest stuff, and for HTTP upgrading mechanisms.')
