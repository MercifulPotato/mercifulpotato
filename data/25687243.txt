QCOM got into hot water for engaging in a pretty abusive licensing model. Here are a couple of examples:<p>If you wanted to use one QCOM patent, you&#x27;d have to pay for a suite of patents that includes IP you have no interest in using.<p>If you want to use a particular technology, the pricing would depend on the total price of your handset -- even if the difference in handset price has nothing to do with the Qualcomm technology.<p>Their business is tough because they basically spend years inventing technologies and then more years licensing them and defending their IP in court. Still, if you have to draw a moral&#x2F;ethical conclusion I&#x27;d suggest that (at least in part) Qualcomm brought its 2016 Apple woes upon itself.')
