We have multiple mid-level (experience expected) software development engineering roles open. We work on cutting edge tech that helps games and simulations run on AWS and scale in ways they couldn&#x27;t alone. I am looking for people with distributed service development (we do most of this in Java), and game engine&#x2F;game dev experience (preferred Unreal). We&#x27;re building an all new AWS service, solving hard technical problems, and we get to have games as a customer, which is pretty awesome to me.<p>Links: (service focused SDE role) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.jobs&#x2F;en&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1365397&#x2F;software-development-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.jobs&#x2F;en&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1365397&#x2F;software-development...</a>, (game engine role) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.jobs&#x2F;en&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1365399&#x2F;software-development-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.jobs&#x2F;en&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1365399&#x2F;software-development...</a>')
