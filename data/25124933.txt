That probably means several specialized robots (packing dirt for a foundation, deploying construction pieces, a crane) as well as some general robots for when things do go off script (haul away a broken robot, right a fallen pylon, remove debris).<p>Does this feel like something achievable in the next decade or two? Are there large pieces we&#x27;re missing?')
