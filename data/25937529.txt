Options and short selling are perfectly normal market instruments that have far ranging utility, including both hedging securities and insurance on tangible goods (e.g. a pork farmer buying puts on pork to ensure he can sell his product at a specific price).<p>Neither is it &quot;radical&quot; in <i>any</i> type of market. It just means selling something you don&#x27;t actually have yet (something you&#x27;re &quot;short&quot;). Think of a middleman who sources classic cars. He contractually agrees to sell a 1991 Ferrari for $60k. He doesn&#x27;t yet own the vehicle, but knows he can source them for $50k. Unfortunately for him, a recently popular meme has gassed the price of Ferraris, and he now has to pay $70k for the car. He&#x27;s still obligated to sell at $60k, so he begrudgingly takes delivery and loses $10k, having &quot;sold short&quot; the car. Is he revolutionary or radical?')
