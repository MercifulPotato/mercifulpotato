This is necessary to avoid evaluating the arguments in the road-not-taken, without fexprs, and I daresay that would be a distraction at the moment.<p>It&#x27;s also embodied in actual machine words. The actual verbiage of &quot;if a then b else c&quot; is clearly less important, C elides the &quot;then&quot; after all.<p>I&#x27;m presuming you mean the construct, not the happenstance of how it&#x27;s spelled out, because you&#x27;re clearly referring to <i>the electron</i>, not the word for amber-the-stone which we happened to adopt for it.')
