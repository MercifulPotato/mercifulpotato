But then again, imagine if you just judged people by how nice they actually were, not by what their face looked like? Imagine if you were evaluated by the merits of your mind, of you, not the &#x27;flawed&#x27; representation of you (your face) given to you by your DNA?<p>I&#x27;ve been helped enormously in almost every area of my life by the way I look and how I&#x27;m able to present myself physically. Much of that is because of my DNA -- something I didn&#x27;t work for or ask for. It was given to me for free. Likewise, others are deprived through no fault of their own. Of course, that&#x27;s the way it is. I like being attractive and having attractive friends and romantic partners. But what if it didn&#x27;t matter? Would my life be richer?')
