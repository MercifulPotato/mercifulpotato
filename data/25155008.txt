If you&#x27;re doing calculus, solving some integral, you end up doing a bunch of addition and multiplication along the way.  That&#x27;s not the part you&#x27;re trying to learn, which is my pointâ€”by having your arithmetic down pat, you can focus on the important things, rather then having to think about the low level details at all.')
