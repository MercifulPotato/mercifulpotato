Item(by='tolmasky', descendants=None, kids=[25836673, 25841789], score=None, time=1611077834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834523, text='I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, but bizarre (entitled?) expectations. A natural part of Open Source is that someone may come in and make way more money off of something than you do. In fact, Amazon makes way more money off of Linux than Linus ever did. But you don&#x27;t even have to go that far, many completely unrelated YC companies made way more money off of Linux than Linus did, and could arguably have not pulled that off without Linux being a free OS that you don&#x27;t even have to <i>think about</i> since it&#x27;s so ingrained in hosting. But when the <i>intent</i> of Open Source is &quot;to increase the quality of software around the world&quot;, this is considered a <i>good result</i>. However, when the <i>intent</i> of Open Source is some nebulous initial hyper-growth to then hope you can offer hosting, the expectations just aren&#x27;t set correctly. Unfortunately, the open source strategy does not magically offer the right result based on the <i>intent</i> of the author.<p>If Linus all of a sudden woke up tomorrow and said &quot;Hey, I just realized that I&#x27;m not being paid a cut by literally every single company in Silicon Valley, that is <i>NOT OK</i>, I am going to shift gears and remove non-contributor code and start releasing Linux as closed source from now on&quot;, I feel people would be less forgiving than they are to these <i>much less impactful companies</i>. But Linus would be as &quot;right&quot; as they are, arguably more so.<p>Many of these companies are simply learning that maybe all those &quot;dinosaurs&quot; of the 90s might have been onto something with commercial licensing, which ultimately seems to be what they actually want: to <i>charge</i> money for their software. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t get you free contributions and ready-made communities, but it gets you money, which is what a company is supposed to do. And that&#x27;s fine! It&#x27;s just not Open Source.')
