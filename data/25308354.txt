A bunch of perpetually angry people on Twitter are angry. So what? Google&#x27;s actual operations are affected not only tiny bit by this episode. Outrage has no power.<p>Social media is not real life. Every company, Google included, needs to simply ignore social media outrage and focus on their mission instead.<p>Internet outrage only has power because companies give it power. Angry words and hit pieces from biased media do nothing on their own. If you don&#x27;t let them make you afraid, you have no reason to be afraid of them. The internet screamed at Coinbase after the company showed their internal activists the door, but Coinbase is doing just fine. See? Nothing to be afraid of. Just get rid of troublemakers.')
