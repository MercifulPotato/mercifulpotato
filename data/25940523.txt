The consequences range from turning households into spam drones, to placing at-risk folks in physical peril through commoditised surveillance.<p>It remains an extraordinarily privileged and wonderful thing to live without fear of the capabilities of a corporate- or state-level actor.  What’s not so wonderful is being reminded that many folks with this privilege lack the self-awareness to appreciate it.')
