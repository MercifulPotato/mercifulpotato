It always seemed strangely artificial and out of place... and also off-putting in the sense that they seemed to be indicating they would look down on people that didn&#x27;t go to an ivy league school or something.  It seemed like a handshake where you get assessed for your social standing in every new interaction.  There&#x27;s definitely plenty of social stratification on the West Coast too, but it seemed more implicit rather than explicit.  I suppose the process is a natural one and you could make an argument for either way of going about it, but the East Coast style of it always rubbed me the wrong way.<p>Frankly though, I can&#x27;t stand a lot of the attitudes from the SF&#x2F;SV area either.  There&#x27;s a lot of self-righteousness and self-signed certificates of moral authority in that crowd.  I&#x27;m not a fan.  People are allowed to see the world differently, and for most of the things I believe are right, I won&#x27;t pretend to be so certain of my the moral absoluteness of my beliefs to insist anyone who disagrees is inherently less intelligent, wrong, or beneath me but that seems to be the status quo in the Bay.')
