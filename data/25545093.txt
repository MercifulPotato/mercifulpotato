It is not as if China  would let IP rights stop them from developing the CPU they think is best. Does RISC-V actually have an advantage other than the fact that is is open source? With the ton of existing software that is either x86 or ARM it would be easier from a backwards compatibility point of view to go with one of those. Would  Europe or the US really get into an all out trade war with China over CPU instruction sets?')
