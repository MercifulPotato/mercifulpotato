Thinking about all of the sciences, computer science is still very much on the leading edge. There seems to be a lot of area left to explore with regard to applying algorithms correctly and devising entirely new ones.<p>For instance, the splay tree is arguably one of the more incredible data structures in all of computer science, and we didn&#x27;t discover it until 1985. Think about all the undiscovered applications that may exist out there regarding such an algorithm. Contrast with how long mathematicians have had to play around with the ideas of Newton, et. al.<p>Another fun data structure is the skip list. This is probably the simplest probabilistic data structure you could hope to invent, and we didn&#x27;t figure it out until 1989. 4 years <i>after</i> the splay tree. To me, this says &quot;keep looking&quot;.')
