Its too long term, too risky, and you lose to much to the tragedy of the commons. All but the most trivial and mechanical research mostly happens due to government funding, or as a prestige byproduct of higher education (ie, not directly driven by their profit objectives). So in this case, maybe there is demand in a social sense, not a market sense.<p>Alternatively, large computer science companies may have just greased enough pockets to create regulatory capture of the process, creating the inequality in a non market driven way.')
