Haven&#x27;t had a single issue. I&#x27;m probably the exception that proves the rule though. I&#x27;ve found that most of the time it&#x27;s not a linux &#x2F; kernel issue, it&#x27;s a udev or config issue. If you write &#x27;mem&#x27; to the right file in &#x2F;proc or &#x2F;sys (I forget which) they just go to sleep. Any acpi event will wake them back up. I&#x27;ve done this with all sorts of custom kernel configurations on older chromebooks and cheap chinese laptops. Never had an issue. Sleeping to memory works great. Sleeping to disk or &#x27;hybernate&#x27; is another story though. You need swap properly configured for that and it&#x27;s finicky.')
