Its (command line) user interface is a mess. I could say more about what you would do to make a better version but a comment isn&#x27;t the place for that.<p>The defence that you are using - that smart people should be able to learn git fully - is like saying that any and every smart programmer should learn IC design and buy their own electron microscope, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s OK that the chips keep breaking.')
