This is also one of the paths out of debt for MDs that don&#x27;t want to practice or MD&#x2F;PhDs in general. With a few people that actually know the science&#x2F;art, you can then focus on the finance and other issues.<p>The science part isn&#x27;t always hardcore mol-bio, as many devices can be a bit more like traditional engineering (even internal ones). But many of the problems that the various agencies will cite will be mol-bio related. Even as a hardcore investor, unless you have the many years of background, or can get people with background to put their own money in it, you are going to have a hard time. Paying just for consulting isn&#x27;t likely to be appropriate due-diligence. Biology is monstrously complex and frustrating even in one individual, let alone a population. As such, it takes a <i>lot</i> of research to have a good clue of what is going on, more so that you can likely pay consultants for.<p>EDIT: Again, I want to stress that every situation is different and that I am only relating my personal experiences here.')
