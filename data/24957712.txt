(As a legal realist, I think we should evaluate law like any other human activity; licenses that lead to outcomes that we want are good, licenses that lead to outcomes that we don&#x27;t want are bad). But I think using a license that granted permission to do the things you actually wanted people to do and a pledge not to sue for the things you want to not sue for would communicate your intentions more clearly. I, at least, assume that when someone uses a license that grants me permission to do something (such as falsely claim authorship of their code), they approve of me doing that thing, because that&#x27;s what people granting permission in a license normally mean by that grant of permission.')
