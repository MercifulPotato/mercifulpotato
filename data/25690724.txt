They don&#x27;t need to solve this by keeping the variable real at every step. What they need to do is to ensure the final solutions are real. Which means they need to solve it in the complex domain entirely and then filter out non-real solutions at the end. The only place that would run into trouble is where the imaginary components are small but nonzero, where you&#x27;d just expect it to use some tolerance threshold as the cutoff, but that obviously isn&#x27;t the case here (hence my comment).')
