Much cheaper in mass&#x2F;payload&#x2F;$$$ to simply deorbit and burn up for a lot of low earth orbit satellites.  Or even &quot;free&quot; - a lot of these satellite megaconstellations will be brought down by atmospheric drag within a year of running out of fuel:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Graveyard_orbit#Disposal_orbit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Graveyard_orbit#Disposal_orbit</a><p>This also provides some passive decluttering of low earth orbit in case of hardware failures and the like.<p>Such self destruct programs (or manual commands from a ground station) are common for farther out orbits like geostationary, although they typically just enter a slightly different orbit where they&#x27;re out of the way and not taking up valuable real estate in particularly useful orbits, instead of escaping earth&#x27;s gravity or deorbiting completely.')
