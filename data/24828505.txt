Really it&#x27;s no harder than preventing SQL injection. All I do is that I don&#x27;t use APIs that can lead to interpreting data as code.<p>So I assign to textContent liberally, don&#x27;t manipulate URLs as text, but via browser APIs, and avoid everything that allows code execution. It&#x27;s really stupid simple to follow safe practices for absolute majority of apps.<p>And this makes writing a electron app with direct access to local PostgreSQL database trivial, fun, and makes writing useful apps without a separate HTTP backend a breeze.<p>I don&#x27;t have a need to split privileged code out to separate process, and go back to acting like there&#x27;s trusted&#x2F;untrusted split, just like with regular website. Having to do that would kill all the allure of Electron, for me. I use electron precisely because I don&#x27;t have to do this, and can depend on the HTML&#x2F;JS code to be trusted.')
