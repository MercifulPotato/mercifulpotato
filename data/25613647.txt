A steak + veggies and I&#x27;m satiated and alert for hours. Similar calorie content with beans or other vegetable sources and I&#x27;m hungrier sooner and often feel sluggish&#x2F;de-energised. I also don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the increased mass and volume of food I need to eat if I exclude meat from my diet.<p>Still, I think there&#x27;s an element of balance here. If I eat beef too many days on the trot I don&#x27;t end up feeling so great either. The key thing is to keep it mixed up with a good variety of veggies, meat, and carbs[0].<p><i>[0] I will say that overly processed carbs like pasta, pizza base, etc., and even things like rice tend to leave me hungry, sluggish and irritable if I have too much of them. Potatoes seem to cause fewer issues.</i>')
