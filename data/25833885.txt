If none of your therapists offered you tools to help you get out of a web of thoughts that you suffer under, that is on them. Of course, if it is your own choice then it is on you :)<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, what you&#x27;re talking about just isn&#x27;t my experience at all. Perhaps it is your perception, and how that impacts the world around you (both what you see and how people respond to you). It&#x27;s really no different than reading about a car and seeing that car in traffic a hundred times. You see what you focus on - in this case you&#x27;re focusing on whatever it is you&#x27;re seeing here and therefore you see it everywhere. That doesn&#x27;t make it true.')
