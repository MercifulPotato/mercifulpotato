I got VMWare, installed Linux, tuned my LaTeX environment and never looked back.<p>I&#x27;m sure that all the problems are resolved by now but, my workflow is mature now and everything is working flawlessly. Considering I&#x27;m going to need Linux anyway, did no efforts to move my LaTeX workflow back to macOS again.<p>Since the code I&#x27;m developing is going to be used in a lot places, I&#x27;d rather develop it in two distinct environments and run tests on each. Also, I like to experiment with different development tools on different environments. Experimenting and experiencing each environment broadens my horizon. Also it&#x27;s more enjoyable IMHO.<p>Didn&#x27;t play with Macports TBH. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to use it but, will take a look to it.<p>Another thing is, I don&#x27;t customize&#x2F;change my terminals much. When you manage 1000+ servers with a team, customizing each terminal to your liking is not feasible so, I can work pretty fast with stock bash or anything. I&#x27;m old school and don&#x27;t like flashy console setups anyway. :D')
