Whenever I search for anything I immediately get thrown a ton of shopping websites in my face as if my default mindset is &quot;buy more crap&quot;. Google has more and more turned into &quot;where to buy&quot; instead of &quot;where to find information&quot;.\nSearching for information on &quot;Vienna&quot;? Here are 200+ hotels you can book! It&#x27;s like a game how to formulate your queries to avoid the most annoying results.<p>Pinterest is a cancer in the Google search results. I hate having to surgically add 10 different pinterest exclusion terms (from various countries) to my search query.<p>I wonder when a hybrid &quot;wikipedia-of-search&quot; solution arises.<p>I&#x27;m envisioning distributed clusters of specialized indexes for various topics. For example some enthusiasts crawl and curate tonnes of cooking websites, others technical and what have you not. Anyone with somewhat beefy servers can then make a search engine by subscribing to these indexes (bittorrent-like manner?) and pick and choose what they want included.\nA whole ecosystem of information indexing would pop up and we&#x27;d see blocklists (AdBlock of search) and craplists. I&#x27;m sure Pinterest would end up on one or two of those lists.')
