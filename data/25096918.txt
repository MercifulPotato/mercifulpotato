What about the rest of us who aren&#x27;t really looking to those people for any kind of framework? Part of the whole &quot;thinking there&#x27;s a grand narrative&quot; that caused me anxiety was trying to model after all of these &quot;successful&quot; people, what they were doing, and realizing I wasn&#x27;t any happier for it.<p>Lately, what&#x27;s brought me a lot of calm wasn&#x27;t the chase of an &quot;end state&quot; (so to speak) but more optimizing my path. That, personally, and only speaking personally has been INFINITELY more rewarding.<p>If that&#x27;s the &quot;it&quot; factor, then so be it ;)')
