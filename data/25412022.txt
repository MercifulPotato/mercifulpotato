And while we&#x27;re all acting conciliatory now, it&#x27;s pretty remarkable how biased the post was, the author using some clearly erroneous numbers to prove their prior, baseless claim that the &quot;M1 chip is far inferior&quot; in some respects, when those respects were specifically SIMD. Then becoming strangely defensive when some people rightly pointed out that ARM64 has 128-bit NEON and a number of other advantages.<p>Far inferior becomes....actually superior in many cases, even at SIMD.')
