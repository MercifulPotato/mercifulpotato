Item(by='ufmace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603726195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873935, text='QAnon is consistently claimed to be &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;violent&quot;. The only justification for this is the guy who went into Comet Ping Pong with a rifle in search of a supposed basement dungeon. But Comet Ping Pong is a Pizzagate thing, which is a different theory than QAnon.<p>Pizzagate is based off of people taking deep dives into the leaked DNC emails and trying to follow up on some suspicious looking things. Just the kind of people who would be up for doing their own investigation into Comet Ping Pong.<p>QAnon is based off of people obsessively following and examining every detail of the posts of the pseudonymous Q on 8chan&#x2F;8kun. A key part of QAnon ideology is that everything is already happening according to &quot;the plan&quot;, so there is nothing for individual followers to do. Some of the most anti-Q people I know believe that it&#x27;s some kind of psy-op to convince people to do nothing in the face of massive corruption because everything is actually under control.<p>Also worth remembering is that the CPP guy didn&#x27;t actually hurt anyone. He scared the crap out of a few people, then was peacefully arrested.<p>So linking QAnon to violence is extremely dubious at best. If anything, the opposite is more true. So why does everybody just push those talking points endlessly and nobody publishes anything skeptical of it? Why is it so incredibly dangerous that we must bust out all the stops against it? This very post is talking about trying to do a hostile purchase of the IP addresses their host uses - who ever heard of the need to do that?!? We don&#x27;t even do that for ISIS, Al-Quada, etc.<p>Meanwhile, Antifa and BLM are rioting and burning down cities across the nation, but nobody dares to even publish that, much less start to question their ideology and intentions. Perish the thought of even trying to investigate their links to the mainstream media, basically every major corporation, and Democrat party.')
