These are just tools, they provide choice.<p>There is a need to package closed source software, to provide dependencies. Some people use outdated distributions, that&#x27;s root cause. If distribution is switching I&#x27;d better search like minded and help with maintaining (or it would be systemd scenario).<p>At least there is application. Everyone is free to make native. There is Void (Linux), runit [1], at least on Arch Linux there is big choice [2]. Fork Gnome, KDE 3 forked as Trinity Desktop Environment [3]. Boot to xmonad — 100MB RAM, Chromium — several GB RAM.<p>It is easy to imagine arguments against — Steam builds distribution platform on top of Linux, no packages there, Wayland vs X11, distributions spread resources, maintainers breaks software. I am not Steam user, I am not Ubuntu user, but I benefit from wider community.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voidlinux.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voidlinux.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;init" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;init</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trinitydesktop.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trinitydesktop.org&#x2F;</a>')
