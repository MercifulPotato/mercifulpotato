Item(by='josephcsible', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606006671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25165553, text='&gt; I can imagine that there are players who are OK with that collateral damage. In the end it will end up exactly like when the cloud providers disabled TLS domain fronting.<p>The problem with domain fronting was that it could be blocked by blocking the chosen &quot;front&quot; domain, which bad actors were often willing to do. In this new era of eSNI, they&#x27;d have to block all of CloudFlare, which would be a lot harder sell even for an entity like China.<p>&gt; It won&#x27;t. The big DoH providers will have nice behavioral data, on computer level, i.e. NAT is no longer a problem, they can distinguish separate device due to TLS session.<p>&gt; Privacy-wise, it is net negative. Few big companies will be getting data they didn&#x27;t have until now.<p>I trust CloudFlare more than my ISP with my privacy, and if you don&#x27;t, then you can pick another DoH server that you do trust.<p>&gt; It has problems with DNS zones that only some resolvers can resolve, and&#x2F;or are under ACLs so only local clients can resolve them. Your local network knows about them, the global ones don&#x27;t.<p>Firefox will fall back to the local resolver for domains that fail to resolve with DoH.<p>&gt; It has problems with split-horizon names. So now, instead of getting internal IP for a service, you will be getting external one, so your traffic will go to router and back.<p>With managed clients, you&#x27;d push out configuration to exempt the internal names from DoH. And what&#x27;s the use case for split-horizon DNS with unmanaged clients? I&#x27;ve never seen that.<p>&gt; It has privacy implications that you didn&#x27;t even began to think about.<p>Like what?')
