It&#x27;s a letter to the editor that includes a case report.<p>It&#x27;s odd to me that anyone would mistake it for a study, actually, seeing as it says &quot;Letter to the Editor&quot; right at the top and has no gross morphological features in common with a research paper. No one seems to be trying to represent it as something it makes no pretense of being, except for people who seem to want to discount it without any significant consideration. That&#x27;s an odd correlation to observe, but there is a lot that&#x27;s odd about how people have reacted to this pandemic, I suppose.')
