If anything, it would actually increase their liability: the whole point of DMCA 512 is to provide a process by which an ISP can disclaim liability for contributory copyright infringement.<p>If they refuse the request on the grounds of &quot;you can&#x27;t DMCA a circumvention tool&quot;, then they&#x27;re still liable regardless of if a DMCA 512 takedown can or can&#x27;t apply to a 1201 violation, since there&#x27;s still an underlying tort of distributing a 1201 circumvention tool. If they accept the request, and get sued anyway, they could at least argue that they have a safe harbor (or should have a safe harbor).')
