Even if you&#x27;re fairly accessing the value of your house (and good luck doing this as a normal person), a rich person can buy it anyway and force you to move.  They can do this over and over if they want.<p>Actually, it would be a good deal for landlords.  They buy the house then offer to let the people rent it back.  No need to deal with flaky tenants, these would be people in their family home.  Would be a good place to park money from overseas that you&#x27;re trying to hide too, solves the problem of the empty downtown condos because people hiding money don&#x27;t really want to be landlords.<p>This is one of those systems economists think up that would be perfectly efficient so long as nobody is an asshole or irrational.  About as useful as a horse race modeled as a set of identical spheres in perfect harmonic motion.')
