In an effort to explain rather than talk down, and knowing no more than I do from the comment ...<p>The popular vote is not a criteria for the winner&#x2F;loser of an election - never has been here - instead its a component to a larger outcome.<p>The US has about 327M people and by the nature of our geography they tend to be somewhat more concentrated around coastal areas. Big cities, small farms so to speak.<p>The reason for the existence of the Electoral College is specifically to prevent any one region&#x2F;geographic faction of the country from asserting control of the nation via the popular vote.<p>The lack of respect for the popular vote is no accident. Its a feature, not a bug. &quot;Every vote counts&quot; is absolutely untrue in the US and thats by design.<p>The evils brought about by counting each vote towards an election are thought to be outweighed by the evils of allowing one regional&#x2F;socio-economic faction of the population dictate the government for all by virtue of their popular vote capability.<p>Now lets get real - this is precisely what happens anyhow despite the Electoral College - the battle lines are not regional in nature but economic&#x2F;religious&#x2F;cultural. One foreseen evil has been prevented while allowing another situation to thrive. Both sides play this divide and attempt to sway things their own direction.<p>America has been subdivided into two groups - &quot;Us&quot; and &quot;Them&quot;. Things aren&#x27;t going to get better anytime soon.')
