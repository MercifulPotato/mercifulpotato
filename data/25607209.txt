If anything I&#x27;d imagine it could become more efficient as more transactions were taking place. I see people argue this a lot and I think it&#x27;s too narrow of a view on the situation.<p>Of course it&#x27;d be much better for us to adopt a crypto currency that uses a different algorithm that has even less energy usage. Even without that though I think it could prove to be more efficient than existing financial systems.')
