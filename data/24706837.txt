What I mean is, when dealing with measurements, the result of 2.1 * 2.12345 isn&#x27;t 4.459245, because the result exceeds the precision of the first factor. I&#x27;d like a common API that handles this, whether implicitly (through notation) or explicitly (through requiring you to state the precision of every number you use).')
