Legacy industry examples would include whole life insurance, title insurance, payday lending, and whatever it was that &quot;Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credibility Corp&quot; was selling (not the historical D&amp;B) a few years back.<p>I consider it enough of a pattern of &quot;bad money chases out good&quot; that I identify it regularly among pitches I receive.')
