Not a single autopilot can do more than keep the vehicle going in the direction you set (using a knob). Autonomous features are not called autopilot anywhere, ever.<p>&#x27;Full self driving capability&#x27; is a capability, not a feature that you can turn on - it is there so you don&#x27;t need to replace the hardware when the autopilot software can be replaced with fully autonomous driving software.<p>Edit: Downvoters, please explain. It is not okay to redefine words for your purposes.')
