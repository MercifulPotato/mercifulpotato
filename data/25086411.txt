In general, Ubuntu just works without much configuration on the user&#x27;s end.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a trend where people who are new to Linux will jump on Arch because they believe it&#x27;ll give them more power, or that they&#x27;ll learn more by using it. Or people will install Kali because they think it is what hackers use, and completely miss the fact that Kali isn&#x27;t meant to be installed at all.<p>It&#x27;s all Linux under the hood, and you get the same amount of power no matter which distro you use. And when you use a distro with sane defaults like Ubuntu, you&#x27;re able to dig into the internals whenever it suits you, and not because an update broke your computer.')
