Fisher’s writing may resonate with those who came of age in the thick of capitalist realism, and who, unlike Fisher’s generation, have no memory of social democracy, precisely because it theorises a loss they can’t remember or measure, but which they’ve nevertheless inherited.<p>This kind of reminds me of a concept I recall from <i>The Great Transformation</i> by Polanyi: that introduction of the modern market to societies elicited quite a bit of opposition from the first generations that experienced it, since they understood what they were losing because they remembered it.  Later generations couldn&#x27;t muster the same energy because they didn&#x27;t know the loss.')
