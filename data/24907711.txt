For all I care he may write his book without introducing determinants or only introducing them at the very end. I&#x27;m all for different pedagogical approaches.<p>But he writes a paper called &quot;down with determinants&quot; and starts it with &quot;if you think complex matrices have an eigenvalue because the characteristic polynomial has a root, then this is wrong&quot;. But it&#x27;s not wrong, mathematically it&#x27;s 100% correct! It&#x27;s just his own personal opinion because he somehow doesn&#x27;t like determinants.<p>Mathematics is all about different approaches and different tools, not about &quot;the one true enlightened way&quot;, as he makes it out to be. This is why I&#x27;m calling it a &quot;personal crusade&quot;. Had he just called his paper &quot;a determinant-free approach to linear algebra&quot; I would take no issue.')
