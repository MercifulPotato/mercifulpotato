Optimizing to 1&#x2F;100 the time (reducing requests from say 1.5 sec to 15ms) is like adding 99 servers.<p>This cannot be correct.  If you optimize 1&#x2F;10, and then optimize to 1&#x2F;10 again, that&#x27;s the same as optimizing to 1&#x2F;100.  Does this &quot;add&quot; 18 servers or 99?<p>If you optimize to 1&#x2F;10, then your cluster can handle 10x the load, which is the same effect you would get by simply having 10x the number of servers (assuming your app is perfectly parallelizable).<p>The article&#x27;s quote is only correct if the &quot;cluster&quot; starts as just a single machine.')
