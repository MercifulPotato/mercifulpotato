I don&#x27;t buy the speculative growth of these companies. You&#x27;re telling me these companies are collectively going to go from a P&#x2F;E of 38 to say, a P&#x2F;E of 80? I doubt it. Oh, and all of them have colossal amounts of debt.<p>Most valuations I see today aren&#x27;t even justified on a FCF basis! And certainly not for someone looking to buy 20% below fair value.<p>Of the companies that I can think of that are closer to fair value, their market shares are being eroded by competitors, or their earnings growths are less than attractive.')
