That is, is there a new source code package on hydra when one of the dependencies changes? Or does it only change if the package itself changes?<p>Also, they are only available when hydra builds the package anyways, right? So if some package is not built by hydra (like how it used to be for the texlive packages), it&#x27;ll still download the sources from the various places they are hosted.<p>As for the hash, it&#x27;s good that the source code is hashed, but my main concern was that it was downloading from external sources in the first place. This is bad for privacy, as those hosts know I&#x27;m downloading from them, as well as for reliability, because the hosts might not have as good uptime as a debian package mirror.')
