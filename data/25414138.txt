I seem to see a lot of the same titles for different searches. Non-fiction books are also more difficult to read than fiction; so these types of books tend to be a big time investment (a lot of them feel like extended essays).<p>There are a couple of books I&#x27;ve read in the past few years that I actually didn&#x27;t fully agree with. Sometimes they were badly sourced or made some arguments I didn&#x27;t think were sound, but there was also a ton of interesting and good material in them; which I think made some good points. Based on that, I guess my recommendations for breaking bubbles would be:<p>&quot;The Strange Death of Europe&quot; (Murray, Davies, et al.)<p>&quot;The War Against Boys&quot; (Sommers)<p>&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (Ryand)')
