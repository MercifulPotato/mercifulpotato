People like me, who have long been wanting to better understand the (obviously sprawling) concepts involved will be able to use the article as a good entry point.<p>That said, the expressed hope of consolidation in the field is likely still some way off. AI has taken over a lot of the promise that the Semantic Web originally held. But AFAICS there are two drivers (also mentioned in the article) that potentially could provide the required impetus for a reignited interest in the Semantic Web:<p>Firstly the need for explainable AI, and secondly the probable(?) coming breakthrough in natural language processing and automatic knowledge graph or ontologies from text.<p>All in all, it seems way too early to write off the Semantic Web field at this point.')
