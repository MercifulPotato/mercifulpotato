When can a researcher positively conclude confirmed harm? \nIn humans, that could take a lifetime, maybe two. \nOther animals must also be studied, but doing that can be much more difficult and resource intensive. Here thinking about marine life primarily.\nPoint being, everything thus far learned points to harm in the long term. Long term studies have only begun in the last 10-20years I believe, and could be that we will be waiting for further still')
