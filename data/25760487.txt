E.g. if CNN&#x2F;Fox&#x2F;BBC publishes something fake on their website, as a publisher they will be legally liable to what they publish. If a user on facebook posts something similar then facebook wont get in trouble because they are not regarded as the publishers. It was created to help boost social media site momentum during the Obama administration.<p>Now recently since facebook&#x2F;twitter have been moving into becoming the arbiters of what is true and not which makes them publishers.<p>From a fairness point of view, why should these social media sites benefit from section 230 while traditional media doesn&#x27;t?<p>EDIT: Added legality')
