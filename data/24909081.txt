His arguments essentially come down to two things:<p>1. LiDAR is expensive - this makes sense from his perspective because he has already declared all Tesla cars on the road are capable of “full” self driving with their current hardware. If he walks back on his, he would have to retrofit a million cars.<p>2. Humans can drive with just vision, so why can’t computers? This is a naive argument because human vision isn’t just vision, it’s linked to a ridiculous intelligence in the form of human brain. And computers are nowhere close to replicating it.<p>If you want to read more on LiDAR’s importance, read some of Brad Templeton’s writings.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.templetons.com&#x2F;brad&#x2F;robocars&#x2F;cameras-lasers.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.templetons.com&#x2F;brad&#x2F;robocars&#x2F;cameras-lasers.html</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;bradtempleton&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;elon-musks-war-on-lidar-who-is-right-and-why-do-they-think-that&#x2F;#3fbad5c2a3bd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;bradtempleton&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;elon-m...</a>')
