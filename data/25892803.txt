It was very basic code and everyone basically solved the same problem. Everyone else&#x27;s code didn&#x27;t work on my machine because print is not a statement in Python 3.<p>That&#x27;s just plain stupid. Just print a warning and add a python2 flag that hides the warning. Don&#x27;t release a major version because of something trivial like this.')
