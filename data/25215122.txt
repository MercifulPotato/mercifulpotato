What you don&#x27;t know is this.<p>Right, one language might have anythingBut(&quot; &quot;).endofline() and the next language might have a different . operator like anythingBut(&quot; &quot;)-&gt;endofline() or it might even require nesting calls. None of these things are a significant hurdle and if we standardize the names (endofline, anythingBut, ...) then you can make the same argument. It&#x27;s a chicken and egg argument: just use regex because that works everywhere -&gt; it&#x27;s not universally implemented -&gt; it won&#x27;t work everywhere.<p>And aside from that, I have a similar experience to the sibling comment: when using some command line tool that I forgot (is it sed? Vim?) the default is that \\( is a capture group whereas in normal regex ( is a capture group. Grep offers you three regex variants to choose from. I have to look up regex syntax or do trial and error every time I don&#x27;t use a language that I use daily. And I don&#x27;t know all of regex to begin with, I just know everything I ever needed but people posted examples here with (?:x) which I don&#x27;t know. I once read it and remembered it for a few days I think... so anyway, consistent and descriptive method names seems a lot easier especially when you consider autocompleting IDEs.')
