Parler does remove calls for violence when they are reported.<p>I used to use Parler before the ban and I don&#x27;t remembering seeing any calls for violence. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t exist because to be fair I wouldn&#x27;t of been in those circles anyway, but it seemed quite tame in contrast to what I see from the average person I follow on Twitter where I regularly see people posting violent Tweets about Trump, his supporters, and even tweets supportive of the violent protests we saw earlier in the year. It&#x27;s only been in recent weeks that those calling for violence throughout 2020 are finally denouncing violence.<p>Everyone who is acting like Parler was this really radical place just didn&#x27;t use it IMO. I think people are clearly right when they say this about platforms Bitchute and some of the Reddit alternatives, but as far as I could tell the content on Parler was just like every other social network, just a little more conservative leaning.<p>If Apple is that concerned they should ban the Saidit app where there is Jewish conspiracies and far-right content everywhere. I strongly suspect they&#x27;re lying to you when they say it was because of a lack of moderation. Just like how Twitter allows Richard Spencer to remain on their platform while claiming Trump has gone too far. Evidence would suggest they don&#x27;t target extremism, they target popular conservative commenters and platforms.')
