They are have a lot of standard components. You can take any Linux boot USB and boot almost any PC with it and at least get a console if nothing else.<p>A PlayStation 4 is x86_64 but is NOT a PC. Watch the Fail0ver video on their PS4 kernel port to understand how different it is.<p>ARM is a god damn clusterfuck of random pins soldered to random shit and every Android kernel patched to hell in non-upstreamable ways. Look at all the work PostmarketOS has to do in order to get mainline Linux to work on all the random ARM e-waste out there.<p>DeviceTree is a joke. Microsoft at least forces ARM+UEFI, but they have locked bootloaders and even though people have found exploits to unlock them, there&#x27;s virtually no reversed engineered drivers. All those hundreds of thousands of Lumina phones? Now they&#x27;re e-waste. Worthless.<p>Linux grew because IBM created the PC. Compaq reversed engineered the BIOS and everyone started making compatibles. Over time, BIOS and later UEFI became solid standards.<p>ARM may be fast, but the non-standard Basic Input&#x2F;Output and device detection makes it nothing but potential e-waste.')
