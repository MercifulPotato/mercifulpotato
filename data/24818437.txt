They&#x27;re considerate but moving around on old floors with thin walls makes noise. Keeping a box fan on when I go to sleep and leaving it on all night means that I can tune out the noise of them being normal humans before I fall asleep and when they wake up earlier than me.<p>Are there any solutions that can account for noise on a varied schedule?')
