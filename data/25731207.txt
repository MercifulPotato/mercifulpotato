Did you manufacture those boxes yourself, from the silicon up?  If you didn&#x27;t, you better hope you don&#x27;t get blacklisted by parts suppliers.<p>&gt;<i>You cannot change your race by &quot;doing it yourself&quot;.</i><p>The analogy is: if she didn&#x27;t like being denied because of her race, she should have started her own busline.<p>Of course, we have laws in place that say you <i>can&#x27;t</i> deny someone service based on race.  That&#x27;s great, and solves that problem.<p>So tell me what law Parler broke?  Has it been proven in court?  Or did a private company decide that on their own?  Why should they have that power?<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not naive; I understand what Parler is&#x2F;was trying to do, and it&#x27;s gross.  But the process shouldn&#x27;t be arbitrary, at the whims of liability protected pseudo-monopolies.')
