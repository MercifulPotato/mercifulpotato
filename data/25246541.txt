I don&#x27;t have as many installs as you currently but It&#x27;s not far off and I want to add more compile time settings to them.  I&#x27;d need to setup a full build server&#x2F;system though because I need to regularly update them with new modules.<p>How opposed would you be to this being reworked to being able to be mainline kernel support too?')
