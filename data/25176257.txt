You could do this with anything:<p>&quot;Everyone has a God (where &#x27;God&#x27; means &#x27;favourite thing&#x27;)&quot;<p>&quot;Everyone believes in the existence of Hell (where &#x27;hell&#x27; means &#x27;being unhappy&#x27;)&quot;<p>&quot;Everyone believes in the possibility of &quot;salvation&quot; (where &#x27;salvation&#x27; means &#x27;self-improvement&#x27;)&quot;<p>Redefining words so that the original sentence is correct is a tad too &quot;charitable&quot;, particularly when the new definition is completely at odds with how everyone uses the word.')
