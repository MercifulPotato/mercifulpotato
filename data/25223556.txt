The real use cases aren&#x27;t as sexy as the articles but they are incredibly valuable and utilitarian.<p>The problem already exists at scale today in many, many companies that everyone has heard of. Mitigating and working around this has been a large part of what I do for many years. If such a platform came into existence today, dozens of companies would <i>each</i> happily spend tens of millions per year to use it tomorrow; they are all ready lighting similar amounts of money on fire in this area on infrastructure that doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The business challenge is that the engineering effort required to build such a platform is simply too large to easily fund, even inside large tech companies. There is no appetite for that scale of investment in infrastructure software anymore, everyone kind of waits around for something to show up in open source that they can re-purpose. Less risk and less cost. In this particular case, that is unlikely to happen for the foreseeable future, someone will need to make a real investment.')
