Are you the current maintainer also, or the current developer?<p>This is what capitalism looks like, folks. Someone &quot;built it&quot; so they now privately &quot;own it&quot;, no matter how big it gets. It&#x27;s not put into the hands of an organization. The profit motive is quite strong, which is why someone can be &quot;corrupted&quot; by very tempting messages like this. If you had a lake or a forest privately owned by one or two people, and they had a lot of debts, they could easily sell it to polluters and loggers.<p>Some people scoff and say &quot;socialism has been tried, it never works.&quot; I admit that socialism simply trades one class of elites (the capitalists with a lot of shares) for another (the bureaucrats with a lot of political clout). BUT! I would like to say that <i>socialism is not the only alternative</i>. The other alternative is <i>decentralized systems with no private ownership</i>. I&#x27;m talking about science, open source software, and so on. There can be a Merkle tree of version updates (e.g. git version control) and each one can have various reputable organizations (like Zagat for software) building their reputation vetting it. Then, each community would run their own app store (think Wordpress plugins) which would work with these reputable organizations. There would be no heroes, no celebrities, no tweets at 3 am to 5 million people, no pulling from repos without peer review, no scientists instantly believed after publishing on arxiv.org .<p>Congratulations for building a popular extension, fancy_pantser. You live in a world where you it&#x27;s really bad to &quot;criticize the profit&quot;, and where building it means you are responsible for it no matter how big it gets, but then we are all depending on your integrity and ability to rebuff life-changing amounts of money to <i>not</i> mine our data. We can pass laws to punish people after the fact, or we can gradually change our culture by rejecting &quot;immediate gratification&quot; of updates that are not vetted, just as corporations have done with bleeding edge vs stable Linux distros etc. Unfortunately, the Web has made it so that anything can be updated at any time, with no sysadmins or reviewers in the loop. It&#x27;s a wonder more malware isn&#x27;t silently everywhere already.')
