That&#x27;s hardly a crazy salary either.  It&#x27;s still a substantial discount over what a lot of technology companies pay, and likely inline with what most mid-level managers at banks and insurance companies earn already.<p>But COBOL jobs don&#x27;t pay anywhere near that kind of coin, and they likely never will in my lifetime.  The systems in place are solid enough that they can survive the resolving door of shitty, underpaid contractors who are hired to work on them.  Nothing every improves, but it also never gets worse.')
