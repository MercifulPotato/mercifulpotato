How can the ads be personally targetted <i>without</i> that data collection and sharing?<p>I have no objection to adverts relevant to what I&#x27;m doing right now. Adverts for DB related books, cloud services, other techie things, etc... while looking at a database related article? Fine. Following me around other bits of my life, not fine.<p>I don&#x27;t mind a waiter trying to upsell me a bottle of wine while I&#x27;m ordering a meal in a restaurant. I would object if the waiter followed me home, via the supermarket to watch what I was buying there, and knocked on the door to suggest I buy a drink from him while I was cooking dinner.')
