It&#x27;s not a problem created by some Python dogma. It&#x27;s a fundamental issue affecting all languages, even those that don&#x27;t have a catchy slogan for it. In Rust and C you also need to &quot;try first, ask forgiveness later&quot;.<p>For example, you can never be sure whether you can open a file until you actually open the file and it doesn&#x27;t fail. If you tried to check if the file exists and has correct permissions before opening it, you&#x27;d have possibility of a race condition. So the correct approach is to try the operation head first and handle the failure, instead of trying to somehow gracefully avoid creating an &quot;exceptional&quot; situation.')
