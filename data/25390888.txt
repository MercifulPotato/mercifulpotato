And now the reduction target for the next decade was increased to 41% ( the math is (1-0.24)*(1-0.41) = 1-0.55). In other words, in a single decade a more ambitious reduction target that the initial target for 4 decades. And starting from a much lower base (i.e. all the low hanging fruits were picked already).<p>This is indeed bold. Is it impossible? I hope not. But I&#x27;d like to see the feasibility study to see what the concrete steps are to achieve this target.')
