You can waste it or you can power bitcoin. This could be arbitrary big numbers in terms of KWh, but the opportunity cost and carbon footprint would be zero.<p>Since bitcoin mining is so perfectly competitive, it will be done where the cost of energy is lowest, which is zero for the most places - where energy would be otherwise wasted. And since other consumers pay considerably more than zero, they&#x27;d get oil&#x2F;gas&#x2F;coal delivered to them instead of wasting them on bitcoin miners.')
