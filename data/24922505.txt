Krebs has a story about trying to kill 8chan right now.  Gab had its payment processing suspended, etc.<p>Now, right now, it&#x27;s hard to blame platforms for wanting to get rid of Nazis.  Nobody wants a Nazi on their front lawn.<p>But in the long term, having capitalist oligarchs with control over most of the public&#x27;s ability to communicate with each other does not seem like a good plan.<p>The people who lead the companies won&#x27;t be there forever and in the future, one of the leaders with all the control over what people can and cannot say may be a Nazi or perhaps someone in power will convert to one.<p>I&#x27;d like to believe that&#x27;s unthinkable, but not thinking about things like this doesn&#x27;t seem like a very solid plan.  Maybe we should limit how much power and control any one media agency can have over public discourse.  And yes, the government&#x27;s power over that should also be limited.')
