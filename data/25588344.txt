They genuinely get to work for competing services and pick their own hours.  Uber and Lyft are the hammer used to smash people fighting for workers in industries where they&#x27;re only contractors on paper. Where they aren&#x27;t allowed to pick their hours or work for another employer in the same field. &quot;Make everybody we can a contract worker&quot; is a cancer eating the blue collar economy alive.  Hair stylists, nail techs, estheticians, massage therapists, painters, plumber&#x27;s assistants, etc are all suffering immensely. There are buildings with a set 8-4 schedule with hundreds of people in them of which only three managers count as employees.')
