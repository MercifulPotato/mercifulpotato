The UK signed first, is paying more and included a provision preventing the export of British-manufactured doses. The EU didn&#x27;t. The EU also added a provision mandating AstraZeneca make no profit prior to 1 July 2021 (the end of the Pandemic Period), a counter-incentive to ramping up production.<p>It&#x27;s not fair. But neither is the UK and EU getting wildly more doses per capita than Africa, South America or Oceania.')
