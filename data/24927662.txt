Good enough for government work, but the operating principle is the same even for private organizations. Put a process in place, sprinkle some pretty words around to get people to agree that this undoubtedly good and just and will not be abused, and the people who are better at politics than you are will leverage that process to unjust means, and your best hope is that you’re not the one in the line of fire.')
