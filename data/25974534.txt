I.e. if you&#x27;re going to do it daily, why not edibles? (If you&#x27;re in a state that allows that.)<p>Somewhat related -- I used to drink a ton, and though I don&#x27;t think I was an alcoholic, drinking was part of my life and was terrible for my mood and my weight. I&#x27;d get very drunk 2-3 times a week, and the other days I&#x27;d drink 3-4 IPAs after work, or get a six pack of really strong beer on the way home from work. Lots of drinking alone. One day I saw a coworker in the checkout line at a store after work, and all I was buying was a bottle of wine. I felt really ashamed, which is a huge red flag. Gave it up &quot;for a month,&quot; which turned into two months, and now 6.5 years without any. I do vape&#x2F;edibles&#x2F;mints, but it has nowhere _near_ the allure that alcohol had, and I&#x27;ll go 6 months without it, then a few days in a row, then another irregular pause, etc.<p>Still have dreams that I&#x27;m in some bar drinking, and in the dream I&#x27;ll think, &quot;I just drink one or two, then stop.&quot; It&#x27;s so relieving waking up!')
