The saying &quot;armed society is polite society&quot; is absolutely true, at least when it comes to the interaction between arms and western social ethics. Obviously your results may vary in the Congo or Chicago or whatever.<p>Even if we accept the (most likely contextually false) premise that reducing firearms access for non-criminals also meaningfully reduces firearms access for criminals, I do not have any preference (ceteris paribus) between getting shot, stabbed, or having my head bashed in. In fact, I might prefer getting shot.<p>In the more realistic case where criminal firearm attainability is less than perfectly correlated with non-criminal firearm attainability, it makes sense for non-criminals to be armed as well.<p>There&#x27;s also the MAD dynamic; people are less likely to physically escalate if there is a possibility of a high-severity response.<p>&gt; itâ€™s a cheap solution<p>A murder charge for an unjustified shooting is hardly &quot;cheap&quot;.')
