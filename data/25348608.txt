That is an EOL kernel. Almost all versions of the software bundled with RHEL 6 have been EOL from upstream providers during it&#x27;s ten year lifetime. Of cause you&#x27;re free to try to attempt to applied any patches yourself, you don&#x27;t have to pay.<p>If RedHat promised to keep CentOS 8 around for 9 more years, then yes, that is very disappointing. It was a stupid promise to make in the first place, but still disappointing.')
