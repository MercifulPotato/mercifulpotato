Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25606427], score=None, time=1609528175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605131, text='LeetCode could be a good source for code for this.<p>Pick some interesting problems from there, and <i>without</i> asking the candidate to actually code a solution, discuss the problems with the candidate. Ask for ideas on how to approach the problem, and suggest some yourself if at any time they appear to be getting stuck.<p>After they, possibly with guidance from you, have reached an approach that if correctly implemented would solve the problem, including meeting time and space requirements, discuss what issues might arise in actually implementing it, such as edge cases that might require special handling. This would be a good place to talk about how they would go about testing an implementation.<p>Finally, go to the discussion on LeetCode for that problem. There you will find various solutions posted by others. What I have found looking at those is that a lot of them don&#x27;t meet the time&#x2F;space requirements, or miss edge cases, or sometimes are just wrong. Go over a few of these with the candidate and have them criticize them for you.')
