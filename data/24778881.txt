Sure, BASIC was limited in the syntactic sugar that was available to manage program complexity but, then again, the microcomputers of the era were so limited that complexity wasn&#x27;t really possible without dropping to machine language anyway.  And machine language definitely didn&#x27;t have any of the syntactic sugar of ALGOL 60 or other high-level languagess.')
