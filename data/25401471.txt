So a lot of the people trying to start them are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of interest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of earnestness.

People have gotten rich on completely idiotic ideas, whereas people pursuing interesting ideas for their own sake have lived poor lives.<p>A lot of the people forming startups to get rich are actually pretty smart and have plenty of ideas they could chase for their own sake, while becoming poor in the process.<p>&quot;I wanna get rich&quot; is honest, which is close cousin of earnest.<p>To get rich, it does have to have an interest in a particular problem domain for its own sake: the domain of how to get people to part with their money, in your favor.
