But lets say your indexing is super good and matches the compressed version: 80TiB. Throw that in EBS, and you&#x27;re paying $6k&#x2F;month just to store it. You also need CPU, and memory to actually compute from that data though! If we instead use i3 metal instances, you&#x27;re looking at about $2700&#x2F;month each, and you&#x27;ll need 15 of them for 3x replication. $40k per month isn&#x27;t bad, if you&#x27;re a startup with VC funding. But... we also need network egress... All this just to be literally the common denominator search engine with zero users.<p>So, how do your users get to you? In 2020, you have three major sources: browser searches, phone searches and direct traffic. If you want to be in the browsers, you&#x27;re going to have to pay, and if you want to be default you must pay more than the incumbents who have their business model figured out. And bid at scales of roughly your Series B and C combined. Phone OSes, same deal: you need to be prepared to bid high, and in volume. Direct traffic is basically word of mouth &#x2F; marketing driven, and for our common crawl search, we can assume is relatively nil. So even search traffic has an acquisition cost, and almost all of the sources run their own search engine that you would need to bid against.<p>So this point you need to start thinking about revenue, because every query you get literally costs you money. We know that search engine ads work okay, since the user is clearly expressing intent. But those different users have very different values -- someone searching from an iPhone or MacBook Pro is likely more valuable to advertisers than a 10 year old Linux laptop running Firefox with Adblock and a Pi-Hole DNS server. And without traffic nobody&#x27;s going to bother running campaigns on your platform.<p>Alternative revenue strategies seem unlikely to work -- Google is free and Bing literally pays users, so subscription seems unworkable. You could try to find a niche, the way DDG has, and perhaps chisel away at market share slowly, but you&#x27;d need some content indexed that is unavailable to competitors, and that will come at a price.')
