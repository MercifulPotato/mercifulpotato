If the poster is affiliated with the project, some suggestions:<p>1. I don&#x27;t know what I am looking at with the examples. I think that this is an interactive session with the program, but this is not clear. \n2. It is also unclear how to start the program as the executable name is not specified. This and the former point could be addressed by including one of those gifs of an interactive session that are popular in GitHub readmes these days. Sure, they are a bit gimmicky, but still useful.\n3. It is not clearly stated if this is an executable program or a library. I believe it is the former, but this is nowhere in the introduction.\n4. Probably this is included with a number of package managers. If that is the case, instructions for installing via a package manager would be helpful, especially since the name is not particularly unique.')
