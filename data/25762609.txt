Americans have yet to understand this clearly.<p>The integration of New York City neighborhoods in the 1960s-70s led to massive white flight out of the city, lowering the middle class population drastically and destroying stable districts.  Was it worth it?  Some claim yes, others claim no.  I believe the city made a mistake by buying up property and giving it to lower income ethnic minorities to forcibly integrate neighborhoods, rather than encourage organic integration by business investment, tax breaks, opportunity zones, etc.')
