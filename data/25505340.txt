The best comment I read was it is the most niche project he ever heard of. And in reality it is a rather small market for it. Moreover, the price has to be higher than what normally card games cost. Because when you don&#x27;t order millions of decks, it is more expensive to manufacture, and moreover basic costs are also split into a smaller number of orders. It makes very hard for any innovation to go to the market. It really depends on if you will find a way to manufacture it in small quantity (what increases the cost) and if you will have market for it. Fortunately I have found an ambitious manufacturer that prints on demand. But it is a card deck. Hopefully there will be more manufacturers of electronic part willing to support startups with small order numbers. It blocks the market we don&#x27;t have them enought')
