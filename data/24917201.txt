I&#x27;m not expecting universal health care by June of next year or something.<p>You start by just getting people to say &quot;Yeah, you know, that makes sense. I would support that.&quot; And when enough people can agree with that idea, eventually you get candidates who say &quot;I have this terrific idea (parrots back to the world what the world is already saying is a good idea).&quot;<p>If there were a general consensus that this is something all Americans like, you can bet money we would have a presidential candidate who not only supports the idea but already has a well-thought-out blueprint developed for how to implement it. In fact, you would likely have two candidates competing for your vote based on the idea that &quot;My universal health care plan is better than theirs! Vote for me, Joe Schmoe, the guy with the better universal health care plan!&quot;')
