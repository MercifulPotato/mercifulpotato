When I focus on it and start typing it would fill in URLs with a lag, and so I&#x27;d try to navigate to a page, but just as I was about to hit Enter, it would auto-suggest some different path or set of parameters and then my Enter would navigate <i>there</i> instead.<p>It also (I guess to appear speedy?) would always speculatively load the root page when I&#x27;m typing something. So if I&#x27;m trying to type in &quot;localhost:4000&#x2F;somepage&quot;, it would issue a request while I&#x27;m still typing that for &quot;localhost:4000&#x2F;&quot;, which would inevitably cause me confusion when developing by triggering breakpoints and stuff I wasn&#x27;t intending.')
