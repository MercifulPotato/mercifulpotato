I&#x27;ve also linked the interview below. It&#x27;s an interview of the WeBull CEO and why they had issues. It&#x27;s pretty clear that this is a process issue, not necessarily a RobinHood is evil issue.<p>Long story short, the clearing house (similar to when you buy a house) assesses risk and assigns terms based on that.  The risk got so high that RobinHood couldn&#x27;t cover it or their clearing house couldn&#x27;t cover it anymore.<p>Whether or not the clearing houses are in bed with these brokerages remains to be seen.<p>I was also pitchforks out earlier today, and willing to move to webull all my stocks, but then I did more digging and this seems more reasonable.  RobinHoods press release was garbage tho.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25950191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25950191</a><p>Link to the video from the OP. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;heres-why-robinhood-restrict" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;heres-why-robinhood-restrict</a>...')
