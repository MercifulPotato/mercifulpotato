Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611532803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25896369, text='The amount of misinformation and lack of research in this article is very obvious from one example. The article mentions the below:<p>&gt; Even as recently as 2015, El Faro, a cargo ship with 33 on board vanished in the area.<p>First of all, the word &quot;vanished&quot; makes it seem like there was no reason or cause to its &quot;dissappearance&quot;. A quick Google search leads you to the Wikipedia article for the vessel[1].<p>It is quite obvious as to why the vessel &quot;disappeared&quot;.<p>&gt; She was lost at sea with all hands on October 1, 2015, after steaming into the center of Hurricane Joaquin.<p>Who could have thought that a ship steaming into the center of a hurricane might result in said ship not returning. More so, the US Coast Guard along with the US Navy conducted an extensive search They recovered debris and a damaged lifeboat, and spotted an unidentifiable body.<p>Former crew members also said that El Faro suffered from drainage issues and that leaking was common in the galley (kitchen) compartment. They said that the ship was covered in rust and her decks filled with holes as recently as August.<p>The US Navy also identified wreckage on October 31 consistent with the [El Faro] cargo ship in an upright position and in one piece. The Navy also announced a submersible had returned images that identified the wreck as El Faro.<p>So, we have a ship, that one, never &quot;vanished&quot;, and two, was sunk for very obvious verifiable reasons, and three, was very much in a horrible shape prior to the voyage and took an un-necessary risk to sail in such conditions.<p>To the rest of the article, Bermuda Triangle has been shown repeatedly to be utterly un-extraordinary area with no specific interesting features that may cause an extraordinary number of crashes or sinkings. There is nothing special about it.<p>The fact that such articles are written that either are horribly researched i.e. can&#x27;t even look up a Wikipedia page, or are lying on purpose shows you why the public&#x27;s trust in media has eroded.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SS_El_Faro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SS_El_Faro</a>')
