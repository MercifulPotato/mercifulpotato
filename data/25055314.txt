I spent time in coupa cafe. nothing happened. we had a profitable startup and we didn&#x27;t raise money. looking back we should have put the money into the company instead of moving thinking we can raise money by being &quot;local&quot;. but that is what literally everyone sold to us. IMHO silicon valley invests in an extremely specific type of company and 99% of investors simply don&#x27;t understand anything about all the different industries out there and how they make money. sorry to give it to you straight up but that&#x27;s the truth. there are crazy talented people anywhere else in the world, it&#x27;s just that silicon valley is extremely good at marketing itself.')
