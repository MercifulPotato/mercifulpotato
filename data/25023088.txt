Something similar I wish everyone would ask themselves is &quot;why do I have this opinion&#x2F;belief&#x2F;etc?&quot; for any topic.<p>Just like most religious people are the religion that their parents were, most people don&#x27;t really choose their political beliefs. It&#x27;s not to say we don&#x27;t learn justifications for what we believe, but it means that the fact that we believe in one thing over another is somewhat random imo.<p>Somewhere out there in the US is someone who&#x27;s pretty similar to me in most ways, they were just born in a part of the country where their default beliefs are different.<p>And for consistency, I <i>do</i> put more stake in someone&#x27;s beliefs when they change from their &quot;defaults&quot;.')
