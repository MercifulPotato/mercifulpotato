I hope this is the right moment for me to pipe up and say this:<p>I always just do the minimum with these CI integrations to get my shell script to run. I am grateful for the free minutes they offer open source projects - but any of the deeper integrations, the advanced automation?<p>No, thanks.<p>It&#x27;s not like the other developers who use what I write have any more motivation than I do. No one wants to learn the custom setup steps, not even for the &quot;biggest&quot; of the bunch. (Is that still Github? Who knows? I don&#x27;t.)<p>Oh, and if or when I migrate away from a CI system, like right now... Good thing I just kept it simple, you know?<p>Even for builds that target Windows, I just run a shell script.<p>I get it that Node and Rust builds really benefit from the advanced features. Anyone care to comment - is it as portable as a shell script?')
