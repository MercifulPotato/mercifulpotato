Not nearly as good as &quot;DRY&quot;, but it is fun to say.<p>I wonder how much of DRY&#x27;s popularity is due to the catchy name. One can say &quot;this needs to be DRYed up&quot; (verb), or &quot;this code is really DRY&quot; (adjective), or &quot;I appreciate the DRYness of this code&quot; (noun). The opposite of DRY: &quot;wet&quot;, of course. Being a homophone of an existing word that is both a noun and adjective, and that has an obvious antonym really lends itself to usage.')
