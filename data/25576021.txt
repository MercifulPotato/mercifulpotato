Item(by='toss1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609282094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568421, text='Interesting description, thanks!<p>&gt;&gt;&quot;decelerate no more than 60km&#x2F;h in 1.2 seconds&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&quot;never send signal AebBreakRequest=1 for longer than 1.2seconds&quot;<p>I&#x27;m surprised to see these specified like this.  It seems like it would be much more useful and responsive to real world conditions to specify it is G-Load profiles over milliseconds, especially since the effective braking force is dependent on so many conditions of the vehicle &amp; environment.<p>So, what do I not know about your system and dev environment?')
