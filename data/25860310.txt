It&#x27;s 2021, there is next to no reason why the default behavior is installation to &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib with shared objects that are rarely shared, with global access when installed for one application used by one user, and linked dynamically when the object never changes over the lifetime of the running application.<p>For all its warts this is something that npm gets right. Package management is a tool for software development, not software distribution to end users.')
