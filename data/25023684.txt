I&#x27;m too tired to do a deep dive for pizzagate so I will admit I may be confusing it with the Seth Rich conspiracy. It&#x27;s hard to keep track this deep into the abyss.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediamatters.org&#x2F;qanon-conspiracy-theory&#x2F;definitive-guide-fox-news-treatment-qanon-conspiracy-theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediamatters.org&#x2F;qanon-conspiracy-theory&#x2F;definit...</a>')
