If you are a startup with $1k&#x2F;mo AWS bills, throwing more hardware at the problem can be orders of magnitude cheaper. If you are running resource-intensive workloads then at some point efficiency work becomes ROI-positive.<p>The reason the rule of thumb is to throw more hardware at the problem is that most (good) engineers bias towards wanting to make things performant, in my experience often beyond the point where it’s ROI positive. But of course you should not take that rule of thumb as a universal law, rather it’s another reminder of a cognitive bias to keep an eye on.')
