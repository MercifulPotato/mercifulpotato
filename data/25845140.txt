For anyone else interested who hasn’t seen it, check out “types” in the wiki article linked above for a nice picture of some variations in common use.  Fun stuff to compute the wave induced motions of...  The math is very similar to a circuit analysis (linear time invariant systems). But the properties of your “circuit” (your boat, craft, platform, whatever) are solved by hydrodynamics to account for the shape dependence, environment dependence, etc.  and depending what you want to know - done in the time domain or frequency domain as well.')
