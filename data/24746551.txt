On Android, for instance, see how different the routes can be when generated by OSMAnd&#x27;s in-built cycling router and when generated by the Brouter plugin (which in turn has two profiles users must choose from). No surprise that DDG doesn&#x27;t want to roll out cycle routing before they can think up a UI that offers the required customizability without daunting the user.')
