Modern science, by contrast, grew out of a revolution in thought that reoriented politics around individual comfort through the mastery of nature.  Modern science dismisses ancient metaphysical questions as (to borrow Francis Baconâ€™s words) the pursuit of pleasure and vanity.<p>Curious, because I think to a pre-modern philosopher the pursuit of knowledge and mastery is itself the pursuit of vanity &amp; pleasure.<p>After all, (<i>pace</i> Aubrey de Grey) all men will some day die, no matter how much knowledge they have or what levels of technological control over the natural world they achieve.')
