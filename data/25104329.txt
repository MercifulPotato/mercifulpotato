If you can uplift species and you choose not to, you have killed their cognition. We are gods over the Earth. We have dominion over it and the creatures that inhabit it<p>No we&#x27;re not. We&#x27;re barely able to hold it together. The Earth is a giant living system we&#x27;re slowly killing and replacing with human technology.<p>It&#x27;s not a naturalistic fantasy, it&#x27;s the reality of the planet you live on.<p>To think we dominate this world is laughable. The fungi will consume all of us some day and outlive us all. I mean some are among the oldest still living life on earth as it is. Like millions of years old and still going. How can you dominate something that&#x27;s existed longer than you and will out live you and everyone you know?<p>Humans have such a limited understanding of the very things that make life possible. We&#x27;re not gods, we&#x27;re children who wandered into gods workshop and started playing with all the shiny toys.<p>Just because we know how to play with toys doesn&#x27;t make us gods or the dominators of the Earth or life itself.<p>That&#x27;s the kind of arrogance I speak of that&#x27;s going to blow up in our faces.')
