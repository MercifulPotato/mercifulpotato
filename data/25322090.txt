Books and mental models are mere tools that won&#x27;t get you anywhere, they just add to the conditioning and the &quot;burden&quot; of knowledge. To find your own philosophy of life you have to start by unconditioning your mind so you can become sensitive to the reality as it is and not what the world around you has taught you.')
