Specifically, they made it explicitly legal to camp in most public spaces (excluding parks) and they permit panhandling, sitting and sleeping on public sidewalks.<p>So there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;campsites&quot; downtown.  A lot of tents, or just people in sleeping bags on the sidewalk.  A lot of people peeing against the buildings.<p>It&#x27;s hard to score the upsides and downsides without starting an argument, but it feels like much of Austin has soured on the &quot;decriminalization of homelessness&quot;.')
