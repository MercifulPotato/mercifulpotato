I’m not biting. What they did made perfect sense. They traded something they couldn’t use for something they could. cCTLD for internet. The majority of the websites that host under the .nu name have nothing to do with the country. The country should not have a right to potentially interfere with the online stability of thousands of websites using that TLD just because they suddenly want it back. If they wanted it, they should never have given up control of it to begin with. In 2010 I had 4000 bitcoin but traded it for a new graphics card online. Should I be able to claim colonialism and say that I was swindled and I demand my rightful bitcoin back in full? No that would be ridiculous. So is asking for anything back you sold or traded after having received payment, especially when the price of the item you are asking for back has gone up thousands of times higher.')
