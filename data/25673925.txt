Knowing the speed-of-light round trip time to a network location gives you a bound on how much you can improve the performance of remote operations.<p>For example, I&#x27;m in Austin, querying a database hosted in Amazon&#x27;s us-east-1 data center (&quot;Northern Virginia&quot;). Call it 1000 miles away, 2000 mile round trip.<p><pre><code>    You have: 2000 miles\n    You want: millilightseconds\n            2000 miles = 10.736388 millilightseconds\n</code></pre>\nIf I have a query that&#x27;s taking &lt; 1ms, no optimization of how that query is executed by the database can possibly improve the overall performance.')
