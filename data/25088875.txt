Item(by='Smaug123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605310805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25066110, text='I find Mathematica very neat in the semicolons department (possibly because it&#x27;s the only Lisp I know, and because all Lisps are neat in this way). In Mathematica, a semicolon is nothing more nor less than an infix syntactic sugar for `CompoundExpression`, and `CompoundExpression` has the attribute `HoldAll` to prevent eager evaluation of the syntax tree. You could roll your own very easily, complete with its own infix operator.<p>You can also override the default evaluation strategy of `CompoundExpression` if you `Unprotect` it first, or you can define upvalues so that your own things behave differently when they appear inside `CompoundExpression`s. It&#x27;s all very lovely.')
