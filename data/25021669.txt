But my recent experience has been the reverse of yours.  Intel&#x27;s early WiFi modules on a CPU board were so bad I was forced to buy a go down the suck it and see path, but a whole pile of them from various manufacturers on EBay, build a room of 60 machines so I could test failure point of the bloody things.  Intel at about 10 clients or so, I didn&#x27;t find the fail point of Atheros and it was 1&#x2F;4 the price.  Then there was the i915 which hardly worked for a year after laptops were being sold with it, followed by a seeming unending series of bugs from the Manage Engine, follow by Apple cancelling heir Macbook refresh because of Intel bugs.  Then I had the misfortune of using Intels T265.  To name but one bug, it you would not re-initialise it&#x27;s USB bus (say after a CPU reset).  Intels response is &quot;won&#x27;t fix, suggest you splice in a relay USB power line&quot;.<p>You must be looking at a difference sort of quality to me.  Right now, Intel is terrible.  In the mean time I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using a few 10&#x27;s of AMD GX-420CA MPU&#x27;s, and they are just working after 5 years, zero failures.')
