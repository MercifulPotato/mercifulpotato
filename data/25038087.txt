Item(by='graton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604947382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25036339, text='I purchased my Brother MFC-8890DW (multi-function laser printer) sometime around 2011. I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t print much but it is only recently that I finally got a &quot;low toner&quot; message. I bought a toner cartridge but haven&#x27;t installed it yet as waiting until I see the effects of the low toner.<p>For my situation I would never buy an inket type printer. When I need to print photos I send them to Costco, which is maybe every couple years.<p>Logged into the printer and see that I have only printed 3370 pages in all that time. I probably use the scanner feature more than the printer :)')
