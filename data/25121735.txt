After all, if the only thing that&#x27;s compared is how much money was spent... what&#x27;s to keep states from blowing the money on bullshit and hoping that the US will save their butt once again?<p>What would be way better is to define goals on <i>capability</i> targets. Like... France being responsible for having one combat ready aircraft carrier, Germany 200 tanks, UK 7 nuclear submarines. That way governments would be incentivized to keep the vendors accountable to deliver safe and working products at reasonable cost, instead of basically letting them do whatever the f..k they want and milking the taxpayers for shit like marine helicopters that aren&#x27;t certified for flight over sea (German NH90 scandal).')
