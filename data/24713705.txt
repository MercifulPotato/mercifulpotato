Feynman pointed out why this doesn’t work: you have to “borrow odd”, so to speak, in order to get any effect. Which means that your slight perturbation, although miraculous, ends up having little more than an infinitesimal effect over an even smaller amount of time.<p>Feynman put it way better than me though. It was in the Messenger Lectures series if you’re curious. 6 wonderful and accessible videos; his audience was primarily laypeople, not scientists. Quite enjoyable.')
