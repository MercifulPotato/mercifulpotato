DoorDash used to eat tips and it&#x27;s still not clear what they do now. If you want to tip, leave an envelope on your door with cash tip and put a big fat sign that says &quot;tips for doordash driver&quot; so it&#x27;s obvious.<p>Separately, I really don&#x27;t understand this tipping economy at all. Aren&#x27;t tips supposed to be based on quality of service? Why do they ask you for the tip amount <i>before</i> you have received service? They should just charge a fair amount and pay drivers a fair amount and not over-complicate the checkout process.<p>In general I absolutely <i>hate</i> &quot;how much do you want to pay&quot; type interfaces. I really hate thinking about that stuff. Just give me a number and I&#x27;ll decide if I want the product or not -- that&#x27;s how the rest of the world works.')
