There may be something to be said for that. I know Google and AWS are pretty all in on kubernetes, but this does offer an alternative &amp; a layer of abstraction on top of that.<p>My bigger worry is all these deployment abstractions might lead to a scenario where when something breaks very badly, nobody really knows how to fix it other than to nuke the whole thing and try again. I feel like we&#x27;re already there with that in a lot of ways with these devops systems. The weird kind of lock in they have to me is that they aren&#x27;t enabling smaller teams to easily adopt these things, its aimed at either cloud providers or large insitutions that can afford to pay a dedicated engineer to manage these systems.<p>I&#x27;d love to see something aimed at smaller teams that makes these orchestrations easy and multifunctional, and work across more platforms, like DO. Hashicorp et. el. know what the best practices are and how to keep things secure, just give me something that enforces those things on any fleet of servers&#x2F;containers&#x2F;whathaveyous I want to use.<p>As a developer on a smaller team who spends part of my time working on these concerns, that would help immensely.')
