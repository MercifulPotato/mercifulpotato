A quick check at levels.io can confirm this fact -- the vast majority of employees are on-site in a tech hub.</i>&quot;<p>Okay, fair enough.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Whether or not this is an important skill depends on what you are optimizing for. I don&#x27;t need to be able to deliver software at FAANG scale if I don&#x27;t ever want to work at a FAANG.</i>&quot;<p>There&#x27;s not much point to enduring the hardship of launching a startup if there&#x27;s no hope of growing it into at least a medium or large business though?  A solid understanding of software processes and even scaling that FAANGs use can be helpful even at that size.<p>For example, a business I was at was encountering growing pains because their seat-of-the-pants YOLO software development processes weren&#x27;t working for them anymore at the size they had grown to.  Gently nudging them to adopt proper documentation and other software engineering processes known to ease those pains because they&#x27;d been battle tested at larger tech companies was part of what I was able to do to help them.')
