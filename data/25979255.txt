Even if contracts are not very explicit about this, it appears that AZ really saw it as a separate supply chain from the very beginning, at least for initial doses. Looking into contract is like trying to catch them at technicalities which is not done in good faith.<p>Again, it is not contracts that can miraculously create more doses now. It was only because of investments done before. AZ is doing this for non-profit (a big mistake in my opinion), so what can you squeeze out of that?<p>In fact, the EU should have invested even more, make them to build even larger facilities with more bioreactors that in case of low yield they would still have more doses. But it is all in hindsight, so not very useful to say it now.<p>The UK is not privileged because their sites had the same issues with the first batches. The only difference is that they started 3 months earlier.')
