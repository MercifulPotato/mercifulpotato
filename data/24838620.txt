Item(by='anthony_romeo', descendants=None, kids=[24839391], score=None, time=1603208302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836602, text='I completely agree, and reports on unemployment rates are one of my biggest Internet peeves:<p>&quot;The official unemployment rate is artificially depressed by excluding people who might be earning only a few dollars a week.&quot;<p>This reads like paranoia. Regardless of how U-3 originated, U-3 reflects an international standard of defining &quot;unemployment&quot;. If different countries use different definitions of unemployment in their studies, then meaningfully comparing unemployment statistics among countries is futile (or just really really difficult).<p>I guess one could argue that, say, U-6 should be the international standard. But whatever definition one uses doesn&#x27;t actually <i>change</i> anything in the real world. The different measures are trying to <i>describe</i> reality, not <i>define</i> the magical all-true unemployment rate. The point is to look at many different definitions to identify trends.  Attempts to blindly point at U-6 and say that this is more &quot;real&quot; than U-3 is just as deceptive as claiming success over lowering the U-3 rate (even if it&#x27;s because people are leaving the labor force).<p>It should be up to outlets like Axios to explain these nuances rather than argue that one measure is more &quot;true&quot; than another.')
