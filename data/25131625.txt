Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605658397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129280, text='&gt; For China is business as usual harassing other fishermen legally operating inside the claimed nine dash line waters, claims which were invalidated by an international court. Other nations are defending their EEZ and have every right to chase them out or sink them.<p>The nine-dash line claims were invalidated on the grounds that controlling small islands without permanent settlement doesn&#x27;t extend the EEZ, so the EEZ is limited to 200 nautical miles from the coastline. But there&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> within 200 nmi from the Chinese coast, including the Paracels, where those Vietnamese fishermen in the article were attacked by the Chinese coast guard. Simply defending their EEZ, as they have every right to do. Except the Paracels are <i>also</i> within 200 nmi of the Vietnamese coast, so the maritime boundary is up for negotiation. Vietnam and China have a treaty delineating the boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin, but otherwise it&#x27;s still unspecified.<p>As for Japan, they&#x27;re on the other side of Taiwan, so their EEZ doesn&#x27;t extend nearly far enough to make any claims in the South China Sea.')
