On Amazon.jp, sold by Amazon.jp, Persona5 anime is broken into volumes, each with 2-3 episodes: Volume 1 is 짜5,958 and has 2 episodes, volume 2 is 짜6,695 with 3 episodes, etc. It&#x27;s priced like you&#x27;re buying a limited edition movie as 3 episodes might be roughly the same length. Browsing other ANIPLEX releases on Amazon.jp, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be all that unique to Persona either. SAO Alicization appears to be similarly priced and released in small 2 episode volumes. It might be somewhat unique to ANIPLEX but I do see other anime sold this way. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime (Season One) is only broken into two parts, 짜5,198 and 짜6,061 each on Amazon. This seems more reasonable. In Canada it retails for roughly CA$50 each part, though reviews complain that the boss fight isn&#x27;t over until you watch part 2 of the season and reviewers say they prefer buying a box set with the full season rather than just one part...')
