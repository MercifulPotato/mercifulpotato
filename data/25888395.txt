Item(by='joseph_grobbles', descendants=None, kids=[25888720, 25888482, 25888513], score=None, time=1611454892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888325, text='&quot;10 minutes&quot;<p>Are you the only one attending or something?<p>Standups are initially scheduled for the start of the development day. But then people come in a little late, get that first minute call, have to attend to something that hiccupped, so soon enough the standup happens 30 minutes into the day, eventually an hour into the day.<p>So if you did get there on time, now you just spin your wheel waiting, because first you&#x27;ve got that obnoxious standup that&#x27;s going to disrupt everything.<p>Now you get there and spend ten minutes waiting for everyone to assemble, and for the S.C.R.U.M.Master to pull Jira up on the overhead. Finally you get going and everyone has an essay about their herculean effort putting a button on a form, which absolutely no one is listening to. You have the manager (because <i>really</i> they&#x27;re a garbage way of managing) interjecting and asking questions. You have someone say something dumb they&#x27;re doing and everyone gets to stand there while two people who could have taken it offline have a conversation.<p>40 minutes later you go back to your desk.<p>Invariably the standup aficionados (almost universally shitty managers) will say &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong!&quot;, but what I just described is the standup reality virtually everywhere.<p>EDIT: Exactly as expected, I made the mistake of actually replying to people who questioned my comment, which means when some angry person comes along they get to downvote all of them. That aspect of HN is weak sauce.')
