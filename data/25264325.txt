From the article:<p><pre><code>  Note: writing an x86 emulator on ARM forces you to deal with this in a particularly messy way because you never know when reordering will be a problem so you typically have to insert a lot of memory barriers. Or you can follow Appleâ€™s strategy and add a CPU mode that enforces x86&#x2F;x64 memory ordering, turning that on when emulating.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a little surprised+happy the ARM architectural license allowed this.')
