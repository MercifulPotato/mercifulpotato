The general effect was that shit kept rolling downhill, but that those in power were not expected to discuss or do anything to improve the situation: the heavily racist outcomes of the war on drugs, racially disparate education funding+outcomes, etc etc etc were off-limits for &#x27;polite&#x27; conversation.
