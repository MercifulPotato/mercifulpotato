They used MIDI audio because likely it simplified the problem along a number of dimensions: rhythm and timbre are fixed, and there is no noise. It also means it&#x27;s cheating and it will not work on acoustic performances, but it&#x27;s a good start. I mean if you can&#x27;t solve the problem for MIDI audio you will never solve it for anything else.')
