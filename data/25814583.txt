My son uses it extensively, and knowing that we&#x27;re stepping on each other&#x27;s progress in a game have always made me care a bit less about playing.  I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it would matter that much, but the specific thought has come up when I thought about using the headset and kept me from using it, so I guess it does.')
