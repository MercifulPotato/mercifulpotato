It got fairly time consuming, and I didn&#x27;t like the relationship I was forming with my comment scores, which I had to look at all the time. I&#x27;ve found that replies coming to my inbox is very different from reply notifications on the site. I&#x27;m not already in &quot;browsing mode&quot; and the email contains the full comment; at least half the time I don&#x27;t bother clicking the link in the email. YMMV.')
