The DMCA is a tool to get a platform to stop hosting content the rights holder believes is infringing. There&#x27;s nothing stopping the RIAA from sending a DMCA notice <i>and</i> suing all the contributors. In other words, the project doesn&#x27;t just need to be hosted in a country that is outside the reach of the US legal system, but the maintainers and contributors as individuals need to also be outside the reach of the US legal system. In fact, I&#x27;d be shocked if RIAA doesn&#x27;t go after the maintainers and major contributors individually if they haven&#x27;t already (I haven&#x27;t been following this very closely).<p>Interestingly, the DMCA notice RIAA sent GitHub isn&#x27;t a typical DMCA notice either. It seems to be more of a cease and desist along the lines of &quot;we noticed this repo is a tool used to infringe on our rights -- sure would be a shame if you were to get caught up in the legal shitstorm that&#x27;s about to happen, thanks!&quot;')
