Have worked on sculpting tools before and it&#x27;s pretty dang intuitive out of the box.<p>Two minor suggestions:\n1. On mac the undo mappings would normally be CMD+Z. Not sure if it&#x27;s possible to map this in the browser or not but took me a moment to find Ctrl+Z (via menus).<p>2. The starting geometry is a circle with a flesh-colored tone. Not sure if this is randomized but it leads to quickly creating weird human-ish shapes. It also defaults to a mirrored circular&#x2F;spherical brush. May want to consider a different default tone as you&#x27;ll likely get lots of female anatomy drawn w&#x2F; the current settings.')
