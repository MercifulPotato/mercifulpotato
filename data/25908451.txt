They didn&#x27;t understand that I literally had no where to go, and that me asking for a place to crash wasn&#x27;t me simply wanting to visit at the last minute.  My friends also weren&#x27;t rich, so even if I could have stayed with them, it&#x27;s not like they had a spare bedroom or guest cottage in which I could stay for a while.  Oddly enough, the people who did let me stay with them were folks that were themselves nearly broke and&#x2F;or recently homeless, all of whom I had only recently met.  They understood that if I was asking them for a place to crash, that I really needed a place to stay.  The kindness of strangers really saved my butt in 2009.')
