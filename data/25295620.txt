I cant imagine the worldwide numbers are more than an order of magnitude higher (I guessed it at 200&#x2F;week in a sibling comment). Thatâ€™s 7.5x more potential draws, and 5x-35x fewer draws per week, which would change the numbers quite a bit, making the weekly chance way way lower than your estimate.')
