Any &quot;remote location&quot; with a road that could carry one of these things probably has a power line running alongside that road too.  It would be great to have one of these at any number of high arctic communities, but getting them there is probably not possible other than by ship to coastal ports.  Even then, the crane requirements probably preclude most ports.  They need to be lighter if they want to push into remote communities.')
