Item(by='inopinatus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605211797, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25074035, text='The handset market is a bogus statistic. Epic are not selling phones or phone accessories.<p>The market in question is the $150 billion mobile applications market, of which Apple controls 60% worldwide, well above the threshold for regulatory attention in many jurisdictions.<p>As for taking sides, I recommend taking the consumer&#x27;s side, since the consumer is thoroughly shat upon by Apple&#x27;s rules.  The agreement demands that merchants on the Apple platform <i>actively mislead the consumer</i> about their purchasing options.<p>At that point, whatever one may think of Epic&#x27;s preferences, motives, or ethics, becomes moot.  It is not unlawful to hold market power, or to use it for profit, but it is unlawful (at least where I live) to wield market power to mislead the consumer, and that&#x27;s where Apple slides off the rails.  However by taking direct action, Epic have the burden of proof, unless a governmental regulator decides to shoulder it first.<p>Of course none of this actually relates to the judgement in the article, which is about Apple&#x27;s embarrassingly nonsensical counterclaims, amounting to &quot;competing with Apple shouldn&#x27;t be allowed at all because then we make less money&quot;.  I struggle to comprehend the magnitude of over-entitled, self-absorbed groupthink that could lead to making such a claim with a straight face.')
