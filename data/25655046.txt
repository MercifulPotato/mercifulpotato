Given that one extra piece of context, I&#x27;m perfectly willing to scoff at that number.<p>I find it interesting that there are currently zero Bethesda games on the list despite their fairly broad scopes, which is... telling, considering the reputation of their games. That said, I have doubts that ES6 will hit $300M. Maybe ES7 as you say, but that&#x27;s not the next Elder Scrolls game.')
