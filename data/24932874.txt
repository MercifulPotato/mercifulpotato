Item(by='dyingkneepad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603992455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24925189, text='Thanks for replying to me.<p>&gt; 1st big paragraph<p>Yes, I recognize I exaggerated regarding LOC. I should have not said that. I do understand that the core protocol assumes one of each thing. Sometimes I dream about declaring X12 being the same thing as X11 but with the core protocol being converted to just an additional extension marked for deprecation :). Then we also deprecate everything related to drawing and find a way to make compositing great again.<p>&gt; 2nd paragraph<p>I did not mean to insult you at all. But let&#x27;s be honest: if you wanted to spend your time doing something that your employer does not want, you&#x27;d either have to do it outside your normal working hours or you&#x27;d start getting bad performance reviews due to not being aligned with the business priorities. Red Hat&#x27;s business alignment has much much much more influence over the Linux ecosystem as whole than people on Hacker News realize or are willing to believe.<p>&gt; 3rd paragraph<p>I understand it, and that&#x27;s why I say things won&#x27;t change unless someone else with lot of money decides to play Linux Graphics. We can&#x27;t blame RH for choosing a path and following (to quote a certain someone, &quot;Linux is <i>not</i> about choice&quot;, right?). But we do have the unfortunate consequence that RH&#x27;s decisions are contributing to significant fragmentation. You don&#x27;t want to have to reimplement the stuff for X+Wayland, but everybody else who does not want to use the Gnome compositor will have to reimplement the stuff you put on Gnome. There&#x27;s probably a lot the community (not only RH) could try to push to alleviate the fragmentation problems.<p>&gt; 4th paragraph<p>I completely understand that.')
