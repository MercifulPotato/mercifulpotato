I cannot verify the veracity of the argument, but the argument itself is new, and not reducible to distinguishing between expected utility and expected value.<p>My comment is based on a Nature article by the author [1]. This is just based on a first reading, so my understanding may not be spot on.<p>The observation here is that the utility function in classical economics is not time-dependent. Time dependence is added-on by effects such as discounting. Discounting function itself may be personal - some investors are in a hurry, some are patient, this is usually taken into account.<p>In contrast, the authors introduce stochastic noise into the __rate of growth of the loss function___ (not the expected wealth). [Equation 7 in the Nature paper]. This makes the evolution of the growth rate function into a Brownian motion. The authors claim that this models individual wealth trajectories better.<p>This is as far as I have got. The underlying dynamical equations for the growth function are different, and the authors&#x27; claim is that their model predicts individual trajectories better than classical economics, and does not have to use psychology like behavioral economics.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41567-019-0732-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41567-019-0732-0</a>')
