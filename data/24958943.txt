Next, they&#x27;ll surely never talk to the people at risk. Their grandparents can sit at home and be more bored to death and lonely than they usually already are and have young people, which are allowed out, to bring them food. Couldn&#x27;t possibly go wrong.<p>How do you picture different kinds of measures per risk group going? People can already choose to isolate more, disinfect more, keep distance more, etc. if they find themselves at risk. The compulsory measures are a bare minimum to prevent unnecessary deaths and keep the long term impact to a minimum. You can find a new job next year and live on government benefits in the meantime (or is the worst-case scenario for you not unemployment and boredom? Well, infecting loved ones would be worse in these times but you don&#x27;t seem to find that very worrying) but if you&#x27;re one of today&#x27;s corona deaths you can&#x27;t find another life.')
