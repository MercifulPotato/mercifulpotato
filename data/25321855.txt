To get into vim takes time and to get muscle memories at least 9-12 months. Something a lot of coders even don&#x27;t do, so why should a data scientist do this. The result is that you are so much faster because most of the time you don&#x27;t write code but stare at your code, navigate around and do small changes. So, I think if you deal with code 80% of your day, vim binds are a must and this was my biggest gripe with these notebooks. Google Colab is the only notebook offering painless vim binds. No other notebooks has proper vim support because data scientist are not coders and rather care about math.')
