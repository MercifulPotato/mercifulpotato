People just have positive and negative subconscious reactions to certain physical traits.<p>It&#x27;s striking that you virtually never hear any discussion of &quot;height discrimination&quot;, which I put in scare quotes because it barely seems to a recognized concept in the world of work (although it is somewhat recognized in the dating world). Yet there&#x27;s lots of evidence that tall people have systematic advantages in life. They&#x27;re seen as leaders, more likely to become CEOs, more like to be elected to political office, etc.')
