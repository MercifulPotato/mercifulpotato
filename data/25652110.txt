For example you could do TCP&#x2F;IP in hardware, but unless you have particular performance requirements (say HFT) you&#x27;re probably better off with a soft core and a tested software TCP&#x2F;IP stack.<p>Also each feature translated to hardware takes up space in the fabric. When you crunch numbers on an FPGA, it&#x27;s ideal if you can lay out the entire sequence of operations as one big pipeline, so you can keep throughput as high as possible. Sufficiently long or complex sequences may not translate efficiently to FPGA.')
