Mostly because of the last bit (better&#x2F;faster).<p>Birds are to planes, as humans are to cars.  Yet can a car leap over barricades, climb mountains, trees, self-repair, turn on a dime, stop instantly, etc, etc?<p>A plane cannot maneuver like a bird, take off in crazy weather conditions, land on a dime in a tree, stop almost instantly in flight, and change direction, etc.<p>I think what you&#x27;ve quoted has a lot of value here, for, what we should expect from an artificial brain, isn&#x27;t a human brain.  This is truth.  However, while it may be faster in a specific capacity, but it won&#x27;t have the same characteristics.<p>So yes, expecting it to be like a human brain doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Yet better&#x2F;faster?  I don&#x27;t think we can compare this, they&#x27;re too different.<p>(which is really the quote&#x27;s point, but I just didn&#x27;t like the better&#x2F;faster bit at the end...)')
