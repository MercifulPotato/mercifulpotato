Often candidates take a &quot;spray and pray&quot; approach anyway, and aren&#x27;t expecting responses to most of their cold emails.<p>But if there&#x27;s any kind of back-and-forth at all after that, especially if a candidate has gone through a phone screen or interview, I think everyone is owed some sort of closure in the process.  Just as if the candidate accepts another job, they should let the recruiter know, a recruiter should let the candidate know if they&#x27;re being rejected.  There&#x27;s no legitimate excuse for not even sending a canned one-liner rejection email.')
