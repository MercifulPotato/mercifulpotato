Like masturbation. Sure it&#x27;s fun. But pretending you achieved something is the real problem. Ultimately, it&#x27;s just ego tripping.<p>It&#x27;s fun to visit friends who get these devices. I have yet to see one setup that doesn&#x27;t have some fuck up. Needing constant reboots, lag, some other type of delay or even best, that one device that just doesn&#x27;t work no matter what.<p>Yes, I wish dumb TVs would be normal again. Had a friend mention that he doesn&#x27;t need a tv bigger than 32in, thus he got a good quality monitor and sound system. Hes single and doesn&#x27;t watch much tv anyways. Most monitors are telemetry-less, which is what we want. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive of a setup, but he&#x27;s had it for years and is happy. At least happier than I am with my stupid ass samsung smart tv. Tossing that idea out there, especially as monitors are getting bigger these days.')
