FREEZE`, etc.<p>One other note:<p>&gt; Goto solution for bulk loading into PostgreSQL is the native copy command. But one limitation with the copy command is that it requires the CSV file to be placed on the server.<p>You can use `COPY ... FROM STDIN` and stream the data from the client, this is basically what `&#x2F;copy` does in psql.')
