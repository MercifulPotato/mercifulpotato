From my experience, the internet is an abysmal place to discuss these ideas regardless of which side you&#x27;re on. The left and right both love to misapply statistics and misrepresent their counterparts whenever it&#x27;s convenient to do so.<p>Modern social platforms simply do not allow you the room to express the nuance required for the topics at hand. You need far more than 280 characters and a few memes to articulate a point where you have to literally reference text, history, and tradition because so few people are versed in it.<p>The most incendiary example is the 2nd Amendment. Discussing it without your counterpart understanding the history and philosophies that spawned it (British longbow tradition, assize of arms laws from 1100s on, centralized Prussian style military vs militias, etc) makes for a nauseating experience.')
