In 2014 it was 13 years old with little chance to improve anything without breaking someone. That was the whole reason why .NET Core became a thing.<p>.NET Core in Version 1.0 cheated then by just taking the network layer of node.js called libuv and linked it up (C -&gt; .NET) . In Version 2.x they wrote and independent socket based networking layer straight in C# which outperformed libuv significantly. In Version 3.x they switched over to use new low level runtime primitives (e.g. Span&lt;T&gt;) which could never have been delivered in the .NET Framework (no breaking changes!). Now in .NET 5 more runtime improvements were added.')
