I found verifying mocks too brittle in many cases. Generally I want to test outcomes (state), <i>not</i> behavior. I had many changes breaking tests although functionality was fine.<p>The example outlined in the article isn&#x27;t exactly a unit test: The change in state of one object changes the state of another object. If these are coupled that tightly I&#x27;d rather try to mock (stub) the dependencies of both objects and let them interact (test both at the same time), then verifying their final state.')
