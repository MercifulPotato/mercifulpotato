If we take the extreme case of Nobel Prizes we see that most of them have IQs 3SD above the mean. We can infer that there is a minimum IQ score requirement to do a certain job, for example:<p>- Nobel Prize level scientist ~150 IQ<p>- College professor ~130 IQ<p>- Engineer ~120 IQ<p>- Machinist ~110 IQ<p>- Heavy machinery operator ~90 IQ<p>The trouble with IQ, and the discussion that surrounds it, is very simple. IQ seems to have a strong genetic (read unchangeable) component. The reality of IQ is a big F.U. to the concept of free will and a big F.U. to the narrative of &quot;poor people are just oppressed, it they weren&#x27;t they&#x27;ll be just as successful as Bill Gates and Elon Musk&quot;. \nThe reality of IQ is, in my opinion, the greatest taboo of our society. The narrative of the entire modern left rests on this taboo not being broken.\nNow you can start downvoting, but if you do it, please explain why there aren&#x27;t highly successful people with low IQs (except in sports, maybe).')
