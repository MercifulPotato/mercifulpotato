It&#x27;s ever-so-slightly more crash-prone than on older OS&#x27;s, but totally usable.<p>It launches on Mojave as well, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it works, but I haven&#x27;t personally used it for any length of time. Catalina is what killed it.<p>IMO, backwards compatibility in OSX&#x2F;macOS was perfectly decent for a long time. Most software compiled for Intel that wasn&#x27;t doing something weird continued to chug on, frequently with significant glitches but not to the point where the software was unusable. Then in Catalina Apple just gave up or something.')
