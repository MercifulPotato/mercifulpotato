My parents didn&#x27;t give me coffee when I was a kid but my wife&#x27;s parents started giving it to her at an early age. My kids both drink coffee. My older one started on black coffee when he was 2. It&#x27;s just a routine part of his day. Coffee at breakfast and then at cafecito in the afternoon.')
