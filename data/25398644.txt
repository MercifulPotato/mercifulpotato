The ISO specs aren&#x27;t free (a couple hundred USD for the AVC spec), which is the most annoying part.<p>You can get the H.263&#x2F;H.264&#x2F;H.265 specs for free form ITU, which covers a lot of the details you need for writing an encoder&#x2F;decoder. Unfortunately sometimes you need the ISO specs for other things related to these codecs (e.g., ISO BMFF stuff).<p>(edit: I&#x27;m a dork and originally misread the comment as saying it was $10k for the H.264 spec, when parent meant the HDMI spec; I removed parts of my comment that were related to that misreading).')
