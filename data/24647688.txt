The biggest improvement, the initial car seat laws probably made things better. At some point though it has direct costs with things like booster seats running until kids are big enough (probably 3rd or 4th grade), and indirect cost like you may have to miss work because you can’t have someone without a seat pick the kid up.<p>All in all it’s different than it was 30 years ago, and more expensive to do relatively mundane tasks with your kids.')
