There is so much evidence that the laptop is real, nude photos, nude videos, no assertion that it is fake, apparently even Hunter&#x27;s lawyer requested the laptop back. Metadata is spoofable anyways and hardly prooves it is real, what proves it is real is the FBI, who can and will request text records from cell phone companies&#x2F;tech giants, or corroborating e-mails from the recipient, or say someone who worked with Biden also testifying to it&#x27;s authenticity (this which happened.) Something with so much overwhelming evidence at least the majority of information is true is crazy it still doesn&#x27;t get any play on so many news stations and websites. Apparently they even know the source of the laptop and have a receipt. That&#x27;s just what&#x27;s off the top of my head, go read his e-mails and article for more reasons. Even presented with these reasons they only stop responding and say HE is the one unwilling to cooperate, I mean the audacity.')
