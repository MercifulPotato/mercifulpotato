One of the very few prominent examples is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;andrewgodwin&#x2F;schema-migrations-for-django" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;andrewgodwin&#x2F;schema-mig...</a><p>Basically I believe in offerings which promise specific qualities (timeliness of responses and bugfixes, roadmap features schedule etc) and cover the costs of development (including market rate salary for the developers according to their skills which they use to develop and manage the project).<p>I am currently developing this with the aim to roll out my first experimental offerings.\nI am keen to help others to adopt this approach, so everybody is most welcome to reach out to me with any questions.')
