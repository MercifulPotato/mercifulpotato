It&#x27;s a risk&#x2F;benefit analysis. Yes, there is some risk to a new vaccine. That is an unknown. But there is a known risk to <i>not</i> widely distributing a vaccine, which is millions of deaths. Vaccines have been studied for a long time, their mechanisms are fairly well understood, and they have been going through full safety trials, even if somewhat accelerated. So those are your options on the table: guaranteed millions of deaths, or possibly some unknown long term implications from a vaccine, but unlikely given the understanding and safety trials.<p>Ask any reputable doctor, virologist, or epidemiologist: they all are backing the vaccine. Discussion is fine, but you have to provide some thoughtful justification behind your worry, and make a case for your alternative plan. Otherwise you&#x27;re just spreading fear and doubt, which may impact vaccine uptake, and directly cause more deaths.')
