Hospitals companies have local monopolies, which they can use to charge ridiculously high prices. On the other hand, insurance companies do get a kickback of sorts when the hospitals bump prices - the negotiators get compensation based on the dollar amount of savings they can bring from negotiation, so effectively, even if the hospital bumps prices high enough and renegotiates the chargemaster rates to a lower one, while still ensuring a profit for the negotiators, they&#x27;ll go for it.
