Item(by='busyant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611408257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878915, text='&gt; I feel like ever since the printing technology became more available, the pace of evolution of languages has slowed down.<p>This reminds me of the &quot;universality&quot; of the genetic code. That is, the &quot;language&quot; for translation of genetic information to proteins is pretty uniform (there are some exceptions). The obvious reason for why this &quot;language&quot; doesn&#x27;t change is that even the tiniest changes will cause problems for the organism (several thousand genes depend on the legacy genetic code and if it changes, that could = death). As others have noted here, we have created niche writing methods like stenography, which would be analogous to non-canonical genetic code in mitochondria, for example (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_mitochondrial_genetics#Genetic_code_variants" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_mitochondrial_genetics#G...</a>). One can imagine that the mitochondrial genetic code can evolve away from the &quot;universal&quot; code because the mitochondrial code has fewer users (genes) depending on its legacy code.<p>I think, in a similar vein, once modern printing got everyone on the same page (ahem), we were sort of &quot;locked in&quot; and even minor changes would break a lot of already functioning communication.<p>I guess the question also reminds me of software engineers who don&#x27;t want to mess with a decades-old legacy codebase for fear of breaking things that they are unaware of.<p>That being said, I imagine it could be done (creating a more efficient, widely used language&#x2F;writing method), but it would take a LOT of effort.')
