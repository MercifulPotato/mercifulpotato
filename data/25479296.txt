Graphics are excellent. Art assets are pretty well made. Human models look a little Daz3d like but it&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t have any performance issues on my Core-i7 9 series and RTX 2070. I do have an issue with a few gameplay elements though.<p>1: Driving feels sluggish, unresponsive, like I&#x27;m remote-controlling a buggie on the moon driving through molasses. I turn left and 250ms later I go left. Yet the wheels turn visually instantly. It&#x27;s bad. Real bad.<p>2: Shooting feels like my bullets are digital slot machine values. I shot an enemy every 4th bullet does damage. I don&#x27;t know what they were going for (Fallout?) but it makes gun fights tedious and not that fun. I feel less like a bad-ass pistol gunslinger from Blade Runner and more like a &quot;pistolier&quot; in a table top game of Fate.  Gun fighting doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; real-time like it should.  Shooting a goon 12 times with my revolver (6 shot) at point blank range isn&#x27;t my idea of immersion.')
