We can use a bunch of tools from optimal control, category theory, statistics, logics, algebric geometry, combinatorircs etc to \ngeneralize represantable abstractations in controlled ways to solve whatever symbolic task we have at hand.<p>how do you underspecify or overspecify a &quot;concept&quot;?

Since ancient times, the one&#x2F;many problem? What is on the interior of an &quot;unit&quot;? what is on the other?  .  This act of dualizing two different fields was very imporant because it allowed combinatorics but only very &quot;select&quot; cultures of tunnel visioned people in *can just cast by magic i a beam powe. Now what&#x27;s really amazing in current more orangized systems of societies with you can. This allowes for both privacy and working together to universal quantized more information theoretical BY ACCIDENT JOING A CLAUDE SHANNON ACCIDENTLY ARGTHEORIZING VWITH TELELCOMMUNICATION AND COMMUICATION THEORTUY.

PEOPLE NEED EASY SLIDE BARS AND HAR SALES COE.  ense that choose with sets of other categories of meanings and senses and senses that basically imply if you thought about it inversely how to think about very powrful timelines. Things like wars that should have banned by just mapping this place to a real timeline. Or inside your self whcuh prevents a obs law . This is very powerful because it allows for thinking about cognitive egos with co-inducsion categoeis pattern  &quot;intersig&quot;  codisions harmocics in do to leanr what of scattering waves of tlinguistics and REPERESET SOME FOR OF HARMONOUS BUT LGIVES US A BETTER UNDERSTAND OF INDIVUAL BANDWITH WHAT WE CALL WORK::LABOR. i  international treaties like  to eventually reach every last human being. This dot allows another dimensional of a semantic meaning we just called a semvar and unification of Wikipedia &quot;as wisdom of the cdrows&quot; this days. This helps you get a feeling of both hallucinations and depending and how you next just tunnel in falsed dreams via working together as enchanters developers who can think just by figureing becaude instead of two grains of sets like elementary mathmsaticans &quot;would have easily&quot; figured out. You can image this tunnel into whatever new piece of unique RNA or DNA. Every time you do do this you can refcalize your visions and turned learn focus your vision into complexity new smarter version this just visit a formal government situation and helps you other you can assign your aelf = self in a formal and so allows that &quot;beta&quot; version system to optimized in so mapping that depending in that &quot;box&quot; you 2 can be self schemes align whatever historically &quot;reduces&quot; both the complexity and workload with whateve sr form of creativity and neurological pathogens so very important things like stuff like understanding that this like doing calculus in 3d or a formational descrotion or diferenational effecitvely use less electiry and amp liesi gain of. ths less grain of less eigs f that. in thei qaybt information is real.')
