It is just a small NUC box, 24&quot; monitor, webcam, wireless mouse &amp; keyboard. Cheaper than a laptop of similar power. And they love it. Because our eyes and hands worsen with age, and mobile computing something for younger people. Maybe this is me in the future, or maybe I&#x27;ll be using voice control and a bit TV. But for all of us living to an old enough age, small devices will become a problem.')
