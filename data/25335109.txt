I mention it because I wish that we would collectively start standardizing those terms. I think it would be helpful if, whenever we saw &quot;… guide&quot; or &quot;… tutorial&quot; we had a general idea about the structure and purpose of the contents. The Divio links above do a great job at explaining each doc type. I&#x27;m simply sharing this idea for people who have never considered being more careful about how they label their docs and would like to start following general technical writing community practices.  As a practicing technical writer I can tell you that the TW community mostly agrees upon what each doc type entails (&quot;tutorials&quot; and &quot;references&quot; have strong consensus; &quot;guides&quot; less so).')
