The company is founded by ex-Crossover (look up the company called Crossover and what the employees say about productivity measuring over there) executives with a goal of coming up a better productivity measuring tool than what they&#x27;ve  already had at Crossover.<p>With their own tool, they were measuring everything from my keystrokes to random web cam&#x2F;screenshots in every ten minute interval. They&#x27;ve given nice names for them like &quot;Focus&quot; and &quot;Intensity&quot;. &quot;Focus&quot; is a measure of how often I&#x27;m switching context and &quot;intensity&quot; is a measure of my keystrokes&#x2F;mouse clicks&#x2F;mouse scrolls per minute. \nThe surprising thing is that they want to market this product to knowledge worker environments and there were already about 20 competitors for them, which says this has a future. In fact, every software engineer&#x2F;marketeer&#x2F;PM in this company were already being evaluated partly - mainly, when they want to bash you in a 1-1 - based on these metrics.<p>You&#x27;re right. I only worked for this company because I needed to make a few bucks. I would never go back to work somewhere if they use a tool like this.')
