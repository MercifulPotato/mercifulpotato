I haven&#x27;t taken the plunge of modular yet (I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s a hole I would never get out of) but I play around with VCV and love it.<p>I also have a Volca Modular which doesn&#x27;t have a MIDI input, only CV&#x2F;Gate and was thinking about adding a CV output to the thing.<p>A real theremin module is probably much more precise than sonar sensors; I use HC-SR04 because they are so cheap but they are really unstable, the values they return tend to jump around a lot. I try to compensate for this in software but it&#x27;s not perfect yet.')
