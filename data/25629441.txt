The argument is that having to deal with a single set of rules is superior to having to so with multiple different ones (which to some degree is the current status within the EU too).\nHow those rules are executed is orthogonal to it, and I would say that most proponents of the EU will agree, that there is room for improvement, as you surely will with how things are run in the UK.<p>The power is not simply given to Brussels, your government has in most cases a veto. And depending on how your parliament has set up the checks and balances with your government, the agreements are subject to your parliaments approval.<p>In other cases it has go through EU parliament, and you can lobby your MEP.<p>So, in essence, it is not some anonymous thing in Brussel doing things, it is your government and your MEP to whom you can direct your complaints. In most cases though likely the very same government you still have to content with.')
