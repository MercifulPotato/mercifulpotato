I just don&#x27;t believe in the supernatural or any belief system that requires the breaking of the Second Law of Thermodynamics without any explanation of how.<p>Still the social aspects of religion are interesting.  What does &quot;more church&quot; look like if you&#x27;re an atheist?  More participatory sports clubs maybe?  Or, more things you can walk to and do regularly with the same people in general?')
