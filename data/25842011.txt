At no point did I think it was OK to fuck my students.  At no point did I think it was OK if my TA fucked our students. \n In fact, not only did I not think it was OK, it was pretty clearly relayed to me that it was not OK per the university&#x27;s employee guidelines.  I was told to not even let a student close the door during office hours &quot;just in case.&quot;<p>The line that&#x27;s crossed isn&#x27;t about the title someone has but the power structure in place.  Any teacher&#x2F;student romantic or sexual relationship is verboten at every educational institution  because of power dynamics.  If what she&#x27;s alleged to have done is not sexual misconduct then why the fuck was everyone so mad about Harvey Weinstein?')
