Problem was that I started using a computer around age 8 and really learned touch type around age 11.<p>My finger placement is wrong, I don&#x27;t type in the &quot;correct way&quot;. But the typing course was graded on reaching X WPM with no errors, which I could easily surpass. The teacher allowed me to pass with that. Now I still don&#x27;t place my fingers correctly and I can type about 152WPM with 100% accuracy (just tested on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monkey-type.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monkey-type.com&#x2F;</a>).')
