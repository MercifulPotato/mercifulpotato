Japan does however have a considerable adult animation market. The a.i. is not trained with any “anime”, however, but with still promotional art which is of far higher quality and clearly trained with the adult market where sexualization is, as one might expect, more common.<p>The paradox is that the unrealistically cute “<i>moe</i>” designs are typically targeted at adults and adolescents and most of the children&#x27;s antertainment does not look like that.<p>Often in Japan, one speaks of four principal demographics: young males, young females, older males, and older females. — the a.i. is quite clearly entirely trained with the “older males” demographic, which should be undertood to target around 18-30 years of age, and even within that demographic it is trained almost exclusively with <i>moe</i> art.<p>Most “anime” would not even be instantly recognized as such, which is why I think the term is fairly useless. — it seems when people speak of “anime” more often than not what they mean is “<i>moe</i> art” whether it be animated or not.<p>This is what the average “anime” looks like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.moomin.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;Moomin-animation-series-1969.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.moomin.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;Moomin-animation-s...</a>')
