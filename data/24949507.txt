Clarification would help anyone, especially since you’re apparently already prepared for, “anyone who denies this.”<p>Which examples of anti-asian violence occurred during the BLM protests? Can you be specific?<p>Which party was in power for both incidents you’ve mentioned? Why or why not does that matter?<p>What effects are those having on Asians? Is there an increase&#x2F;decrease in anti-asian crime?<p>Looking forward to your response.<p>Edit: Downvotes are fine, but consider that this post is merely asking for clarifications on a charged post and expressing no political opinions whatsoever.')
