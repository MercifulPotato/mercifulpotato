Item(by='ece', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606179125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186737, text='memtest exactly tests for different access patterns including attacks like Rowhammer. I also use Gentoo with background tasks like mprime&#x2F;foldingathome (they can catch memory errors too), and any gcc&#x2F;llvm errors would&#x27;ve been obvious by now (It&#x27;s easy to repeatably and reliably test checksums on every compiled package). DRAM errors get progressively worse, replace the module when you find any errors. Simple as that. Focusing on finding errors early and doing backups protects against almost all classes of failures for home PCs.<p>With a median of 10,000 FIT or lower, it&#x27;s zero errors every 5-10 years, and DDR4&#x2F;5 might actually be below that if the rate of improvement between DDR1&#x2F;2 was anywhere between 2x-10x continued. You&#x27;d have to overlook this important trend to see any benefit from ECC. Yes, there are DRAM errors, but if they can be found by memtest, bg scrubbing, self-tests and don&#x27;t affect low-use scenarios, then it&#x27;s meaningless to be talking about ECC for home use.<p>Setting speed and timings on ECC modules seems super flaky to me, do you know what speed and timings the separate ECC logic can handle? Can you turn off ECC and test DRAM independently? Maybe what you&#x27;re seeing is the ECC logic throwing errors and not the DRAM.')
