I also use Gentoo with background tasks like mprime&#x2F;foldingathome (they can catch memory errors too), and any gcc&#x2F;llvm errors would&#x27;ve been obvious by now (It&#x27;s easy to repeatably and reliably test checksums on every compiled package). DRAM errors get progressively worse, replace the module when you find any errors. Simple as that. Focusing on finding errors early and doing backups protects against almost all classes of failures for home PCs.<p>Setting speed and timings on ECC modules seems super flaky to me, do you know what speed and timings the separate ECC logic can handle? Can you turn off ECC and test DRAM independently? Maybe what you&#x27;re seeing is the ECC logic throwing errors and not the DRAM.')
