(Not true at the moment, because all gyms are closed in my area right now.) That commute gives me time to wake up and get into the gym mindset.<p>After work, it gives me time to unwind, let go of the stress for the day, and get into my dad-of-4 mindset.<p>Without it, everything blends together. My work days would never really start and never really end.')
