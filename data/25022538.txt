Society functions because it is comprised of individuals overall working together.<p>Like, seriously, you can&#x27;t keep using public infrastructure and services and think taxes are slavery. The amount of shit you use daily that is funded by your taxes, hell, that is funded by <i>my</i> taxes as well from across the globe, is unreal. You would have to go find some virgin island and live off the land of you were to take this ridiculous argument to its logical conclusion.<p>And you&#x27;re probably paying for private insurance right now. Either because you have to, or because your employer makes you. A socialized healthcare system would be more efficient and fair on everyone, you included. How do I know? I had to have sinusoidal surgery two years ago and didn&#x27;t have to run a fucking indigogo campaign to pay for it.<p>Increasing taxes is not increasing slavery.<p>Decreasing taxes is not reducing slavery.<p>Socialized healthcare is not slavery.')
