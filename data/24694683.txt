They already had a strong market position and it would have been capitalist suicide to abandon it wholesale. I don&#x27;t agree that it sucks compared to Spotify, but it does cater to a different audience, preferring curation over algorithms.<p>Apple TV+ is indeed a curious one. Personally I think it&#x27;s as simple as being a placeholder to allow Apple to make strategic choices in future, if they ever choose to compete aggressively with Netflix, Amazon etc.<p>I think the real weird one is finance. While Apple Pay is obvious, Apple Card is not. Banking is desperate for technological upheaval but many fintech start-ups are already doing a good job of thisâ€”at least in some countries like the UK.')
