In my mind it seemed as serious as if there was an active shooter somewhere.<p>I was <i>literally</i> the only person in the group to fucking book it to a fire exit. Everybody else was just casually standing in line, like you seriously couldn&#x27;t make up how serious they made the situation sound and how little just about everybody did to care.<p>It was over in about 5 minutes, I never heard any explanation as to why it had happened aside from a rumour that somebody was vaping in the lobby and did not leave when asked to. And this is like, the biggest hotel in DTLA, during a massive convention.<p>Not entirely relevant... but weird ass experience. People react to things strangely.')
