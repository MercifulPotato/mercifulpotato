Ron Hubbard, and Robert Heinlein made a bar bet in the late 30&#x27;s about who could make a book that could better form the basis of religion.<p>L. Ron Hubbard used his offing to create the Church of Scientology.<p>Asimov&#x27;s Foundation (the omnipotent and all knowing moon) was eventually the inspiration for Musk&#x27;s SpaceX and Tesla, which (no matter what you think of him or his companies) has definitely moved the bar on electric cars etc, self driving, space development, satellite deployment etc. - no knowing where the influence of that will end.<p>Heinlein, with &quot;Stranger in a strange land&quot; was more reserved, and included tracings of the actual work of Hubbard. It becoming famous when it was quoted in some court case as the blueprint for using religion to milk the system  - don&#x27;t recall the details now.<p>Point is, sometimes the darndest of things will change the world. Make every minute count.')
