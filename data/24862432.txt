Item(by='aditguptalula', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1603395337, title='Lula: Convenience Goods Delivery', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Dear HN Community:<p>My name is Adit, here with my friend Tom Falzani, and we co-founded Lula (www.luladelivery.com). Lula is a marketplace made from the thousands of items sold by convenience stores, bodegas, and other such retail stores. We (users) pay a monthly subscription ($12) to get access to unlimited deliveries (without tips, other fees, etc.)<p>We charge stores a $200&#x2F;month subscription to get access to unlimited deliveries, inventory management platform, and we&#x27;re working to build integration for ordering&#x2F;replenishing store inventory from wholesalers.<p>For users, we&#x27;re building a platform that is sort of like Amazon, but for under 1-hour delivery. Users get an experience of thousands of convenience goods to choose from - a list made dynamically based on the products available in their area from a multi-vendor approach.<p>We have officially ended our (alpha) and made Lula public! We are currently available in NJ and PA. I simply posted this to get your feedback, thoughts, advice. Tom and I built Lula because our family had to permanently close down a retail store (no e-commerce platforms available). And we hope Lula can provide support to over 150k convenience stores in the country.<p>Please feel free to learn more at Luladelivery.com! Or Simply ask questions here :)<p>Best Wishes,\nAdit &amp; Tom')
