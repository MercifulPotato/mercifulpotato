I&#x27;m not a Republican, I&#x27;m not even an American, and I see a lot of issues with how this election was conducted. Maybe you don&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t want to. Maybe the end justifies the means. But when the shoe is on the other foot, remember this garbage you just posted to HN before you start crying foul.<p>If I was an American I&#x27;d want to be confident in the election process. I don&#x27;t know how one remains confident with videos of election observers being removed from counting areas to rousing applause, videos of counting areas being blocked off from observers using cardboard and other opaque barriers, video of ballots being counted after election observers had gone home for the night, hundreds of witnesses reporting irregularities, etc.<p>The country I&#x27;m from isn&#x27;t perfect when it comes to elections, either. But given its immense power in the world, I&#x27;m greatly concerned with what I&#x27;ve observed in the United States.')
