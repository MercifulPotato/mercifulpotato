The origins of the EU were founded to end the endless wars between Europe&#x27;s powerful nations and we haven&#x27;t had a Franco-Germanic war since its inception. The wealth across the entire EU has increased with initiatives like the Schengen acquis, international relations are closer than ever and the freedoms European citizens have gotten out of it are unlike anything imaginable before. Many people inside of the EU are identifying themselves more as &quot;European citizens&quot; than as &quot;German&#x2F;Spanish&#x2F;Polish&quot; citizens.<p>It&#x27;s fair to say that the EU has no traditions outside those necessary for keeping the government running, but traditions form over lifetimes and even just the origins of the EU are little more than 60 years old. Give it some time and humans will create their silly little traditions.<p>The EU&#x27;s origin is not one of conquest, but one of peace and prosperity. If people cannot stand behind the EU because it was not formed by violence, then the problem is not with the symbols or stories themselves but with people&#x27;s tendency to value righteous conquest over peace and prosperity.<p>Several countries, including my own, have always kept at a distance because they did not want to be dissolved into an overarching government or because they wanted to keep their cultural independence. The UK is one of the most extreme examples of those; they&#x27;ve tried to fight EU legislation tooth and nail against the union they&#x27;ve voluntarily joined. The way Britain behaved in the EU makes me feel that they should have stayed out and signed agreements like Norway and Switzerland signed instead, though I suppose the limitations of the power they could exercise to neighbouring states would not have been enticing.')
