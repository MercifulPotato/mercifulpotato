PediaLyte and Ensure are <i>vastly</i> different products. Ensure is a weight gain meal replacement drink and PediaLyte is fancy gatorade.<p>Soylent is somewhere between Slimfast and Ensure. I&#x27;m not positive there&#x27;s a quality calorically balanced meal replacement drink out there? Maybe there is, but whatever that is, Soylent is the branded version of that. Not PediaLyte or Ensure.')
