Item(by='hnick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607812061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399180, text='Exactly, gamers have gone from thinking horse armor is stupid to now accepting &quot;only cosmetic&quot; and it&#x27;s a problem.<p>Are you going to put better looking items in the game for free if you could charge $20 in the store? Are you going to spend time writing an engaging and rewarding quest line when you can just throw a price tag on it? Games do need content so they won&#x27;t do this for everything, but the mere existence of a cash shop and MTX is a perverse incentive on development quality. It also often ruins the cosmetic experience of the rest of us, with knights running around wearing angel wings for some weird reason.<p>That aside, Jim Sterling brought up something I hadn&#x27;t even considered since I&#x27;m too old. Kids getting bullied because their Fortnite characters only have the default skins and they can&#x27;t afford (or aren&#x27;t allowed) to buy anything else. &quot;Only cosmetic&quot; indeed!')
