When you are stuck just doing JS powered SPAs, an &lt;a&gt; tag seems like advanced technology!<p>I ended up at a new school creating a new curriculum. This approach is where we &quot;recapitulate the evolution of  the web&quot;, so we start with SSGs &amp; server-side programming (Python&#x2F;Django), then only at the end cover SPAs and React.JS -- since, as you mentioned, that&#x27;s still the main skillset that companies are new devs for.')
