Most the reasons stated are basically what <i>we</i> will supposedly benefit. There is literally no reason from GitHub&#x27;s point of view why they would be interested in creating such a product to begin with.<p>Of course, there might be reasons form Microsoft to create an alternative to the App Stores say for a gaming marketplace etc. But specifically for GitHub I cannot see why they would be interested in the overhead.')
