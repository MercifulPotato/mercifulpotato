I&#x27;ve found this style of programming a little difficult. It&#x27;s imperative that you rerun from scratch regularly so that the state in your living instance doesn&#x27;t digress from the theoretical state obtained from running your source.<p>Ideally for me, I&#x27;d prefer to just hit a button and it rerun to the same place instantaneously (with a full debugger to deeply inspect state, of course).')
