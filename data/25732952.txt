Where you see “pro-censorship”, many see speech that historically has never been protected<p>I didn&#x27;t use the word &quot;bizarrely&quot; and I&#x27;m not talking about condemnation of unprotected speech (and again, not just because I&#x27;m not from the USA). I&#x27;ve seen people arguing that the concept of free speech itself is &quot;outdated&quot; and that societies that hold it are &quot;doomed to collapse&quot;, and that&#x27;s just an example.<p>&gt; [Trump]<p>Again, I wasn&#x27;t talking about parler nor about Trump. I would appreciate it if you stopped trying to imply that I&#x27;m talking about stuff I&#x27;m not, or steering the conversation toward subjects I&#x27;ve never even alluded to.')
