Item(by='bigwavedave', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602029666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701692, text='&gt; Saying negative things is just negative, full stop.<p>I dunno, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s always an absolute. Example: your boss says the budget has been slashed and the department head will be downsizing the whole department by 50% in the coming months. This is very obviously a negative thing, but is your boss doing you a disservice by giving you a heads up? &quot;Oh but he should give me guidance that I should work diligently but also prepare resumes and look into other options.&quot; Of course they should and it would be really nice if they also could find out for sure if your head is on the chopping block- but let me ask you this: even if your boss doesn&#x27;t offer this very obvious advice or have any insight into the department head&#x27;s persona non grata list, is knowing about this negative truth a net-negative for any employee this concerns? Of course not.<p>Or even more relevant to HN: a very outgoing individual who loves the face-to-face environment of the office has just been told that the CEO has decided everyone will be 100% remote starting next week until 2022. Is being told this negative truth a net-negative for the social butterfly employee who now at least has a brief chance to wrap their head around the idea and mentally prepare for the change instead of being blindsided?<p>Sometimes simply raising awareness that a negative thing is happening isn&#x27;t a bad thing.')
