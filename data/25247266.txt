Took [horse-drawn street] cars across town.  Saw a woman get into car that [who] was so tall and frightfully thin as well as dried up that my mechanical mind at once conceived the idea that it would be the proper thing to run a lancet into her arm and knee joints and insert automatic self feeding oil cups to diminish the creaking when she walked.<p>Classy. This would probably be a tweet today, whoops.<p>Any people doing a diary today? How does it help you and do you refer back to it?
