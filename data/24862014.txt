Make ransoms impossible and they will start selling the data or monetizing it in other ways (identity theft, card fraud, etc), at the expense of the public.<p>Given that we can&#x27;t eradicate this kind of crime entirely by improving security, I think ransomware is the least bad option in the sense that it punishes the offending company while minimizing the risk of the data being leaked which would hurt the data subjects themselves (the public).')
