Item(by='mikepurvis', descendants=None, kids=[24983618], score=None, time=1604431592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24982380, text='I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the legal framework is around it, but Canada&#x27;s monopoly network operators (Rogers for coax, Bell for copper) are I believe required to sell bulk bandwidth to MVNO-style carriers. I&#x27;ve been a long-time TekSavvy customer, and certainly I get way better pricing from them than I would buying equivalent service directly from Rogers. And for what it&#x27;s worth, when I tracert out of my house, the very first hop (9ms away) is a TekSavvy IP address which geolocates to a point in my neighbourhood, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going through a ton of Rogers infrastructure to get to them (unless it&#x27;s all transparent and extremely low latency).<p>There isn&#x27;t much of a difference on the service side either; the trucks which come around here are all third party fulfillment firms regardless of who your ISP is (and they have super-bland, forgettable names like &quot;Dependable HomeTech&quot;)')
