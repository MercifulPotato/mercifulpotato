When did workers create the wealth, exactly?  If you&#x27;re talking about Apple&#x27;s first five employees, sure, they could have bought in for not very much money in 1980 or whatever (they probably <i>were</i> part-owners and&#x2F;or paid in equity!).  But there weren&#x27;t any profits in 1980, either, nor for a long time.  And most employees have probably moved on in that 40-year window.<p>Someone joining Apple <i>today</i> did not create any of that wealth.<p>Not sure why a random hire today &quot;rightfully&quot; deserves some huge transfer of wealth from the &quot;capitalist owners&quot; (read: owners) on their start date.  Can you elaborate on that step?')
