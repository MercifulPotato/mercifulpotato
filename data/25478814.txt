What&#x27;s the rationale, besides personal benefit&#x2F;preference? Taxing money in motion reduces motion, which is hardly a good thing except when the motion itself is illusory arbitrage (e.g. HFT).<p>&gt; double jeopardy laws<p>Double jeopardy is a concept of <i>criminal</i> law applied to <i>humans</i>. It&#x27;s certainly the wrong term here, and arguably the wrong concept. Even your own &quot;time of use&quot; standard leads to the same money being taxed multiple times. Why should it be any different when assets are held instead of exchanged (see above about money in motion)? Henry George and others have made eloquent arguments for taxing wealth - especially land - instead of income. It has been tried many places and times, generally with good results. Do you have any <i>substantive</i> counterargument, or just random phrases plucked from a pseudo-libertarian website?')
