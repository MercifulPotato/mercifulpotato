We are talking about video games. It is just entertainment we are talking about. Get a grip!<p>I picture you decrying the same thing about the telephone, in 1949 when the us government sued at&amp;t &amp; forced them to sell off Western Electric, the maker of telephones. And again in 1959 when Carterphone was created &amp; AT&amp;T sued, forbidding anyone else from connecting their own devices. It&#x27;s just a telephone! What harm is there in consumers being forced to use only no-fuss officially endorsed solutions. You can say whatever you want, do whatever you want, as long as you say it &amp; do it with an AT&amp;T product.<p>There are limits to innovation &amp; diversity, &amp; when left to rot, when too protected, systems ossify &amp; stagnate. Beyond the scary platform wars afoot, I think Linux has absolutely cutting edge drivers in some places that can do things absolutely no other tech out there can. DMA-BUF &amp; PipeWire are in early early days but already showing incredibly promising zero-copy streaming that few if any can replicate, for example. Linux drivers push advanced features to devices that mainstream support has moved past years ago, while increasingly offering best of breed implementations of cutting edge features &amp; rapid adoption of Vulkan standards &amp; extensions.<p>The other topic worth mentioning is systems like Stadia, which is Linux based. Maybe that wasn&#x27;t necessary, but it is a strong indicator to me that Linux is an interesting &amp; worthwhile place for gaming. That there&#x27;s interesting stories of system utilization &amp; decreasing latency that no other platform could have provided. New frontiers are possible, because the platform is not closed, and that enables new interesting gaming to emerge.')
