Even less a set with actual translations for them.<p>This also means that autocomplete etc is pretty much useless for us. I just disable it on iPhone as it actively makes typing out a sentence harder.<p>(also to make things harder as others have pointed out the base word and inflections get changed to make the word easier to pronounce so there is no static form for them when you stack them)')
