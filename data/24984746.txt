Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604442495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981191, text='&gt; Because Sweden didn&#x27;t mandate masks.<p>I can not read the parent post since it was deleted, but...<p>&gt; First, Sweden had more deaths per capital than most countries.<p>Then again, most of those deaths occurred in care homes where the infection was spread by personnel who did not follow the personal protection mandates because they could not read the (Swedish) instructions. The number and outcome of infections outside of these facilities does not seem to be markedly different from that in states which have strong masking mandates, Italy being a good example of such.<p>&gt; Second, even if it had very good numbers, that would not mean that masks aren&#x27;t effective.<p>The fact of Swedish numbers - outside of the care facilities which I mentioned above - not being markedly worse than those in places with strong masking mandates does indicate that masking is not an effective way of limiting the spread of the disease, unless those places with strong masking mandates have other practices which lead to increased infection rates which level out the gains from masking compared to Swedish numbers.<p>There is no doubt that the <i>correct</i> use of the <i>correct type</i> of masks can help limit the spread of aerosol-borne infectious agents. The problem with masking mandates is that most people do not know how to correctly use masks, nor do most people have access to the correct type of mask. Re-using masks, handling potentially infected masks without care, storing used masks together with unused ones in coat pockets, there are many ways in which a masking mandate can negate any potential benefits from masks or even lead to a worse outcome. This is also one of the reasons for the different opinion on whether to implement masking mandates in different countries, e.g. Anders Tegnell (who leads the SARS2-campaign in Sweden) does not support a masking mandate. Fauci did not support masking but has changed his opinion on the matter for reasons as of yet unknown.<p>Masks do not save lives. Masks <i>can save lives when of the correct type, used correctly</i>. This is a big difference.')
