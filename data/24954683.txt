And there is definitely a limit on global throughput of dollar movement, which is roughly the slowest processing rate of all the bank compliance divisions involved in the transfer. For complex cross-border transfers there may be more than 2 banks involved.<p>Greater amounts still would attract even more scrutiny due to AML and KYC regulations in most jurisdictions.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with capital controls, which many large economies now have, the complexity is exponentially higher. You&#x27;re also assuming that telecommunications networks, physical infrastructure, particularly power, are in good working order when you want to do the transfer. That may be the case 99.99% of the time, but the edge case should also be a consideration.')
