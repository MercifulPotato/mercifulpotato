What if the power company tell the individuals, &quot;we do not wish to supply electricity to you&quot;. Or their phone company.<p>It would be a bit like China&#x27;s social score and the banishment of people deemed bad by the system, but with an interesting corporate twist. Will there be a Trump-loving phone company to service these people, powered by Trump-loving electricity supplier? It&#x27;d be the libertarian wet dream.<p>And what if it starts hitting people I&#x27;m sympathetic with? PayPal froze WikiLeaks&#x27; account and I found that to be a cowardly action by them.')
