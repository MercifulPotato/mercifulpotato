I think that there is an uncomfortably common belief that cheating is done to prevent randomness from interfering with the &quot;correct&quot; outcome. A bunch of people think &quot;well, our system is great and we just don&#x27;t want something weird to happen in the test that makes it seem otherwise&quot;. It starts with the assumption that your system is already good before the test is done.')
