Then OP generalizes and says that HR is not effective and not your friend. However, there are many gray areas where it&#x27;s hard to justify firing someone. For example, let&#x27;s say this person was acting passively aggressively and ignoring&#x2F;avoiding someone. Is that a fireable offense? I am not sure it is. There are also very clearcut situations, like harassment or racism or aggression. But there are a lot of gray areas also.')
