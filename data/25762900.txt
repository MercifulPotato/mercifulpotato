And even if they don&#x27;t, this is something that can be worked around in various ways.<p>The <i>real</i> issue is whether or not to use that vendor directory, or to always use generic Debian-provided versions of those dependencies, or some mix of both. This is less of a purely technical issue like the above, and more of a UX&#x2F;&quot;how should Debian behave&quot;-kind of issue.')
