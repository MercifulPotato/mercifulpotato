Taylor. A four book series, haven&#x27;t read the rest of the books.<p>Children of time - A. Tchaikovsky<p>The Unicorn Project - G. Kim. This would be especially interesting for the HN crowd. It&#x27;s not sf per se, rather more than contemporary fiction, but the main theme is about programming and politics in a big corporation. Quite original and a lot of fun.<p>Agency - W. Gibson<p>The space between worlds - M. Johnson<p>To sleep in a sea of stars - C. Paolini<p>The algebraist - I. Banks<p>Hope you&#x27;ll find something to your liking. Happy new year.')
