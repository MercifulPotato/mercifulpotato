I&#x27;m also at a similar point in my career, and my experiences have been really different. I still enjoy my work more than ever. I&#x27;ve never worked in &quot;big tech&quot; that long. However, I do agree that companies become more corporate over time so it&#x27;s up to you to fight back against these tendencies and make the job you really like. Of course that is harder in large companies but it is still doable to make an enjoyable niche.')
