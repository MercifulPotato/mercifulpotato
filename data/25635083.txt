The idea of giving up the fancy things that you&#x27;ve worked hard for, maybe having to sell your house, take your kids out of a school you pay for, etc just so you can leave the company you work for and go somewhere &#x27;better&#x27; is a <i>hard</i> choice that no doubt feels selfish. The decision has a significant and material impact on other people after all.<p>Very few of us would prefer to earn a 250k salary that comes with the freedom to move to other companies, even though that&#x27;s <i>a lot</i>, if there&#x27;s a 600k job on offer instead. We&#x27;d all take the higher paying job and maybe regret it later. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very fair to suggest those who are in that position are wrong or stupid to have put themselves there.')
