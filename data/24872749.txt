I end up just rolling my own format because it&#x27;s so much simpler and I can take all the tradeoffs that benefit what I&#x27;m doing instead of what anyone might possibly do with it. this doesn&#x27;t apply in many situations (i.e. sending data to outside parties) but I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of success with it that seems at odds with conventional wisdom on the subject.')
