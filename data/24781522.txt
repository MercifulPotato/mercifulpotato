I didn&#x27;t read everything, but skimmed some of your materials online and most of this seems to be right on point in my view (having done hundreds of interviews and looked at thousands of resumes).<p>A few points you touch on that I really like:<p>* Leave out extraneous stuff... photos, references, etc. I don&#x27;t need to know where you went to high school (assuming you are a college grad). I&#x27;ll ask for references after I hire you.<p>* Check typos and formatting. I know some hiring managers who will let typos, formatting issues and grammar mistakes slip. Personally, I look for them and will likely disqualify you if I see them (I&#x27;ll be more lenient if English isn&#x27;t your first language). If you can&#x27;t keep bugs out of your resume, which is a one to two page document, how can I expect you&#x27;ll keep them out of your code? Also pro tip: always PDF resumes so formatting is consistent and doesn&#x27;t show the squiggly lines that word document spell checkers show.<p>I general, I&#x27;m always surprised by resumes that try to stick out with gimmicks like charts or color, or whatnot. I&#x27;ve looked over high hundreds (or low thousands) of resumes and the ones that stick out are usually black and white, well formatted, straight to the point, brief and don&#x27;t have glaring errors.')
