It&#x27;s a library that helps you write tests by generating dummy data - even if this was GPL it would have no impact (except maybe scaring some people from using it or making it a non starter in companies with policies banning GPL). You will never distribute your tests to the client and if you&#x27;re running test you already have access to the code.<p>And this is trivial but tedious code that you could replace on the spot.<p>I&#x27;m not dissing the author but these rants about opensource licensing and whatnot are completely out of touch.<p>Most (but importantly not all) of serious non-trivial open-source is sponsored by big corporations or academia so this stealing narrative is ridiculous, and MIT&#x2F; Apache is an excellent licence that successfully facilitates collaboration on some of the largest OSS projects out there so there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using them.')
