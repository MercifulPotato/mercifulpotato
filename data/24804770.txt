These inane rules waste millions of hours and cause untold disruptions for not only no benefit to europe, they managed to completely obliterate whatever was left of european advertising agencies. I struggle to think of one thing that EU has done to help us small-time tech people, other than giving pacifying subsidies that are wasted on travel expenses and stacks of printed paper. (and tbh i dont like advertising, but it feels like there s just nothing unregulated in europe anymore, it&#x27;s a dead land)')
