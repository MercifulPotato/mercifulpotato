These ragas are usually meant to be played at different times of day&#x2F;year or to evoke certain moods. Players will improvise these raags, interpreting not only their &quot;version&quot; of the song, but custom jamming a version specifically for that place and time and audience. Some of these raags have a very long history. I think when people talk about &quot;classical&quot; Indian music this is what they mean. Temporary it&#x27;s deeply historical music that is constantly evolving.<p>I&#x27;m generalizing and glossing over so much to be brief, and much of this varies by region and tradition, but that&#x27;s a gist.')
