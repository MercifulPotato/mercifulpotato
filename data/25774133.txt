A single, hi-res, (possibly oled?) screen that needs to be replaced in its entirety vs a bunch of individual components which can be individual replaced. The up-front cost may not be too different (possibly the screen is cheaper?) but how robust, how much flex, how much tolerance to vibration does it need to have over 5-10-15 years? And good luck getting one in 15 years. A knob is still a knob even on a wreck. An intact screen? Rare as hen&#x27;s teeth I imagine. Increasing obsolescence right there.')
