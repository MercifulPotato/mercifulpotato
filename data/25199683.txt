Someday you&#x27;ll be on the losing end of a lottery limited to &quot;eligible&quot; people. The draft to Vietnam. Getting Parkinsons. Being born across the street, from the better zipcode.<p>Just because in some abstract mathematical sense they&#x27;re fair, doesn&#x27;t mean lotteries are equitable or just in the way people care about.<p>Besides, the idea that it&#x27;s wasted or neglected, it&#x27;s crap. The government has basically unlimited resources. How much money did we borrow, how many checks did we cut in the last 7 months, and what were the implications really? It is never about making the most of a scarce resource, there is never really scarcity. And maybe it&#x27;s not justice either.<p>Nobody has a right to charge a person rent who would have gotten a free, beautiful government apartment instead. However, because that landlord wants Birkin bags, and the government will simply never, under any circumstances, give out free Birkin bags on purpose, the landlord is going to be rationally, legitimately mad about free apartments. That&#x27;s the antagonist, not the government.<p>And the reason we have a less interesting world than the humanistic one you propose is, landlords care more about fucking Birkin bags than say, art and writing.')
