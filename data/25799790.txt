Less cited papers are sometimes poorly executed research, but often they also just represent dead ends and uninteresting avenues that would&#x27;ve eventually needed to be explored. they don&#x27;t form the foundation for lots of new research, but collectively they are important for directing things in the right direction. In that sense the citation count undervalues their collective worth. I don&#x27;t buy the idea that we could get rid of the vast majority of them and the high impact work would be done just the same.')
