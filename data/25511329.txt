I can make a decent guess by two important factors to your post and a third supposition. 1) you specify ads on the internet (this is actually important because it specifically refers to your <i>digital</i> footprints) 2) you say you&#x27;re not in the West and suggest a smaller developing country. I don&#x27;t think it is unlikely then that you aren&#x27;t as well tracked around the web. 3) more speculation, but judging by you being on HN and saying &quot;when I do get them&quot; I&#x27;m guessing you use ad blockers or have some privacy preserving features that help. This also reduces your digital footprint and irrelevant ads would be a marker of success of these products instead of irrelevance of ads (if 3 doesn&#x27;t apply to you, I know it is applying to some here and they aren&#x27;t thinking about it this way).<p>But I guess some things to look out for. There are far more than just &quot;you might be interested in this product&quot; type of ads. There are political ads, public awareness ads, moral campaigns&#x2F;religious ads. There are ads that aren&#x27;t intended to get you to buy a product but rather to be satisfied with your purchase (see coke). There are ads that are used to sell prestige and status associated with a brand (see cars and watches). There&#x27;s native advertising[0] which often goes unnoticed and is a frequent guest on HN. The tricky things of ads is that they come in a wide variety of flavors but people think &quot;coke&quot; is the only kind of soda. It is also a cat and mouse game. Old Spice created their ridiculous ads (called anti-advertising) to stand out because saturation of one type took over. Native advertising has been growing over the last decade and taken prominence in the space and the entire intent of native advertising is to be an ad without the reader&#x2F;viewer knowing that they are watching an ad.<p>Sure, maybe they don&#x27;t affect you. But how sure can you be? Especially with the knowledge of native advertising. But let&#x27;s <i>assume</i> they do not work on you. Does it matter if they work on others? It would be an absurd notion to suggest that they don&#x27;t. With hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on ads per year (by single companies!) it would be a bit odd for them to be throwing this money down the drain. It would be a bit odd for politicians to do this as well. And once you accept the notion that political ads are a thing I think you have to accept that ads can persuade people to do things beyond buying a product. Carnegie and Rockafeller both used advertising to increase their public image in the early 20th century.<p>It would be odd for people to spend so much money on something that isn&#x27;t effective.<p>Edit: I wanted to give a good example. If you watch &quot;The Boys&quot; on Amazon Prime (great show) you can see how Starfire&#x27;s memes are all in fact a part of a marketing scheme and about brand awareness. This would be a version of native advertising, and one we&#x27;ve seen quite frequently, especially around political campaigns. But I don&#x27;t think these types of memes even register as ads in most peoples&#x27; minds.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Native_advertising" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Native_advertising</a>')
