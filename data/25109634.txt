Item(by='msla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605517346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109496, text='&gt; There is a minus sign and the speed of light in front of time in the space-time metric.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s called the Minkowski metric, and it&#x27;s absolutely nothing new.<p>You can do the exact same physics with the opposite sign convention (called the signature of the metric), where time has a positive sign and all three spatial dimensions have negative signs; the only rule is that time has to be the odd one out, so rotations in a space-time plane obey hyperbolic geometry as opposed to Euclidean. You can get rid of the factor of c by moving to a different system of units, commonly called the natural units, where the speed of light is 1.<p>All of this is covered in any real introduction to Special Relativity, which, in turn, is at the beginning of any course on Modern Physics, as opposed to the Newtonian Physics.<p>Welcome to Spacetime:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.av8n.com&#x2F;physics&#x2F;spacetime-welcome.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.av8n.com&#x2F;physics&#x2F;spacetime-welcome.htm</a><p><i>THE GEOMETRY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY</i> with the quote:<p><i>Lorentz transformations are just hyperbolic rotations.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.science.oregonstate.edu&#x2F;~tevian&#x2F;physics&#x2F;paradigm9&#x2F;sample&#x2F;excerpt2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.science.oregonstate.edu&#x2F;~tevian&#x2F;physics&#x2F;paradig...</a>')
