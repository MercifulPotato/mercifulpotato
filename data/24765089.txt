Item(by='lowdanie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602593507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764259, text='Your method is similar to a popular probabilistic technique called simulated annealing [1].<p>The general setting for this type of algorithm is that you have a large number of states and you want to find the state that maximizes a particular score. In the TSP, the states are paths and the score is the (negative of the) path length. The idea is to define a Markov Chain whose stationary distribution is proportional to the score. This means that if you jump from state to state according to the probabilities defined by the MC, eventually the probability of ending up at a given state is proportional to that states score.<p>In the case of TSP the states can be represented as permutations of the cities and the neighbors of a state are given by swapping the positions of two cities. The probability of moving to a neighbor is high if the length of the neighbor is shorter than the current path.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simulated_annealing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simulated_annealing</a>')
