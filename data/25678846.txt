I replied to another user to explain in, hopefully adequate enough detail, that I did not in any means attempt to equivocate yesterday&#x27;s rioters to antifa, BLM protestors, or the participants of the George Floyd protests. My only intention was to maybe prevent a flamewar from erupting in these comments.')
