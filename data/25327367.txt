If you can select an area where the person may have a pre-formed opinion that you know is objectively unwarranted with current data, you can present that data and see their reaction. Intelligent people tend to be open to and actively enjoy recieiving new information which challenges and alters their opinion, creating a more informed and more well founded perspective. Insecure, groupthink people will instead vehemently deny the validity of the new information and rigidly stick to a pre-formed opinion. This is a clear sign of a limited capacity for critical thinking.<p>Edit: Just realised Alan Kay said this more succinctly. <i>A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.</i>')
