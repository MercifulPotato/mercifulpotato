There&#x27;s definitely some benefit to being a large country, such as loose borders and a common currency.<p>Another thing to consider is that some states are rich, some are not. In many countries, it&#x27;s because the big cities are getting rich off the less developed, but resource rich states. You&#x27;d have taxes heavily distributed to industrialised or develop highways in an industrial state. The poorer states are used for oil or corn farming. A richer state processes that into soda. And an even richer city has all the CEOs, lawyers, marketers, banks, etc, used to power that soda company.')
