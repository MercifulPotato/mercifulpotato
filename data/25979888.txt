Do you just not interact with the scientific Python community? Your anecdata that is blind to large swathes of the community is no more valid than my firsthand experiences. This comes off as defensive, not informed.<p>It&#x27;s an objective fact that Python 3 was not adopted quickly (given various EOL deadline extensions) and that plenty of libraries are stuck on 2, so your point that types have been around for 10 years is not really an argument that I can actually expect to be able to use types when working within the ecosystem.')
