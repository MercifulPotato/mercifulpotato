The &#x27;town square&#x27; is a shopping mall full of products and services <i>designed elsewhere</i>.<p>In crude market terms it&#x27;s &#x27;more efficient&#x27; to close the local coffee shop, put up a Starbucks and have workers take marching orders from Seattle where they can concentrate Product Innovation and R&amp;D.<p>Canada used to have a few automakers - but with &#x27;consolidation&#x27; they were all bought by US firms - which in raw market terms, makes some sense.<p>The same would happen to all protected industries: Bell&#x2F;Telus, CTV&#x2F;Global, CIBC&#x2F;BMO - all of it them be snapped up instantly if they were not protected.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if AT&amp;T&#x2F;Verizon are &#x27;well managed&#x27; or &#x27;poorly managed&#x27; relative to Bell&#x2F;Telus - the fact is they are 15x bigger and that&#x27;s that. &#x27;Headquarters&#x27; will be in Virginia, not Toronto. And that&#x27;s where the surpluses will go.<p>Canada brings in tons of &#x27;educated workers&#x27; and then sends the best and brightest of them right away to the US (I&#x27;ve seen this happen time and time again). Who can blame anyone with &#x27;no ties&#x27; to Canada moving on for 2x salary? So Canada gets &#x27;good workers&#x27; ... and the US gets &#x27;the talent&#x27;.<p>An Ontario MP, trying to attract Cisco to Toronto indicated that Canadians work for less salary than Americans and that he would do everything within his power to keep it that way.<p>So there you have <i>literally</i> the leadership trying to do what they can to keep salaries low, to keep the system firmly in &#x27;2cnd place&#x27;, by design.<p>This is the Canadian National Strategy.<p>If you want to do something exceptional, go to specific places in the US where systems are designed for that.<p>The theory being that it&#x27;s better than being in a left out US state like Arkansas, West Virginia etc..<p>In some ways, it&#x27;s commendable, because Canada relative to the world has a really high standard of living, stable &#x27;everything&#x27;, good basic rights etc.. But of course, there is not a lot meaningful to do. That&#x27;s the deal.')
