I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s good for society to have corporations that are this large and this powerful.<p>I also believe that <i>every</i> association of citizens should have civil liberties. I have no desire or plans to become Facebook, but I want the freedom to make much smaller companies (or collectives, or charitable organizations, or whatever) and have the discretion to associate with whomever I want. If that right is taken away from Facebook, I am harmed.<p>If the ability to become Facebook-scale is taken away from Facebook, I am not harmed, because I have no interest in doing so. So that&#x27;s what I advocate.<p>(If you search through my comment history, you can see this is not a new belief for me, e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19338090" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19338090</a> from two years ago agreeing unironically with Paul Graham&#x27;s strawman suggestion that Google should not exist, or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24797482" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24797482</a> from three months ago arguing in favor of Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s proposal, <i>and motivation</i>, to break up Big Tech in a specific way following specific principles.)<p>If <i>your</i> side wants power more than you want to stick to your expressed ideals, go ahead, but don&#x27;t drag me down to your level. My side&#x27;s ideals look like an opportunistic and self-contradictory version of laissez-faire libertarianism simply because our position is not laissez-faire libertarianism at all.')
