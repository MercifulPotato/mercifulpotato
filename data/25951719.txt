Item(by='nawgz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611879900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951382, text='&gt; If your &quot;short squeeze&quot; is dependent on people buying more in order to create a short squeeze<p>Who said that was the situation though?<p>The problem is that buying the stock became something that was largely barred from retail investors, while institutional investors faced no such issue. Indeed, when a stock can only be sold, that means it can only go down, so the pressure of the short squeeze was alleviated as a natural amount of selling occurred while buying was artificially deflated by multiple brokers and entities preventing retail investors from purchasing a stock that was &gt; 100% shorted.<p>This was guaranteed money for these traders too, the short squeeze was already on - the shorters were on the hook for this money.<p>The fact that there are huge financial relationships across the chain from one of the biggest shorters of the stock all the way to Robinhood makes this the controversy it is today. The market prevented natural market mechanics dictating a short squeeze that was already on.')
