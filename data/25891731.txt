It&#x27;s mindboggling how inefficient it actually is to encode every call through a bunch of layers, stuff it into a network stream, undo that on the other end, and then repeat on the way back.<p>Meanwhile, if you tick the right checkboxes on the infrastructure configuration, then a binary protocol between two Azure VMs can easily achieve a latency as low as 50 microseconds.')
