It just increases the money supply, while not increasing the amount of goods that one can buy with that money, hence by nature it is inflationary, ie it makes money less valuable. The market is complex and the effects may be postponed in time by years, but the fundamental mechanisms persist. The consequences are negative and sooner or later we will see them, or it is likely that we are already deeply affected.')
