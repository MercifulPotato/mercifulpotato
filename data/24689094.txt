Indicative of craft production is that things are unique, unpredictable, take a lot of time, cost a lot, require specialised maintenance, depend on the specific skills of the workers available at the time, and so on. Planning is virtually absent and things happen when the craftspeople think that sounds like a fun challenge for the day.<p>This is in contrast to e.g. mass production where humans are reduced to replaceable cogs and everything is build from meticulous blueprints by a separate department and planning happens in a waterfall-style way.<p>Which is in contrast to lean production where small cross-functional teams work on end-to-end stuff from the beginning of the project in quick iterations and with tight feedback cycles.')
