Only the season of the year can be deduced from the poem and that was established by a much older paper.<p>There is only one point in this criticism that is not valid, there is no doubt that the Pleiades referred to the same group of stars as now.<p>Nevertheless, when dealing with Ancient Greek or Latin texts it is necessary to be aware that a very large number of names used for animals, plants, minerals, places and so on, were used with a very different meaning than today, so Darin Hayton had good reasons to be cautious in his criticism.<p>Unless one is careful to make extensive searches through the literature, it is very easy to reach wrong conclusions based on misunderstood names.<p>For example the poems of Hesiod have several references to &quot;adamant&quot;, i.e. &quot;diamond&quot; in English, which are hard to understand by those who think that he referred to what is now called diamond.<p>In fact, Hesiod used the name &quot;adamant&quot; for nuggets of osmium-iridium alloy (collected from alluvial deposits of gold), so he appropriately mentioned it as grey material suitable for making a hard blade for a sickle that will cut anything.<p>Later Greek authors, like Plato used it with the same meaning as Hesiod. Pliny the Elder was the first author that mentioned the modern diamond, under the name &quot;Indian adamant&quot;, together with the previously known osmium-iridium &quot;adamant&quot;.')
