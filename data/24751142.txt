I get conflicting numbers on the actual decay time of these phosphors, but with a 240 fps camera the decay time is difficult to judge by flipping through frames.  I’d have to make a proper set up to try and even give an estimate.<p>I can safely say the P22 decay time is below 1 ms.  Here [0] it is stated to be 100 us for G &amp; B and up to 1 ms for red.  A commonly referenced list of phosphor decay times [1] lists it as “medium”.  In general, CRT phosphors seem to have sub 1-ms decay times unless you want a long persistence.<p>The limiting factors will be in a monitor’s max horizontal scan rate (typically 130 kHz or lower) or the DAC’s maximum pixel clock (it used to be 400 MHz but most VGA adapters these days struggle to keep 200+ MHz stable).<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epanorama.net&#x2F;documents&#x2F;video&#x2F;phosphor_decay.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epanorama.net&#x2F;documents&#x2F;video&#x2F;phosphor_decay.htm...</a><p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunkerofdoom.com&#x2F;tubes&#x2F;crt&#x2F;crt_phosphor_research.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunkerofdoom.com&#x2F;tubes&#x2F;crt&#x2F;crt_phosphor_research....</a>')
