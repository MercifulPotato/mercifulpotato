It says:<p>&quot;To be sure, the problem seems much less acute in harder sciences – e.g., physics, chemistry, cosmology – that have an established tradition of skepticism, replication, or even blinding researchers to their own conclusions.&quot;<p>Of is this because there are very few people who are trying to replicate the studies?  The equipment is a barrier.  Its not clear...<p>My second point regards innovation, is that surely replicability is essential.  If studies aren&#x27;t reliably replicated, what exactly can the innovation be?  So I see replication as a core issue.<p>Replicability is also only one of the problems science faces.  The other issue that isn&#x27;t well discussed, is that funding comes from 3 sources by and large - the government, the military and corporations.  We, as individuals, cannot assume that this method of funding will serve our interests.  Why would studies on &#x27;good food&#x27; receive funding over a new type of medication.  When the funding is tied to profit, or vested interests, there is only so much inclination to &#x27;rock the boat&#x27;.<p>But in general, I&#x27;m certainly glad this very major issue is being discussed.  I&#x27;m not holding my breath for any solutions.  And I only wish there was greater awareness of how much trust, or faith, goes into un-skeptical acceptance of scientific pronouncements.')
