There was no social network in the 2000s and before. No retweet button, no &quot;curated&quot; timeline that showed you what you &quot;like&quot;. YouTube did not try to push more videos like the ones you watched previously until the mid 2010s.<p>Free speech does not have the same meaning as before. Before it just meant that you could say whatever you wanted. Now people use it implicitly to mean that they can say whatever they want, but also that they are entitled to have their thoughts broadcasted at large using the amplification mechanisms I mentioned above.<p>While I believe free speech is a good thing, I believe free amplification is terrible.<p>If you think about it, before social networks, amplification was done through TV and newspapers, and those have editorial boards that filters the content they share. If a newspaper&#x27;s staff is pro-environment, they can prevent any columnist writing anything that denies climate change, and it&#x27;s not controversial.<p>However the problem is how do we decide who can get free amplification and who can&#x27;t? Based on what?\nMy preference would be that no one is, and we go back to uncurated things and to an internet where you have to look for the things you want to read&#x2F;watch, versus getting content pushed onto you.')
