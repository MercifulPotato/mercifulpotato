Besides,<p>&gt;&gt; Evidence was never actually heard in any courtroom<p>Well, that is a lie, many of his cases were thrown out due to lack of evidence and lack of witnesses willing to actually testify to anything. Guess where does that happen? In a courtroom. Where a judge looks at the case and decides whether to proceed with it or not. So all of these cases had their time in court, to say otherwise is just a lie. You, like many other people, seem to operate under the assumption that you first start a case, everyone gathers and <i>then</i> you present evidence. That&#x27;s not true, at least not in the US it isn&#x27;t. Evidence has to be presented when you file to open the case, and since there wasn&#x27;t any, judges have dismissed the cases. Why would they continue? So they could gather in an empty room listening to...nothing? Evidence can be admitted to the case later, with the permission of a judge, but you can&#x27;t just start a case with nothing in the first place, which is what Trump and his team were doing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;20b114b5-5419-493b-9923-a918a2527931" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;20b114b5-5419-493b-9923-a918a2527...</a><p>&gt;&gt;But continue to dismiss, continue to ignore<p>Well, thanks but I won&#x27;t, I think people trying to steal an election should be in jail, so my wish for 2021 is that we see trump and his cronies where they need to be - in prison. Either because of the election, or because of his many other crimes, I&#x27;m really not going to be fussy about it, he&#x27;s done enought to spend rest of his life behind bars, attorneys everywhere will have enough to bring him to justice.<p>&gt;&gt;Trump was just Hindenburg<p>Hindenburg represented the complete collapse and end of the entire airship industry, it has crashed and burnt and with it the entire trust and reputation these ships had. And it crashed and burnt because people in charge of building them wilfully ignored the dangers of building flying ships filled with explosive gas.<p>So yeah, I think this is a very apt comparison to trump - just probably not in the way you intend.')
