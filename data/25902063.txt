What&#x27;s your point?<p>There is a difference between HIV vs SARS-Cov2: If you get AIDS, your body does not have the capacity to recover from it on its own. So, 1) the chances of detecting dead material from a long gone infection are nil; and 2) the cost of a false negative is much higher than the cost of a false positive.<p>Since most people seem not to be seriously affected by a SARS-Cov2 infection, neither is true for SARS-Cov2. So, not agreeing on a fixed, reasonable, standard number of cycles which everyone uses has the consequence of inflating false positives for no gain. Note WHO&#x27;s updated information[1].<p>&gt; WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patientâ€™s viral load.<p>If you are not sick and your viral load is barely detectable, what&#x27;s the point?<p>See also Figure 1 in WHO&#x27;s lab guidance[2].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news&#x2F;item&#x2F;20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news&#x2F;item&#x2F;20-01-2021-who-information-not...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.who.int&#x2F;iris&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;10665&#x2F;334254&#x2F;WHO-2019-nCoV-laboratory-2020.6-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.who.int&#x2F;iris&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;10665&#x2F;334254&#x2F;WHO-...</a>')
