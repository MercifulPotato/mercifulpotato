I am looking to simulate &quot;real-world&quot; traffic and load before going live with the deployment to determine if the number of pods and number of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster is optimal also how the application performs.<p>The applications are python and have a standard HTTP web interface with an API REST backend.<p>Prefer a SaaS (paid ok) service.
