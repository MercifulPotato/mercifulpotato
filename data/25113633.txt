Nevertheless it is a very powerful domain tool for working in scientific computing and the number of functions related to technical domains that are surfaced in the language represents decades of meticulous expert domain expertise.<p>Can you explain this more?  Why is (i.e.) the Wolfram Programming Language best thought of as a &quot;domain&quot; tool, and not a general purpose programming language? Why couldn&#x27;t someone build an extraordinarily complex piece of software (say with millions of lines of code) under term-rewriting paradigm (like Wolfram) in a domain that has nothing to do with traditional mathematics&#x2F;scientific computing?<p>BTW, my favorite Wolfram fact is that it is the most concise programming language on the Rosetta: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.revolutionanalytics.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;which-programming-language-is-the-most-concise.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.revolutionanalytics.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;which-programmi...</a>')
