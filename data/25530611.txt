Ricci vs Perlman vs Shaham vs Midori vs Hahn vs Paganini, they all make the technique looks effortless. And the a lot reason why is because they&#x27;ve spent a lot of time removing bad tension from their playing.<p>While elbow positioning does matter, it is more a function of string and third vs fifth hand position. The fingerboard is curved, not flat, and you want the finger to land normal to the board for any given string.<p>Look for the work of Sol Babitz, or if you can&#x27;t find it, Borivoj Martinic-Jercic&#x27;s forward to his exercises.<p>For me, what helped the most was removing the shoulder rest during practice. You become accutely aware of the the delicate balancing act that needs to occur, and the forces you put on the instrument. With time, you can develop balance in the left hand and achieve better dexterity than before. For anyone with sufficiently long neck, you can no longer rely on continual holding, and need to support the instrument (in fixed position sections) via the thumb. This encourages you to release pressure on the digits as you play. :-)<p>But like OP said, they&#x27;re happy so why mess with what works for them. :-)<p>P.S. what rep are you working on? Feel free to drop me an email if you&#x27;re interested in discussing more.')
