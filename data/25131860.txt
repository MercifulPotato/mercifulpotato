Culture is not race.<p>Unfortunately, some people have redefined &quot;racism&quot; to mean dislike of anything related to another ethnic group. Biology, culture, religion, whatever.<p>I agree with you here. Blaming the culture is the opposite of blaming the biology. But the meaning of &quot;racism&quot; has expanded from &quot;blaming biology&quot; to, well, &quot;noticing anything negative about anything&quot;. The only non-racist behavior is to say the differences don&#x27;t exist at all, or blaming them 100% on oppression.')
