Item(by='username90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608501128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489570, text='&gt; You are trying to convince me my experiences are wrong.<p>No, I am not, I agree that there are many situations where women are not taken seriously due to their gender and assigning project credit is one of them. I 100% believe that has happened to you, that is wrong and we should try to do something about it. If you want that then you support meritocracy instead of biasocracy. However I&#x27;m trying to convince you that this statement is wrong:<p>&gt; strive for equality of outcome for all is what we need to do<p>Men and women are different on average, maybe because of socialization etc but fact is that today they are different. My path relied on anonymous interactions online, so is by far the most friendly for marginalized groups. However marginalized groups like women are basically non existent on that path. That proves to me there are more differences than just discrimination. If you want to hire someone like me you wont find a woman, as there are hundreds of men for every woman with that background. Now you might not want to hire a person with those skills, but those who do will not find women to hire. And not because of discrimination, they don&#x27;t even try to work for it in the first place.')
