As someone who used Scala for years, but always wondered whether they can retain their users with competition from Kotlin, I&#x27;m extremely curious what this will mean for Scala in the long run.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical, because the cost to migrate is big. But I&#x27;m hopeful, because Scala is a language I like to write code in.<p>Edit: why am I skeptical? I know scala 3 is largely meant to be backwards compatible. But scala has always been a language of many styles (&quot;java without semicolon&quot; vs &quot;haskell compiled with scalac&quot;). All this new syntax in scala three adds a whole new dimension to this issue.')
