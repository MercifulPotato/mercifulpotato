The problem doesn&#x27;t scale linearly, policing 750m people isn&#x27;t like policing 25m people, especially when the 750m have a propensity to all shuffle around a bit, and live in 50 different jurisdictions.<p>My point is that the author isn&#x27;t careful about the similarities and differences, the author just puts everything down to policy decisions and points of discourse that simply aren&#x27;t the case in most of the places the author is describing.')
