I also find the middle-upper class difficult for germany (since salary upper class doesnt mean you are asset upperclass aka rich).<p>Personally I would say 25k€ nett is middle class; but here everybody wants to belong to the middle class so it usually has a wide stretch.<p>Big companies are unionized so salarys do not get that big, but are considered higher then in non-unionized companies.<p>How is the situation in the US?')
