Make Google the arbiter of who is secure or not.<p>I can think of no good reason why an app ought prefer it&#x27;s own CA store to the OS&#x27;s. The OS ought manage these things consistently for users, give an effective cental management system.<p>I can think of one rotten reason why this happening. Android. Android&#x27;s unmaintainability. Dependence on the manufacturer to provide OS updates, including to our CA store. There&#x27;s no way toaintaom an Android phone&#x27;s CA store.<p>in the Android case, Google&#x27;s unwillingness to let the useraontain or repair their system has boiled over, in this one particular spot, to the point where Chrome MUST take over, reimplemt the basic systems provided by the OS. Again, because the OS cannot be maintained.<p>The timing is not coincidence. Android users have no way to update &amp; support Let&#x27;s Encrypt if they are on old devices. Chrome stops depending on Android. Perverse changes to have to make, from an OS that these days usually can not be unlocked &amp; user maintained, even when the software on it begins to rot &amp; not receive updates. What an ewaste anti user nightmare locked down Android devices have created. This is computing hell.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;own-two-feet.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;own-two-feet.html</a>')
