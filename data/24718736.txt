Apple would encourage responsible disclosure (and attract more white-hat bug hunters) this way. The amount of vulnerabilities found is a proof by itself that team work does pay off, if the team is strong. Also, this is a drop in the bucket for Apple. It would probably cost them much more to have them on the payroll for the same amount of time.')
