The correct way to diet is totally different than what you think it is. You&#x27;d have to be a complete idiot to do it one way when another way is obviously more scientific. I once dieted a third way and it was way more effective than the second way, but it wasn&#x27;t as healthy. You just have to look at the facts. Anyone who isn&#x27;t doing the right diet - like I&#x27;ve been doing for <i>years</i> now - just doesn&#x27;t understand how the human metabolism works. It&#x27;s sad, really, this stuff is just basic. Stick to what&#x27;s natural and you&#x27;ll be eating in no time, trust me.')
