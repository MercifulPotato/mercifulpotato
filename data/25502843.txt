You&#x27;re not responsible for your words. That&#x27;s why these fail.<p>Notice I use my real name here on this website. Not a pseudonym.

I&#x27;ll always use my real name.<p>We don&#x27;t require anyone to take responsibility for what they say, so they say anything they want. Combine with this an entire zeitgeist of people who feel disconnected and alone, and its a recipe for attention-seeking behavior.<p>And on the converse, sometimes its taken too far, with people losing their jobs for things that clearly meant in jest (Justine Sacco) or for clumsily worded communication.
