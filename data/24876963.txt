This is according to the county auditor, who is the highest non-judicial authority when it comes to real estate ownership.  When CenturyLink bought the old telco they never bothered to update the deed.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean I can go squat on that land.<p>It just means the records weren&#x27;t updated when the acquisition happened.')
