I ran into this myself a couple times over the years and dealt with it depending on what changed. What was really nice was the weekly deploy. All commits were fresh in my head so there were not any changes from long ago that I forgot about. That was actually really important. On some holidays we would not do a deploy and even two weeks of changes was a lot more to remember than one week.<p>So, if I knew the changes well, I could roll back if nothing in the API changed. We didn&#x27;t like that, but sometimes you just need to be pragmatic. Other times an update was made that forced you to get it working. In this case services helped because rather than the whole system being down, only part of it was. So many of our services were background type work that in most cases, customers would never even know if they were down for even 1-2hrs.<p>We had good staging environments with a <i>lot</i> of reporting, monitoring and metrics. We never deployed to production code that had not run reliably in staging for a least a couple of days.')
