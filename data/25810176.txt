It would still be useful - perhaps even more efficient than it is. Signal&#x27;s outage yesterday that this logic does not apply for them. If they run out of money or infra, everyone is out in the cold.<p>&gt; This is the best arrangement for users.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the best arrangement would be to stop hiding the operational cost per user and <i>charge</i> them for it.

WhatsApp was doing just that with their $1&#x2F;year fee and subsidizing market growth markets before Facebook got them.<p>I&#x27;d also make the case that part of the reason that we (as users) should not accept a centralized solution is due to the fact that a distributed&#x2F;federated system gives room for competition and diversity.
