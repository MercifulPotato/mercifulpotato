We will need major, non-trivial technological innovation in order to truly escape our toil (through capitalism, of course :).  Teams of innovators will need to build out AI &amp; robotic infrastructure (among other things) in order to make this happen.<p>I hope that humans will look back on us thousands (if not hundreds) of years into the future and look in horror at how hard we had to toil for our basic necessities.<p>The leftist desire to redistribute wealth (which I think is strongly misplaced and immoral) will become irrelevant once we achieve a certain level of abundance that is unlike anything we are accustomed to today.  It will be like wanting to redistribute oxygen or dirt -- two resources so abundant they are essentially free.')
