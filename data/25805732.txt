Web, iOS &amp; Android and Mac. The app helps freelancers keep track of time they spend on projects&#x2F;clients. A dashboard shows you how much you can invoice per week&#x2F;month per client.<p>I have used different time tracking apps since I started freelancing a couple of years ago. About one year ago I decided to built my own. This gave me the possibility to style it exactly how I like. I named it Billable (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbillable.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbillable.com&#x2F;</a>). I also find it really nice to use my own product every single day.<p>There have been so many unfinished side projects through the years. It feels good getting to this stage. The first web version is ready. Right now focusing on removing bugs and preparing images and texts for the Mac App Store.')
