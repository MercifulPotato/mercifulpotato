The main value of this is that everyone can use their own setup and instruments and still participate in the creative process together. I&#x27;ve been working on this for a year and have been doing open beta for about a month, people seem really into it which is awesome!<p>4+ people can make music at the same time, the projects are saved and loaded in the cloud, people can load them on their own time if they want and do their parts so not everyone needs to be online at the same time. Tons of extra stuff, I&#x27;m quite proud of how it&#x27;s turned out.<p>I built this mainly because all my friends who make music live in different cities and I really just want to jam all the time and nothing out there was letting me do it, so the idea was born a while ago but it was an adventure to get it to work properly.<p>Screenshot: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Kr3bvx2.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Kr3bvx2.jpeg</a>\nWebsite: www.beatconnect.ca')
