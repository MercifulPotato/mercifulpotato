If there&#x27;s a problem, discuss it directly with them. Don&#x27;t faff about, it could just be that they don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re missing expectations<p>Sounds like the hypothetical manager in this scenario is underperforming and thinking they&#x27;re doing great too. Managers need spines.<p>e: for a bit of context I was an underperformer that thought they were doing well.<p>Also admittedly this is a kneejerk response to a skim read while I&#x27;m on a coffee break so I&#x27;ve probably just focused on the passive parts that used to wind me up from management')
