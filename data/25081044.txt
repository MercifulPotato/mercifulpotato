This is air exchanges with the outside, not filtration cycles which are in addition. Even if the filters were entirely INOP, I suspect you’re no worse off than sitting in an office building.<p>Now, I’m not doing that right now, but there’s little reason to think major US carriers aren’t doing what they say they’re doing and if the air change mechanism wasn’t working, you’d see oxygen masks deploying as that’s the mechanism by which the aircraft remains pressurized.')
