Some &quot;awd&quot; is mechanical with even 50:50 or a 40:60 distribution of power like the quattro system that have a center differential. These systems still work great with large differences in traction: if you put snow tires on the front and regular tires on the rear, you can bust some sweet drifts and drive right out no problem. I wouldn&#x27;t try bad tires on the front though. Other systems use electronic sensors and have a front bias giving 80+% to front wheels while giving rear varying amounts when the front loses traction. It reacts much slower and there is probably a bit of over&#x2F;under correction from the control system if the tires don&#x27;t have even traction. I could see this leading to a quickly cycling clutch that would over heat your system.')
