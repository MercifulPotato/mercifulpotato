A few observations from an outsiders perspective:<p>* One interesting thing I have noticed from being on HN is that lots of start-ups that focus on the tech industry &#x2F; IT &#x2F; helping developers. I think it makes sense to pick a niche you understand, but possibly not if it is a &#x27;niche&#x27; which is filled with developers.<p>* Workplace collaboration in a &#x27;knowledge work&#x27; environment = red ocean. Application of workplace collaboration tools to new&#x2F;unexplored industry segments I suspect has lots of blue ocean areas however. I think you have picked something in the red ocean.<p>* As a small note, you started with a solution (always on video room, inspired by a twitter post) and worked backwards to a problem to solve (teammates not being fully engaged). The usual process would be to start with a problem and then work out how you are going to solve it. I know it sounds like semantics, but there are lots of potential solutions to &quot;teammates feel disconnected&quot; and an always on video room is just one of them! (e.g. coffee roulette, remote pizza parties).')
