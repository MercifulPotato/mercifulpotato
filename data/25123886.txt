I write endless hierarchical notes for endless meetings that I live through. They go like this:<p>- New Client<p><pre><code>  - Referred by John\n\n  - Looking for a quote on X\n\n  - Would like to chat next week to hear options?\n\n  - *** Ryan (me) to create 3 slide presentation to highlight options and cost\n</code></pre>\nSee that last one!? Yeah, that&#x27;s a task&#x2F;todo for me buried in notes. So, now I have little tasks that sit within my massive note taking document. It&#x27;s not great for prioritizing or quickly trying to see what&#x27;s urgent for today&#x2F;this week. And then I hate copying that information to a separate todo list (computer science nerds just hate redundancy :). All these approaches break down fairly quickly.<p>I believe that any note can also be a task but we shouldn&#x27;t copy them to a separate list (&quot;pass by reference&quot; instead of &quot;pass by value&quot; for the computer geeks out there). These seems intuitive but haven&#x27;t really seen this implemented anywhere.<p>Does anyone else have this problem too?  I spent the last weeks building this prototype. I think it achieves my goal but I&#x27;m still tweaking and building. I&#x27;d love for some feedback and to hear your thoughts on this problem&#x2F;solution.')
