Item(by='adrianmonk', descendants=None, kids=[25103607], score=None, time=1605465074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103105, text='&gt; <i>The climate doesnâ€™t care about economics, only total parts per million of atmospheric CO2.</i><p>But behavior cares about economics, taxes change the economics, and behavior affects CO2 levels.<p>The devil is in the details, of course. Taxes would have to be high enough to get the behavior under control. It could turn out that, in order to get usage down low enough, the taxes need to be 500% of the cost of a fossil fuel car or 5000% of the cost of fuel. And maybe that&#x27;s not politically feasible or something.<p>But my point is in order to dismiss the idea of taxes as a solution, you can&#x27;t start with the idea that taxes won&#x27;t have any effect. Governments all over the world use taxes to change behavior, and there are obvious examples of it working, like tariffs in trade wars.<p>Note that I&#x27;m also not saying taxes are the right solution here. This is really just a point of order.')
