I don&#x27;t think Apple is big enough in computing (as opposed to mobile) to be such a scary monolithic force.<p>I&#x27;ve been off Apple laptops for a few years, but I might go back soon.  The new M1 is basically in the direction that I think computing should have gone a decade ago (RISC, increased integration into processor package, heterogeneous processing).  Intel didn&#x27;t succeed in taking us to such a great place, so I&#x27;m hoping Apple pushes things along.<p>And, of course, AMD silicon is flourishing too, which is nice.<p>Apple&#x27;s been a far better steward of the internet and of computing than Intel had been-- perhaps mostly because of Apple&#x27;s limited market share here.')
