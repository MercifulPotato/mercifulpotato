This cluster has been growing rapidly over the past 4 weeks and since been observed in other UK locations, indicating further spread.</i><p><i>Several aspects of this cluster are noteworthy for epidemiological and biological reasons and we report preliminary findings below. In summary:</i>\n <i>• The B.1.1.7 lineage accounts for an increasing proportion of cases in parts of England.</i><p><i>• The number of B.1.1.7 cases, and the number of regions reporting B.1.1.7 infections, are growing.</i><p><i>• B.1.1.7 has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations&#x2F;563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;preliminary-genomic-characterisati...</a>')
