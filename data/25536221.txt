The view inside the field is very different, and doesn&#x27;t resemble what you say at all.  Nobody in the field worries about hyperinflation for developed economies.  The consensus is that governments can combat recessions.  There was some challenge to this view in the late 70s and early 80s, when inflation was high, but by the end of the 90s the question was mostly settled.  In the US, even the economic advisors to George W. Bush called for stimulus spending to combat the recession in 2000.')
