But if there&#x27;s a tool that doesn&#x27;t required Hand-Coding, and it can still turn your design into Responsive Webpage, I bet you&#x27;d like to know.<p>Me and my team have been trying to get rid of this situation for years, so we finally came out with a tool to help. It is pxCode, no more measurements and handoff tools, no more hand-coding and code gen, but you can still hold the complete control on your Layout and Code. Should definitely try it if you&#x27;re into creating Responsive Webpage.<p>Check out www.pxcode.io')
