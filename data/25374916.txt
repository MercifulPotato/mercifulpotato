Also, most of it looks the same and is Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v of something else.<p>With Clojure the mess is still 100k to millions LOC because the guys did not know how to make worthwhile abstractions, but now it can&#x27;t be parsed by IDE and you are screwed trying to figure out what happens at runtime.<p>ALso, if you think if there is less code then it is easier to understand, go and read any advanced Common Lisp book (like Let over Lambda) and try to really understand what some of the more advanced macros do, exactly. It is definitely not the same as reading pages upon pages of redundant code.')
