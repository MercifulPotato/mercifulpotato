A year or two before Electron came along, the Gnome folks had the foresight to declare that JS would be the language of choice for promoting GTK and Gnome app development, with the option to drop back to C otherwise.  This caused a minor controversy, where the community decided to rage against this effort and essentially rejected it.  Here we are then, instead.<p>Rather than the &quot;default&quot; toolkit of choice in 2020 being GTK, which is cross-platform, provides an opportunity to get closer to &quot;native&quot;, and has the roots and traditions of pre-GitHub FOSS, an vacuum was left wide openâ€”unfilled due to the internal revolt&#x2F;denial of the Linux desktop crowd.  So the NodeJS and web developer community swooped in and filled it, with their dubious <i>sui generis</i> practices pushed to the forefront instead, and the world is shipping apps in browser runtime containers.')
