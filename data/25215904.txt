But as anyone who&#x27;s tried to express a mathematician&#x27;s proof of any real complexity in Coq can attest, they&#x27;re a very small subset of the sum total of human proofs.<p>The proofs that mathematicians have been doing for thousands of years, by contrast, aren&#x27;t formal (in the strict sense). They&#x27;re arguments that appeal to the human sense of deductive reason, in a phrase. And yes, formal logic is an attempt to codify and mechanize that as an object for study, but...well, like I said, it&#x27;s a big philosophical or even neurological question as to how well it does that, or can do that; to what degree that&#x27;s possible.')
