It&#x27;s a tool.<p>If one is worried about nation state actors, the ownership of a device that&#x27;s secure and uncommon enough is likely to attract additional scrutiny or just be seized, legally or not.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty cool device, mind you. The fact that they&#x27;re going out of their way to make sure the device is fully inspectable and trustable is pretty impressive, as you point out.
