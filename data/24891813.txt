The exit velocity in turn is proportional to the square root of (temperature divided by molar mass of the exhaust gas).<p>Thus, if you use cooler hydrogen gas rather than hotter water+hydrogen, you can still make it a lot more efficient given that water has 9 times the mass of hydrogen per molecule.')
