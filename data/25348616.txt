Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=[25348746], score=None, time=1607449094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25348343, text='&gt; Dropping off at a depot is not really how this bit of the industry works â€“ the courier collects from the distribution centre in almost every case.<p>I am aware of this. The posted article is referencing merchants with 3000 shipments to send out, which is not <i>insane</i> scale. If FedEx wouldn&#x27;t pick those up at your door, it is possible to get those shipped out still. Obviously, yes, you may need some new logistics coordination, and it will be more expensive, and yes, it could make a lot of business margin&#x27;s no longer work. I am definitely not saying that I agree with any action that FedEx&#x2F;UPS is alleged to be taking here (especially without reasonable notice).<p>But that is not the same thing as &quot;FedEx is refusing to let us ship more than X boxes per day&quot;. And it&#x27;s a distinction that the article should get right.')
