For example, Robinhood has publicly spoken about the large number of investors that passed on their seed round, while Flexport has been inundated with interest during every funding round.<p>One big constraint on the # of investments per year for a fund is the amount of time that the fund&#x27;s partners have. Investors want to differentiate themselves with the help they can provide, and help takes time. As a result, a Series A investor&#x2F;board member can manage 1-2 new investments per year, while a seed investor might be able to manage 3-8 new investments per year. So # of partners * ~5 investments per year is a good estimate of how many investments a hands on seed fund will do.<p>There are funds that invest in a lot more companies, but they tend to write small checks and are less hands on.')
