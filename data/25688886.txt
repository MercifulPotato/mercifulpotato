I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s considered normal.<p>If instead of FIR panels you use a heat pump (isn&#x27;t that the main point of electrical heating), would you still need 32A? And if you&#x27;re cooking and baking with 10 kW, would you still need heating at the same time? And a 7 kW heat pump water heater should give you ~10 liters per minute of hot shower water.<p>Seems like any automatic system that could make sure not all high-draw consumers get turned on at the same time would be enough. It does mean that if someone is taking a shower while two people are vacuuming with all the lights on and the kitchen is cooking up a feast, you wouldn&#x27;t be getting any additional heat or electric car charging, for the hour or so that such high demand can last, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a serious problem (especially as this would only affect older houses).<p>And you said it&#x27;s required for new construction, so I assume they&#x27;d be putting in 3-phase for those.<p>The main power lines for the whole street could be a problem, so yes, this may require some new construction. Might as well put down FTTH while at it.<p>Additionally, if houses add solar, it should reduce typical demand on the grid, as a lot of the current wouldn&#x27;t have to flow all the way from some substation but would be supplied either within each house or from neighbors.')
