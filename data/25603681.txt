Once companies desperately pay you to share your skills, you are building up a track record. Anything less is nothing.<p>A good and worrying example are the many nodeJS tutorials on the matter of authentication or log in&#x2F;session protocols. Good forbid if you implement that stuff in your own product. The devs posting these articles should and do know better but it seems like they are more after subscribers and revenue than anything else.')
