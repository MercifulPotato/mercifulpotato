Item(by='plaidfuji', descendants=None, kids=[25229124], score=None, time=1606488067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228160, text='&gt; The energy density of green hydrogen is three times that of jet fuel, making it a promising zero-emissions technology for aircraft<p>I assume this is on a per-mass  (as opposed to per volume) basis, which is misleading due to the storage challenges associated with hydrogen. The practical reason we calculate energy density is because weight matters for transportation purposes. I think at this point in the discussion, we should be including the mass of the storage medium (tank) in the denominator of the energy density calculation, particularly given that cutting-edge solutions involve capturing hydrogen in metal hydrides or porous materials.<p>Also, given that the discussion is centered specifically around energy storage for long-haul transportation, shouldnâ€™t the investment be evaluated relative to the potential cost of fully electrifying long-haul trucking, shipping and air transport (ie developing next gen batteries and electric motors for these apps)?')
