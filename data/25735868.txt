When I say “moral plane” I take into account broad societal forces. For example, broadly speaking in the USA the black cause for equal justice is broadly understood to be of much more importance and credence than the cause of the Aryan nation for white supremacy.<p>And to reinforce my second point, Twitter’s decision to ban or not ban someone is largely subjective (beyond the TOS) and they are sensitive to public pressures and the overall societal climate.<p>It’s not about my moral values but the aggregate moral values of society.')
