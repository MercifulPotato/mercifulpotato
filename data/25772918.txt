Current offerings are way too expensive and immature. The way I envision these should go is helmet mounted visor with a replaceable, helmet mounted battery; standard lenses you can source from various vendors; swappable HUD modules; manufacturers could offer complete package (helmet, computer&#x2F;projector, lens, battery) lineups and employ their regular pricing strategies. Not sure why nobody came up with such a system yet, all technologies are already there.')
