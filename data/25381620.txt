I’m really sorry to hear that by the way. I spent a year in a suburb outside of Houston and also felt it was far less tolerant than Palo Alto &#x2F; MTV &#x2F; Cupertino was, but wasn’t sure if it was a fair comparison for me to make given the differences between the two (the suburb of Houston I was in was an hour outside of the outer loop and had very few jobs and very little diversity, whereas the suburbs making up the Bay Area all felt a bit like one continuous city to me, with a large population and the university right next to them). I haven’t spent any time near Dallas either though, thanks for that perspective.')
