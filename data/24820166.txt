Or the fourth to last article that is called an &quot;Online Report&quot;. A blog could be considered an &quot;Online report&quot;. LOL<p>I was literally laughing as I went through these.<p>Do you seriously think this is what actual scientific publications are?<p>Is this view of what a scientific article is widespread?<p>This explains a lot to me about why America is being crushed from the inside out by ignorance.')
