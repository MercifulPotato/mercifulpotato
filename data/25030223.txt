Then one day I heard him yelling at someone in his office that I knew to be a good person &amp; good worker. His precise words were &quot;I&#x27;m the boss, if I want to shove my thumb up my ass &amp; spin around I can do it and you can&#x27;t say a thing&quot;<p>And I thought to myself &quot;Yep, I&#x27;m done here&quot;. Unfortunately I jumped ship too quickly and found myself in a job I hated, with a manger who (while not as vocally abusive) was just as bad.')
