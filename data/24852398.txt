Same goes for science e.g.. People like Popper or Kuhn spent a lot of mental cycles arguing what is and what is not science, yet people still do science every day without reading them.<p>In some ways this way of thinking is too meta. In order to be a good mathematician, it is not necessary to understand the nature of mathematics from an outside perspective. This view can be very useful e.g. if you&#x27;re working on foundations, but that doesn&#x27;t mean before being good at mathematics one must be good at understanding the nature of mathematics. That seems like the job of philosophers, not mathematicians. (Well, sometimes the set has intersections, e.g. Brouwer, Hilbert, Godel and Penrose (theo. physicist) wrote some works on phil. of math).<p>EDIT: To express this slightly more formally: in order to understand a theory of a model, you do not need to understand the model comprehensively. You can be an expert in intelligence science by studying the falsifiable and predictive theories of intelligence science without understanding the nature of intelligence itself.')
