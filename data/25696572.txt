However, that rally is where the match lit the fuse. They were sent to the Capitol to cause mayhem. Two different but related events to consider. If there was to be an organized event at the Capitol, things would have been prepared differently. However, the Capitol was already undergoing preparations for the Inauguration. I seriously doubt the people in charge of those plans would have agreed to a rally at the Capitol.')
