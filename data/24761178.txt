Sure, when I was in my twenties I crashed at friends&#x27; places, and they at mine, all the time. But the article is specifically about the tradeoff of getting a smaller, cheaper, apartment, vs. getting a larger house in the suburbs with a spare guest room. The idea that it&#x27;s usually a <i>cheaper</i> option to pay for the occasional hotel than to specifically purchase a larger house with rooms you rarely use. Obviously the &quot;crash on my couch&quot; is a different dynamic entirely.')
