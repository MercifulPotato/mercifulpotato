It was a plugin to the VFS framework (KIO) the desktop and all the apps use, so it would also work e.g. in Open File dialogs from anywhere within the toolset.<p>I remember using this regularly to mass-download the images embedded into a page - open the page this way by replacing <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> with a pseudo-protocol, copy all, paste, done.<p>KDE always came with a lot of VFS trickery like that. Ripping a music CD into MP3s was similar - you&#x27;d open the volume in the file manager and see your tracks along with a virtual folder full of MP3 files. The rip and encoding would happen on the fly, and you could do this e.g. straight from the file attach feature in an instant messenger.<p>Desktop Linux was a lot less friendly to get working smoothly back then compared to now, and feature discovery was by word of mouth more than anything, but it sure felt like living in the future early.')
