Instead of ratcheting up the intensity the police should try and calm things down. I think most people on HN can agree with that idea.  Let cooler heads prevail.<p>So why then are people applauding Big Tech and the politicians when they do the opposite? De-platforming the president, cutting off Parler, these actions will inflame already high tensions. Impeaching trump again with 9 days to go before he&#x27;s gone?  It&#x27;s a major escalation.  The media and the politicians seem to <i>want</i> armed rebellion.  It&#x27;s so totally fucked up. And half the country doesn&#x27;t see the other half as anything but &quot;racist&quot;.<p>The media has ruined America.  Game over.')
