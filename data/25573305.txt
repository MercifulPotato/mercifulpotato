Don&#x27;t assume that your experience applies across the board and everyone can spare double digits of their salary. Depending on where you live and how much you make, 100% of your software salary might be just getting you to having an okay-ish standard of living with not much to spare. So giving up 20% of it doesn&#x27;t sound appealing.<p>And that&#x27;s on top of the question about life-sitation and priorities.<p>&gt; Maybe if you have 2 kids and a mortgage but that&#x27;s not me<p>Not you but many people are in that situation.
