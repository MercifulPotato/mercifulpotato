But you have to <i>coordinate</i> with another party, particularly if you&#x27;re generating large amounts of energy this way. But the grid is evolving towards increased storage to accommodate renewables, so this will mitigate the impact of shutting generation down to run maintenance on the heat source.<p>But if we don&#x27;t want to couple random industrial plants to the supply side of the power grid, I wonder if we couldn&#x27;t be using this with some self-contained carbon recapture devices. Heat -&gt; power -&gt; less COâ‚‚ in the air. If that kind of tech will ever be workable, that is.<p>All this to say, when I put my software engineering hat on, I&#x27;m starting to get sick thinking of <i>all that capacity being wasted</i>.')
