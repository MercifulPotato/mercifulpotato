You can find churches with members on either side of the political spectrum if you worry about that.<p>One thing I love is that (almost) wherever I am travelling in the world, I can just turn up to a church and feel welcomed.<p>My wife and I moved to a new city and went to church and were invited to a family home for dinner straight after the service. It&#x27;s great to experience that in a city where you don&#x27;t know a single person.')
