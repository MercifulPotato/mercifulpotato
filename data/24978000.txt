Even if it were think about the following analogy given by a national leader. I dont remember his name. There are more crows in India than Peacock. Yet Peacock is the national bird not the crow.<p>If there must be a national language then it should be English. Simply because it is the one that has prospered the coutry. Hindi does not help the states where hindi is the primary language. Bihar people migrate to south india for jobs and learn tamil and telegu, while the south indians leave india to abroad.<p>Preach Hindi to the people who are still low class but you learn english conveniently, thats evil IMO.')
