That doesn&#x27;t imply common heritage.<p>Western Turkey was inhabited by large Greek populations and colonies for a very long time, which was one of the reasons behind the Persian War. During the Hellenistic era, the Seleucid Empire, a Hellenistic kingdom, ruled most of modern-day Turkey. And then from the Roman era to 1453, the area remained largely Greek-speaking, with Constantinople (aka Istanbul) the center of Greco-Roman civilization, with the citizens thereof actually called &quot;Greeks&quot; by many peoples.<p>Of course the Arabic and Turkic invasions introduced new peoples and changed things up quite a bit, but there&#x27;s definitely common heritage between many people in Turkey and the Greeks, to the extent that many &#x27;Turks&#x27; citizenship-wise are ethnic Greeks and other ethnic groups that spoke Greek and  had a long participation in the Greek and Roman kingdoms.')
