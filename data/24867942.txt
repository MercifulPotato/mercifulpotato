I currently have a raspberry pi with cheap speakers that I play a telephone ring wav after VPN&#x27;ing and then SSH&#x27;ing into. I would love a software idea that I could have two-way intercom like communication without them needing to do anything. So like an auto-answering speakerphone software idea. Can Discord or Mumble do that?')
