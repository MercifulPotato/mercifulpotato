The vaccines have undergone significant testing, and they&#x27;re not doing anything magical.<p>If you&#x27;re going to insinuate that the vaccines have significant risks, you should provide some evidence. (This bar should also be a bit higher in my opinion in the middle of a public health emergency.)<p>Compare a statement like &quot;5g has great potential, but I&#x27;m really, really concerned about the health risks of 5g towers&quot;. I&#x27;d expect that to get voted down too unless you had some remarkable evidence.')
