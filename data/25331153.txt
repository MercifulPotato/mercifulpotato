They just usually provide an environment where the defaults guide you to functional (immutable by default, option&#x2F;result types instead of exceptions, making partial application of functions and piping easy, etc.).<p>A prime example would be F#. You can program pretty much the same as in C# if you need to, but there are a lot of facilities for programming in a more functional style.')
