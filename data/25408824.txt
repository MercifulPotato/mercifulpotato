Prisons are overcrowded as it is. Minor&#x2F;nonviolent criminals are not the ones serving time.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about <i>jail</i> as in people who are charged and awaiting trial, yes you will find more nonviolent offenders there and they may not be able to afford bail so they are stuck there. Even then in most places space is limited and first-time offenders and those seen as low risk are not held.')
