This increases their liability.<p>Imagine someone at a liquor store sells beer to someone. Then, they learn the ID is fake and the person is lying about their age. Once they know someone is doing something illegal they can be held liable if they continue to sell the person beer.<p>Note, I&#x27;m not getting into right an wrong here. I&#x27;m getting into legal liabilities. Large companies like MasterCard are conservative (legally speaking) in how they handle this stuff.')
