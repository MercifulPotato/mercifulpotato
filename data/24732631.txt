I keep seeing allusions to catastrophe and disaster but I am not seeing any specifics about the material effects of this catastrophe.<p>&gt; <i>would you feel comfortable if FB came under control of the Saudis while it was engaged in extensive vetting</i><p>Why would that make me uncomfortable? Like what are the Saudis going to do with Facebook that would be so terrible compared to what Facebook is already doing under current ownership? The Saudis in particular seem like a weird example considering the already prolific influence of SoftBank in U.S. tech firms.<p>&gt; <i>Another problem is that vetting (&#x2F;censorship) is often supported when it&#x27;s &quot;your side&quot; doing the vetting</i><p>I don&#x27;t have a &quot;side&quot; with respect to what Facebook removes from its platform, I can&#x27;t fathom a scenario where something being removed from Facebook can be accurately described as a catastrophe or a disaster regardless of who is doing the removing.')
