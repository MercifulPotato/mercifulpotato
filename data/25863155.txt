Item(by='brudgers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611257938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848536, text='I own more than half a dozen cameras and a couple of dozen lenses. It&#x27;s more a matter of what other cameras don&#x27;t I want.<p>Almost any dedicated camera will provide a different experience than a phone. Ergonomic design for single purpose. Psychologically because it only comes out to make pictures.<p>The easiest upgrade is a point and shoot with 10x or 12x zoom because it provides more reach. One with physical dials and physical buttons will provide a dedicated tactile experience. It&#x27;s the simplest thing that might work and has the important quality of being easy to take with you.<p>To me, the biggest difference between cameras is whether you hold them to your eye when making pictures (or not). Making pictures with the camera to your eye is &quot;looking through the camera&quot; versus &quot;looking at the camera.&quot; Neither is better. But they are different.[1]<p>Holding the camera to your eye facilitates tight composition of moving subjects because of hand-eye coordination. It facilitates the use of longer focal lengths (narrower field of view) to capture action. The disadvantage is the tendency to make pictures from eye level rather than more interesting angles.<p>The easiest way to try a camera that can be held to the eye is a used Canon&#x2F;Nikon entry level DSLR with a kit lens for a couple of hundred dollars. If you like it, there&#x27;s more than two orders of magnitude headroom you can spend for better cameras and nicer lenses.<p>To me, fallacious sunk cost reasoning is about the only mistake you can make buying a camera. Your next camera is just your next camera not your last one. The more pictures you make, the more you will understand which pictures you can&#x27;t make and being able to make different pictures is the reason to look for new gear (unless you are getting paid making the same pictures &quot;better&quot; usually isn&#x27;t a good reason).<p>[1] It&#x27;s not quite either or. Cameras with waist level finders sort of sit in between. A tilting screen camera at 90 degrees can capture some of the experience but not all of it.')
