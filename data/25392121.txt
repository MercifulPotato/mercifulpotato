Not sure why I&#x27;m replying, as its wholely offtopic<p>- Nuclear, i think you should read up why people are against it. ( spoiler, it isn&#x27;t the science... but maybe you should think about  who can do it effectively vs the potential risks of doing it wrong... or you know, the imbalance of global power when only a few countries could generate.. well, power )<p>- GMO, again, same point above. &quot;Sure you can have this great crop, no seeds&quot;. Again, GMO per say isn&#x27;t bad, its the implementation that&#x27;s bad.<p>- Gender science. Stop worrying about what other people do with their life, worry about your life my fellow human.<p>- Nature vs nurture. Sure, an argument that goes back B.C., and now you think this is a conservative vs liberal? Wait, is this Paleo conservatism? lol<p>Again, not even relating to the argument at hand. There&#x27;s no &quot;true&quot; side in any of these, as two of them are well, not science. And the other two, will continue to evolve with science. But nice try :)<p>Oh... and thank you for taking the quote of a comedian ( and my quip, so seriously). Any arguments about the first one?')
