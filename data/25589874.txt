Adobe Illustrator was always more serious, and you needed to spend time fine grain adjusting BÃ©zier curves, but in Flash that was one stroke of the hand I loved it. Also timeline and animation, was super user friendly, 15 years after there are few tools I have tried but none has that same easiness for artists.<p>Tool is the issue, and I can understand artists, HTML5 does not have any similar tools. And writing &quot;HTML &amp; CSS&quot; and aiming at pixel coordinates is just not the way to do 15 minute (27000 frame) animation.')
