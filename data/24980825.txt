Item(by='simonh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604419434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980172, text='I don&#x27;t think this is a fair criticism, and as it&#x27;s phrased so generally I doubt it&#x27;s based on any actual evaluation of the article to see whether it&#x27;s making any errors with respect to correlation or causation.<p>I do accept that the majority of the pay gap between men and women are attributable to factors within the control of employees. Choices about having children and taking career breaks, willingness to work long hours, unwillingness to take dangerous jobs. These are all reasons why in general a lot of women earn less than a lot of men.<p>This article isn&#x27;t making general claims though. It&#x27;s evaluating specific indicators of bias in specific circumstances, and on the face of it seems to have a compelling case. It does seem wrong that women using assertive terms should suffer a lower likelihood of getting an interview or role than men that use the same language.<p>The fact is that in some sectors for some roles there is good evidence of bias in selection. This is bad for applicants and bad for employers who are missing out on good candidates. The fact that some other industries may even have a pro-female bias doesn&#x27;t excuse anything either. I can accept that and want to do something about it, while still being a Jordan Peterson fan and without being a neo-Marxist social justice warrior.')
