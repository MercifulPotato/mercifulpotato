At least in the United States, we can proposition our own politicians to reign in the excesses of Big Tech in our own country.<p>Foreign countries have no real alternative: there is no way to lobby Big Tech for change.  They have no real voice far away in Washington DC.<p>In some cases they can just block some site or app and insist people use the locally developed alternative, but this isn&#x27;t really all that effective.  Usually the local alternative has some deficiencies, and it doesn&#x27;t always work: look at the way Russia failed to block Telegram a few years ago.')
