I am unlikely to face an attacker with nation-state resources, so I actually print out my backup codes on paper along with instructions on how to use them to bootstrap my entire password&#x2F;auth chain.  I then put that paper into a safety deposit box with a copy of my will and other docs my wife and family might need if I drop dead of a heart attack.  No passwords to remember, or realize that I forgot at the point where I least want that to happen and secure against the threat models I consider most likely.')
