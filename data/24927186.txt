A hypothetical situation where multiple talks violated the CoC but attendants only reported one talk and so the conference only took action against one speaker doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge problem. Like, sure, maybe they should have CoC cops sit through each gathering compromising material just so that it&#x27;s perfectly fair, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the best use of conf organizers&#x27; time.')
