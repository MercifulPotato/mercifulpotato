Some treatments are so expensive and&#x2F;or niche that public programs likely wouldn&#x27;t cover them. Such treatments will probably always exist. (And if they didn&#x27;t, then that could he a problem by itself.)<p><i>But</i> at least basic modern healthcare (things that existed ~20 years ago) should be provided as (mostly) free to the patient. We need people to not worry about going to the doctor - there should be minimal paperwork and cost. More people going to healthcare earlier would hopefully pay off through better preventative care.')
