In NZ we have medsafe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medsafe.govt.nz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medsafe.govt.nz&#x2F;</a>), a govt website that lists everything they give out. There&#x27;s also the The New Zealand Formulary (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nzformulary.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nzformulary.org&#x2F;</a>)<p>An example here is that too many doctors believe that Pregabalin has no withdrawals. They&#x27;re very wrong. Here, they will prescribe it for <i>anything</i>. It works really well too, but there&#x27;s a lot of hidden bullshit. As an example, they give it to people with epilepsy, but one of the main contradictions is that it can actually <i>cause</i> seizures. So when that started happening for me, they put me on clonazepam (2mg, six times a day).<p>When I burned myself, I told the hospital I did not want either medicine. There&#x27;s no point in taking Pregabalin if I have to take so much clonazepam to fix the side effects.<p>A week later (while still in hospital) I had a panicked pharmacist for the ward visit me and he&#x27;s like &quot;omg we weren&#x27;t giving you these two&quot; and I said, &quot;nah mate, it&#x27;s fine. I feel okay apart from the pain&quot; and he&#x27;s like, &quot;hang on, you just stopped 12mg of clonazepam a day and you feel fine?&quot; and so I said yes, it&#x27;s because it simply stopped working and my body has decided it doesn&#x27;t work on me anymore, which is why I can&#x27;t take the Pregabalin either... and the stupid thing is the Pregabalin is probably one of the best things I could take right now due to it&#x27;s amazing nerve pain relief. I&#x27;d rather not have seizures though, nor have to find the right kind of benzo to help. I doubt I&#x27;d find one that&#x27;s different enough from the rest to help.')
