I cannot even explore a serverâ€™s users and posts from the community list.<p>You can, right from the homepage of any instance.<p>You have &quot;discover users&quot; button, which will show you any local user that wants to be there (by default you&#x27;re not visible here, you need to opt-in in the settings).<p>You also have &quot;see what&#x27;s happening&quot;, which will show you latest public posts from an instance.<p>Using Fosstodon purely as an example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosstodon.org&#x2F;explore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosstodon.org&#x2F;explore</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosstodon.org&#x2F;public" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosstodon.org&#x2F;public</a> .<p>&gt; And then I created an account in the wrong server, and then what? Can I migrate my account to another server?<p>...kinda. You can &quot;archive&quot; your account and redirect your visitors to the new one. You can&#x27;t migrate who&#x27;s following you and who you&#x27;re following.<p>Also there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from having an account on multiple instances, but that&#x27;s mostly unnecessary since you can follow people regardless of what server they happen to be using.')
