In a largish endeavor, there may be few SAs, many SEs and even more devs.  In my experience, it depends on the diversity of tech that the solution entails.  To address your point (perhaps semantically) the SA may see a wider view... business lens, sustainability lens, etc.  Often, the Senior Eng may interface a lot sith the SA, but may also hae more depth on the pure technical aspects of the solution.  Captain Kirk is the SA, while Scotty might be the Senior Engineer.  Kirk dreams of things, and can probably execute, but Scotty can keep him honest within the bounds of physics. Each needs the other.  Ultimately, they are names on hats, and as long as the right people are in the room, I will take experience and communication capability over titles on cards.
