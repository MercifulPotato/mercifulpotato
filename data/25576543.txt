Anything. If you don’t own physical dollars the inflation thereof doesn’t affect you. This is ECON101. Your only job is to pick an asset you believe in.<p>Then there’s the whole thing of you way overstating the impact of printing money and of stimulus on inflation. Inflation remains on track for a perfect bulls eye 2% per annum. The velocity of money is a huge factor you aren’t considering. It’s dropping and these are measures to counteract its drop. A lack of printing and stimulus would be deflationary and that would be way, way worse than inflation.')
