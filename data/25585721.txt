It practically proves the existence of an intelligent creator ... a watermark stamped on reality. It suggests that it was the creator that reached out to Earth, and Ellie, and cared about her feelings. The ending is Ellie the devout modern priestess of a cold clockwork universe coming face to face with an animate aware personal universe. It&#x27;s the mathematical version of Palmer Joss&#x27;s message.<p>This is Sagan attempting to reconcile Ellie and Palmer, a dream of a scientific theology.')
