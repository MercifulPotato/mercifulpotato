AFAIK there&#x27;s no story for exposing higher level abstractions of these devices though the OS in a way that would allow them to be shared between different applications.<p>How would you envision an &quot;FPGA on board the CPU&quot; differing from this? Would it still be a separate thing the way GPU is today, or would you see it more as like a new set of CPU instructions which enable little blobs of HDL to be somehow passed in and invoked, kind of like how a shader works today on GPUs?')
