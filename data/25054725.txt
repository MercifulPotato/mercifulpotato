If I had to chose between a bad C# codebase or a bad RoR codebase if it&#x27;s beyond something very simple I would chose C# one any day of the week - which is what I think C# approach gets you - guarantee that if you follow the conventions your project will scale reasonably well into maintainability and codebase size. You pay for that in initial development speed and pointless verbosity.')
