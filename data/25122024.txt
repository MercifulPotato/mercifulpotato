I mean yeah, masks seem like a good idea regardless, and they aren&#x27;t too onerous. People should wear them. They should wash their hands, too, and take vitamin D, and try to lose some weight. Same with outdoor dining or reduced occupancy. But everything else is COVID theater pretty much, and our politicians are known to make idiotic decisions under the circumstances. That&#x27;s why some of our states (such as NY and NJ) have some of the highest death rates in the world - the politicians there had the bright idea to send COVID patients straight to the nursing homes, even though it was clear from the very beginning of the spread in the US that this was an extremely bad idea. The outbreak _started_ in the nursing homes in the Washington state. These same people are still there, and they&#x27;re still in charge of whatever passes for &quot;COVID response&quot; in their states. The results are quite predictable.')
