Instead they could stay inside as much as possible to  reduce risks - even indefinitely self quarantining if needed. Or maybe they should only go outside if they’re wearing a full body PPE that is sealed off and has its own air supply.<p>My point is, those who can’t get vaccinated have choices to keep themselves safe, and their decision not to take on those inconveniences shouldn’t result in OTHERS being coerced to undergo a medical procedure. I think it is disingenuous to place agency on those taking no action by skipping the vaccine.')
