Item(by='helen___keller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605191971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25070098, text='&gt; Can someone explain to me why white people moving to another country is considered colonialism?<p>The premise is that colonialism was marked by people from wealthy countries (generally Europeans) occupying and extracting wealth from poorer foreign lands. So the author is alluding that a (relatively speaking) wealthy white person looking to hop to a lower cost of living land, and be treated like a king for their wealth, is similar at face value.<p>That said it&#x27;s really just at face value. Using your expatriated wealth to live like a king in a low cost of living country is not the same as extracting wealth, and the expats generally hold no political power either.')
