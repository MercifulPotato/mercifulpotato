The linked paper might be &#x27;serious&#x27; in tone but the claims are not convincing.<p>One of the best articles I have seen on the lab-made hypothesis is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yurideigin.medium.com&#x2F;lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yurideigin.medium.com&#x2F;lab-made-cov2-genealogy-throug...</a><p>If you want to go down a more skeptical route, closer into conspiracy theories and Chinese politics, you can read some of the writings on this site:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nerdhaspower.weebly.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scientific-evidence-and-logic-behind-the-claim-that-the-wuhan-coronavirus-is-man-made" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nerdhaspower.weebly.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scientific-evidence-and...</a><p>Please, when reading these, keep your scientist hat on and evaluate the claims with an open mind.<p>That being said, if anyone has links to rebuttals of some of the key ideas behind these articles, or further evidence of natural origin beyond the Andersen et al Nature paper, please link it, I&#x27;d very much like to change my mind.')
