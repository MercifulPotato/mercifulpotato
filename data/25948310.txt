But because devs didn&#x27;t cave in to &quot;permissive license fallacy&quot;, they had to eat it up.<p>Linux using GPL wasn&#x27;t such a big problem for the corps, as the Linux developers stated the syscall interface is the GPL boundary. So you can make user space code that runs on Linux without being affected by the GPL (see e.g. the Android &quot;no GPL in userspace&quot; rule). And even inside the kernel, there are loopholes to get around the GPL (e.g. the &quot;tainted&quot; thing you mentioned).<p>Even if Linux were permissively licensed, the thing preventing splitting up into a zillion proprietary forks would, I think, be the ferocious development speed and lack of internal API guarantees.<p>&gt; until we stick to GPLv3 like linux stuck with GPL, opensource is point less.<p>I don&#x27;t see what GPLv3 would solve here. To close the &quot;service provider loophole&quot; you need the AGPLv3, or even something stronger.  But given the more or less total lack of adoption of AGPL, I&#x27;m not hopeful here.<p>I mean, it would be nice if copyleft would be the norm, but that goal seems to be slipping further and further away all the time. To the point that corps can start to shun copyleft code, pressurizing the remaining holdouts to switch to permissive licensed or become irrelevant.')
