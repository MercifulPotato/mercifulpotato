That&#x27;s really the only way to get valid legal advice, and you want to understand what these clauses mean from a legal perspective. Usually they&#x27;re written in legalese and the defined meaning of something in legalese tends to be a bit different from the coloquial meaning.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that even if some of the clauses they&#x27;re trying to impose on you may not be legal or enforceable where you live and work, it usually takes a court to make that determination. So it&#x27;s a matter of understanding what the impact of these new clauses is and what risks you take by accepting them.<p>And please, please don&#x27;t accept the &quot;oh, but we&#x27;re never going to enforce those clauses&quot;. You don&#x27;t want to be the first person they get enforced against. If the employer comes back with that statement, ask them to take out the offending clauses.')
