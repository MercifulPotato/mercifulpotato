Historically doctors have believed a white woman&#x27;s pelvis is better for child bearing, whereas a black woman&#x27;s is better for hard labor. That has since been proven wrong. There is no discernable difference between the races in the pelvic area.<p>Regardless, the argument against discrimination is that one has no CHOICE what race they are born with. Because there is no choice, race does not reflect their invididual merits or lack thereof, and one should not be awarded or punished based on that factor alone. There is also significant variation within a race with regard to IQ or otherwise, that exceeds the difference of the mean value between races')
