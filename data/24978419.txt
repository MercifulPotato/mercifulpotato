Thanks for reading.<p>&gt; * What build toolchains are suited to these arbitrary DAG arrangements?<p>In general any CI&#x2F;CD tool that allows for easy composition of jobs&#x2F;pipelines, where versioned artifacts are a first-class citizen and can be the outputs and the inputs of jobs. Preferably one where the graph is emergent, i.e. just a consequence of declaring which &quot;jobs&quot; (taken loosely) depend on which artifacts.<p>I&#x27;ve had good experiences with GoCD <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gocd.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gocd.org</a> and Concourse <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concourse-ci.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concourse-ci.org</a>, the latter being a fresher, younger take on these concepts. I haven&#x27;t surveyed the landscape recently so there may be other tools that work well.')
