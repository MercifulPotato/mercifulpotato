Would you suggest some reading on this? Question: if I send to other 3 players (via gossip say) the event &quot;in frame N, I clicked the B button that causes monster to die&quot; but my network lags and in the mean time they do other events where someone else kills the monster and <i>they see the monster dying from another player event</i>. After a few ms my events gets to them, their state is rewind with the monster dying because of me instead of the other player. In other words, this causes players to see the monster dying twice.')
