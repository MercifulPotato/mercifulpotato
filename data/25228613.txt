It&#x27;s also sadly narrow. There is no one I know who is independently minded in all disciplines of life or, likewise, conventionally minded. In sports, there&#x27;s no one as independently-minded as the top stars (read reviews by their coaches and teammates for a sense of this). But in other disciplines, especially religion, they&#x27;re are amost the most conventionally minded: adopting all sorts of rituals to solicit the help of God during the game.<p>This extends beyond sports. Descartes, arguably the father of modern philosophy, was a devout Catholic, even refusing to publish a paper after Galileo&#x27;s declaration got him in trouble with the Catholic Church. If the soubriquet &quot;father of modern philosophy&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply independent thinking, I don&#x27;t know what else would. And then there&#x27;s his Meditations on First Philosophy where he&#x27;s severely blinded by conventional-mindedness to &quot;discover&quot; God as the first principle.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that, someone writing about independent- and conventional-mindedness should at least take some pain to explain that in any individual you&#x27;ll see both. That there are no independent-minded people nor conventional-minded people, but only in ways that we carry out our activities.')
