Unfortunately my main motivation, an old Windows game called The Divide: Enemies Within runs poorly, either with software mode or using the emulated voodoo. On vintage hardware I could run the game at 320x240 with a good frame rate on a Pentium 100 mhz, but this setup doesn&#x27;t allow anything lower than 640x480. Sigh..<p>In anycase this is a great project, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to run Windows 9x in dosbox, something standard dosbox did not do reliably.')
