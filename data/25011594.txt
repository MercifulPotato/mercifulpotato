It&#x27;s psudeonimity. It&#x27;s a completely different thing we are not used to dealing with.<p>Unless you actively try to hide your tracks, every single transaction you make is related. You may pay your friend at work $5 back for coffee using Bitcoin -- and at that second -- since he knows your wallet id -- he can check the blockchain for every transaction your wallet has ever participated in - every website you paid for  (as a captcha, as a registration fee for that totally-legal-but-morally-questionable site, the money you contributed to support&#x2F;oppose a political cause, etc.)<p>This is NOT paranoia. People who aren&#x27;t the NSA are constantly analyzing and making public identities related to wallets and transactions they made.

For some things, it&#x27;s a net negative (losing privacy for individua).<p>[0] I&#x27;m tryting to word this as neutrally as possible.')
