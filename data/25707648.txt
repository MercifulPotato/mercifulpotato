Section 3 of the 14th amendment states:<p>&gt; <i>No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.</i><p>Derrick Evans was a member of a State legislature when he participated in what Congressional leadership has labeled as an insurrection. So the 14th amendment prohibits him from being a state legislator or holding any other state or federal office ever again, unless Congress decides otherwise. This constitutionally-imposed restriction is separate from any statutory restriction that could be imposed through criminal prosecution, and removed by a presidential pardon.')
