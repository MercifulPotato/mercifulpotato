This solves some problems with the information theorem (no information can be lost) by presenting all information contained within a black hole on it&#x27;s surface where it can be read, atleast theoretically. (Here information and mass would be considered equivalent)<p>To some extend, it still holds true if you just consider the mass of a black hole to be it&#x27;s singularity and it&#x27;s volume the volume that fills the event horizon.<p>edit: Also consider; if you placed an equivalent amount of mass in space that occupies less volume than the event horizon would, it would automatically be a black hole (and note; the schwarzschild radius is not necessarily the event horizon, the event horizon can be tighter if the black hole rotates)')
