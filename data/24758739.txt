Or fiddling with your seatbelt tightness and worried it may not be optimal for safety, when the main determinants of car safety are actually personal alertness, time of day, etc. But if you adopted a whole bunch of wrong behaviours while driving a car it would absolutely reinforce anxiety!<p>&gt; To some extent anxiety is an irrational process. But I do think it has some basis in the physical world and by really going over what risks are and what risks aren’t you can tame it and reason with it somewhat. Good luck!<p>As an aside, I chose to move to a dense urban region in large part because I suffer from car anxiety. In particular, I get really anxious that the moment I <i>stop</i> feeling anxious my alertness will drop and I&#x27;ll be in a terrible collision. Although full on panic attacks are pretty rare from this.<p>(I have actually almost nerd sniped[0] myself by being really deep in thought about complexity theory while on mental autopilot back from my internship and making a left turn without realizing how close oncoming traffic was)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;356&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;356&#x2F;</a>')
