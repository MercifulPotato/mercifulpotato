Item(by='lr1970', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608464753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25469874, text='&gt; This feels like &quot;rust 2021 governance roadmap&quot;,<p>Please don&#x27;t get me wrong -- governance is important. But concentrating on governance for the entirety of 2021 leaving technical roadmaps to the teams is surprising. What problems is this roadmap trying to solve?<p>1. Is the existing governance model inadequate and needs to be urgently fixed?<p>2. Is Rust becoming a &quot;designed by committee&quot; language? This model does not seem to work despite the best intentions.<p>3. It would be very useful to see not only &quot;what&quot; is in the roadmap but also &quot;why&quot;.<p>EDIT: formatting...')
