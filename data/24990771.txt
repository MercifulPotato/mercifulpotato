Item(by='MisterTea', descendants=None, kids=[24991221], score=None, time=1604509118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24990637, text='&gt; I know a couple of people that have been bullied but haven&#x27;t seen much violent behavior from them, but they in general are very uncooperative with any authority (police, social services) and have a pretty low trust in the system<p>Most likely because whatever system was supposed to protect them, failed to do so. Schools like government are authoritarian structured institutions, they&#x27;re just another &quot;system&quot;. In a sense, schools condition children to be obedient to authority preparing them for life in a society with a government and rules. If they cant trust that system then are they supposed to trust the system they are being conditioned for?<p>This is the same feeling of mistrust that evolves in minority groups who are bullied&#x2F;oppressed (same thing really.)')
