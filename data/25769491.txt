The app said closed, it&#x27;s closed. \nEven if this was the case, how could you possibly ask for the entire damages caused by a third party? The ToS only talk about the user letting someone else drive the car for negligence, but how can that encompass thieves? They&#x27;re not asking for a negligence fee or a deductible, they want customers to pay for damages caused by thieves.<p>- Nope, an immobilizer is an industry-standard for keyfobs and digital keys alike. All competitors have it. They don&#x27;t track anything. They only check the idle state of the car. I you are driving, turn off the engine on a Share Now and We Share, then open a door, the immobilizer kicks in. That means that you need to open the app and &quot;unlock the engine&quot; to keep driving. Simple, extremely effective. \nIn two cases reported, Miles said the cars were stolen up to 4hrs after the users left them. Even if they forgot to close them (which users deny, with witnesses) they&#x27;re admitting that the car was open and available to anyone for hours. \nHow is that not a public safety issue and a farl√§ssigkeit of the company?')
