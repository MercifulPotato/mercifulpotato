I&#x27;ve experienced the consequences of turnover on my current team. The product was mostly built 5 years ago, but no one on my team has been here more than 1.5 years. Getting even basic things done requires extensive codebase archaeology. It sucks.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily think you need the people who wrote the code originally though. As long as there&#x27;s enough overlap between generations, and deliberate effort to train people on different parts of the system, knowledge can be preserved. That&#x27;s probably not possible if everyone changes teams after 2 years though, except for relatively simple or highly standardized codebases.')
