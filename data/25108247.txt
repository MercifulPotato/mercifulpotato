On the radio this morning there was talk about standardizing qualifications making more Australian degrees recognized in member countries.<p>This is so fascinating! I knew Australia hosts a lot of Chinese students but they&#x27;re really on their way to making education an export of theirs. Thanks for the perspective. I&#x27;m beginning to see the huge potentials of this treaty for the parties involved.')
