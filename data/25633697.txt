Do you want your stock to be volatile? (if you have large BTC assets, it should be...)<p>- I won&#x27;t comment on deflationary&#x2F;inefficient, I feel the article didn&#x27;t focus too much on that. But it&#x27;s a questionable store of value because it doesn&#x27;t have intrinsic value - this, again, should be uncontroversial. The article lists multiple events that might absolutely destroy BTC (the section &quot;BTC is really risky&quot;). It&#x27;s easy to imagine more (e.g. war or other catastrophic events that would make the BTC network &quot;less interesting&quot; and would make it really easy for a committed player to do a 51% attack, destroying all remaining trust).<p>It definitely feels like a fancy ponzi scheme - at the very least, BTC ticks a lot of boxes for &quot;how to identify a ponzi scheme&quot; (definitely 1 &amp; 5; arguably most others, except for 2):<p>1. Abnormally high investment returns. The most obvious sign of any investment skulduggery is the promise of an abnormally high investment return. ...<p>2. Guaranteed returns. ...<p>3. Consistently high performance. ...<p>4. Vague business model. ...<p>5. The need for more investors. ...<p>6. Pressure to reinvest. ...<p>7. The pressure to act now. ...<p>8. Credibility through association.<p>---<p>Note that I&#x27;m not claiming that BTC was created with the intention of being a Ponzi scheme!!! I&#x27;m just saying it appears to have many such characteristics, and one may reasonably assume that a similar eventual outcome is not unlikely.')
