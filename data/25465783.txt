Because game sales is to a large extent about that pre-hype, not the gaming experience.<p>Publishers have (correctly) realized that the games themselves are following the same mechanics as in-game loot boxes.<p>You might also think that these poor&#x2F;disappointing experiences would turn gamers off from buying the <i>next</i> game because they were burned the last time, but no that&#x27;s not my experience either.
