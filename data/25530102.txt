It gets the student focused on looking at the fingerboard and using the small lateral muscles in their fingers to try to reach for the tape rather than finding the large muscle positioning and biomechanics that produces in tune fingerings.<p>Hold up your hand with fingers straight. Try spreading your fingers and then pulling them together fast. They kind of &quot;pop&quot; between the two positions, and if you look at the spread position, they&#x27;re basically the same distance apart. So if you can arrange your arm so that spread drops an in-tune whole step on the fingerboard and together drops an in-tune half step, you will play in tune.<p>You do that by rotating your elbow under the instrument. The farther toward your back the elbow is, the more your hand is angled from the neck, and the closer the spacing between where your fingers fall on the fingerboard. The more your push your elbow forward, the more your fingers fall farther apart on the strings. There&#x27;s an in-tune position for each of the four strings, and kind of inbetweens for double stops. Training your gross muscle memory to find that position is vastly easier than searching for tapes, you don&#x27;t get in the habit of looking at the fingerboard (because there&#x27;s nothing there that makes a difference), and you don&#x27;t get slowed down later because your lateral muscles in your fingers are tense and making your fingers move slower.<p>The funny thing is that I think this was described in Geminiani&#x27;s treatise, which was the first manual of violin playing ever.')
