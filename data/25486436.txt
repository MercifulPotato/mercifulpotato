However, things are most probably improved now with lazy initializations of beans and maybe developers of that applications could have done better at that time. I don&#x27;t know it is still the case now.<p>&gt; Also, with the current network speeds and memory availability, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the war size to be a bottleneck in web development.<p>Network speed was not the problem, decompression &#x2F; expansion of the application was. There were war files about 100-150 MB size. Also I saw one with size of 1.5GB however it was an exception. These may or may not be a concern depending on your CPU utilization, disk speed, memory, etc.<p>Most decisions depends on environment. For some environments, as you said, deployments are not a concern for microservices, for some they are.')
