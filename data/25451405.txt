I’ve never identified as “high maintenance” — quite the opposite, in fact — but reading this gave me pause. On occasion, I exhibit many of the traits outlined in this article on projects at work. (I haven’t threatened to quit yet, but it’s on my mind as a possibility.

I don’t think I come across as “whiny” about them and am generally pretty accommodating in trying to help people attain them.
