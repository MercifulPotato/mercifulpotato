Thunderbolt ports would be ideal but their absence makes sense given it&#x27;s an AMD based system.<p>I feel that a year or two down the line, once USB4 begins to make headway, this machine is going to feel quite limited.<p>P.S. - I truly detest the USB 3.* naming convention - &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 - Type C connector&quot;, &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2&quot; and &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 1&quot; seem explicitly designed to confuse non-technical people, hell, it&#x27;s hard enough for technical people too.')
