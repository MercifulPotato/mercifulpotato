Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[24833744, 24836198], score=None, time=1603158728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24832118, text='After reading those four email screenshots, my conclusions are:<p>1. Roost should probably do a better job in the future figuring out who she&#x27;s trying to send her work to.<p>2. Sojwal&#x27;s reaction was way out of proportion to any slight or offense, real or otherwise.<p>3. Roost&#x27;s further reaction was foolish and condescending; taking Sojwal to task for her response was never going to be well received.<p>4. Sojwal&#x27;s further escalation was ridiculous; equating &quot;sending an essay that doesn&#x27;t meet the submission requirements&quot; with &quot;racism&quot; is just bonkers.<p>Beyond that, Roost should have just left well enough alone; it likely could have ended with that email exchange.  Whining about the interaction on Facebook and threatening to report Twitter posts would have been a bad look even if she <i>had</i> been completely in the right.<p>I don&#x27;t think Sojwal looks great here, but Roost had plenty of opportunities to put down her shovel and climb out of the hole she&#x27;d dug for herself, but instead chose to keep digging.<p>It&#x27;s just disappointing that public discourse around race has devolved so far that this sort of thing happens at all.  The excesses of cancel culture are a symptom, not the cause.')
