And when someone does, it basically sounds like very minor league codec artifacts.<p>Someone very familiar with a given voice, or other content, may possibly be able to tell.  But an A &#x2F; B test of this VS. codec artifacts will likely prove inconclusive.  It is hard given clean audio to compare against.<p>Once things have gone through a codec, all bets are essentially off.<p>This is not to say software detector could not be used.  The average phone should do fine.')
