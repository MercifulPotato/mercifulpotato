It&#x27;s a perversion of virtue. We live in a world system that always seems to have self-interest in there somewhere, but self-interest taken to extremes becomes evil.<p>So, &quot;Freedom v2.2&quot; is a system that allows for <i>some</i> entropy to motivate independent decisions that affect the public good (e.g., an entrepreneur), but are also punitive toward the public bad (e.g., child porn).<p>The <i>real</i> battle here that becomes political is the quantity and scope of controls. Generally, in the USA, the Republicans are presently leaning away from more controls and the Democrats toward it. The voter decides based on whether they think the system is self-correcting.<p>Or, to put another way, the <i>entire</i> essence of free information is either a self-correcting negative feedback loop (like the stock market) or a holy-crap-let&#x27;s-stop-this-train-before-we-all-die positive feedback loop (like a horrifically dysfunctional family).')
