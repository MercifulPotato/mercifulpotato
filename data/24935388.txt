Must everyone harbor a shadowy agenda?<p>The math does not care. For some number of slot machines, for some variance of payout, there is a single optimal explore-exploit strategy. If there are two slot machines, then a optimal agent does very little exploring. If there are a million slot machines, almost all with a $1 payout, but one with a $1 trillion payout, then you are inclined to do more exploring.[1]<p>Your disagreement is not with the theorem, but the shape of the distribution of slot machines.<p>And, of course, that distribution changes over time. For most of human history there either was no technological progress or it was imperceptible across a lifetime. Our current riot of ever-changing software tools is unprecedented. And, as hard as it is to believe when we&#x27;re in the thick of it, eventually computing will become a mature technology. A century from now, you can be sure there will be fewer programming languages in use, and they will be more similar to each other. If humans are still programming, the Delphi graybeard will be the norm, not the exception.<p>--<p>1: This is the actual useful takeaway from this submission, not the text from the article, which is the usual &quot;science news&quot; trash.')
