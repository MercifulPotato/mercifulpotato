You also acknowledge that it&#x27;s in Apple&#x27;s interest to push native, which is absolutely true. The only thing I would disagree with is that you think &quot;Apple just needs to give PWA developers [...]&quot; when Apple does not &quot;need&quot; to do such a thing at all.<p>Your whole comment is predicated on the interpretation of one word. Apple <i>just needs</i> to support push notifications for PWAs <i>if</i> they want to make PWAs useful and competitive, and it would be helpful for Apple in the antitrust battles that they seem to be facing. That&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;need&quot;. Previously, Apple also needed to add offline support, but they eventually did... so now that isn&#x27;t a &quot;need&quot; for PWAs to be useful and competitive, even if Apple&#x27;s offline support for PWAs is limited.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to implement it from whatever abstract interpretation of the word &quot;need&quot; that you&#x27;re using... I&#x27;m not saying Apple will starve to death if they don&#x27;t implement it -- it isn&#x27;t a fundamental business &quot;need&quot; that they currently have.<p>They <i>should</i> do it, and I really <i>want</i> them to do it.')
