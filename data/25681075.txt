It’s just math, not “an excuse”. You’ll never see the data for how many cases <i>would</i> have been recorded without the measures in place.<p>You can see the full paper here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.iza.org&#x2F;dp13319.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.iza.org&#x2F;dp13319.pdf</a><p>The second link you posted earlier also says conclusively that higher reported mask usage correlated with lower reports of symptoms. Are you even reading your own sources?<p>Or maybe you just have very skewed expectations of the impact? The Jena study estimates a 0.23 reduction in R rate. It is nowhere close to <i>eliminating</i> the disease, but this small reduction in transmission rate has an outsized effect on the total number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and that is what really matters (roughly, a 50% increase in transmission would result in 10x more deaths).<p>The inconvenience of wearing a mask is an insignificant price to pay even if the numbers are off by an order of magnitude.')
