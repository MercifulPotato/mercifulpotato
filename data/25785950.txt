For a company that will likely be around in 100 years or more, IBM-style, that&#x27;s not a good concession.<p>I agree, but if they <i>were</i> in the business of extracting significant pro-consumer concessions, I can see some weird incentives building up: imagine a dystopian future in several decades where the only semi-pro-consumer companies are the goliaths that have decadesâ€™ worth of accumulated concessions, and consumer startups nearly-universally act in their own financial interest, making them unusable for people who care about their data&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;ads&#x2F;etc., and regulators who are unwilling to burden startups with regulations that restrict them from competing with AmaGoogleFlix.')
