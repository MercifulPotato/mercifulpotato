Part of the lecture was about how electron microscopy was easier but pretty inaccurate compared to x-ray crystallography. But the slides were 10 years out of date, the accuracy of EM was still not as good but the gap was much smaller. So I updated them with more recent EM results from the same labs.<p>When the prof came back he spent the first 5m of the next lecture &quot;correcting&quot; me, explaining that EM sucked, x-ray was the only good technique. I realized that he had basically made up his mind decades earlier and no matter what changed in the technology he wasn&#x27;t going to change his opinion. Science has its own politics, similar to actual politics in that conclusions drive observations, but instead of being about minimum wage or housing supply it&#x27;s about arcane scientific techniques.')
