Decentralisation isn&#x27;t a feature most people care about. You, people in your circle, or HN might be very interested in decentralised apps but most people care about questions like<p>- is anyone I know using this app&#x2F;site&#x2F;service?<p>- is it a nice user experience? (most decentralised apps have a strictly worse user experience than their counterparts)<p>On top of this, it takes a lot of effort to grow past a certain size. Google or Facebook wouldn&#x27;t be where they are now if there wasn&#x27;t a single centralised force in the form of a company to push them forward.')
