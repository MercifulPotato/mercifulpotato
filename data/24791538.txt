Item(by='ebg13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602784465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790791, text='&gt; <i>We are performing those comparisons from the EU, over fiber Internet and a good WiFi access point.</i><p>That seems like a really stupid marketing move.<p>According to their charts, Zendesk is over 6x the size, but only takes 0.36s longer to load with more network requests and equal CDN latency. If their size difference only matters over a weak connection, they should have done their comparisons with a weak connection. They either threw away an opportunity with their charts or maybe their optimization didn&#x27;t make a big enough difference to matter in the end.<p>If I were them, I&#x27;d redo these tests quickly from somewhere else and update the charts to make it look like what they did matters.<p>Also the &quot;Saved Us 50TB of Bandwidth&quot; in the title isn&#x27;t discussed anywhere in the post. (And why would a customer care?)')
