You see, in the UK there is a large difference between the government <i>guidance</i> on mask wearing (taken to be rules by many), and what the <i>law</i> says. And yet, the police routinely arrest people not for breaking the law, but for ignoring what is in essence the preferences of a few ministers in government. This is the very definition of a police state: enforcing &#x27;rules&#x27; without legal authority.')
