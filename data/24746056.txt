PCs work fine.<p>&gt; Just make the iPhone the same as modern day PCs. Which people are already capable of using just fine.<p>Ransomware attacks are absolutely rampant, though you&#x27;ll never hear about the vast majority of incidents of course, and pretty much all of those start with someone running thingycorp_salaries_full_list.xlsx.exe, enabling macros for a fishy .docx, opening an infected .pdf, downloading and running infected installers, plugging in random USB keys, and so on. Then there&#x27;s lots and lots of phishing attacks going on, and that&#x27;s with most companies already clamping down on attack vectors really hard â€” if people used private PCs as much as they use their private smartphones, for sensitive things like banking, without an IT department to shield them from the worst of it, I guess consumer Windows would get a lot more locked down really quickly.<p>&gt; people are capable of using PCs, and don&#x27;t explode from the confusion of doing so.<p>People may not explode from confusion, but if they had a better idea of how complex IT security has become, they might at least feel somewhat uneasy. Even people in IT roles screw up and get pwned, or build systems in a way that lets them get pwned easily, all the time really. Bad actors have become pretty sophisticated over the last decade as well, and Covid-19 is only making things worse as lots of unsavory individuals with money and resources find that real-world crime doesn&#x27;t quite deliver the returns it used to, and everyone and their mother now conduct large parts of their lives through their smartphone and move lots of money through those devices. Personally, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed both attack volume and sophistication going up few notches already.<p>&gt; How does a lawyer use a PC, right now? So thats how they&#x27;ll do it.<p>The vast majoriy will depend on IT people to keep them safe, and their devices will be quite thoroughly locked down, and their email pretty aggressively filtered. Incidents definitely still happen, though. Same with medicine.<p>I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stretch to imagine people getting socially engineered en masse to install shady apps in a world where each app store and each app requires an entirely new security assessment on little to no data by end users, or apps getting compromised and not get pulled, or whatever. It&#x27;s possible to solve that quandary, but it&#x27;s not going to be as easy as just throwing out all restrictions without devising some other mechanism to take their place in protecting users.<p>&gt; Because PCs work, right now, and society is not falling apart.<p>Society isn&#x27;t falling apart from lots and lots of issues I&#x27;d consider quite severe. I&#x27;d rather not let anything get to that point if it can be prevented.')
