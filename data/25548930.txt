Item(by='octoberfranklin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609044422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546481, text='&gt; At the dawn of IPv6, the idea was that you could upgrade an address to IPv6 by prepending a pair of colons, as in ::1.2.3.4<p>No, IPv6 explicitly rejected that idea at first.  Most of the other IPng proposals <i>did</i> have a backwards compatibility mechanism like that.  I&#x27;m still sore that the <i>least backwards-compatible</i> proposal was the one that won.<p>Later the IPv6 cabal admitted their mistake and published NAT64, but at that point it was too late to make it a mandatory required service offered by any default-route router.  So now we have all of this crap about dual-stack hosts instead of simply being able to upgrade to IPv6 and trust that you will not lose any connectivity.<p>This is basically why, twenty years after it was standardized, IPv6 is still merely the &quot;internet of cellphones&quot; and no closer to replacing IPv4.<p>As usual, DJB saw all of this decades ahead of time:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;djbdns&#x2F;ipv6mess.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;djbdns&#x2F;ipv6mess.html</a>')
