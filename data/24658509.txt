You could argue that maintaining so many relationships is unhealthy but I think it&#x27;s a good thing to keep friends that I&#x27;ve cultivated over the last decade of my life. And usually when I need to get stuff done it&#x27;s nice to have friends to call upon who are interested in helping.<p>The internet can be used for a lot of good and it sounds like you&#x27;re argument is akin to saying telephones are bad because of call center scammers.')
