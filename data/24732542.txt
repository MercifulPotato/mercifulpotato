Item(by='cossatot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602266176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714990, text='The primary advantage that I notice of writing complex thoughts by hand, for example a first draft of something important, is that insertion of more than a few words is difficult on paper. Therefore I tend to work just a bit more deliberately and focus a bit more on the narrative structure.  The results tend to have a more coherent narrative flow, be easier to read, and be more organized than a draft written on a computer where I can jump back and forth between partially-completed paragraphs or sections.<p>Similarly, decreasing the accessibility of information, code, etc. helps me develop the narrative when making the first draft.<p>I get a pretty big productivity bump from bringing a notebook to a desk or table away from a computer (with its attendant distractions) and spend an hour or two, producing a page or two, that require much less editing later. I can leave little spaces for numbers or other specifics that I don&#x27;t have on hand, and make marginal notes for other things to research or fill in later, while focusing on the structure and organizing my thoughts and arguments.  Afterwards I can make figures, check calculations and statistics, etc.<p>I also frequently draw out powerpoint presentations on graph paper, maybe 8 slides per paper page, and just write the basic points and sketch in the figures I want to add.  Then I go through and actually make the slides at the computer.')
