Most of us have heard Google horror stories <i>when you use their products</i> the fact you can be free of them and have any new customers bounce from your sight in terror is uh, terrifying.<p>I would like to emphasize <i>of course</i> they have good stated reasons for warning users before accessing websites. The issue is that they are a private company whose behavior affects all major browsers and (for kicks) they have an extremely opaque review process.<p>If you ran a &quot;divest from Big Tech&quot; website which started gaining steam they could delist like this and the only real force stopping them is public backlash. If you think you can effectively sue Google to stop them I have a bridge to sell you.')
