You could mouse on it to get a dynamically-generated menu of operations supported by the pointed-to value, or call functions on it, or whatever.<p>In Sk8 you could grab an arbitrary widget anywhere on the screen and drop it on a MessageBox window to obtain a named variable referring to it. You could then operate on it in a manner similar to that described above.')
