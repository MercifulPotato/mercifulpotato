That means when a node sees a transaction from another node, it&#x27;s impossible to know whether the node was the originator of the transaction, or was merely relaying it from another node. AFAIK bitcoin core also has some mitigations such as delaying broadcast to a subset of the nodes, to make it look like your node wasn&#x27;t the first node to learn about the transaction.')
