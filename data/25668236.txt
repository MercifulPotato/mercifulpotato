Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25671252], score=None, time=1610004534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667996, text='&gt; That is flat-out not true.<p>It actually is true that there are &quot;lots of sworn first-person statements, which aren&#x27;t hearsay.&quot; This isn&#x27;t to say there are none that are hearsay.<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t combed through every piece of evidence in every case, but a lot of &quot;sworn first-person statements&quot; basically amounted to hearsay or other statements that could not legally be sustained as evidence.<p>Right, and we could ignore them and talk about the ones where people testify to <i>things that happened to them or in their presence</i> but its much easier to respond to evidence you don&#x27;t like by ignoring it and debunking &quot;evidence&quot; that&#x27;s easy to respond to.<p>&gt; The first set of cases did reach that stage<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to as &quot;the first set of cases&quot; but many of the cases were dismissed before evidence was heard. That means you can&#x27;t faithfully dismiss the evidence on the basis of a dismissed court case because the court never looked at the evidence.<p>&gt; The people who are alleging this conspiracy--first and foremost Trump himself--are unwilling to sustain any evidence to the contrary.<p>I disagree and if you could <i>present</i> evidence to the contrary we could perhaps resolve this.<p>&gt; The Trump campaign and affiliates have lost 62 lawsuits in the past two months (and that&#x27;s not counting subsequent losses on appeal).<p>Refer to my statement above. Most of those never even examined the evidence.<p>&gt; For the first time in 230 years, a mob has broken into Congress<p>Its not that big of a deal, the last time a mob broke into congress was 2018.<p>&gt; has broken into Congress to commit sedition<p>Actually they are trying (in vain) to avoid disenfranchisement. Or if you prefer not to appear to take a position on the object-level issue, its merely a &quot;mostly peaceful protest.&quot;<p>&gt; Why? It&#x27;s not because we didn&#x27;t demonstrate the concerns were being taken seriously.<p><i>that most certainly is why</i>.<p>&gt;  It&#x27;s because way too many people were willing to indulge a delusional conspiracy theory that was ungrounded in truth, and to pretend that frivolous lawsuits that were clearly contrary to all prior precedent fanned [2] that delusion.<p>I like how you compared the idea that people might cheat in an election to a delusion, when people cheat in elections all the time and its probably more properly considered delusional when someone insists (without evidence) that there was no fraud and all these people asserting fraud on the basis of evidence are delusional.<p>&gt;  If two or more persons in any State or Territory [...] conspire to [...] by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, [...] they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.<p>Would that apply to conspiracy to violate election law?')
