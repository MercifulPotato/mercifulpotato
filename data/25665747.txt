Your manager supports you, but you need to drive it and deliver it.<p>Tooling&#x2F;languages are standardised, but FB does not care whether you do know Hack, or JS. You can do interview in any language (if you are going for generic engineering role). So far at FB I have coded in 4 different languages and picked up all of them as I joined teams.<p>Even though FB is enterprise company, it feels like startup with great salary, benefits and more manageable work-life balance. Before FB I was 7 years in startups and I have worked longer hours, got paid much less and wasted more time.')
