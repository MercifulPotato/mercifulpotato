I know that in some countries (disgracefully in my view) even leaving home for a solitary walk or with family you live with anyhow was forbidden, but where it isn&#x27;t anyone who&#x27;s been feeling more than a bit claustrophobic should sincerely just go out and get some air on a regular basis. It is possible to do this without overly exposing yourself, and it can be done in the company of any people you in any case might share your home and intimate air with.')
