The governor&#x27;s in charge of enforcement. Punishment comes in the form of losing elections or impeachments, not law enforcement.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you can argue they&#x27;re bad actors when the clear and obvious reasoning for those measures across the country are to limit the spread of a deadly pandemic.<p>It seems to me like the poll watcher is the person with standing?
