I learned that no job is perfect, and if you have a good thing going, stick with it.<p>Now, hindsight is always 20-20. If I had that experience, I&#x27;d probably ask my boss about it, in private, if possible. (Good leadership should always be able to handle challenging questions from subordinates.) (But, there are times where leadership should be challenged publicly.)<p>Perhaps the statement needed some context? I&#x27;ve had to make statements like, &quot;no, I will not do you work for you,&quot; and, &quot;now I&#x27;ve never done this before, and hopefully don&#x27;t need to do it again, but I&#x27;m pulling rank here.&quot;<p>So I would have tried to get context from you boss... And maybe realize that good people make mistakes too.<p>Edit: The point to leave is when there is a pattern of bad behavior.')
