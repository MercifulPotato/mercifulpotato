There are not that many of my personal friends&#x2F;family were ever on MySpace. Now however, almost every one of my personal friends and family members is on Facebook.<p>* MySpace did not spend billions acquiring potential social network competitors. The two biggest c(non Chinese) social networks that might have challenged Facebook were acquired for billions (Instagram and WhatsApp) and the other network (SnapChat) had an offer, and when it was turned down, a competing service was created by Facebook.<p>* As a market matures, it becomes harder to unseat incumbents. The social media market is far more mature than it was before.<p>* as an example, Google dethroned AltaVista and Lycos rather easily. However, I would bet money that 10 years from now, absent regulation, Google will still have the dominant search engine. In the same way, 10 years from now, I would bet that Facebook will still have the dominant social network.')
