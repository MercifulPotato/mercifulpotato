They won&#x27;t accept what you are telling them, they will endlessly keep rephrasing what they want from you, coming up with endless explanations how it&#x27;s very bad of you to not do what they are requesting. And once your patience finally runs out after 20 emails back and forth, they will throw a massive tantrum, that sometimes includes false complaints, reviews, and takedown requests. Ignoring them in the first place saves you the trouble. I guess, they quickly pick another victim instead.')
