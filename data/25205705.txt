In most cases were a government&#x2F;authority&#x2F;kingdom&#x2F;whatever transitioned to a democracy it was merely, because the state was in crisis and democracy was a rallying cry people could get behind, because it promised a way of ending the misery\n(the examples that spring to mind are the famines of 1789 and the 1840s in Europe which triggered multiple revolutions).<p>I think if there were no existential threat to a critical mass of people in those European countries, they would never have revolted, nor would we have so many democracies today.<p>For a similar reason I believe the democratic movements&#x2F;protests in the recent years (like the Arab Spring, or the Hong Kong protests) have not resulted in a victory for democracy, since there is no real critical mass of  people whom are existentially threatened by the failure of these movements.<p>Since I am sure someone has thought these thoughts before, I would be grateful if someone could point me in the direction of articles mentioning a similar sentiment&#x2F;idea.')
