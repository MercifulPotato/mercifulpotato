I was wondering if anyone has figured out a good way of programming on the go? I don&#x27;t think a phone would work because typing&#x2F;navigating is just too inconvenient. I was thinking something along the lines of using a wireless keyboard (I mostly use Vim) with something like Google glass, but not sure how realistic it would be to get a pair of those. I assume most people just use a treadmill with a laptop, but I can&#x27;t get a treadmill in my house. I can take my laptop to the gym, but was curious to see if anyone has seen or uses a more convenient approach.')
