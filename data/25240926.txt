If decisions don&#x27;t matter then the only way to define discrimination is via observed results: if you have no black employees, it must be discrimination, even if nobody ever actually discriminated in an objective way. Which means you&#x27;d be punished for not matching some theoretical demographics.<p>The whole notion is ridiculous. The fact that California takes this stuff so seriously just makes it look like it&#x27;s throwing away its tech lead, as viewed from afar.')
