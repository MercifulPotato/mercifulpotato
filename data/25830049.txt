Census blocks are intended as an organizational unit for census data and not necessarily for any comparative use, such as this website makes, since it&#x27;s clear that the demographics of blocks will vary widely depending on location, size, etc.<p>Historically census blocks were determined in the field as an early stage of enumeration based on local conventions, but today they&#x27;re defined semi-automatically from GIS data. Still, what exactly defines a block and what is typical of them varies widely from place to place.<p>Blocks are the lowest level of the hierarchy in which census data is organized, next being block groups and then tracts.')
