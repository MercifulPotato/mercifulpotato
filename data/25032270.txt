With two disk integrators and some differentials it&#x27;s possible to integrate the equation of motion for the vertical direction, because forward motion is constant this is all the &#x27;computing&#x27; we need to do. We can sense hits to pipes using physical pipes and a feeler on a spring.<p>We could use a looping set of pipes, but it should also be possible to do randomization too. A simple way to do this is to have a four sided rectangular block with different pipe configurations on each side. As it is looped around, it gets spun randomizing the orientation like a slot machine, and then we lock the orientation to one of the four.<p>It might be difficult to carry out the integration fast enough. Although it would be funny if we ran it off a scooter engine to integrate at high speeds.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twobithistory.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;differential-analyzer.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twobithistory.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;differential-analyzer.h...</a>')
