It is also the job of governing leaders to encourage and educate citizens on how and why they should comply with these policies. This is where the USA is failing miserably.<p>We could discuss the tradeoffs and the details, that’s fair, but it’s totally irresponsible of you to say that this massive spike in cases was ‘inevitable’.')
