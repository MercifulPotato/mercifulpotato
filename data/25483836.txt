In this modern age, we are all kings, and there are vast industries to save us from ever being alone from our thoughts.<p>For December, I quit sugar, social media, and video games. It&#x27;s been really interesting to notice what state I&#x27;m in when I go to reach for those things. Sometimes it&#x27;s just habit, but often it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m uncomfortable or in distress and want to avoid those feelings. But indulging in those things often just kicks the problem down the road.<p>Indeed, breaking my social media habits reminds me of Oscar Wilde talking about cigarettes: &quot;A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want?&quot; The same for me is definitely true with Twitter and Facebook. An infinite feed of shiny, entertaining, funny, and outraging things, but almost nothing that&#x27;s ever satisfying.')
