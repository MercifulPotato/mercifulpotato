So the odds of getting a 1 on a 10-sided dice are 9 <i>to</i> 1 against (odds are also typically specified with the larger number first, because of the overlap between mathematical odds and betting-shop odds).  And the probability of it happening is 1 <i>in</i> 10.<p>(I suspect that counter-pedantry on these lines might be part of why your post is getting downvoted; I wasn&#x27;t one of the downvoters fwiw.)')
