Similar story for other tropical fruits, including bananas. The demands of long-distance shipping and wide distribution force significant compromises in most types of fresh produce.<p>Disclaimer: I have never been to India.<p>&gt; <i>best mangoes I have tasted in America were from two huge trees in the backyard ... in Hawaii</i><p>Yeah now try to grow those at commercial scale and keep them as tasty weeks later after shipping them hundreds of miles across several layers of supply chain.')
