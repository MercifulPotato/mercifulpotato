Item(by='asenk', descendants=None, kids=[25135042], score=None, time=1605693619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134903, text='&gt;The overall lifecycle CO2 benefit of EVs and hybrids as they stand is minimal.<p>That&#x27;s simply not true.<p>&gt;Net emission reductions from electric cars and heat pumps in 59 world regions over time<p>&gt;..We show that already under current carbon intensities of electricity generation, electric cars and heat pumps are less emission intensive than fossil-fuel-based alternatives in 53 world regions, representing 95% of the global transport and heating demand. Even if future end-use electrification is not matched by rapid power-sector decarbonization, it will probably reduce emissions in almost all world regions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41893-020-0488-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41893-020-0488-7</a>')
