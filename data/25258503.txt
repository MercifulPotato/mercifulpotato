AlphaFold (and other competitors) seem to use MSA (Multiple Sequence Aligment) and this (brilliant) idea of co-evolving residues to build an initial graph of sections of protein chain that are likely proximal. This seems like a useful trick for predicting existing biological structures (i.e. ones that evolved) from genomic data. I wonder (as very much a non-biologist), do MSA-based approaches also help understand &quot;first-principles&quot; folding physics any better? and to what degree? If I write a random genetic sequence (think drug discovery) that has many aligned sequences, without the strong assumption of co-evolution at my disposal, there does not seem any good reason for the aligned sequences to also be proximal. Please pardon my admittedly deep knowledge gaps.')
