Because when we&#x27;re talking about UIs, there are most definitely &quot;ways of doing things&quot; and &quot;ways of not doing things&quot;<p>There are definitly things you should not do, but there hardly is a list ot things you always should do. There is just no gold list of thing in UI, just customs and established conventions to enforce the &quot;intuitive level&quot; of interactions.<p>But even between different platforms you have strictly different conventions, sometimes even competing with each other. Yet most of them are good on their own and it&#x27;s wrong to use one of them.<p>&gt; after 50-odd years of user interfaces, we ended up with scrollbars and buttons and tabs for a reason.<p>Yet wie have working interfaces without scrollsbars, buttons and tabs, even where they could be used, and some cases where using them even makes the interaction worse.<p>UI is more a kind or prioritylist of things you can add, not a checklist of things you should add.')
