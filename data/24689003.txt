I did most of the data analysis, and I used R. That was something he just didn&#x27;t understand although I did explain it a couple of times.<p>Things like version control, CI, R&#x2F;Python for data analysis, all make sense to professionals but not necessarily to dabblers. Perhaps a dabbler in data analysis made this decision.')
