Item(by='Laforet', descendants=None, kids=[25796642], score=None, time=1610742258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794705, text='&gt;chlorine dioxide is not sodium hypoclorite<p>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to make of what you said until you dropped this common fallacy used by MMS cultists.<p>All forms of oxidising bleach (chlorine gas, hypochlorite solution, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate, etc) take effect by taking electrons from other matter. These reactions are able to &quot;bleach&quot; because pigments are often complex organic molecules which tend to decompose in presence of strong oxidizers.<p>The toxicity of chlorine dioxide is very well studied. Guess what, once absorbed it acts as a bleach&#x2F;oxidizer in your blood, rupturing red blood cells and may lead to kidney failure as haemoglobin is released into the plasma.<p>The reaction is caused by the inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase which is probably the tenuous link between consuming bleach and cancer treatment. While the enzyme is indeed a drug target that people have looked into, it is very unlikely to work by oral dosing because many healthy issue also rely on the enzyme to survive.<p>This, of course, has not stopped the MMS cult from claiming that their panacea cures every single ailment under the sun which has no medical basis whatsoever.')
