Item(by='Dowwie', descendants=None, kids=[24944187], score=None, time=1604070370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24941873, text='I&#x27;ll try to focus on a reason that Steve hasn&#x27;t touched in his response -- investing in one&#x27;s future.<p>I&#x27;m a generalist who wants to use great tools for my work.  I&#x27;ve built a variety of systems, not just web applications, with Rust.  The more I use the language, the more I learn and develop greater capabilities to do more unfamiliar work.  I am on the fence right now about diving into video streaming&#x2F;processing but already have a foundational knowledge that will lend useful to a Rust-based solution.  Embedded product development, too.  And mobile.  Rust is being used everywhere, now, with success.<p>So, while you may get away with using slim for your web app, using Rust instead is a way of acquiring the skillset that is applicable across all software development.  One may do web dev today,  but security engineering tomorrow.  Whatever the domain, Rust expertise carries over.  Using Rust for web development is how you invest in a software engineering future.  As a manager, one may argue that this is up to the programmer to do so in their own time, and not company time.  Well, in response to that I recommend reading Steve&#x27;s comment as to why you can&#x27;t afford not to use Rust going forward. :)')
