Engineers look at code all day. And when they see two pieces of code doing roughly the same thing, they immediately think about ways they could eliminate the wasted effort by combining them into one piece of code that performs both functions”.<p>I shudder when thinking of all the times I have wasted time trying to generalize something only to end up with code that is harder to understand, awkward to use, more complex, more prone to bugs, or all of the aforementioned, just because there is a stupid voice in my head going “do not repeat yourself”.<p>With maturity comes the insight that not repeating yourself is good.  But sometimes avoiding it makes things worse and costs a lot more.')
