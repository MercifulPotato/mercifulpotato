Item(by='ryanmercer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610541706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758623, text='&gt; Look how many videos there are of the Chelyabinsk meteor.<p>That event was immediately noticeable and happened in an area where the vast majority of vehicles have dash cams due to insurance fraud.<p>Not a lot of people stare at the sky though looking for flying objects that they cannot identify. Most cameras aren&#x27;t pointed in a direction to capture much (if any) of the sky either. Also, go outside next time the moon is out, get your phone out and take a photo or video of it... looks like a tiny blob of light doesn&#x27;t it, far worse than what your naked eye sees.<p>In December I was curious about MUFON so joined, paid to take the test to become a field investigator as I was curious what people are reporting (largely commercial aircraft I suspect after having worked at an airport for 15 years and seeing aircraft appear to do wonky stuff due to distance&#x2F;speed&#x2F;absurdly bright landing lights), and joined the MUFON facebook group.<p>On the Facebook group, when you sift through the hot chaff of people claiming they&#x27;ve been telepathically communicating with umpteen races of aliens that &quot;their sources&quot; given them &quot;intel&quot; about, you get a lot of photos and videos of what are almost certainly commercial aircraft. In once instance in the past few weeks someone posted a photo of an &quot;alien ship&quot; that was blatantly a Mylar balloon in the shape of a sun with wavy rays of Mylar around the edge of the balloon.<p>Then factor in things like stars, planets, satellites, toy and commercial drones, Chinese lanterns, balloons, space debris reentering the atmosphere, military aircraft refueling, etc and you quickly realize that probably 99.999999999999999999999999% of Unidentified Flying Objects are man made and natural phenomenon, often extremely boring stuff.<p>Recently there was some siting off of Hawaii of some blue orb. I had multiple people get into arguments with me on the MUFON group about it&#x27;s origins. I believe it was random space junk, immediately a man began insisting it was an &quot;ion propulsion&quot; alien ship crashing after it had been shot, kept insisting that only that bluish glow could be create by an ET exotic technology star drive, I quickly pointed out more than a dozen materials that create a blue flame when they burn at which point he kept arguing with me and got quite hostile insisting it&#x27;s a downed alien craft.<p>The past 2-3 days that group has had people sharing a recent article about Juno detecting an FM radio signal from one of Jupiter&#x27;s moons. Almost everyone on those posts is adamant it is an extraterrestrial signal that NASA is trying to cover up. Virtually none of them are willing to even entertain the idea that this is 100% a natural phenomenon that science can fully explain.<p>Even if all of the cameras we have deployed around the planet were capable of getting high resolution, stable, quality images of the bulk of Unidentified Flying Objects, some people would simply claim a conspiracy when you showed they were very much not little green men in flying saucers.')
