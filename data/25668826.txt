I got up to 5 I believe (with one being a new ultrawide). It was impossible to use them all productively. At best they could serve as live status for some Jenkins job. Two monitors are useful, but now you can just use one ultrawide (I like to use two cables since it makes Window management easier, but you can use software for that too). I like to have one extra in addition to an ultrawide, but it&#x27;s often unused.')
