I had pre-ordered one from the UK company. Its announcement coincided with a thing I had for small-form clamshells. I had a Saurus, a Viliv and a Nanonote. The Nanonote was open, both hardware and software, and I was expecting the same high quality development process from the Pandora as I had seen in the Nanonote team. I was <i>so</i> excited about Pandora!<p>Then of course...<p><i>In March 2013, the pre-order queue of the German OpenPandora GmbH company (owned by Michael Mrozek aka EvilDragon) was finally cleared.[18] The remaining pre-order queue of the UK OpenPandora Ltd. company (owned by Craig Rothwell) turned out to be significantly larger than originally reported, and the UK company has requested to be struck off.[19] This means that the original pre-orderers at the UK company are unlikely to ever get their unit from the UK company. Also because of this, buyers have lost their money. Although there is no legal connection between the two companies, the German OpenPandora GmbH company is trying to help those UK customers by offering them significant discounts (if they decide to buy a unit from the German company instead of waiting for the UK company) and by organizing community donations to get them peer-funded units.[20]</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pandora_(console)#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pandora_(console)#History</a><p>... it got stuck in development hell. I bailed early and managed to get my pre-order money back, but I was probably one of the few. I guess, if we had all held on to our faith, we&#x27;d have gotten our devices right about now. Only ten years later!<p>Unfortunately, the same thing seems to be happening with the Pyra.<p>&gt;&gt; The DragonBox Pyra has had a difficult development process, with numerous hardware (and mold) related issues during its design. It was kind of supposed to be ready to come out a few years ago, but every time you’d think “hey, it’s just 2 months away now!” it would be delayed again and again – for yet completely valid reasons.')
