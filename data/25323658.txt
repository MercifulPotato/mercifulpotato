The entire idea of Libra as a cryptocurrency was more ludicrous than any state adopting btc. It essentially was the western Union &#x2F; paypal with same contributors but with a shiny new word, crypto.<p>My question. What is the &quot;benefit&quot; of using Libra when you can just as easily transact with xrp ? Dictatorship by Facebook first, tracking of spending for MOAR ADS.<p>Who benefits from Libra ? Not the end user at least. Oh and fees. If there are no fees on Libra,why is PayPal investing money in this model ?')
