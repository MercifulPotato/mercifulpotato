I believe all of the MVP features have been sufficiently implemented and tested and a modest website and admin tool has been built up to support it.<p>So, I believe it&#x27;s ready for a wider audience to check out and provide feedback.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear any kind of constructive criticism on the website and the service itself.  For those who are interested in trying it out for some time for free, I&#x27;d love to hear about their experiences...good and bad.<p>So...I&#x27;m ready for feedback...!  Please be gentle.  ;-)')
