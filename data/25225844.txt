The caller in this case is, in my example, the function that takes the user inputs. But every subsequent part of the application (in my example the sorting&#x2F;email function) does _not_ have to deal with it anymore.<p>So essentially: you only have to deal with errors at the boundaries of your application - and after that, the rest of your code (usually the vast majority) just works without checking for errors again and again.<p>So to answer your summary:<p>&gt; A compiler can’t solve the problem of preventing the class of bug you’re talking about, hence why there always needs to be some code that handles cases like empty files or lists<p>Yes. The difference is: do you want to handle these case all over again in each function of your code base... or just once at the boundary.')
