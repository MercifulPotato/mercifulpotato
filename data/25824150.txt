Healthcare in EU is based on solidarity system where every citizen pays a percentage share of his monthly salary to the  medical insurance. So if you earn more, then you will also pay more medical insurance - but you will get the same treatment as others (unless you have some fancy private insurance on top of the regular insurance). \nSo basically any medical expense is subsided by every citizen in the country indirectly.<p>I believe this is a completely different way of looking at things than in the US. The average EU citizen doesn&#x27;t really think that the monthly medical deduction from his salary is just for his use or it&#x27;s his own insurance, it&#x27;s only a contribution to the whole system.')
