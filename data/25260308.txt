That can make sense, depending on your perception of the degree of harm and the probability of harm.  Still, for at least some degrees and probabilities of harm, that&#x27;s a spectacularly wrong-headed approach.<p>[Edit:  And let me note that I agree with you on one thing:  The lockdown <i>is</i> harmful.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I agree with your larger perspective.]')
