I look forward to the report proving otherwise after a year or three.<p>You can&#x27;t buy things, have accounts (including banking), get healthcare, or get anything done with local government without a phone number. Forced 2FA via SMS is only accelerating normalizing ubiquitous demands for phone numbers. Just as claims of fraud protection have normalized ubiquitous demands for SSNs or driver&#x27;s license numbers.<p>You can probably get by without a smartphone, but good luck getting by without a phone number.<p>Probably the best you can hope to do is to get a number through an online service that doesn&#x27;t connect to a large telco and which you access solely through Tor.<p>But my money is on that system not working because you&#x27;ll get stuck at infinite CAPTCHA loops or silently blocked for looking like abuse.<p>This is absolutely a place where we need a legislative solution rather than a technological one. Unfortunately the government and corporate incentives aren&#x27;t aligned with the citizens&#x27;, so it&#x27;s not going to happen.')
