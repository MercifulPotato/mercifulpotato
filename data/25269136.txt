I run a tech startup and have been angel investing in other startups since many years. I’m a business angel in the mentioned IPO and have no lock-up period. I had liquidity events in the past but not at this size. I dont’t plan to sell at IPO nor need the cash. I believe that the company will 10-20x over the next 10-20 years and would love to hold the shares.\nThat said, I think this is not optimal for my portfolio. Possibly even idiotic. I’m wondering what the optimal play in terms portfolio construction is.<p>Reading and analysing the data [0] on IPOs over that last decades suggests that I should sell all shares on a schedule, like over 18 months [1], and reinvest in new startup deals.<p>Who has been in a similar situation and can point me in the right direction?<p>I do not want to retire. I want to keep investing in startups.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;site.warrington.ufl.edu&#x2F;ritter&#x2F;ipo-data&#x2F; [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.wealthfront.com&#x2F;sell-employee-stock&#x2F;')
