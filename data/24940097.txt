A proper meal shouldn&#x27;t really create a blood sugar (and resulting insulin) spike as much as a gradual elevation and fall back to baseline, because protein, fat, and fiber all slow digestion, and complex carbs (and even sugars within fiber&#x2F;nutrient matrixes ie whole fruits) don&#x27;t tend to spike blood sugar too badly in the first place.')
