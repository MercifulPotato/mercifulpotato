Item(by='throwaway287391', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606038041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25174648, text='&gt; Transcriptions from dead composers like Busoni are allowed in competitions. So if you&#x27;re dead and gone, your transcription is a &quot;work&quot;. If you&#x27;re alive and playing in a competition it&#x27;s not allowed, unless the student is making emendations to an already transcribed piece.<p>Huh, interesting... Do you happen to have a pointer to any more info&#x2F;context on this or a link to a competition’s rules where they say this? I played piano for a long time (although never at anywhere near an international competition level) and I’ve never heard of this; it seems like a really bizarre rule to allow competitors to make arbitrary changes to an already-altered piece, but not allow any changes at all for a fully original one. I feel like I’m missing something.')
