Melvin borrows 40 shares from A, and sells it to Person B.<p>Person A + Person B now have 140 shares combined (while Melvin has -40 shares). If PersonA + PersonB agree to loan shares to Melvin for another short sell, they&#x27;ve become able to drop to -140 shares, by borrowing 60 of Person A&#x27;s remaining shares, and then 40 shares from B.<p>Nothing illegal here, as long as Person A and Person B agree to the terms.<p>----------<p>And again: Melvin seemed to hold puts, not shorts. So this entire point is moot anyway. Puts are a bear-bet, but they&#x27;re kind of unrelated to short-selling.')
