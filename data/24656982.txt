You need FICA, state, local, federal etc. people often underestimate all of this when they are tossing tax rates around.<p>Effective tax rate for a single earner of 150,000 in NYC with no extra deductions is a bit over 32%.<p>Remember that the before-tax delta here gets applied at the marginal rate, so it&#x27;s always going to be knocked down a fair bit for higher earners; the net impact will be smaller.<p>Anyway I assumed above leaving NYC for somewhere else in NY.\nIt&#x27;s easy to come up with scenarios where you might actually take home more with the pay cut (e.g. SF, CA -&gt; Houston, TX).  Housing costs there would be way lower (less than 1&#x2F;2?).')
