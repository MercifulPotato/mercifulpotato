Mostly because the only times I&#x27;ve needed &quot;customer support&quot; was when I&#x27;ve been sent fake items (specs grossly and explicitly misstated, usually, often with clear intent to deceive), and that is something AliExpress sellers will absolutely <i>never</i> admit to doing in my experience. Best case they politely say there&#x27;s no problem, worst case they throw racial slurs based on your presumed nationality based on the destination country (which isn&#x27;t even correct for me, ha).<p>In those cases, AliExpress will seemingly randomly decide for or against you randomly, even when you file a dispute with clear photographic and video evidence. I&#x27;ve had it go both ways.<p>90% of the time it&#x27;s fine, though, and the cost savings outweigh the loss from fake goods. But I&#x27;d certainly not call the AliExpress CS experience &quot;good&quot;.')
