My guess is the willingness to pay vs github for just plain source control isn&#x27;t there.<p>:shrug:<p>This is the risk with saas though.  Customers are adults; they can choose to continue using your product or not.  If customers don&#x27;t want the saas they buy to be able to change models or raise prices, their choices are (1) don&#x27;t use it; or (2) sign annual or even multiyear agreements.  And if a company evaluates software that won&#x27;t make multiyear commitments to them, they should take that unwillingness into account when choosing which vendor to use.')
