Item(by='mwcampbell', descendants=None, kids=[25560200], score=None, time=1609169724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559869, text='&gt; I&#x27;m merely suggesting a hack that goes along with this  hack, not the foundation technology for a mono-binary Office clone.<p>Sure. I just worry that one person&#x27;s clever hack will then become another person&#x27;s indispensable tool, which they&#x27;ll then impose on their colleagues, employees, or contractors, blocking a third person from doing their job. I know a blind person who temporarily lost his job because his employer&#x27;s largest client required an application that didn&#x27;t work with screen readers. So I just want to make sure developers are aware of accessibility, and in general, the risks of reinventing things that are necessarily complex.')
