CompCert started in 2005 and it still can&#x27;t compile all of C, and it doesn&#x27;t go past the level of Gcc&#x27;s -O1 optimizations.<p>Formal verification is an extreme cost amplifier, and the cost is super-linear with the size of the code base. I don&#x27;t think my estimate is unrealistic, depending on exactly what you would expect to have running before vi (I was assuming a complete OS including a kernel, device drivers, a C stdlib or equivalent, and a userspace similar to the GNU tools).')
