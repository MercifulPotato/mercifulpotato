But with the professionalisation of even the free software community I have, I must admit, all but given up hope.<p>This wave exists, we’re just old. Go talk to 16 year olds who are building virtual reality machine learning apps in their bedroom.<p>Web is no longer the frontier. We’re old and out of touch. The kids no longer hang out with us. Hence you see a lack of youthful idealism.')
