Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604247650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958204, text='Other than keyboarding&#x2F;IME practice, there is no benefit to typing out a word or phrase compared to recalling the word or phrase and seeing that it matches exactly. If you see the right spelling in your mind and &quot;hear&quot; the word, you obviously know the word and could type it if required.<p>(For languages with an ideographic writing system, there is a benefit to writing by hand, but that&#x27;s a whole separate story.)<p>It sounds as if your flashcards are in a format where the foreign word is the answer, or embedded in the answer via a cloze. That&#x27;s not the only way Anki is used. If the flashcards are in a foreign-word -&gt; definition format, the typing would have to be definition-side, to which there is little benefit. All the more obviously so for definitions that are in your native language. Definitions are too verbose to type out, and difficult to machine-grade due to variations in wording.<p>I understand the efficiency benefit that keyboarding can bring, but it&#x27;s not realized in Anki.<p>I made a very good application for kanji memorization, where the keyboard is the key to efficiency. The reason is that in this program, all of the characters you are tested on appear on the same screen simultaneously. You type answers into blanks next to each character, and use Tab to move from one to the next. The machine grades your answers when you&#x27;re done; you don&#x27;t have to engage in time-wasting self-checking. This is extremely fast because you can operate in pipeline mode: your eyes scan ahead several characters while your fingers type without stopping. Also, if you&#x27;re having trouble recalling, you can just leave the answer blank and then easily return to it before submitting the test for grading. Often, your mind will come up with the answer in the background, while you are filling other answers.<p>The main source of inefficiency in Anki is the stop-and-go blocking: being shown one card at a time, and not being able to go to the next card until passing the current card. Anki is best used for the cards for which that is the most efficient approach: cards that have a simple front, and a complex back that requires self-evaluation. For cards that have a one or two word answer that can be machine-checked, I would find (or develop) something much more efficient than Anki.')
