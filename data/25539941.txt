Apple&#x27;s understanding of security and privacy is fundamentally broken: they protect you against a boogyman, the idea of someone who wants to take your data for exploitative gain. In reality, the paradigm of computer security has completely changed. Apple had been leaking unencrypted user data to third party firms for years, and refused to yield when researchers warned them of the implications. Thunderbolt is rife with security vulnerabilities, some exploits being so advanced that they can give the attacker a raw dump of whatever was in memory (which is ironically even more dangerous thanks to MacOS&#x27; lackluster memory management).<p>At the end of the day, securing MacOS is a losing game. Big Sur introduced new, untraceable telemetry at the lowest levels of the system, basically forcing me out of the Mac game. Linux it a breath of fresh air by comparison: not only does my system never phone home, it gets security updates as a first-class citizen in the software world (one of the many perks of being the backbone of most computer infrastructure).<p>Security on Linux is entirely dependent on the user. One of the core Unix philosophies is that a true Unix system won&#x27;t stop a dumb user from doing something dumb, because that impedes clever people trying to do something clever. The weakest link in the security chain is always the end user, which is why most &quot;hacks&quot; these days are just massive phishing campaigns: it&#x27;s just an easier attack vector. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re on Windows, MacOS, Linux or TempleOS - if you put your credentials into a browser, someone&#x27;s gonna pwn it.<p>P.S. - If sandboxing is your interest, you should check out Flatpak. I think it should clear up your repo concerns too ;)')
