Not just because it&#x27;s directly profitable to be pro-developer, but because it helps their long term image, culture etc. This goes a long way to explaining a lot of their recent actions like helping Github be available in Iran again and open sourcing large parts of C# &#x2F; .NET.<p>So the question becomes: are Apple being pro-privacy because it&#x27;s a long term stance they want to take and make a basis for their company culture because it&#x27;s something their customers really want. Or are they taking the stance simply because it doesn&#x27;t impact their own profitability right now, but would drop it if there was an obvious potential income stream.')
