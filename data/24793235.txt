I think there was some stupid &quot;list of fallacies&quot; infographic popular on Reddit a few months back that spawned this notion that there&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;slippery slope&quot; and calling anything a &quot;slippery slope&quot; means you&#x27;re wrong and your argument can be tossed out.<p>But... that&#x27;s exactly how rights are eroded.  It is, in the purest sense, a slippery slope of gradual change.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this specific instance (the Twitter&#x2F;Biden thing) but I think the &quot;slippery slope fallacy&quot; fallacy is relevant here.')
