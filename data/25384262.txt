The prices (rent) adjust so that &quot;if you can&#x27;t very cleverly combine it with something else&quot;, which probably most people can&#x27;t, then it makes sense to &quot;stay where you are&quot; and pay the premium compared to travel(-expenses) and a cheaper deal. If <i>a significant amount</i> of people would find feasible ways &quot;to arbitrage (between locations)&quot; the market would adjust (and prices in SV would drop).
