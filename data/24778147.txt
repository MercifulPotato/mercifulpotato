Providing early voting at all is a drastic improvement reducing voter suppression.  Since it lasts for multiple days, it allows for many more people to vote on days off work and other commitments, when they may not be able to easily vote on election day.  Providing <i>better</i> early voting would of course do an even better job of this.')
