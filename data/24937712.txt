The end could be tomorrow, or in a thousand years; its just unknown and not communicated at this time.<p>This is a similar misconception to the word &quot;infinite&quot;, which many people believe means &quot;an unending amount&quot; but actually just means &quot;not finite&quot;; an amount large enough that it can&#x27;t be quantified, but still an amount nonetheless. This comes into play in mathematics when talking about some infinities being larger than others.<p>If you take a nihilistic view of the universe, then everything is temporary, and thus even the DVDs you&#x27;ve purchased should have been advertised as a temporary rental. That&#x27;s not very useful, though.')
