In an ideal world that could be adjusted as well though but realistically that&#x27;s not going to happen. Example from neighbouring country how crippled things can be: solar would be subsidized, leading to the ones with enough money putting complete factory roofs full with solar, to the point the time in which they&#x27;d gain back the initial cost would be a couple of years only. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, great that they have solar energy, but there&#x27;s way, way more concumer roofs out there but with an average income the initial cost for them is just too much.')
