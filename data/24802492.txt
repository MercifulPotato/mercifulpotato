Music is something you to do enjoy, not because it is top sport!<p>Obviously there are going to be incredible performers at the high end but there is plenty of fun to be had in the middle and even on the low end.<p>I have a few pieces that are so beautiful compared to <i>evertyhing</i> else out there that if that were the norm those pieces might as well never be performed again, but then again, it&#x27;s all subjective and what I like you might not.<p>&gt; Similarly the vast majority of students going the chords&#x2F;voicings&#x2F;improvisation route will never be able to play Over The Rainbow as well as Keith Jarrett, but they can at least have the satisfaction and enjoyment of doing it in their own unique way.<p>Yes, true. And that too is a lot of fun. I did some jam sessions with the sax (and I wasn&#x27;t all that good), most fun I had making music to date.<p>&gt; Composing your own music takes it a step further again.<p>That might actually at some level be more essential than just reproduction. The cave men had it easy: everything they did was original.')
