I didn’t leave a comment today about it.<p>I asked him to show me data that confirms that the HN community is not what I think it is. I partially believe this is why he added the link in his comment since he added a similar link in his reply to me over the weekend.<p>And his comment today was basically what I said in the other post. The HN community is going to behave themselves on the millionth hate post about Electron or Amp urls. But they’re going to show their asses on these sort of posts.<p>dang@ basically agreed with me but then said “But still, no the community is fine.” You can’t use silly Electron posts to prove that point.')
