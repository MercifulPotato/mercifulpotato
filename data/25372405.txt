Things like:<p>* fold_first&#x2F;reduce<p>* min_const_generics, arguably the biggest feature added (Edit: I just saw that the FCP hasn&#x27;t started yet... this will be tight, maybe it&#x27;ll only make it into 1.51)<p>* backtrace capturing and formatting as part of the standard library<p>* or_patterns might also make it into 1.50, we&#x27;ll see<p>So I think it will be quite a big release!')
