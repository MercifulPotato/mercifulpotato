COVID has, is, or is threatening to overload our healthcare system as evidenced by:<p>1) Severely reduced in-take of new patients of patients due to lack of beds available (and longer COVID recovery time)<p>2) Reduced ability to effectively care for other patients due to limited beds and transmissibility of the disease, and workforce reductions as healthcare workers get sick (this is not a hypothetical, this is happening in the hospital my wife and brother work at).<p>3) Forcing healthcare works to perform their jobs without subsequent PPE for their own protection, increasing their own health risks and creating serious issues for mental well-being when working in this environment day-in and day-out.<p>The healthcare system is designed to treat patients. Believing the system is not exceeding what it can handle because somehow &quot;the system itself&quot; is not damaged (which I&#x27;m not even sure what you mean by that) but dismissing patient care and outcomes is like evaluating a vehicle&#x27;s crash rating, but not evaluating the damage to the vehicle occupants.')
