Due to network churn the IP address assigned to a residential machine will change over time.  As such you will usually need more information other than just the IP to identify a machine on a network at a point in time.  So what is the deal?  Was the IP assignment fixed?  Did the police acquire the ISP logs for the IP assignment or DHCP?  How do they know that the IP in the web server logs wasn&#x27;t from some middle box or LB in front of the webserver?')
