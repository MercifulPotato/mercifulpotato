It makes you explicitly acknowledge it directly, and codifies it either with properties or useState. In practice it&#x27;s a fantastic model, as it does let you write &quot;mostly functions&quot; as the article suggests, but you can&#x27;t have a UI without state, so it&#x27;s great that they make it easy to handle.')
