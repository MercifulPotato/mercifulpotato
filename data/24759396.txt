You can stand by and observe, only really going in when something is amiss... or show up in riot gear as your first option. The second choice has been the choice with BLM protests - but is rarely the choice with, say, anti-abortion activists. And you know, I don&#x27;t get it: If an African-American man can keep his cool while having to police an KKK march, why can&#x27;t cops in general keep their cool with these?<p>Part of the issue is that folks are protesting the police themselves - namely, the systematic and blatant racism and police violence. The prudent measure, minimally, would be to have a background presence since they&#x27;ve not actually jumped on the chance to make real change. The Rodney King riots happened in 1992: We&#x27;ve had decades to try to change the face of policing. If anything, perhaps we should have started real change after any one of the incidences. Changed police immunity. Required more training. Try to reduce officer stress and weed out folks that were racist. Abolish police gangs. But that&#x27;s much harder, and won&#x27;t stop a protest while it is happening.<p>But it would actually stop them.')
