Stores have limited space for inventory, and they have to make decisions about what the best use of that space is.  It&#x27;s very well possible it the probability of earning a profit on a heater at the end of a cold season is too small to merit stocking it.  The store has no obligation to provide you with what you need at exactly the time you need it, so the concept of &quot;fault&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense to me in this scenario.<p>&quot;Customer is always right&quot; is a nonsense saying in my opinion.  I always have informed my staff to show the customer the door if they&#x27;re unnecessarily wasting their time.')
