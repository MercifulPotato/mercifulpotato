Unfortunately it&#x27;s only available in German probably because it&#x27;s a very niche interest. It&#x27;s called &quot;Das Ma√ü im Kochen&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;The measure in cooking&quot; or &quot;Measurement in cooking&quot; by Renate Breuss.<p>For instance it contains a chapter about time durations that have historically been measured or compared to the time you needed walking a known length. Presumably in a time where not everyone owned a watch.')
