They can do it that way because there’s a limit on how many licenses each fisherman can have, a limit on the number of licenses they give out, and also they throw back lobsters that are too big, too small, or have a history of being successful breeders (they notch the tail to mark those).  So the fishery is sustainable.  But the downside is that the licenses tend to run in families and you have to know someone to get one, so it’s not open to people coming in from out of state.  You can get a special limited license to put 4 traps out as an amateur but the professionals are going to cut the lines on your traps, they hate four trappers invading their fishing territory.  And if you go out raiding someone else’s lobster pots, they’re gonna shoot at you, so don’t do that!')
