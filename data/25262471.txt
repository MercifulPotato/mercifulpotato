(But the installer is fully customizable so this is optional.) It also can (try to) patch non-LineageOS roms, so if you&#x27;re stuck with an unsupported Android build, it can still gut out some of the bloat. I actually used it with my vanilla LineageOS install because the maintainer also packages a patched version of the Play Store that still supports in-app purchases so you can still use your paid apps with MicroG. Overall it&#x27;s been a great experience for me, my battery life is way better than before and I feel much better about what&#x27;s running on my phone.')
