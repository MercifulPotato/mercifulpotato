It wouldn&#x27;t be a disaster if Americans focused their attention on their many domestic issues first, which they have direct control over. But currently there is very little open discourse in the US about prison labor, especially compared to the amount of discourse about Xinjiang.<p>This doesn&#x27;t excuse China for the things they are doing wrong.')
