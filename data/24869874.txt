But conceptually? Yes. If we made a space based telescope that could do IR-visible-UV spectroscopy with decent resolution&#x2F;sensitivity we would be able to get some information about the chemical make up of the gasses on planets transiting their stars.<p>Much like the kerfluffle about phosphine on Venus, there are some compounds you just wouldn&#x27;t expect from strictly geologic processes. Molecular oxygen comes to mind, but also some complicated shortish life time compounds would imply industry maybe. If we had &#x2F;really&#x2F; good sensors we might even be able to spot the isotopic differences, it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve looked into the capacity for spectroscopy, but since the masses are different, the vibrational modes should be different, resulting in different spectra. We could conceivably spot if weird isotope distributions were in their environment, if it differed wildly enough from their suns make up you might be able to make the case that weird non-geologic nuclear reactions were taking place.<p>The reason the astronomy community is excited about the James Web Space Telescope is that it can do a few of these investigations.')
