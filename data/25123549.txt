The blob stores a diff. The commit stores a reference to... the diff. This is a division between the concept of the object and the implementation. But it&#x27;s not an example of a diff-storing model failing to model git as it is; git as it is is storing diffs.<p>If a commit references a &quot;blob&quot;, and the &quot;blob&quot; that it references is, in fact, a diff, why would we say that the commit &quot;does not reference a diff&quot;?')
