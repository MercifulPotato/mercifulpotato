Because it is an act of invention. Yes the camera&#x2F;widgets, lights&#x2F;libraries are all reused. But the way they are reused is unique for each movie&#x2F;application. And a large number of external constraints&#x2F;forces impact how the movie&#x2F;application is made. Yes you can quickly make an amateur movie&#x2F;app in a few hours. People do it all the time. But thatâ€™s not the same as making AAA movies&#x2F;software.')
