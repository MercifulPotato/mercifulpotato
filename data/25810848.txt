Or from\na torrent or similar.<p>Furthermore (assuming Apples sues and wins a case) I don&#x27;t think they will bother trying preventing a (for them) small amount of private people from using it. Through if it becomes more successful it&#x27;s likely another matter.<p>What they care about is that you can&#x27;t buy a tablet of which the UI looks, feels and behaves like iOs.<p>I just fear this might be <i>ab</i>used by Apple or other entities as an argument why devices should be looked down and users must not be allowed to install their own Os as this would lead to all kind of fraud and lost revenue. (Just to be clear I&#x27;m fully aware that for a tech aware person this argument makes no sense, but propose it to an old politician who doesn&#x27;t really understand anything IT related and they might believe you, and at least in Germany we have way to many tech incompetent politicians...)<p>EDIT: Also in the parent post I probably should have used the term distribute inside of the EU&#x2F;US&#x2F;... Anyway I&#x27;m not a lawyer so the exact terminology might not be quite right.')
