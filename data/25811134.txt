The article author dismisses it as basically too inconvenient (they apparently keep their Security Key somewhere out of reach and they struggle to remember the complicated user interaction of... pressing a button)<p>But WebAuthn is completely effective against phishing.<p>The closest to plausible attacks are: The bad guys take over the target servers (no reason to phish you); The bad guys persuade you to physically send them your authentication device (truly not everybody can be helped...); The bad guys persuade you to install software under their control on a general purpose PC (this won&#x27;t work on a Phone) and then you follow their bad instructions to &quot;use&quot; your authenticator with their software to get them in.<p>Mutually authenticated TLS is in principle viable, and I have used it in machine-to-machine systems, but the UX is atrocious and it has grave privacy problems.')
