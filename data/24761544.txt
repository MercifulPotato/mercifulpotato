Tubers will keep propagating by themselves - you cant call out someone for infringing a patent on a potato if you miss one when harvesting and it makes more of itself. Although there&#x27;s always grey area - plant reproduction is complicated! Tubers and seeds are however covered under plant variety protection, but that&#x27;s a different legal code than patents.')
