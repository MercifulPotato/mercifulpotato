I just couldn&#x27;t work anymore and leaving was the priority.<p>After months of doing nothing much, I decided to implement a game (which I came up with in school, and had also created a basic version in college). I had an electronics background, so I did know programming basics and had to write Perl scripts at work. However, I didn&#x27;t know much of Java (had a course in school) and Android. Somehow, over the course of a year, I made the app.<p>The main game idea I had in school was simple inspiration from tic-tac-toe. Make squares instead of lines on a 4x4 board. While writing the code, I was ever trying to make it impressive. So, I came up lots of choices - larger board sizes (up to 12x12) for both tic-tac-toe and the square ones, with blocking moves.<p>To monetize, I added ads. After release, I got about 0.12 dollars or something over few months. I just removed the ads instead of trying to salvage it. I had bought a domain&#x2F;hosting, so financially, it was a loss.<p>In hindsight, biggest issue was UI&#x2F;UX and not knowing how to promote. I&#x27;m still proud of the code I implemented for computer moves.<p>App is no longer on play store (because it stopped working on newer versions), but you can still see screenshots here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;learnbyexample&#x2F;squaretictactoe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;learnbyexample&#x2F;squaretictactoe</a><p>I wanted to re-implement in Python later, started it but never finished. May be next year ;)')
