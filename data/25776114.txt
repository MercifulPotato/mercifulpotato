The people involved in the officers death should be held accountable but to hysterically say that everyone was there to murder is bizarre.  And even then he died from his injuries, similar to a bar fight gone bad etc. If the group formed to murder it would have been like Pablo Escobar.  But they weren’t and instead you want to push an agenda and get everyone worked up.  Watching the “insurrection” or whatever it was live on CNN was a snooze fest and nothing was happening.  They didn’t even burn down a Starbucks.  People were mostly just standing around.')
