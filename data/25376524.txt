We like to think of light as photons, traveling in rays in straight lines.  That&#x27;s geometric optics and works great for most purposes in photography.<p>Physical optics takes into account the wave nature of light.  This becomes important when the size of the lens becomes small  (eg pinholes) ... there&#x27;s diffraction around edges and pixels receive contributions from many points in space.<p>Geometric optics lets you model using ray-tracing, reflections, and Snell&#x27;s law refraction.<p>Physical optics uses tools such as Fourier transforms, convolutions, and sinc functions.<p>Understanding a simple lens system?  Geometric optics is your friend.   Building an astronomical telescope?  Check into physical optics.')
