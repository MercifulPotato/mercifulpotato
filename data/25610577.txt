As a Masters&#x27; student currently studying robotics, I felt pretty overwhelmed with all the sub-fields when coming from a computer science degree in undergrad. I only got a clear understanding of what I was interested in after a year of courses. I think joining a lab and learning as you go is sound advice, but if you really want to do some novel research, you would need a semester or two of courses just to be able to contribute (by which time you would have almost finished your masters). It also seems like a lot of research directions gravitate towards deep RL when classical approaches could work just as well, if not better.<p>Also, unfortunately due to COVID, most of the work I&#x27;ve done with robotics has only been in simulation and I&#x27;ve found myself frustrated by the limitations of the simulator or the work required to simulate a real world scenario. Working with real world data might be slower, but it&#x27;s a lot more satisfying when it works.')
