People can not be faulted to feel that every minute spent studying the liberal arts curriculum is a minute that might be better invested in studying something that slays the elephant.<p>It’s a life or death feeling when the money involved is more than your parents have earned cumulatively.<p>Slaying the elephant becomes the end goal, everything else is secondary. A high GPA is a spear, and ethical integrity is a cheap way of obtaining it. This doesn’t explain why everyone cheats, but I think it attracts the otherwise “good” people, who are essential for normalizing the practice.<p>IMO, we need to do away with the elephant, and the rest will follow. Schools need not be so expensive. I hope some startup school will do the job. Otherwise, companies might be the first to do it.<p>It’s probably cheaper for Google to operate a University than it is to operate their recruiting pipeline :)')
