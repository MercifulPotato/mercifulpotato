It&#x27;s a contextual number, determined by population and behavior, population immunity and other factors.<p>Rt is simply notation of an <i>estimate</i> of R0 at a particular time.<p>Either way, you&#x27;re correct that &quot;herd immunity&quot;, as used here, means the point at which time the infection rate begins to decline, and this is conditional on population behaviors. If people mix more freely, the estimate changes.<p><i>However</i>, the observation that people don&#x27;t mix uniformly still applies, even if they mix a bit more than they do now. To put it in a CS context, it&#x27;s like debating the magnitude of the constant, when the algorithm has a fundamentally different asymptotic behavior.')
