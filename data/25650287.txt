How is that even a question?  The answer is obvious: do good directly, with your own mind and hands, not indirectly.  Thatâ€™s the obvious alternative.  Maybe not everyone has the opportunity to do that, just like not everyone has the opportunity to get a non-alienating job.<p>&gt; Give enough to charities that make you not feel alienated, and then donate the rest to charities that are making a greater positive impact on the lives of others.<p>You see?  Both of these things are still indirect do-gooding.  Donating to charity?  How about <i>being</i> good, doing good?  Or are you only able to assess the moral weight of something if you can read about them in some spreadsheet?')
