Item(by='atomicnumber3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603079577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819225, text='I work in this space and the questions outlined in you and your parent&#x27;s comment are absolutely spot-on.<p>The worst part is, these things tend to grow organically where the original ancestor of everything is engineer #3 of the 5-person startup who decided to write a cronjob to dump the prod db every night to feather files on a samba share. Then one cron job becomes three. Then ten. Then you&#x27;re using S3. Then there&#x27;s dependencies. Then you&#x27;re using Luigi&#x2F;Airflow. Then you&#x27;re using Spark. Then you&#x27;re constantly messing with partitioning and performance. Then you&#x27;re using Hadoop and YARN and configuring queues and capacity scaling. At this point the &quot;infra&quot; team is 10 people and there&#x27;s 20 data scientists. Then you triple in size a couple dozen times and now it&#x27;s time to figure out how to retroactively slap security controls on top of everything.<p>That turned into a bit of a rant. Honestly I love this space but I agree, as hard as the software bits are, the hard part is the entire picture as a whole.')
