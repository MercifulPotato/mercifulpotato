They also, never invested in additional education nor skills. Their disposable income went to vacations, new cars, daily coffee at Starbucks, and a bunch of other frivolities. Always carrying a near zero bank account from end of pay period to end of pay period. But hey, at least they met their responsibilities. They were functioning paycheck-to-paycheck people.<p>Now many broke and really struggling even if they are still employed. Why? Because of reduced hours or salaries to adjust for the pandemic. Usually these kinds of people are susceptible to the slightest change in their salary. That&#x27;s part and parcel of not saving and living strictly paycheck to paycheck.<p>Do they deserve it? No of course not. Nobody deserves bad fortune like this. These people weren&#x27;t trying to harm others and they were decent hard working people.<p>However, ... it&#x27;s not hard to see why they end up like this.<p>These people were never taught to save away money when times were good, to live within their means, to invest, to do the math before buying a car and making modest decisions, heck, even to have the common sense to know that a daily coffee at Starbucks is a terrible financial decision.<p>And many of of these people, even people who are still gainfully employed usually retort with: <i>well I&#x27;m never gonna be able to own a home, so I buy what I want with my money now to make myself happy.</i>, but the thing is, many people who own homes now, also didn&#x27;t just have all the money available and had to save up for the down payment and probably live a few years house poor.<p>This expectation that we should all be able to own at least: one smartphone, one computer, one expensive game console, etc. etc. that wasn&#x27;t a thing back then.  Today there are so many things vying for our dollars, that it&#x27;s hard to just make the choice to save up for a home.<p>But nevertheless, it still needs to be done and especially now during times of a pandemic, the money we put away isn&#x27;t for a home, but rather, to get through this crisis.<p>It is not victim shaming &#x2F; blaming to point out that stupid frivolous behavior &#x2F; practices are a root cause of people&#x27;s problems.<p>However, it&#x27;s imperative to understand that bad circumstances, such as COVID-19 can derail the plans of even the most thoughtful, budget conscious and financially savvy people.<p>The thing is, to never take for granted that good times last indefinitely and not squander money earned.')
