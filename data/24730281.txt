Item(by='offtop5', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602254141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24728140, text='&gt;, I would regulate the information dating apps collect to the same standards as patients&#x27; national healthcare information is handled(in the EU; I don&#x27;t know about the US&#x2F;UK but I heard it&#x27;s not all rozy there).<p>In the case of Grindr they released user HIV status information which is literally medical data.<p>&gt;Personally, I have no dog in this fight since I gave up on online dating and got good at IRL dating(pre-COVID) but I am aware of plenty of men willing to throw their cash and intimate data at these corporations for the hope of meeting someone.<p>Good for you, it&#x27;s a giant scam( See FTC Sues Match). I also gave up on these apps and started meeting amazing people in real life. It&#x27;s also much less stressful to disconnect from the social media matrix.<p>I put vastly less effort into meeting people now and I found myself actually getting approached last year. I&#x27;ve found greater peace. Social Media is a very bad thing for most people. You waste tons of time you could be spending on other things. Doesn&#x27;t help people tend to be much meaner online. Again , why deal with that.<p>With Corona I&#x27;ve been trying to focus more on learning music , but I&#x27;m fairly optimistic next year things will be somewhat normal.')
