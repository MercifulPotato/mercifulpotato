Cloud services are handy, cheap intermediaries for lots of device&#x2F;user interaction. LAN connectivity is a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface, with devices constantly going offline depending on power consumption and what chipsets are in the device (which is a function of what price point the makers were targeting).<p>And yes, there are technical solutions to this (just add an IoT hub, just add this chipset, etc), but don&#x27;t forget how cost-driven IoT still is. People want the features of smart devices, but won&#x27;t pay 5x the cost for it...unless you&#x27;re Apple making headphones.<p>IoT is still very much a hack-driven industry. I do 100% agree that the software side is substandard, but until some of these chips get cheaper it&#x27;s surviving on small margins.')
