Chalabi then connected the defectors with journalists like Miller so they could tell their wild tales, based on what they claimed was first-hand knowledge, about Iraq&#x27;s mounting WMD threat. Of all the mainstream journalists on the defector beat however, Miller was the most impressed and least skeptical of Chalabi&#x27;s sources; sources who were spreading pro-war talking points on behalf of the pro-war American administration.<p>There are no links to any NYT articles based on Chalabi&#x27;s sources, but I assume they still presented the information they got from him as something a source had told them, not something that the reporters themselves hat witnessed in person.')
