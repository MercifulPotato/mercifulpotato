Item(by='greeneggs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604582006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996775, text='&gt; surely we can, in principle, genetically modify ourselves to fix the problem gene drives would cause?<p>It might not be practically possible.  Genetic modification has side effects, where typos are introduced in other areas than the target.<p>This means that the first generation of a hypothetical new gene drive is less likely to survive long.  But once the gene drive got established subsequent generations would become more and more normal (as typos were lost by interbreeding and natural selection).<p>Now imagine that we discover a rogue gene drive introduced in humans after, say, it has affected 1000 individuals.  There isn&#x27;t any way of ethically fixing it in their children.  You can&#x27;t go to a person and tell them that they are not allowed to have children.  Nor can you tell them that they need to undergo an experiment that makes their children 100x more likely to die young, for example.')
