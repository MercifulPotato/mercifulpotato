Item(by='vletal', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1611059203, title='Tell HN: Turn on DND before joining interview call', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve interviewed way too many candidates in the past year. Due to the pandemics these interviews were strictly online. There is one thing which candidates can not fail in person yet can do online - switching windows. It&#x27;s an online equivalent of looking on your phone...<p>Just do not do that. Do not even touch the laptop. It&#x27;s rude if it is during the first screening call. During a technical round it&#x27;s just a huge red flag.<p>Some candidates make it even worse by trying to look confident by asking seemingly &quot;clarifying&quot; questions about trivial stuff they could have heard if they just had listened.<p>These are not super rare singularities! Even some strong looking candidates get distracted occasionally. So please take the extra measure, disable notifications before the call, and try to keep focus.')
