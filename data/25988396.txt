Shorting affects the owners of the stock. But publicly traded companies don&#x27;t normally own a large amount of their own stock.  Their stock price doesn&#x27;t have that direct an effect on their balance sheets.  It affects their credit worthiness, but not in a mechanistic way.  (Believe me, Gamestop isn&#x27;t finding it easier to borrow just because its price has gone bonkers.)')
