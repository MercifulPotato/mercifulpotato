You cannot compare popular musicians today from those in the 70s and 80s.<p>Actually there are very talented artists around today but it&#x27;s impossible to find them... Takes a lot of searching on YouTube. I found some music on YouTube recently that blew me away but it didn&#x27;t even hit 100k views...
