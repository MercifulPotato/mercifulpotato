Why would anyone do THAT? Heck, you should be putting everything in serverless and avoiding even the vague possibility that you would have to touch anything so degrading and low-class as an <i>operating system</i>. Systems administration? Who does that?&quot;<p>In all seriousness, however, the decision (likely) has very little to do with that. They&#x27;re most likely not hosting in the cloud because the current CA&#x2F;Browser Forum rules around the operation of public CAs effectively don&#x27;t permit cloud hosting. That&#x27;s a work in progress, but for the time being, the actual CA infrastructure can&#x27;t be hosted in the cloud due to security and auditability requirements.')
