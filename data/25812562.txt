I don&#x27;t like dongles myself! I still use a (pre-USB C) 2015 MacBook Pro, partially for that reason. I greatly prefer common ports such as HDMI to be built right into the laptop.<p>But &quot;15 minutes of fighting with dongles?&quot; Even if there&#x27;s some comic exaggeration here, I don&#x27;t understand.<p>Of all my gripes with Mac laptop dongles, &quot;fighting&quot; with them is not on the list. They are as plug and play as it gets. No drivers, etc... I hate carrying them but they&#x27;re not exactly difficult to use.<p>The only way I can imagine people &quot;fighting&quot; with dongles is if they were nontechnical users who had difficulties simply plugging a cable in.')
