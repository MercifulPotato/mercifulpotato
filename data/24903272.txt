Lake Michigan beaches are the best of the great lakes.<p>However, transportation between the two cities is terrible. Worst travel experience I&#x27;ve ever had. And I&#x27;ve been to India.<p>I landed in Chicago, and wanted to take the train to Detroit. Had to get to the Train station from the airpot, on time. So was in a hurry.<p>1. Got off the airport, waited in line to buy Metro ticket, on some antiquated machines for buying tickets. Italian couple \nin front of me got confused, and gave up. I ended up completing their transaction for a week long metro pass by mistake.<p>2. Get off the metro. Ask for directions to the train stations, get pointed in the wrong direction. Waste 15 minutes.<p>3. Walk back, my flip flops break, need to change shoes. Unpack my luggage in middle street. Walk towards station see a pigeon get hit by a taxi. Walk further, and a sky scrapper is blocked off with police cars, helicopter flying around. Think its some sort of suicide going to on. Keep walking. Later found out they were filming spider man.<p>4. Make it to train station, wait in line to buy tickets. Tickets are sold out. Girl in front of me in the line starts crying, has a break down. No tickets left.<p>5. Decide to walk to greyhound station. Police car outside. Think thats a little unusual. Quickly figure out that this must be a popular way for poor black people to travel between the two cities. \n Go in, lines everywhere. Its crowded chaos in there. Go to washroom, smells like urine. Wait in information line. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. The guy in the line besides me asks a question from the info guy. Gets in some sort of 30 second argument. The attendant, calls in the cops. And the cops arrest the guy! WTF. My turn to ask a question.\nI ask if I can buy a ticket to Detroit. The response &quot;who told you that. You&#x27;ve been bamboozled&quot;. I don&#x27;t don&#x27;t even know what to make of that. Decide to leave.<p>6. Walk back to the train station. Get told about Magabus. Wait 5 hours. Bus shows up after midnight. Driver is pissed about people having too much luggage. Starts charing people extra for it. Bus is crowded. I end up sitting above the wheel well the whole night. Back hurts the next day.<p>Never again!')
