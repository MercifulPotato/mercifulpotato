You need to find a chip line that has manufacturer guarantees for a long span, then a SOM integrator that will also guarantee a time span using that part.<p>I’ve been happy with NXP (Freescale) for the former, obviously being a large automotive supplier has a benefit.<p>For the SOM I’ve recently been using Toradex. They do a great job of making their SOMs comply to a common signal layout at the connector. I also recommend Boundary Devices. TechNexion is also interesting if you need a smaller footprint. They’re the group that also ships as WandBoard.')
