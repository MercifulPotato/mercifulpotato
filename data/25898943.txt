I can’t see any other way of interpreting this “new normal” idea that’s been so heavily promoted. Based solely on observations of the past, I would expect governments around the world to hold onto their newly established power, and continue to use it far into the future in whichever ways end up suiting them. After 9&#x2F;11 the government decided that it needed to temporarily infringe upon everybody’s liberties while they sorted the problem out. 20 years later, that is literally just the “new normal” that we’ve been living with since then (some portions of the patriot act actually failed to be renewed last year, but that’s happened in the past and their expiry didn’t last long, so I’d be very surprised if this time was permanent). I would expect any decision to ease restrictions to be an entirely political one, and I would expect them to be reimplemented again in the future whatever ways end up suiting our current and future governments.')
