Your site essentially didn&#x27;t exist unless AOL knew about it. There were only a few big webhosts a long time, and it was nontrivial to run your own server -- especially because a lot of ISPs banned it unless you paid a lot more every month.<p>So for a long time, you options were: host on one of the big services (Geocities, for example) or run your own server.<p>Now there are potentially millions of hosts. The centralization problem is exclusive to search, but you can still change search engines if it bothers you.')
