Or a doctor who isn&#x27;t experienced at medicine to treat you.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is, I think you&#x27;ve latched on to the wrong quality as a focus of your ire. People being career politicians is not the problem, it&#x27;s people being corrupt power-seeking assholes. That&#x27;s a difficult problem to solve, I know, which is why it is so tempting to blame the problem on something easier to solve, but I think that sentiment is one pushed largely by career pundits to manipulate people.')
