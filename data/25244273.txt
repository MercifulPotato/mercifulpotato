No arguments that rendering is _hard_, but the rest isn&#x27;t simple at all. It depends on where you draw the line between rendering and &lt;other system&gt; but animation for example, can be just as difficult and really has nothing to do with the rendering part of a game engine.<p>Physics simulations (fluids, soft bodies&#x2F;deformables, breakables) are also unsolved in a real time environment.<p>Networking is tough; games have strict latency requirements, and perform all sorts of tricks to minimize bandwidth usage.<p>Input (as you mentioned) is tough too, albeit solved for the most part by now.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that this is all work needed for a game _engine_ you still need a game on top of it.')
