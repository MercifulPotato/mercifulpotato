Much like California.</i><p>California has free, open, and fair elections every cycle.  Since they&#x27;ve gone to non-gerrymandered voting districts it has been obvious that the current era Republican party is woefully out of touch with most Californians.  But there&#x27;s nothing putting a finger on the scale for the Democrats.  Republicans are free to field competetive candidates any time.<p>So please stop insinuating that CA is some kind of dictatorship or totalitarian enforcing 1-party rule.  That&#x27;s blatantly wrong, and you know it.')
