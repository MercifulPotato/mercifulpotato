I don&#x27;t understand why would you take it as picture of how things should be done. It has not been like that before and it&#x27;s getting back to &quot;normal&quot; now.<p>Most musicians play because they need to. Because it&#x27;s the only thing that makes sense. Nobody sponsors their years of very hard work which they do voluntarily and with joy before they become great at what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Original bands are doing just fine. They have big following because they offer something new. They have patreon, sell tshirts vinyls and whatnot.<p>Many average musicians can afford equipment which top bands couldn&#x27;t dream of 20 years ago.<p>If somebody wants to just create another pop song then yes they will have a hard time.<p>And existing artists who sold their soul to big labels may suffer because those companies never thought they would need to move a finger. Not ideal but there&#x27;s some worse suffering happening in the world than that.<p>Big record labels and expensive CDs were basically a dotcom bubble. Music is entertainment and people have a lot to choose from now.<p>Those who need to play music will be fine and enjoy life with their instrument(s) as they always do. Those who went in with &quot;I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s some good money there&quot; are getting disappointed.')
