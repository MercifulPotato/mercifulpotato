As I told Tim privately and publicly (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mjasay&#x2F;status&#x2F;1317084448119169024" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mjasay&#x2F;status&#x2F;1317084448119169024</a>), I hadn&#x27;t been aware of this but am talking with the relevant product team to see how we can improve in his regard.<p>AWS uses a lot of open source, and we contribute a lot, both in terms of code (first-party projects like Firecracker and Bottlerocket, but also third-party projects like Redis, GraphQL, Open Telemetry, etc.), testing, credits, foundation support, and more. But open source is ultimately about people and communities, and I personally feel we could have done more to acknowledge the great work Tim and his co-maintainers have done, and try to support their Headless Recorder work. We&#x27;re talking with Tim now about this.<p>(While I think we do far better than sometimes acknowledged, we&#x27;re also always looking to improve, and appreciate all the feedback that helps us toward that goal.)')
