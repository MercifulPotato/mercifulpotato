You can only get away with that as long as you&#x27;ve got a lock on expertise and development.  As soon as a significant portion of development and expertise is coming from outside, what makes the original business entity any more appealing than those others (as in this case)?<p>One way to stave that off for a while might be to make sure you&#x27;re releasing new features you&#x27;ve developed at a good clip, and as you&#x27;ve developed them you&#x27;re naturally going to have more expertise.  That likely only works for so long though, most projects hit some level of maturity eventually at which point new features are somewhat superfluous, and might even be detrimental.<p>I think the bottom line is that if a business is based on an open source product then that business should be looking at it as something with a life, and a coming natural death (of being able to be the only&#x2F;main support company for it at least), and plan accordingly.  It might not happen, but you can&#x27;t count on it being exclusive forever, especially if it&#x27;s actually lucrative.')
