There was a second trial over Google&#x27;s fair use argument and the jury ruled for Google. Oracle appealed and the Federal Circuit ruled against Google again. That decision was appealed to SCOTUS on January 24, 2019. Google&#x27;s petition challenged both decisions by the Federal Circuit: APIs are copyrightable and Google&#x27;s use of the Java API wasn&#x27;t fair use. Certiorari was granted November 15, 2019 and arguments were planned for October 7, 2020.')
