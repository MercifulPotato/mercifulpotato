But as that government starts to have a larger impact on your day to day life than it makes less sense.<p>If we started sending nato several trillion dollars a year it makes less sense for Bulgaria to have the same say in how that money is spent as we do.<p>And there isn&#x27;t really any political appetite to roll back the federal government to a size where that type of representation made sense. Moving social security and Medicare from the federal to the state or city level would be a political non starter.')
