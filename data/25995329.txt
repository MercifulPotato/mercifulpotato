Once lockdown hit all my built-up coping mechanisms broke down and triggered a depression spiral.<p>I think what finally got me to do the thing was realizing how often I was now not able to parse my partner speaking directly to me even when I was 100% listening, no distracting noises, interested in what they had to say, etc. At the worst it was more than once a day for at least a minute or two. I could see their mouth moving and recognize that they were making words but was unable to understand a word of it no matter how hard I tried.<p>Vyvanse has been helpful. It&#x27;s made it possible to put the work in and build routines to get stuff done. It&#x27;s not a magic bullet but it brings me much closer to the starting line. I started struggling more with insomnia since starting it but that&#x27;s a trade I&#x27;m willing to make to be able to function at all.')
