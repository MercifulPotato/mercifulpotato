The reason  for all of this being both unpopular and requiring big purchases is because it&#x27;s pretty much a 1 off deal between the grid operator and the purchaser.  It requires that they both both come into the room to make a deal.<p>Instead, we need something closer to the NEM in Australia.  There needs to be a standard bidding mechanism for buying&#x2F;selling energy on the market.<p>Our electric meters need to be hooked up to a grid pricing network and our appliances need to be able to talk to that network through our meters.<p>Once there is a standard communication protocol and pricing network, then you&#x27;ll start to see neat things happen with smarter power consuming products.<p>For that to work, however, it needs to be setup nationally.  It won&#x27;t work if every single grid invents their own market or bidding standard.  Ideally, this would be an international standard.')
