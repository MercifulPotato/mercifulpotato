Also I imagine to head off consumers who would otherwise be like &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll wait for a 3080 Ti&quot;.<p>I also expect been a kind of struggle between their consumer side who need some other reason to sell their top end GPUs beyond just the whales when game developers aren&#x27;t really that interested in pushing out features that will require it given the niche ownership, while the datacenter people want to protect their Quadro margins. This to me seems their most likely reason for the on-again&#x2F;off-again relationship with pushing their high end cards for compute usage vs gaming usage.')
