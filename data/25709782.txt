They have problems anytime a bug in native code pops up, like video codecs. Windows 7 video decoding has been partially broken for 3 years now with no fixes in sight, Big Sur video decoding is also broken. Chromium was a safe bet, and js lets them iterate fast, but the quality of code in their Web UI leaves a lot to be desired. Still, they are the only game in town when it comes to browsers you can just inject your code to change UI on the fly, modding it to your heart content. As a bonus they have no problem ripping out all of Google tracking&#x2F;spying code.<p>My biggest problem with Vivaldi is the interface between developers and users. They have no QA to speak of (repeatedly reintroducing same bugs, claiming to fix something while its not fixed, introducing trivial bugs with new features, failing to reproduce most bugs), most likely no automated unit testing, and no public accessible bug tracking system.<p>The way you report bugs is, I shit you not:<p>- fill out a form<p>- receive random number<p>- receive single automated confirmation<p>- post in obscure thread on their forum to ask for some Vivaldi employee to MANUALLY check what is happening with said bug from time to time.<p>As you can imagine not very conductive to a healthy development process, not to mention costing them a ton of time wasted on duplicates and replication time.<p>Imo this, together with recent move to remove Vivaldi from UA string are business decisions aimed at obscuring how they are doing. Internal company structures, not showing how (not)many employees they have, speed of development, company trajectory, user traction, deployment numbers, etc.')
