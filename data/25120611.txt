So good your mind has taken that path.<p>But the type of problem you pick is very important.<p>Picking problems with &quot;too many dimensions&quot; is a bad idea for many reasons.<p>1. Chance of failure is high and if you fail you don&#x27;t just feel jobless but also useless. So it can be a double whammy at the end of 2-3 months of hard work.<p>2. Any solution to such open ended complex problems will have holes. And you know people will fixate on them and easily dismiss the solution instead of appreciating you for whatever hard work you have done.<p>The better approach is to pick something with a clear and achievable goal that <i>someone else</i> has already defined.<p>Like on their bug tracker or feature tracker. That way at the end of a few months of hard work someone somewhere is satisfied with that hard work and can vouch for your abilities helping your job hunt.')
