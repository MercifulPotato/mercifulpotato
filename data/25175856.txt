I&#x27;ve been a user since, oh, 2005 I believe.<p>I&#x27;ve always found the interface easy to use, and I&#x27;m really surprised to see so many people complaining about it here.<p>GIMP has always been my go-to tool for simple tasks like cropping, resizing and compressing images.<p>More recently, I started using it for photo post processing (see also RawTherapee), and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!<p>25 years is a long time in software terms. Kudos for keeping the project alive and useful this long. Please, keep up the good work :)<p>You know what? I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any other app I&#x27;ve been using for 15 years.')
