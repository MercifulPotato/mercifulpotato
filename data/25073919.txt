I ended up writing my own for the project of a customer. It&#x27;s been running for a few years now.<p>Same customer, another project, I&#x27;m experimenting with a deployment system based on git format-patch. It copies the patches on the server (we have only one server) and applies them with patch. Then restart the web app.<p>It&#x27;s fun to learn the internals by rewriting the tooling but a good tooling to start with would be better.')
