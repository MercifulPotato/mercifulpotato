If you put down 5%, and prefab saves you 5%, you have massively reduced your risk of default during a downturn.<p>And if you expect it to take 20 years to pay off your mortgage, and framing saves 5%, that’s one year saved, which is massive IMHO.<p>Obviously a lot of assumptions to the above e.g. everyone else doesn’t get the 5% savings, and everyone doesn’t just bid up new house prices by 5% (because they are bounded by their mortgage which is related to their earnings, not costs).')
