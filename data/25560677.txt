A vector field is just a mathematical model to describe a natural phenomenon, as does curved spacetime for gravity. Those models have limitations under certain Conditions. For magnetism there are afaik quantum mechanical models available for all energy states while for gravity those seem to only work at lower energies. At the end, your question is about the nature of truth - what is behind all this. I don&#x27;t think anyone can answer that so far in a scientific way, that is, in a falsifiable and not yet disproven manner.')
