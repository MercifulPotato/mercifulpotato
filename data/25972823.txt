I think it&#x27;s just institutional momentum. We could do settlement within minutes for 99% of trades. The only reason we haven&#x27;t is because 100+ years ago people though 2 days (T+2) was quick and we haven&#x27;t updated it.<p>The EU is gradually forcing its members to do T+1 and eventually (I think decades in the future) wants same day for most products. That reduces risk and it makes the market fairer (RobinHood have had cash flow problems they wouldn&#x27;t have had with T+0 settlement and the big boys don&#x27;t have to worry about that).<p>I guess we have to wait. Some of these places are still using COBOL, a language first introduced in 1959!? That&#x27;s how complex, legacy, under invested etc many back office setups are.')
