There are simply too many variables to make estimates more accurate than “best guess”:<p>1&#x2F; the team’s composition at a point in time (and all the variability that comes with this)<p>2&#x2F; the team’s dependencies (a kind of exponential effect is at work here: the team’s dependencies also have all these issues in variability and so do <i>their</i> dependencies)<p>3&#x2F; the type of work being estimated in the context of the product (even “basic” things like “CRUD” can be quite intricate in some cases)<p>Basically unless the estimation is literally for a known change (e.g. modify source code files X, Y and Z with code changes A, B, and C) its predictive power diminishes substantially.<p>It’s not a powerful tool, it’s a micromanagement technique disguised as a tool to empower ICs.')
