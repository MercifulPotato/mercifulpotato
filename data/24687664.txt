Item(by='evrydayhustling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601905207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684387, text='I think the current proposal agrees - &quot;Minimum bar plus lottery&quot; caps the returns on spending money, but also other forms of merit.<p>I also agree that it&#x27;s impossible and probably undesirable to keep folks from investing in every kind of preparation they can.<p>However, I think the test is a uniquely concentrated opportunity to invest in swaying the admissions system rather than in preparing more holistically.  What I&#x27;d love to see explored are:<p>- A more holistic admissions packet that includes evaluation beyond GPA.\n- Public resources on advanced education earlier in the curriculum.\n- Some examination of Chicago-style admissions, which ranks students within local geographies to pick highest achievers from many backgrounds (yes, I&#x27;m aware of many arguments from both sides against this structure).')
