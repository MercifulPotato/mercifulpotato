Unless you are working with high-performance programs, most of the time you don&#x27;t care about one or two extra branches. It&#x27;s usually more beneficial to write code that can be easily understood by a future-you or by another person in your team: less time invested in understanding code, more time dedicated to actually fixing issues that matter. If performance becomes an issue, you&#x27;ll catch that in profiling easily (because everybody here is profiling before trying to improve the performance of a piece of code, right?).')
