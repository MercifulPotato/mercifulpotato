The Linux kernel team has never been particularly supportive of middleware layers designed to promote common drivers between Linux and other operating systems, and for good reasonâ€”it impedes the development of optimized, native Linux drivers.<p>The only way I see nVidia succeeding here is if they clearly demonstrate that EGLStreams is a technically superior alternative to GBM, not just for their own hardware but in general, and also contribute the changes needed to support EGLStreams for all the other graphics drivers currently using GBM so that applications don&#x27;t need to deal with both systems. As long as the EGLStreams code path can only be exercised in combination with the proprietary nVidia drivers it will remain a second-class citizen and projects would be well-advised to avoid it. (Drew DeVault goes into more detail[1] in his objection to the inclusion of EGLStreams support in KWin, which I agree with 100%.)<p>Or they could just acknowledge that this is a Linux driver, not a Windows driver, and implement the standard Linux GBM interfaces like everyone else even if that means less shared code.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.sr.ht&#x2F;~sircmpwn&#x2F;public-inbox&#x2F;%3C20190220154143.GA31283%40homura.localdomain%3E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.sr.ht&#x2F;~sircmpwn&#x2F;public-inbox&#x2F;%3C20190220154143...</a>')
