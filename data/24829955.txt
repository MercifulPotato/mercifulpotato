There was actually nothing keeping that water from flowing except for the delta smelt.  The Central Valley went from green to brown in a single year.  Nobody else was affected.<p>Irrespective of the politics of &quot;who should get this water&quot;, the reality is that the people who were for protecting the Delta Smelt created an environmental disaster.<p>It&#x27;s the same logic that they used to prevent thinning forests via logging and clearing underbrush--and lo and behold we have too many trees and when the fires burn, they&#x27;re too hot!<p>It&#x27;s the same logic that the U.N. used to ban mahogany exports, which led to those countries burning thousands of years of trees to make room for farmland, as it was their only economic recourse.<p>At some point, the environmentalists might want to ask themselves if &quot;they&#x27;re the baddies&quot;, given that other, supposedly less enlightened cultures have similar ecological situations and different outcomes.')
