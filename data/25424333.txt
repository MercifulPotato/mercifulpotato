We have laws against false advertising, and that is not considered infringement on free speech.<p>During the Victorian era arsenic was known to be poisonous yet &quot;Arsenic Complexion Wafers&quot; were advertised in newspapers claiming that it would remove freckles and pimples. Yet no one in their right mind would argue preventing arsenic from being peddled is an infringement on free speech.<p>Furthermore, proving deceptive intent is not necessary under false advertising law.
