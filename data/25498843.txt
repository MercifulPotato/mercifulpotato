It&#x27;s hard to say whether the blowback and sanctions from an assassination would be worse from an &#x27;unfortunate accident&#x27; or someone dying suddenly and inexplicably in a manner very similar to a nerve agent that Russia exclusively uses.<p>It seems like for them to get away with the Novichok poisoning they should&#x27;ve chosen to assassinate Navalny locally so they&#x27;re be little chance of getting the victim to a neutral location for treatment or autopsy.<p>That&#x27;s just my speculation, ultimately this whole situation could be explained by malice and incompetence.')
