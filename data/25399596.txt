Another problem with large and slow moving code bases is that things around changes, like hardware getting better&#x2F;faster so software architecture that made sense 30 years ago might not be the best solution today.\nAn OS should probably not be developed by a single team or company, there should be an open core&#x2F;kernel, then companies could instead compete and specialize in different combinations and support of systems, apps and services developed independently, where each part could be replaced.')
