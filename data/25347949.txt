That sounds...uncommon and ill-advised. \nI&#x27;ve seen a brand mercury that makes electronics products(?), but doesn&#x27;t seem to quite fit the context.<p>I mean, a soldering iron isn&#x27;t exactly disposable. I can see how the audiophile crowd could grind gears. But while fiddling around with something can certainly be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, basically repair shaming seems like a bizarre take. At that point it&#x27;s as much an electronics hobby.<p>In the bad old days of computers, there were certainly more problems you had to solve with an iron. Hell, if you&#x27;ve had a busted cap on a gpu or mobo past warranty, there&#x27;s still problems that do.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I just find it difficult, that on this kind of software-dev focused forum, that I can discourage the hacker spirit anywhere it grows.')
