Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=[24691714], score=None, time=1601928769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24691116, text='&gt; These days we have many websites with giant empty spaces on the left and&#x2F;or right, all in the name of making the text lines short enough (much shorter than I like them, but that&#x27;s another rant).<p>The other rant is here: [1].<p>Curious why do you hope people don&#x27;t use their browsers full-screen? How does someone else&#x27;s browsing preference affect you? Am I a lesser person if I want to use my browser full-screen on a 5120x2880 retina display?<p>It seems more and more every year, the user&#x27;s preference gets sidelined in favor of the web site designer&#x27;s preference. I never thought it would get to this, but as web sites get more and more opinionated about enforcing their particular stylistic choices, I&#x27;m more often than not feeling the need to disable CSS or go into Reader mode. I wish browser developers would provide better tools to override questionable site designs, rather than taking them away. At least I can still change the font size with the browsers (shhhh--don&#x27;t give them any ideas).<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24690133" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24690133</a>')
