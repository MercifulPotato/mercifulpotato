The 2.0-compute spec indeed hasn&#x27;t been updated for a year. I imagine it was halted because WebGL 2 never saw great adoption to begin with. Though even Apple &#x2F; WebKit is finally adding it, because I think they realized that WebGPU is going to take how many more years to pan out. What a disappointment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KhronosGroup&#x2F;WebGL&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;specs&#x2F;latest&#x2F;2.0-compute&#x2F;index.bs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KhronosGroup&#x2F;WebGL&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;specs&#x2F;late...</a>')
