There were occasional commits by other people but the majority of KHTML&#x27;s development was done by him.<p>You see, Konqueror as a web browser didn&#x27;t even have a single full time developer. That was the beginning of browser wars when Apple and Google were both funding Safari and Chrome with millions of dollars.<p>It was not really feasible for KHTML to compete with so many new specs being introduced to the web.<p>It&#x27;s still fascinating what they achieved though. At the time KHTML was the first to pass ACID2 test and beat competition performance-wise in many aspects.<p>This is all what I can recall so don&#x27;t consider it 100% accurate but I&#x27;m pretty much sure about the main point, which is that it simply was not viable to develop khtml from a practical standpoint.<p>[0] Quick note that Konqueror itself was created and maintained by David Faure, who maintained KDELibs (Before it became KDE Frameworks). David was a sponsored full time developer but he wasn&#x27;t doing a lot of work on KHTML and KJS (The browser aspects of Konqueror)')
