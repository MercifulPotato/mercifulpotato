I mean, it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to make a VM that&#x27;s indistinguishable (except for speed), but what&#x27;s the purpose of doing so?<p>Most people who run VMs have the purpose of &quot;I want this application to run more conveniently than having dedicated hardware for it.&quot; For that purpose, it&#x27;s useful to provide abstractions (e.g., providing dedicated access to CPUs in a way normal kernels usually don&#x27;t) and usually to provide sandboxing (e.g., prohibiting disk writes outside of the VM disk), but there&#x27;s generally little point in lying, unless the software you want to run won&#x27;t run right without lying. And it&#x27;s often counterproductive to lie, because software can adapt to the ways the abstraction is leaky if you&#x27;re truthful about the nature of the abstraction. (In this case, the VMware graphics driver can achieve much better performance by cooperating with the host than a normal graphics driver expecting physical hardware could get on a software emulation of that hardware.)<p>It&#x27;s also often pointless to lie - if you pay for a VM from Amazon EC2, and you log into it and it pretends to be a 1U physical server, are you going to believe it?')
