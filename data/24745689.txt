Item(by='nirui', descendants=None, kids=[24746489], score=None, time=1602423561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744772, text='&quot;Kitchen knives&quot; went too far to be an example. How about door locks?<p>I still don&#x27;t get the idea that having a weakened security system could somehow benefit security. Based on many real-life hack stories I&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s usually the &quot;bad actors&quot; who&#x27;s taking advantage of unsecured apps to attack normal people, this is the very reason why developers are making apps more secure to begin with.<p>Another point is, insecured systems are usually easy to take control of (By injecting malwares payload into the brokenly-encrypted traffic for example), then &quot;bad actors&quot; can turn those systems to a trojan proxy. How does that help if you want to make things safe?<p>Last point: I know this is about big companies encryptions. But really, &quot;Roll Your Own Encryption&quot; is not that bad anymore if all other &quot;secured-encryption&quot; was bugged. And, really, roll your own encryption is not that hard today if your only goal is to annoy the FBI.<p>Real last point: Even if companies such as Google and Facebook did banned encryption, does that also prevents &quot;bad actors&quot; from using real encryption on top of their service? You can even send your nudes to me safely by encrypting it with my public key and publish the encrypted data here (Don&#x27;t actually do that). The point is, even if you&#x27;ve successfully banned encryption in big companies, users will then just add a layer of encryption of their own, and that layer can be very very secure.')
