How about door locks?<p>I still don&#x27;t get the idea that having a weakened security system could somehow benefit security. Based on many real-life hack stories I&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s usually the &quot;bad actors&quot; who&#x27;s taking advantage of unsecured apps to attack normal people, this is the very reason why developers are making apps more secure to begin with.<p>Another point is, insecured systems are usually easy to take control of (By injecting malwares payload into the brokenly-encrypted traffic for example), then &quot;bad actors&quot; can turn those systems to a trojan proxy. How does that help if you want to make things safe?<p>Last point: I know this is about big companies encryptions. But really, &quot;Roll Your Own Encryption&quot; is not that bad anymore if all other &quot;secured-encryption&quot; was bugged. And, really, roll your own encryption is not that hard today if your only goal is to annoy the FBI.')
