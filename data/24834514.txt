An excerpt:<p>TL: Well, you see, I&#x27;m fine with that channel.<p>EM: You&#x27;re very kind. But my question is: Who in your family will take care of your copyright and your songs in the distant future?<p>TL: I don&#x27;t have a family.<p>EM: OK, but what do you think will happen to the channel and your songs? And if you have someone who will act on your behalf, could you give them my name in case they&#x27;d want the channel taken down?<p>TL: Yes, but there&#x27;s no need to remove that channel.<p>EM: I was just wondering what will happen in the future, because you&#x27;re certainly going to continue to sell records.<p>TL: Well, I don&#x27;t need to make money after I&#x27;m dead. These things will be taken care of.<p>EM: I feel like I gave away some of your songs to public domain without even asking you, and that wasn&#x27;t very nice of me.<p>TL: But I&#x27;m fine with that, you know.<p>EM: Will you establish any kind of foundation or charity or something like that?<p>TL: No, I won&#x27;t. They&#x27;re mostly rip-offs.</i>')
