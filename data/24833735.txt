Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[24834416], score=None, time=1603165256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833019, text='As someone that studied Game Theory (and philosophy, for that matter) at graduate levels, there&#x27;s quite a lot wrong with this post, and I just want to reiterate what @georgeglue1 said: Matt Jackson is quite literally a leading expert and the paper is actually very good for how terse it is. The kinds of exercises you&#x27;d do in a Game Theory class are pretty on par with what you see in the paper itself. You would end up answering questions like: What are the dominant strategies? Do any equillibria exist? What&#x27;s the Nash Equilibrium? What outcome is Pareto optimal (if any)? What&#x27;s the expected utility of a particular pure strategy? Mixed strategy? Etc.<p>Anyway, to address your comment, just on a very basic level, Phillipa Foot&#x27;s &quot;Trolley Problem&quot; is unequivocally <i>not</i> a game theoretic problem. It&#x27;s in the family of ethical &quot;no-win&quot; puzzles a la &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; and has little to do with the actual study of game theoretic strategies, outcomes, and equillibria. The &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; is also not game theoretic. There have been some attempts at turning it into an iterated game (in the <i>formal</i> sense), but -- again -- it&#x27;s not technically a game theoretic problem, and rather a question on social policy. Elinor Ostrom famously provided a <i>non</i>-game theoretic solution to the Tragedy, so bringing her up is just confusing.<p>&gt; At the core of game theory, and human civilization is communication and trust. The abuse of mass media to manipulate populations knows the power of communication and cultural narratives, and we&#x27;re witnessing what&#x27;s often described in terms such as &quot;hypernormalization&quot; or &quot;accelerationism&quot;<p>And I have no idea what the hell this means. It looks like gibberish and has nothing to do with the (relatively narrow) scope of Game Theory as a field.')
