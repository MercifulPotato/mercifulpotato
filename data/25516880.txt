It&#x27;s a great tool to have in your toolbelt.<p>I&#x27;m saying that unless you&#x27;ve used and hit the limits of RocksDB - and it&#x27;s already absurdly fast - there&#x27;s <i>zero</i> reason to utilize this project.<p>Maybe it&#x27;ll mature one day, have multiplatform support and a wide array of client libraries, and be to RocksDB what RocksDB was to LevelDB. But today is not that day.<p>For now, developers that don&#x27;t immediately understand what this project is for would best be served with a simple link to RocksDB.')
