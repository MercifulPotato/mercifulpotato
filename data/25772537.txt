If I&#x27;m understanding you correctly, you seem to believe that the issue is that I&#x27;m lonely, and it&#x27;s not a bad assumption but it&#x27;s not entirely correct. I grew up without friends, my parents forbade me from making friends from childhood until I was done university and by then for the most part I was, and still am, fine with being alone.<p>&gt;Finally, if you must commit suicide, please do it so that it plausibly looks like an accident.<p>I had a few ideas, but the only semi feasible one I thought of so far was to mix heavy alcohol intoxication and hypothermia.  Hypothermia is uncomfortable until you start loosing your mental faculties. The alcohol might be able to cover for the discomfort but I haven&#x27;t tested that particular combination. And there&#x27;s a slight concern about the poor sap that comes across my body.<p>Fentanyl overdose is probably the next option but I lack the necessary friends-of-friends to acquire some. And there isn&#x27;t a way of testing the timing or potency against the time of arrival of EMT&#x27;s that seem to carry Narcan in their pockets.<p>I&#x27;m open to hearing ideas if you have any though.')
