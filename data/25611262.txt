You may be thinking of TOPS-20, which indeed used filename.ext, where the extension was limited to 3 characters.<p>There was also ITS, which was one of the famous operating systems on the PDP-10. On ITS, filenames consisted of two parts, rach being 6 characters separated with a space. So you could have a file named &quot;abc def&quot;. The second half was often used in the same way we use extensions today, but executable files were named &quot;ts name&quot;, where name was the name of the command.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what format filenames had on TENEX and TOPS-10.')
