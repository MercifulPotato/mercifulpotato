And next time you go to Chipotle, think for a moment the complexity of the ingredients your getting. Rice? It&#x27;s rice. Black beans? You could buy them canned, you won&#x27;t taste the difference in a bowl. Salsa? You can just buy salsa, it&#x27;s a dollar or so and lasts ages in the fridge. Cheese is cheese. Lettuce is lettuce. Now all that&#x27;s left is cooking some chicken breast, your choice how to do it.<p>If it takes you hours to cook chicken... I don&#x27;t know how to help you. Perhaps Google how to bake chicken, how to pan fry chicken, how to cook chicken in an instant pot. Literally anything.')
