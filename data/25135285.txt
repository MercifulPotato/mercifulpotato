You can always `use super::*` but, ugh.<p>And with most imports in Rust being unqualified (that seems to be the idiomatic approach), I then find it difficult to differentiate types that are from a sibling, internal module from types that are important from external crates. Especially at site of use of the type.<p>Go&#x27;s “local package names unqualified, everything else qualified” makes it much easier for me to read code without first having to parse all the import statements.')
