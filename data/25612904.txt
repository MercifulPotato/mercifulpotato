The experience in different US prisons (and jails for that matter) differs widely - just like schools.<p>Federal prisons are well known to be cake walks. State prisons are the worst but again differ widely - even within the same state. Typically those with different types of crimes and sentences and ages get put in different prisons, so as you can imagine a nonviolent offender under 35 with a 10 year or less sentence gets sent to a much better prison then a serial killer who&#x27;s 51 with a life sentence.<p>So take that dude&#x27;s experience with a grain of salt. The state wants you to believe prison is hell, but as with most things it depends. The positive experiences I had in prison changed my life. If I had a choice between my prison experience and my experience as a master&#x27;s student all over again I&#x27;d choose prison every time a million times over.')
