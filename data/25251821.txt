If I just disregard strange formats etc. there are just a things that Hugo doesnt do, as a design decision, like start a binary when you are rebuilding the site. Which is to me extremely strange &quot;security&quot; decison that is just making updating site (like putting `software --help` on to a webpage) more annoying and workarounded by bunch of scripts instead relying on hugo only.<p>I think that over the time all the software starts creeping with bunch of features that most people dont want or need and strange decisions from the past hunts it.')
