Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25052575, 25050937, 25056663, 25055701], score=None, time=1605037824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048271, text='This squares with my experience in Illinois after a couple of elections.<p>* As a security&#x2F;integrity issue, the ballots themselves are much less scary than the pollbooks, which are what we use to match voters against the voting rolls.<p>* Everything&#x27;s ultimately on paper; there are bar codes, which nobody loves, but they&#x27;re auditable against the readable printed ballot.<p>* Most of the security is physical&#x2F;human; for us, each polling station (a location can have several precincts and thus several stations, each a giant rolling metal box) is sealed using numbered plastic seals before the polls open and after they&#x27;re closed, and everything is recorded redundantly and signed off on by the poll workers.<p>* A matching count at the close of polls is a <i>big deal</i>, a nightmare big deal; in Illinois, we can&#x27;t just shrug off a missing ballot and say &quot;nothing we can do about it&quot;; in March, I had to stay 3 hours late while we resolved a similar issue (IIRC, a mis-recorded provisional). Most pollworkers in my experience are there for the money (I&#x27;ve never bothered cashing the check) and the threat that they won&#x27;t get paid if they count doesn&#x27;t match is extremely powerful.<p>* The local police are not allowed to monitor polling places, and the municipality of the polling place is usually confused about that; in Cook County, it&#x27;s the County Sheriff&#x27;s Department that has authority over polling places. Our cops were very friendly and responsive.<p>* The drama of every election is the the &quot;string line&quot; that defined the 100 foot &quot;no electioneering&quot; radius of the polling place; the entertainment you can count on each cycle is the candidate whose people religiously move their lawn signs inside the string line, and freak out when you remove them.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting system that derives a lot of resiliency from extreme complexity and maximal human touch points --- Illinois elections will never do something with 1 person when the same thing could be done with 2 --- which is sort of the opposite of how we reason about security online. It&#x27;s simultaneously terrifying and reassuring.')
