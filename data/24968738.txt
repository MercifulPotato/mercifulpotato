Many of the comments seem to be assuming I am talking about low-end motorcycles.<p>To be clear, however, I was talking about small folding electric inline 2-wheel stand-on devices.<p>As for theft, that&#x27;s a huge and growing problem with bikes.  That&#x27;s another reason to dissuade me from having a decent bike that would encourage me to commute (although work from home now solves that).  A folding bike or 2-wheel step scooter would have worked perfectly for me when I was commuting via foot, train, bus, and then foot each way to and from work.')
