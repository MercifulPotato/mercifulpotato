It&#x27;s generally used for one of two things: 1) Single Sign-On - something that generally increases the security of applications under one organization, where authentication has to be shared one way or another, and 2) &quot;social login&quot; - something that takes a website from being its own and only auth provider to supporting multiple external providers.<p>2) is the exact opposite of centralization and 1) is basically equivalent to dynamic linking which, while &quot;centralization&quot; in theory, is generally considered a good security practice.')
