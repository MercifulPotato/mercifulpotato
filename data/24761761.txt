Even <i>looking</i> vaguely like a manufactured home is enough to keep people away from them. My own observations are that newer pre-fab &#x2F; manufactured can be very well built. We have a lot of people coming here looking for rural retreats - truth is, if you are way off the grid, a manufactured home may be a very good option for you as it may be difficult to convince a builder to work on your custom build project if it&#x27;s going to be a long commute for them.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is - there&#x27;s a mental block for people in accepting these houses that has noting to do with reality and everything to do with perception.')
