This can&#x27;t be serious, can it? LN is vaporware from day one. It serves no purpose because it is essentially centralizing a decentralized service. And when it still cost $5-10 to send BTC to a LN node, you are no better off than credit card fees.<p>Hilariously BTC had this problem solved from day one, then Blockstream hijacked the GitHub repo, kicked out all the original devs and artificially limited the block size to try and push people onto their own &quot;second layer&quot; products.<p>Why anyone would use LN rather than just real Bitcoin (now called Bitcoin Cash) is beyond me. They have lots of trolls (Adam Back) and social engineers (Greg Maxwell) pushing a false narrative but how real people fall for it is still just bizarre.')
