I mean, even the riding posture is different.<p>We want beginner languages to make it as easy as possible to learn programming, and to be able to write a program to do simple things.  Our PL ideas may be good, but no, we don&#x27;t want beginners to need to know them.  We want them to be able to learn to program <i>at all</i>, and the fewer ideas they need to learn to do so, the better (that is, the more of them will learn).<p>And <i>then</i> we want to encourage them to move on to more advanced ideas.  To do that, we want to make the more advanced ideas as accessible as possible (which I think was your point).  And to do <i>that</i>, we need to make ideas as orthogonal as possible; that is, we need to decouple them as much as possible.  This lets someone learn as much as they want about one area without having to first learn all the other areas.')
