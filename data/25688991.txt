My first though was - oh this should be no big deal chances are there are good policies in place for laptops that go home with people.<p>Then I realized it is a shared&#x2F;central machine which means it probably has the most effed up and relaxed security in the fleet, post-it notes with passwords taped to the palm rests, and god knows what else. IT departments are notorious for over-granting privileges to these shared machines due to the mixed use they typically recieve. After X help desk complaints you get fed up and check all the boxes in the permissions manager.<p>Hopefully, though, it is locked up and the data is inaccessible.')
