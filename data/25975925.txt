Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612067099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975634, text='&gt; In reality, each short creates a synthetic long, so there are always more long positions than short positions.<p>I feel like this should have led to more interesting problems already.<p>Like, suppose there is a company which is going down the drain and two of its competitors are willing to pay a few peanuts for its carcass and nobody else wants it at all. It&#x27;s e.g. 50% shorted, so they each end up buying 51% of the company because 102% is less than 150%. What happens now?<p>&gt; They&#x27;re not accounting for (or deliberately ignoring) the fact that new short positions can be initiated at $360 which will be profitable when the stock inevitably falls.<p>That&#x27;s still a risky bet given the amount of media coverage this story is getting. The volatility of that stock right now is absurd. And if it goes high enough, even shorts who got in at a crazy price could get busted by an even crazier price.<p>&gt; Reddit can&#x27;t keep the stock high forever with a never-ending stream of buyers.<p>It&#x27;s a war of attrition at this point, isn&#x27;t it?<p>You have the shorts who would really like to wait until the price crashes before closing their positions, but the higher the price goes the more collateral they need to continue shorting the stock. So they end up having to borrow money from people willing to risk losing it in exchange for (presumably) a high interest rate. If the price gets high enough for them to run out of willing creditors, they go bust and anybody who tried to bail them out loses the money they put in.<p>On the other side is everybody who is holding the stock and is going to keep hyping it until that happens, because if there is a short squeeze they make a mint but if it crashes first then they end up eating it instead of the shorts.<p>Anybody who thinks they know who is going to come out on top has a better crystal ball than me.')
