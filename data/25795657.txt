I have no car and negligible other assets. it is rational to take out a loan for a reasonably priced car as long as I can comfortably make the payments on my new wages. if I later lose my job but am not upside-down on the loan, I am still better off than I started.<p>example two: I make $200k and have $500k in assets and I want to buy a $20k car. I could easily afford to buy the car outright by selling some assets, but then I would have to pay capital gains and forgo future appreciation. if the expected appreciation + capital gains tax on those assets is significantly higher than the loan interest over the full term, it is rational to finance the vehicle.')
