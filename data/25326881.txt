Basic idea is you would buy a good online but you wouldnâ€™t pay the merchant directly. You would pay a payments processor who would pay the merchant from its account. Somewhat similar to using Visa or Mastercard. Then the payments processor has data about you, but Mastercard and Visa sell your data today anyway. You can also using mixing pools and generate new addresses for each transaction to help mitigate tracking.')
