If you understand graphs then you&#x27;ll grok git pretty fast.<p>Not all engineers are CS grads. Not all engineers _need_ to be CS grads. Git is a great tool, but it can also be pretty complicated if you have to go off the beaten path.<p>&gt; Is the market so over-saturated that they have to offer the 4 month trial period?<p>*week<p>And IMO, it&#x27;s not a question of saturation. It&#x27;s a question of credibility. You, for instance, are (presumably) skeptical of whether or not Lambda grads would be able to pull their weight on a team. Spending 4 weeks working directly with a Lambda grad seems like a pretty good way to either prove or disprove your hypothesis.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of bootcamps, especially after learning that some of the TA&#x27;s at Lambda are hired to help with teaching as little as two months into the program as students.<p>Skepticism is healthy, however I object to the idea that one needs to be an expert to teach. Even if you&#x27;re just a _little_ better at something than someone else, there&#x27;s no reason that you can&#x27;t teach someone what you know.<p>Of course, that breaks down if you _pretend_ to be an expert at the thing that you&#x27;re teaching. It takes some humility, I guess.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s no better than some diploma mills but any state school with half a decent curriculum sounds better than this.<p>AFAIK, very few schools have an applied software engineering program that adequately prepares grads for doing real work on a real team. That&#x27;s something that really can only come from experience.<p>Having hired multiple new grads, my biggest problem was that they&#x27;d go down the rabbit hole of computing theory rather than focusing on solving the problem at hand in a practical way. IMO, applied software engineering education is pretty lacking across the board and bootcamps are a good place to experiment with new approaches. Even if Lambda and other bootcamps aren&#x27;t necessarily the perfect solution, they&#x27;re an attempt at a new solution to a hard problem.')
