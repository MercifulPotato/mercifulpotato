Also from the Wikipedia article:<p>&gt; Supervision and control of D.C. National Guard was delegated by the president to the defense secretary pursuant to Executive Order 10030, 26 January 1949 with authority to designate National Military Establishment officials to administer affairs of the D.C. National Guard. The Army secretary was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the ground component, and the Air Force secretary was directed to act in all matters pertaining to the air component.<p>&gt; The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president or Congress.<p>So control is apparently shared in some way between the president, secdef, congress, and secretaries of the army and air force. But it does seem that the Army secretary&#x27;s authority is delegated by the president, who remains the &quot;commander in chief&quot; of the guard unit.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s controlled at the federal level, not by the DC mayor.')
