Quit our jobs, abandon our livelihoods, and take to the streets<p>If necessary yes. Your forefathers fought hard to earn you your democratic and associated rights that you have all taken for granted. And that&#x27;s why its slow erosion has only now made you start to feel a bit uncomfortable. So yes, you too need to start asserting for your rights.<p>And no, to begin with you don&#x27;t need to quit your job and take to the streets.<p>Start by writing letters to the political parties of your country. Start by making your local politicians aware that you feel the government isn&#x27;t concerned about your rights as a consumer. Escalate and urge others in your network to do the same. And move on from there. Democracy is designed to slow down political changes because abrupt political changes also has a lot of chaos. Initially you will only have to spend maybe an hour or two a week to do the above. As more and more people support you, and you all work together, this may increase to 5-10 hours a week depending on how much you are willing to commit yourself. Once a political party latches on to your issue, it then becomes a lot easier - join it or offer issue-based support to them. (Yes, often it is all quite boring and just takes patience and dedication. That&#x27;s democracy - it is often boring participating in it, but still worth it).')
