I chuck them straight in the bin.<p>Domino&#x27;s is the only place that will deliver to me, being on the outskirts of the city. Luckily that Domino&#x27;s is pretty good and reasonably low on the grease quota, compared to some I&#x27;ve had elsewhere. The one thing I do particularly like about that franchise is the cleanliness; I&#x27;ve been into the shop itself and it&#x27;s really well kept, compared to some of the other &quot;big&quot; pizza places here.')
