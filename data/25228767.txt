There is no objective measure of productivity that can be applied to software development.<p>2. Accurate estimation of development times is impossible (not difficult, actually theoretically impossible). All estimates of development times are wrong, some by more than an order of magnitude.<p>The second one is especially hard to grok for non-techies. I have to explain that if you insist on accurate estimates, you will get grossly padded estimates [0]. And the work will expand to fit the time available (sometimes resulting in the task exceeding even the massively padded estimates because the work expanded with the estimate). I&#x27;ve had many entertaining conversations attempting to explain this.<p>[0] Because every developer knows that an estimate will magically become a deadline.')
