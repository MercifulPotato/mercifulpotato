While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing”<p>I don’t think that’s inadequate hardware performance. I think that’s Linux GPU stack. More specifically, the parts where hardware acceleration integrates with that decades-old X11.<p>I once made a toy project for Pi4 that can render GLES content either with or without desktop manager: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;Vrmac&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;Vrmac&#x2F;</a> I did observe occasional tearing on desktop, with both 3D content or accelerated h264 video. Maximizing window into borderless fullscreen didn’t help. However, rebooting into console and running the same code on top of DRM&#x2F;KMS without X11 resulted in no tearing.')
