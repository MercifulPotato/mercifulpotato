That&#x27;s too big a burden for something so vitally important to it&#x27;s users?<p>I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I get that there are issues with corporate monopoly control of communication. And there are <i>some</i> things that will only work well as an app, not as a web page. But... parler really isn&#x27;t one of them?  Oh no we have to go to a bookmark in a browser instead of having an app or even an icon on a homepage... seems like a weird complaint when they are also saying access to parler is so vitally important. What&#x27;s the big deal? I mostly access facebook and twitter this way on my android phone already.')
