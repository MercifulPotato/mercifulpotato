But most of the conversation here seems to be about refugees and asylum seekers rather than legal immigrants. It helps that I&#x27;m more than willing to adopt the European way of life: fashion, food, work-life balance and all the rest of it.<p>As to your first point, that was the crux of my post. I no longer care (nor am offended by, mind you!) whether you judge me or not. I <i>know</i> how much vitriol coursed through my veins every day I was in Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi etc. And I <i>know</i> how much more at peace I am in France. I am a better human because of it; kinder, more useful to society etc. I would not trade any of it for more abstract notions of whether Europeans as a whole will be upset by the wider trends.')
