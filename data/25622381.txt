Problem is that you donâ€™t get the time to do a real review. There is also no real process of handling the review feedback so even if you find the time to understand the issue management will still go ahead with what they wanted to do anyway.  Not sure how to handle this. It seems there is no amount of process to ensure that people act in good faith.')
