I want to learn more.<p>I&#x27;ve read that increasing CO2 %, increasing temperature, and increasing water availability will improve plant yields. Is this true?<p>I also understood that one of the positive feedbacks for the climate response is the increased amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, water vapour being a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. I&#x27;m confused about how we can have more water vapour in the atmosphere and yet less water availability, presumably because less rain - these things appear to be conflicting.<p>I understand that the change in climate will change the established weather patterns that we&#x27;re used to now, and create drought in areas that are currently wet. I don&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t adapt to this and move our farms to where the water is.<p>In short: I keep hearing this, that global climate change will reduce our ability to grow plants, and I don&#x27;t understand why this is true or how the science for it works. Can anyone shed some light on it, please?')
