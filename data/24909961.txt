For images outside the viewport it&#x27;s great; for images which are in the viewport, the browser isn&#x27;t able to discover the image until the JS has loaded and decided which image size to fetch. In my experience this slows down the overall rendering of the page.\n&gt;I see the Google Chrome team was involved in creating this component so I&#x27;d like to know what&#x27;s different this time, because they have the data.<p>No knowledge of what Google contributed to this, but my experience of running Google PageSpeed Insights on many sites is that this sort of optimization does improve the metrics Google measures.<p>Also, while I agree in part with most of your points, I still think we should give credit to nextjs for making this easy.<p>Sure, maybe you don&#x27;t need a library to use srcset. If you are going to run our own custom build processes (or server endpoints) that generate images in a range of appropriate sizes and write the corresponding front-end code, good for you. Next.js has done nothing to stop any of this.<p>But many (most?) websites don&#x27;t bother with any of that and just load one giant image for everyone. If there is a tool that makes using optimized images as easy loading one giant image for everyone, I think that&#x27;s great.')
