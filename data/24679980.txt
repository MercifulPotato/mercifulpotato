Personal attacks are neither productive nor interesting.<p>My reasoning is the following:<p>People would only listen to you if you can prove what you say is right, because nobody is interested in hearing wrong things or unexplained things, they just aren&#x27;t helpful.<p>&quot;We should use nodejs!&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t want to argue, we just should.&quot;  Is that helpful?<p>If you don&#x27;t have the reasoning skills to convince others, you can&#x27;t present constructive ideas and back them up with an explanation.<p>If you can&#x27;t do that, literally, what is your value to the team? Blindly and quietly execute the will of other team members? That would take too much energy from those people, to direct you on every step of the way.<p>When you hire engineers, you expect them to give more than they take, otherwise they&#x27;re a drain on the team resources.<p>Collective problem solving is impossible without arguing. Arguing is trying to improve something, identify mistakes, logical contradictions, basically you&#x27;re doing the work of a compiler that checks your program for correctness.  Would you want a compiler that always agreed with you, whatever you fed into it? Don&#x27;t think so. Same thing with engineers working together to reach a common goal. You&#x27;re checking and improving each other&#x27;s ideas.<p>Edit: moreover, if you lack reasoning skills to convince others, means you lack reasoning skills themselves. How are you going to solve problems in the first place?')
