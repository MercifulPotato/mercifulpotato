There&#x27;s no way to set exchange parameters in RH, users can&#x27;t edit the charts for TA, and the functionality is heavily reduced on purpose for the sake of not overloading users that have basically no clue what they are looking at anyways.<p>Not that any of this excuses RH. Given RH&#x27;s user base, some random person trading PLTR and GME calls probably is not even looking into any of this stuff to begin with.')
