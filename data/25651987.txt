I haven&#x27;t been drinking coffee very much at all during the pandemic, but that&#x27;s because there is no risk if I drowse off at home. At work, if I didn&#x27;t have my coffee I would be clonking off in every presentation, because who doesn&#x27;t start feeling relaxed and tired in a dimly lit climate controlled room in  a comfortable chair with nothing to do but sit in silence for a while? If I sit anywhere not doing anything I will start falling asleep, and I do get my 8 hours+ a night.<p>What was worse was if I had to drive. Same issue. Comfortable chair, light vibration from the car, warm interior, not much going on going straight on the highway, and I start dozing off. Coffee prevents that from happening. In desperate times I would start to rip out a leg hair every now and then to keep myself awake, or slap myself quite hard in the face. I keep emergency caffeine pills in my car now for this purpose.')
