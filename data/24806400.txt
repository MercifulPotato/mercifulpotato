By <i>you</i> doing something positive and concrete.<p>Think global, act locally.  But personal action here would be <i>you</i> actually doing something.  Something positive, if you want to be taken seriously.  Not suggesting others do, but <i>you</i> personally.  When you’ve dedicated enough time (years) to that personal action, then <i>you</i> develop the moral authority to ask others, who have day-to-day struggles, to dedicate their limited resources to help to broaden your (now successful) action.<p>Think Jimmy Carter.  You do something direct and positive (build homes for the needy, actually hammering nails), and when that something is good, others follow.  It’s a core cultural value of engineers to champion this sort of concrete strategy.  I think the readers of HN lean towards the engineering side of things.  Jimmy Carter was an engineer.')
