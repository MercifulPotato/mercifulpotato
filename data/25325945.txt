I remember when everyone complained that docker was too monolithic and controlled by one company. In response they spun out a spec (OCI), an implementation of that spec (runc), then their entire freaking runtime (containerd). They focused on making Docker more of a developer tool with Docker for Mac and Windows.<p>Kubernetes continues to use OCI, runc and containerd - so basically the parts of Docker <i>the kubernetes community asked for</i>.<p>Yet here we are commenting on their demise as a business, blaming it on their “not being nice” and “not listening to their community”. It’s bullshit. We should be discussing how the longstanding tension over the role of Docker in the Kubernetes was finally resolved, in large parts through the successful efforts of the oci, runc and containerd projects which Docker started and shepherded to mass adoption.<p>Let’s take a step back and look at who is pushing this narrative about Docker, and how they benefit. I can’t help but notice whenever this drama pops up, a Red Hat employee is involved. Maybe it’s time for Red Hat to give up on old grudges and give credit where credit is due? Just a thought.<p>Docker may have failed as a business but it’s ridiculous to blame it on their lack of openness when their number one problem was being too open and trying too hard to get everyone to love them. Basically the opposite of what this blog post claims.')
