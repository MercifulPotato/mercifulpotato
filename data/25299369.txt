On the Flex 5 it isn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s quite annoying that docking for multiple displays, etc. is nerfed.<p>It&#x27;s mystifying that there&#x27;s pretty much no availability of competitive spec&#x27;d machines for such a great performing processor &#x2F; GPU on the market. This Pangolin is slightly amazing for allowing up to 64GB of RAM -- all other options using AMD Ryzen 4XXX I&#x27;ve seen are limited to 8GB of soldered RAM, 1080p display, and 720p webcam. I was somehow lucky and got a 16GB version of the Flex 5 in July. Now it&#x27;s completely disappeared from the market.<p>It just feels like dark market forces are preventing good options that people really want to buy.')
