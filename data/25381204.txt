Without that hardware it&#x27;s super niche and I don&#x27;t think has much broad use.<p>If anyone can pull it off when the hardware is ready it&#x27;ll probably be Apple.<p>FB is obviously trying really hard to be there too, but I just don&#x27;t think people will want it to come from FB (and forcing Oculus under their brand makes it so that it would have to be).<p>Magic Leap will be to whatever Apple ends up making as General Magic was to the iPhone.<p>The rough idea was directionally correct, but way too early with hardware that just wasn&#x27;t good enough.')
