On the one hand, more efficiency and liquidity in small investment projects is probably good.<p>But I also see two big opportunities for abuse: One risk would be combining this with 506c offerings (allowing general solicitation) to create a proliferation of very low quality syndications (I&#x27;ve already seen many ads on Facebook for this sort of thing) that are effectively glamorous but money losing opportunities. A second risk is that a lot of investors won&#x27;t be over the &#x27;legal help&#x27; threshold -- basically they won&#x27;t be investing an amount where it makes sense to hire a lawyer to actually review the contract. This could potentially lead to abuse as well.')
