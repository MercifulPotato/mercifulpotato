Fox, for instance.<p>I mean, this is the plan for a ton of people who go to California, particularly in the software world: &quot;I&#x27;ll work really hard for &lt;major company&gt; and put away a lot of money, then I&#x27;ll move to a small place and work on what I <i>really</i> want to do, and live happily ever after.&quot;<p>How many people actually achieve this?
