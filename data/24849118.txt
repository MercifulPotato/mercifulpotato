The ashes were put in an &quot;ash can&quot; and put out for the &quot;ash man&quot; to collect.<p>When burning became illegal, people started throwing garbage in their ash cans, and the word transformed into &quot;trash can.&quot;<p>At least that&#x27;s the story as related to me by my parents and grandparents.  The ones who are still alive still refer to it as an &quot;ash can&quot; for this reason.')
