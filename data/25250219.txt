This may have been the right direction for them, but it&#x27;s not the same approach as before and definitely abandons compatibility in favor of better performance.<p>Second while Gatekeeper has been around for 8+ years, the default of contacting an Apple server on every program launch was new (or so I thought) with Big Sur. It&#x27;s a step towards that direction.  People could not launch apps when this server was down.')
