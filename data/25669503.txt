We went as far as \nfinding the vulnerable code and triggering it to cause a \nmemory leak and an eventual denial of service, but we \nweren’t able to exploit it for remote code execution.<p>It is possible that there’s no actual remote code \nexecution here, and it was marked as such just in case, \nas it happened with the “Bad Neighbor” ICMPv6 \nVulnerability (CVE-2020-16898). If you have any insights, \nwe’ll be happy to hear about them.</i>')
