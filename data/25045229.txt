For some old-fashoned customers I always carried a Brother DS-mobile 600 portable document scanner in my bag.<p>The scanner was expensive, but really nice. And it worked perfectly with MacOS &#x27;capture&#x27; application that existed on Snowleapard (10.6).<p>However, Apple removed TWAIN support in MacOs Lion (10.7), and Brother refused to release updated drivers. The only way to use the scanner was using the horribly bloated third party scanning software, that was basically useless for document scanning (but it did allow you to draw a hat on the photo of your dog!). Up to this day they still market the scanner as &#x27;MacOS compatible&#x27;.<p>Ironically, my scanner is now an expensive paperweight. Which makes it double useless, since I have no paper.')
