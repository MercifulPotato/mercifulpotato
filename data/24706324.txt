It&#x27;s true that designing an USB 3.0 PHY&#x2F;controller is a serious challenge, and bad signal integrity in PCB design can cause many problems, but almost nobody implements one&#x27;s own USB transceiver or controller from scratch. They&#x27;re all standard off-the-shelf chips. If the PCB design is careful and a good cable is used, Layer 1 should be relatively stable.<p>A large number of problems appear to be bad hardware compliance, documentation, firmware or driver. For example, I have a PC with an early Renesas USB 3.0 controller. Once in a while, the controller could become completely unresponsive. The reason was that the controller has a firmware bug, and you can actually get some reverse-enginnered firmware update tool on GitHub to fix it.')
