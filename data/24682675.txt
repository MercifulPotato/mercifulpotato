The standard education in a diff eq course is almost useless for real world problems (beyond the obvious linear diff equations). Much of what is taught in such a course is never used - even by mathematicians - including applied (Google rants on integrating factors).<p>Real world diff equations are notoriously difficult to deal with analytically, and usually a numerical approach is the only tool in the toolbox.')
