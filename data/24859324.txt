Before my MythBox went out the door, it had four TV cards a couple of huge drives and a ton of memory. It was a very nice machine. Before that, I used the XBMC on a couple of Xboxes. I remember using Splinter Cell and a memory card, I think, to perform the hack to get it going. That was a lot of fun.<p>Fast forward to today, I was using a a little single board computer (le potato) to run Kodi. That worked okay but always required hacking to get it working with Netflix or other services. I finally gave up and bought the Nvidia Shield Pro. It works great and I haven&#x27;t had a single (major) issue since buying it. It runs Android TV and allows me to install Kodi as an app. I still run Kodi along with many of the other apps. No longer do I have to run into the room and ssh into the box to get it to do something.<p>While I am happy with the Nvidia Shield, in my heart, I feel like I gave up some freedom. The early days of HTPC were about figuring out how to make things work without the infrustructure of any big companies (other than the $19.99&#x2F;year I paid to schedulesdirect!). Just a community of people making things work they way they wanted them to work. Yep. I am a sell out (that is watching tv with a knowing smile on his face).')
