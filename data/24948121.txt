The NumPy homepage makes absolutely no reference to NumFOCUS at all.<p>I have no connection to any of these projects but some very basic browsing on these sites refutes your assertions. You&#x27;re using questionable criteria to make dubious claims.

NumFOCUS provides NumPy with fiscal, legal, and administrative support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numpy.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numpy.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; By 2010, a critical mass of projects were in need of a more formal structure to provide support and help to organize the community.
