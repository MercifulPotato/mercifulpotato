Interesting, but I think there are very different outcomes with leaning on either (1) &quot;earnest A or earnest B&quot; vs (2) &quot;bad C&quot; (McDonalds Theory)...<p>The McDonalds Theory doesn&#x27;t attempt to control or guide the decision. It maximally liberates others to shape it. It invites serendipity, from the POV of the prompter. It doesn&#x27;t assume the poser of the question has any special knowledge or expertise with which they wish to shape the choice landscape.<p>But &quot;A or B&quot; can very easily (and perhaps unintentionally) guide and take control of the choice. Its usage can easily become a &quot;dark pattern&quot; that collapses the possibility space onto one of two known trajectories (from the perspective of the prompter).<p>If you WANT to take control, then &quot;A or B&quot; is great. But if you want to lazily invite collaborative ideas from the minds of others with the least effort or skill, then McDonalds Theory is much much better imho.<p>To show my cards, I&#x27;ve realized I air toward the latter in my community organizing and facilitation work. Frankly, I believe we&#x27;re all more likely to learn more about the world through McDonalds Theory framing, instead of getting stuck in local minima of &quot;only what we can imagine&quot; as leaders&#x2F;supporters :)<p>This stuff is all very relevant to facilitation practices! It&#x27;s neat stuff to think through, so thanks for the opportunity to work through it out loud :)')
