Apple just has been hiring some of the best talent in the field for a long time now that have been working on their phone&#x2F;tablet chips and now used their talents on the M1.<p>There is a lot you can do to improve a CPU without changing the instruction set or manufacturing process just by doing a better job at designing the CPU itself. (look at Ryzen 5000 series with 15 to 20% IPC gain over the 3000&#x2F;4000 series while staying on the same manufacturing process for example)<p>Basically there is a lot to gain just by doing a better design on the CPU itself. Also faster CPUs&#x2F;GPUs allows one to build faster CPUs&#x2F;GPUs just because as with more compute around you can run simulations faster&#x2F;with more accuracy thus allowing faster development&#x2F;better designs.')
