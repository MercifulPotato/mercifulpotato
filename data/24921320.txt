I also like Gitea because it doesn&#x27;t have reCaptcha or other proprietary components, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the advanced (&#x27;Enterprise&#x27;) features that Gitlab does (I program as a hobby so I&#x27;ve never needed these). When Gitea has grown and is more accepted, I hope the Wikimedia Foundation will consider using it.')
