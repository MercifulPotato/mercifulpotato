You start to think that people who can&#x27;t even get their lives together to remember a court date -- how many other things are they going to get into trouble with that we&#x27;ll have to save them from too?<p>You&#x27;re being summoned to a court of law for something that you did.  You would think that you could spend a few minutes not browsing Instagram and take certain things in life more seriously.<p>Also edit: totally not right that I&#x27;m being flagged for just having an unpopular opinion.  I&#x27;m not flaming anyone, personally insulting anyone, or raising illegitimate points.   Whoever is doing this is exactly falling into the behavior of trying to silence people you disagree with.')
