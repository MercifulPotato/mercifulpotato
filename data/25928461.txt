Sure, it&#x27;s hard to put a concrete price on a 2x4, but you at least understand what value people see in it - the way supply and demand affect the price are reflections of the worth of lumber as a building material (or whatever else).<p>But the price of a stock is nonsense - if you don&#x27;t own enough to influence the company, and the stocks don&#x27;t pay out, then the price is just money that moves in and out of your account. You can&#x27;t even really say that the price of a stock is an agreement of its arbitrary value; you sell the stock because you expect it to go down, and you sell the stock to someone else who expects it to go up. If you buy a stock at the peak, you are paying the highest ever price for its lowest ever value.')
