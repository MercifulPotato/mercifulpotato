While I was there, we switched to a new fulfillment system that involved putting all of the stocking responsibilities on one team, instead of spreading it between departments.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the technology, it&#x27;s the physical amount of product coming in compared to man hours. A typical 8hr shift would look like:<p>- 3hrs to unload the general merch delivery truck. An hour to unload the two freezer&#x2F;cooler that would arrive at some point throughout the shift<p>- 1hr30m of breaks<p>- 1hr setup for night shift<p>- 1hr of &#x27;picks&#x27;, which was stock we had in the backroom that the system said could go out. This doesn&#x27;t include the actual stocking of said items<p>That leaves 1hr30m to unload all the stock from the trucks, which doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Even if these robots were in my store and could tell me for certain that products needed to be reshelved, the man power isn&#x27;t there to do it. It ends up being that all the teams achieve their department goals except for the fulfillment team that gets killed.<p>edit: formatting')
