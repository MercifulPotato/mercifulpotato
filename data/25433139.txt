Though I have read about both, I have never worked with a JSON schema or Open API api. I have conservatively worked at least a hundred REST APIs, including both public and private ones.<p>I’m mildly optimistic about GraphQL, but without a doubt I think one of the best parts is that all GraphQL APIs have typed schemas. There is no discretion on the part of the API provider.<p>This is similar to a debate  regarding programming languages. Some people like more restrictive languages, because they don’t trust others or themselves to reliably use good discretion in the use of powerful features or omission of optional safety checks like types.')
