Only about 30% [2] of produce is sold in mandis.<p>Any anti-mandi law is essentially an anti-farmer law; because mandis act as a safety net for farmers. No farmer can negotiate good deals with big corp, and once the buyer side is monopolized (ala Jio); the farmer is <i>forced</i> into bad contracts. What the government should do is implement mandi reforms.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thehindubusinessline.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;can-free-trade-and-corporate-farming-improve-farmer-income&#x2F;article32745489.ece" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thehindubusinessline.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;can-free-trade-...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.downtoearth.org.in&#x2F;blog&#x2F;agriculture&#x2F;by-pushing-farm-bills-through-modi-government-has-put-democracy-at-crossroads-73647" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.downtoearth.org.in&#x2F;blog&#x2F;agriculture&#x2F;by-pushing-f...</a>')
