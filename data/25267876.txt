Even then there will be wildly different opinions in the scientific community.  You might take a look at nih.gov (Use google to search it) e.g. &quot;site:nih.gov covid-19 antibodies&quot;  etc..  to get an idea of some of the studies in play right now.  It may be a long time before people can truly answer that question.  There are also many variables per-person that come into play.  i.e. a persons physiological condition, environment, lifestyle, etc...  Medical experts usually default to the lowest common denominator, so the answer you would likely get is to take the vaccine regardless.')
