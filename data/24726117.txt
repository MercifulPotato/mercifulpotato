Again, there is nothing in this article nor in the e-mail included in the article that suggests they aren&#x27;t being sent for the purposes of being present upon a search warrant being issued or consent being given to search the individual&#x27;s property. This journalist just decided to take the worst possible interpretation of the e-mail and state it as fact.<p>You may not like the FBI, but to assume that they are malevolent actors or are intent on trampling on people&#x27;s rights disingenuous and unhelpful. I&#x27;m all for bringing government misconduct to light, but this article is trying to make legal conduct seem illegal by distorting facts and selectively quoting information to fit a preconceived narrative.')
