What&#x27;s hard is grasping the underlying concept of array-based programming and using it to do useful work and solve problems. NumPy is popular because it piggy-backs on a popular, widely used, and free language which also does a lot more than array manipulation, if NumPy existed on its own then its notation would not be simpler to learn it would be bizarre.')
