How do you deal with it? I would drink coffee during the work week and have nausea headaches at the weekend, once i established the cause and effect here I stopped the coffee habit. What I find tiresome are the macho comments about being a real coffee drinker. Yes, I also love the double-shot whatever, but dependency isn&#x27;t cool and I don&#x27;t want to have coffee at the weekend just to avoid headaches.')
