I&#x27;d love such a thing. Unfortunately, their algorithm is woefully immature, they lack content, and can&#x27;t double down on shows that get a slow start. In the short term this helps them grow at the expense of alienating early adopters, die hard fans, and their more flippant subscribers.<p>My biggest peeve is that Netflix keeps dropping and cancelling shows I&#x27;m really enjoying. I&#x27;m close to dropping them, and every other service. Months close. The hassle and cost of maintaining 10+ subscriptions is a worse experience than the prenetflix days of broadcast. If the industry could get their act together and go the way of music and pay royalties per stream then Netflix would probably have the biggest advantage with their algorithm. But their ux is still painful and proper discovery is completely lacking. I yearn for a Dewey decimal like video categorisation system, and way more high production value sci-fi shows.')
