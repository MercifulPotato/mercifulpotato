In 20&#x2F;20 hindsight where we now know Sanofi&#x2F;GSK failed hard in their first attempt, and one of of Sputnik V&#x27;s virus vector doses is being tried with AZ&#x2F;Oxford to improve efficacy, it would have been a very good idea to also place a bet on it, and following their business model set up one or more production facilities in the EU.  Although given how AZ&#x2F;Oxford&#x27;s four late in the game EU factories have the very worst productivity of all of their&#x27;s, would not for a while make a difference.')
