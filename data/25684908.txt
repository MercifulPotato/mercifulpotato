The proper way to do cross-browser compat is feature testing, as browsers keep adding more features. Google until recently was distributing a different, inferior (at least IMO) version of Google Search to Android Firefox users, based on user-agent.<p>To detect the OS for download, either JS will have to be used, or the new granular Client Hints[0], specifically User-Agent Client Hints[1]. You can use Sec-CH-UA-Platform and Sec-CH-UA-Arch to figure out the OS and CPU Architecture of the client. However, browsers may refuse to honor this, depending on the privacy budget.<p>Seeing User-Agent go away will be a net positive for web compatibility. That it also improves privacy is just a nice-to-have.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Glossary&#x2F;Client_hints" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Glossary&#x2F;Client_hin...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wicg.github.io&#x2F;ua-client-hints&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wicg.github.io&#x2F;ua-client-hints&#x2F;</a>')
