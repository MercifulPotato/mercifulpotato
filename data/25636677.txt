You could argue that it gives incentives for the rich and powerful to maintain the status quo since their own riches become out of reach from the corrupt government.<p>Meanwhile the commoners are still very much under threat since most of their assets will be physical (their house, their clothes, their belongings, their bodies etc...).<p>The idea that cryptocurrencies are empowering the poor makes about as much sense to me as trickle down economics. If you are in a position to benefit from Bitcoin it means that you already have a significant amount of disposable income you can convert into bitcoin and afford to &quot;HODL&quot; in your wallet for a while. &quot;Being able to transfer money across political boundaries without censorship&quot; is completely irrelevant if you&#x27;re a poor farmer in Buthan or an elderly shoemaker in rural Pakistan. Transfer what money, to whom and for what purpose?<p>This whole concept is just social-washing cryptocurrencies to obfuscate that it&#x27;s profoundly libertarian (the USA flavor) at the core. If you consider that the government is always the enemy and it can&#x27;t be fixed and should instead be thoroughly destroyed, then and only then do cryptocurrencies make sense. It&#x27;s not about good vs. bad government, it&#x27;s about no government.')
