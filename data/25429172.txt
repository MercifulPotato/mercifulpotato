Rich peeps are so much worse for the environment than the poor. Look at what an average Bangladeshi cranks out in CO2-equivalent, water use, landfill contribution and compare that to an average USer.<p>Sure I get that having many children is a multiplier, but even if that average Bangladeshi couple has 4 they still dont contribute as much to environmental destruction as an average US couple without kids.<p>My solution would be (as only picking on someone&#x27;s solution is not nice in a discussion): only tax pollution, scarce resources and stuff that otherwise needs to be disincentivized. Only. So no tax on wholesome behavior like income from labor or housing. And yes: money is a scarce resource (tax the shit out of it over say 5 or 10MM USD). This will rearrange the economy to do good for us all + nature.')
