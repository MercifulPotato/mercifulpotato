It&#x27;s a kind of uncanny valley effect.<p>You can speak to these assistants, but the language is still restricted. They show little to no common sense. It&#x27;s a lot of party tricks bundled together.<p>You can&#x27;t interrupt them and it&#x27;s hard to correct them.<p>On the speech recognition side, an issue I&#x27;ve found (although is a rather niche one) is triggered because I&#x27;m bilingual (I&#x27;m fluent in spanish and english).<p>Speech recognition only works well on a single language.<p>I have Alexa set to speak english, for example when I&#x27;m searching for a song with a spanish title, I have to try to fudge the name into a fake english pronunciation for it to produce the right phonemes that will match the song title, rather than just say the name properly.<p>Also, if it misses the match, there&#x27;s no easy way to stop it and say &quot;No, not that one&quot;, and be presented with a list of similar matches.')
