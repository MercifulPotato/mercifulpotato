Which one is that?<p>My second thought, why not scale that up to 64 vcpus (or even more) and spend less time rendering? I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a balance between cost per second of render time and # vcpus. I haven&#x27;t found it myself, mostly due to not experimenting.<p>When I render my product shots on GCP, I use a 96 vcpu instance and render relatively intensive (due to the higher quality of render and light settings) at print resolution in a minute or two. The cost becoming negligible, the feedback quick, and the strain on my MBP minimal.')
