Is this just about not hearing back about the next step in the interview process or why you didn’t get an offer?<p>I mean I think it’s pretty clear why recruiters would keep their options open up until the last second and limit information sharing.<p>The way to respond to that is to create urgency by having multiple parallel interviews in the pipeline and letting them know your deadlines. This works like magic if you are even a moderately strong candidate. That will have about a infinitely greater effect than sending whiny anonymous emails.')
