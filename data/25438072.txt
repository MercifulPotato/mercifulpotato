Why do you think I never bother getting a personal blog website off the ground? Because the traffic it gets pales in comparison to the audience I get from writing comments. This comment for instance might be seen by several hundred people, all within my target demographic. How many people might see my longform blog content? Maybe dozens if I&#x27;m lucky. I&#x27;ve never really written a meaningful blog post, but I&#x27;ve probably written a novel&#x27;s worth of comments.<p>And because comments aren&#x27;t really written for monetary gains, they are one of purest forms of writing left on the internet today. People still write comments liberally and openly, speaking their mind and even voicing unpopular opinions, because they don&#x27;t give a shit about what Google thinks. Google doesn&#x27;t read comments. Say the quiet parts loudly.<p>Maybe someday there will be an age where you can be certain almost every comment you read is already bought and paid for by some corporate interest or a guerrilla advertiser, but fortunately we are still not there yet.')
