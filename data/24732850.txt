I don&#x27;t understand how this is even a point you&#x27;re confused about, unless you believe in a truly extreme form of cultural relativism.<p>You obviously have an axe to grind against a particular political spectrum, so I will pose a more direct example that does not involve it.<p>Is Russia Today political? Is choosing to display it prominently in a search result political? Is choosing to display a &#x27;this is state sponsored news&#x27; tag on it political?
