I can almost guarantee that on such a big number of people voting that at least some number of votes were stolen, probably by representatives from both parties. What I strongly doubt is the fact that this was widespread, organized or the numbers of these frauds were in any meaningful way impacting the election.<p>The difference between parties was not insignificant. In other election cycles you had much lower differences but the other party conceded to the process ( looking at 2000).<p>So this whole thing is, IMO, predicated on one side simply refusing to admit defeat.')
