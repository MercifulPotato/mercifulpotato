What has happened in the last 75 years is historically new:<p>1. The growth of information&#x2F;knowledge (the Information Age) jobs, which are now the majority of all jobs in the U.S.<p>2. The growth of remote work tools (the jury is out on how productive people are remotely <i>at the moment</i>, but new tech will drive this <i>soon</i> so that you will be just as or almost as effective in your kitchen or local coffee shop)<p>3. The growth of global transportation (the Jet Age) that allows previously localized diseases to spread globally in hours, instead of months or years<p>These factors are <i>new</i> and together likely presage a historic shift in how and where people work.<p>Ironically, except for this market adjustment in larger cities, the ability for people to work <i>productively</i> in other locations will put continuing downward pressure on the cost of living in cities as people leave, and probably hit some sort of equilibrium at some point soon.<p>... all this to mean that you should sell your investment properties in the Tenderloin ;)')
