If I want to persuade others that they should also ignore him then I make my case on the merits.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not taking someone&#x27;s assessment at face value, I read it, considered the sources, considered pg, and am using it to build an understanding of his work.<p>Can you share the basis of that understanding rather than expecting that we would take your assessment at face value?')
