I&#x27;ve skimmed it and am somewhat underwhelmed by both the methods and theory:<p>* All of their regressions are in levels.<p><pre><code>    * Look at Table 1, Column 1. \n\n        * Robotics investment is positively correlated with overall employment. \n\n        * What this tells me is that, &quot;Large companies, by dint of their being large, make large investments. Some of those investments are in robotics. Likewise for small companies.&quot; \n\n        * To me, it has nothing to do with the claim &quot;More robots =&gt; more employment.&quot;\n\n    * Running regressions in first differences would be better (but not enough). \n\n     * Then you could begin to work towards an interpretation like, &quot;companies that _increased_ their investment in robotics in year X tended to increase&#x2F;decrease employment&#x2F;management&#x2F;turnover by X.&quot; You can account for lags and the like via your specification.\n\n     * Fixed effects _are not_ equivelant to first differences in this setup!\n</code></pre>\n* Separate out the long-, medium- and short-term consequences:\n * Investment in new technology may require hiring new &quot;talent&quot; that is knowledgeable of the tech.<p>* In cases where there is a tech shock and firms are all buying the same machine, demand for a certain skillset will grow quickly. So you&#x27;d likely see:<p><pre><code>  * An uptick in turnover among affected workers\n\n  * A move to a &quot;flatter&quot; organizational structure (various reasons). So maybe fewer people who are managers per se.\n\n  * Possibly short-term productvity decreases arising from implementation issues. (e.g. have to hire people to check the work of machine in staging manually while still running previous process.)\n\n * Over time, though:\n\n  * Implementation issues&#x2F;bugs are smoothed out\n\n  * Rare skills are commidified. The need to hire &quot;superstars&quot; ends.\n</code></pre>\n* It is important to ask, &quot;what might have caused investment by a given firm over a given time frame?&quot;<p>* Common industry technological shocks might spur investment.<p>* (And the simplest way to account for technological shocks in this sort of regression you&#x27;d want `[industry] x [year]` fixed effects.)<p>* &quot;We went on a manager hiring spree in year 1. Those managers, in turn, bought a lot of robots in year 2. In year 2 we hired fewer managers because we&#x27;d just hired a bunch in year 1.&quot;<p>* Reverse causation issues are pervasive.<p>* Finally, I think it is important to notice their notion of &quot;robot adoption&quot;:<p>* They are talking about physical hardware _only_.<p>* Their measure of investment is coming only from import data. The set of firms that are going to go through the rigammarole of importing physical hardware is probably raher special: Probably:<p><pre><code>  * Larger\n\n  * Have a high expected ROI from investment\n\n</code></pre>\nAt the very least, this paper needs first-difference regressions and a good instrument that can help to disentangle what might be going on. For the instrument, it might make sense to look into changes in tariff duties over time [1].<p>---<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.tcmediasaffaires.com&#x2F;LAF&#x2F;lacom2019&#x2F;robots.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.tcmediasaffaires.com&#x2F;LAF&#x2F;lacom2019&#x2F;robots.pd...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cbsa-asfc.gc.ca&#x2F;trade-commerce&#x2F;tariff-tarif&#x2F;2020&#x2F;html&#x2F;tblmod-2-eng.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cbsa-asfc.gc.ca&#x2F;trade-commerce&#x2F;tariff-tarif&#x2F;2020&#x2F;htm...</a>')
