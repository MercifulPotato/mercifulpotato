You&#x27;d hijacked it, and your hijacking failed. Go big or go home. The IETF hijacked the OID arc 1.3.6.1 and they succeeded because everybody accepted their control of that arc and it&#x27;s now used everywhere, but if you hijack some namespace and then only use it on a few dozen machines nobody has heard of, that&#x27;s not going to stick.<p>More seriously, what you&#x27;ve done is probably a bad idea. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myprinter.lan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myprinter.lan&#x2F;</a> seems unique to you, and then your new partner moves in, why doesn&#x27;t the printer work? Oh right, his printer is <i>also</i> named myprinter.lan because you don&#x27;t have globally unique namespaces.<p>This happens on a bigger scale at a business or other organisations of course, but it&#x27;s annoying even in one household. Here&#x27;s a metaphorical nickel kid, get yourself a domain in the public DNS hierarchy.')
