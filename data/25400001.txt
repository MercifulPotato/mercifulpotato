He never told me about its ill effects and he didn&#x27;t taper the does till mid of second year. It didn&#x27;t help my Crohns much, just kept it suppressed. I am expecting to die early because of this.<p>So, please don&#x27;t assume the doctor is always right. Do your due diligence. They are fallible just like us, to be honest, I think they are just engineers working on the human body.')
