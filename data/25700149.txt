Instead of explaining Monads like all other design patterns out there, they insist on using some obscure definition from category theory to explain it.<p>The author is bashing people for explaining a concept from Category Theory with... dum dum dum... Category Theory?! Just because OP was looking for articles explaining monads as design patterns doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t other people who, God forbid, are looking for theoretical articles about CT&#x2F;Monads explained with Haskell.<p>Yes, there is value in pragmatism. Rant posts, on the other hand, have little value IMHO. Haskell has shortcomings like any other programming language. That absolutely does not make it a bad programming language.')
