Item(by='mooreds', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609113087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554617, text='&gt; My intent was to encourage others from not thinking &quot;Yeah, I need all this to start a company&quot;.<p>Definitely! when I was first consulting I created all my invoices in OpenOffice doc files, and then emailed them out. I kept track of everything I&#x27;d sent out to clients on a spreadsheet. It was worth it because it was free. I didn&#x27;t have many clients and was just starting out. Wanted to keep my expenses down.<p>However, after a few years I used FreshBooks, which automatically built an invoice for me. I could run reports easily. I could send the invoice. I could even accept payment via credit card.<p>It cost me something (I don&#x27;t remember what it was, but it was under $50&#x2F;month) and saved me so much time. (There are many competitors to FreshBooks and I&#x27;m sure each of them would have done the same.)<p>That&#x27;s the tradeoff. Most things can be done for &quot;free&quot; if you count your time as having zero value. That is very rarely the case. It may be a good idea to minimize $$ out the door as much as possible when you are starting, but in a while (even if it takes you years, like it did for me) you&#x27;ll learn to trade money for time using specialized tools.')
