We make a PostgreSQL-compatible endpoint available to the public to query any of the tens of thousands of open datasets by referencing them as virtual tables: they&#x27;re not hosted by us but we proxy to them using Postgres FDWs. When a query comes in, we intercept it and redirect it to a FDW instance that handles query translation and planning from the PG dialect to that of the backend data source.<p>We wrote an FDW for Socrata-powered [1] government open data portals to query the public datasets that we index in the Splitgraph catalog as a proof-of-concept. However, there are plenty of other FDWs that we&#x27;re working on integrating to let people add their own backend data sources (RDS, Snowflake etc).<p>FDW plugin quality varies (some of them can&#x27;t push down all predicates or JOINs) but it&#x27;s definitely an interesting way to think about accessing data. We also added a lot of scaffolding around foreign data wrappers in our open-source tool [2] that makes it easy to add a FDW-managed data source to a PostgreSQL instance.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splitgraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data-delivery-network-launch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splitgraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data-delivery-network-launch</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tylertech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;socrata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tylertech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;socrata</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splitgraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;foreign-data-wrappers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splitgraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;foreign-data-wrappers</a>')
