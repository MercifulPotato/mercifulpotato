It is not true that &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot; in the sense that is is not a law of the universe, but it sure makes living together a lot more desirable.<p>The <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Is%E2%80%93ought_problem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Is%E2%80%93ought_problem</a> - discovering a cronyism might generate a knee jerk reaction to eliminate it without understanding the full consequences of doing that. The data involved in a problem is practically infinite. Better the devil you know might be exemplified like this: sure, Bob is kind of lazy and he costs you 5k$ to employ him at you textile factory, but outsourcing your production to Asia, even though 1&#x2F;5th of the cost for same productivity, might introduce problems you are not aware of at the time like: child labor, local workers not affording to buy your products any more, the outsourcing company controlling or taking over your business, etc.<p>So just discovering a belief isn&#x27;t an universal truth or that it generates some problems does not necessarily justify destroying it.')
