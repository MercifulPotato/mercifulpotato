Not simply conversion of existing market-sold housing to price controlled, but <i>more</i>.<p>Lets say that everything gets converted to rent-controlled in an area.  A child becomes 18, graduates from high school, and wants to stay close to their family to maintain their emotional connections. If everything is rent-controlled, but not enough housing is built, they have to be on some sort of waitlist or lottery to stay in the area. This will push out so many people.<p>The <i>only</i> solution is to make enough housing for the people that want to live in an area. Without that, we are rationing it by price, by lottery, or by waitlist, and <i>all</i> of those will destroy the emotional connections that both you and I want to maintain.')
