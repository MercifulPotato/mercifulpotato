I suppose tariffs and such would increase that substantially, so that&#x27;s a fair point. My bad. That said, I believe there was discussion about the hypothetical situation where you did want a Mac.<p>More to the point, I checked your post history before I commented, and I gathered you are a developer, somewhere in South America (?). I suspect that the code I write is probably no better than the code you write. But your pay is presumably quite a bit less than mine. My point was that it&#x27;s unfortunate that like work doesn&#x27;t yield like rewards.<p>Now here I am going to make some assumptions... In all likelihood, people are amassing wealth off of your work in the same way they profit from mine. But due to local wage norms, they can pay you less and reap higher margins. They get to upgrade the yacht, but you might not even have enough free time time to use a boat even if you could afford one.<p>It&#x27;s possible that I extrapolated too much and that your situation is nothing like what I have inferred. Sorry in advance if that is the case.')
