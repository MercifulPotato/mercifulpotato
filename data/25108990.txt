Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605510760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108566, text='&gt; Places are doing hard lockdowns and it is working.<p>Russia isn&#x27;t doing &quot;hard&quot; lockdowns. I know because I have relatives there. Schools are open. Airlines are flying. Where there are restrictions, they are pretty mild.<p>For that matter Sweden, which has _no_ lockdowns still has 150 deaths per million <i>less</i> than the United States. Italy, which had severe lockdowns, has a comparable number of deaths per million (from which it follows lockdowns aren&#x27;t &quot;working&quot; as well as you imply unless you catch the spread very early and are able to close the borders a-la NZ).<p>The difference is mostly how deaths are counted, not the CFR per se. If you only count people dying of COVID as a primary cause, you get Russia&#x2F;Iran number. If you count people run over by a bus who also had COVID, you get the US rate. Which one is better is up for debate, the point is you can&#x27;t compare if you don&#x27;t count the same way, nor can you even tell the CFR accurately if you count deaths where COVID was merely present, but did not cause the death per se.')
