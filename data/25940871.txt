It&#x27;s a madness full of Docker impossible things to run and a very long and confusing configuration file.<p>I wonder why can&#x27;t these things be provided as binaries with a simple set of settings.<p>Now they offer Jitsi as a service for free up to 25 users? That&#x27;s great though. It should cover 99% of normal people use cases, so no one will use meet.jit.si anymore.')
