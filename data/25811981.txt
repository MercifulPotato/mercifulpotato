We all look for &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot; to make sense of a narrative, but I come away with the feeling that Ms Jones is not solidly in the former camp. One data point I have for this is the way she tears down others who are doing their best work, for example a very public feud with Emily Oster: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GeoRebekah&#x2F;status&#x2F;1344067350216265729" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GeoRebekah&#x2F;status&#x2F;1344067350216265729</a><p>We have some serious work to do. I&#x27;m very hopeful that we&#x27;re going to have a very solid team at the national leadership level in 3 days, after a year of a vacuum, but I&#x27;m still concerned about state and local levels. I don&#x27;t think these types of personality fights are very helpful.')
