You can &quot;play the game of life as best you can,&quot; (which includes hopefully bettering the lives of others in addition to yourself) but just don&#x27;t let it define you.<p>&quot;In this case, Epictetus said everybody should play the game of life-that the best play it with &quot;skill, fonn, speed and grace.&quot; But like most games, you play it with a ball. Your team devotes all its energies to getting the ball across the line.<p>But after the game, what do you do with the ball? Nobody much cares. It&#x27;s not worth anything. The competition, the game, was the thing. You play the game with care, making sure you are never making the external a part of yourself, but merely lavishing your skill in regard to it.<p>The ball was just &quot;used&quot; to make the game possible, so just roll it under the porch and forget it, let it wait for the next game. Most important of all, just don&#x27;t covet it, don&#x27;t seek it, don&#x27;t set your heart on it. It is this latter route that makes externals dangerous, makes them the route to slavery&quot;')
