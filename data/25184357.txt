I&#x27;ve worked two different jobs with totally different amounts of pressure (one lower pressure and one higher pressure) but I&#x27;ve experienced burnout in both. It&#x27;s not the level of pressure &amp; optimization that leads to burnout, in fact the best periods of my career were at my high pressure job working pretty hard.<p>FWIW there&#x27;s a comment quote that I think really nails burnout perfectly [1]:<p>&gt; Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or effort into high-risk problems that fail. It&#x27;s the result of a negative prediction error in the nucleus accumbens. You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure.<p>&gt; My suggested remedy would be to reassociate work with success by doing routine things such as debugging or code testing that will restore the act of working with the little &quot;pops&quot; of endorphins.<p>&gt; That is not to say that having a healthy life schedule makes burnout less likely (I think it does; and one should have a healthy lifestyle for its own sake) but I don&#x27;t think it addresses the main issue.<p>My 2c is that if you&#x27;re interested in working out &amp; solving your own burnout, this is how you need to understand burnout. There are so many bad and weirdly political interpretations on burnout that basically sell &quot;the solution is to work less&quot; or &quot;the solution is for society to work less&quot;. I want to save you the trouble of discovering that working less doesn&#x27;t actually help you feel more fulfilled and will probably make you even more miserable if you have even a little bit of passion &amp; curiosity &amp; ambition.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5630618" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5630618</a>')
