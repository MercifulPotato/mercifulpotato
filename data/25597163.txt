It must be.  Because the US government, and all of its agencies and military actions, despite a few bad apples in the past, is trustworthy and true to the pure mission of democracy and freedom for all.  And there are never any &quot;means to an end&quot; &quot;ethical compromises&quot; anymore.  Other countries, sure.  But ours?  No, of course we rooted all of that out.  Only the pure of heart survive here.  The pure light of Democracy doesn&#x27;t permit evil or corruption or subversion to survive.<p>And anyone who suggests otherwise and makes a serious allegation against the government or admits a fundamental lack of trust for it, is definitely mentally ill and should be publicly noted as such.<p>&#x2F;s')
