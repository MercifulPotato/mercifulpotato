I&#x27;m arabic native speaker and can provide more details.<p>First the quran was revealed in a span of 23 years. And when dealing with drinking, the quran took a step by step approach. At first, a general warning was given to forbid Muslims from attending prayers while in a\ndrunken state (Quran, 4:43).<p>&quot;O you who believe! Do not approach the prayer while you are drunk, so that you know what you say&quot;<p>Then a later verse was revealed to Prophet Muhammad which\nsaid that while specifically alcohol had some medicinal benefits, the negative effects of it outweighed the good (Quran, 2:219).<p>&quot;They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “There is gross sin in them, and some benefits for people, but their sinfulness outweighs their benefit.”&quot;<p>Finally, “intoxicants and gambling” were called “abominations of Satan’s handiwork,” which\nwarned people with self-consciousness to not turn away from God and forget about prayer,\nand Muslims were ordered to abstain (Quran, 5:90-91).<p>&quot;90: O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and divination are abominations of Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may prosper. 91: Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you not desist?&quot;<p>The Prophet Muhammad also instructed his companions to avoid any intoxicating\nsubstances (paraphrased), “if it intoxicates in a large amount, it is forbidden even in a small\namount.” For this reason, most observant Muslims avoid alcohol in any form, even small\namounts that are sometimes used in cooking.')
