However there already are multiple blockchains and anyone that can watch youtube can sync with all of them if they want to.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s any better, because you&#x27;d either be heavily dependent on intermediary exchange services and be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations<p>This makes zero sense. Anyone can choose whatever combination of whatever they want and most people never touch the normal chain.  This is the reality right now, there are lots of choices, people can use any or all of them. Why would transaction volumes change any of this? This isn&#x27;t a prediction of the future, this something that has already happened years ago.<p>&gt; The problem is that the cost compounds, so comparing the cost to running a refrigerator isn&#x27;t exactly fair.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t.<p>&gt;  On the other hand, running a full node might cost $90&#x2F;year today, but 5 years from now would cost $450 upfront + $90&#x2F;year.<p>That makes absolutely no sense at all.  A full node for every crypto currency can be run on a $35 raspberry pi with a hard drive hooked up by anyone that can watch a youtube video. Your numbers are just a lie, the entire bitcoin chain is 1&#x2F;25th of an 8TB hard drive which can be bought new for $150 USD.<p>&gt; This goes back to the decentralization debate. Needing a huge upfront investment to fully participate in the network is very much anti-decentralization.<p>Then it&#x27;s a good thing that isn&#x27;t true, since most people never touch it and those that do probably don&#x27;t have to spend anything at all.<p>These are lies, there is no truth to what you are saying and you know it.  If there was any validity you would have a better explanation than made up numbers and nothing else.  You are predicting something as if it hasn&#x27;t already been passed by. No amount of circular logic warps reality to what you want it to be. The bigger question is why you are so desperate to convince people that cryptocurrencies can&#x27;t scale.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitinfocharts.com&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;transactions-btc-eth.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitinfocharts.com&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;transactions-btc-eth.ht...</a>')
