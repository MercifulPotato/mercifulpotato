I&#x27;ve moved on from Lua to using tiny virtual machines that run RISC-V instead, and so I choose to use Nim inside the VMs in the hopes that non-technical people will find that easy to grok, somehow. I don&#x27;t have any anecdata to report yet because it&#x27;s still early in the project. But, that&#x27;s the only thing I consider when choosing the language.')
