Seems to confirm OP&#x27;s hunch. Hard to come up with a scenario in which the same script would put that one and all the others up. Didn&#x27;t review all of them but the news clips in trailer videos seem pretty different. Doubt this would be the script erroring out and uploading just the first part.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r6UgjgCSbf8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r6UgjgCSbf8</a>')
