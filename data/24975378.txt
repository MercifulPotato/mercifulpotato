That is, you, as a recipient of the code, are free to ask GitHub to host it, and to offer them a license under the terms of the GPL; GitHub is free to accept or to decline, same as if you sent <i>me</i> the code, I am free to host it on my personal website but I&#x27;m also free to not host it.<p>(It would feel more like violating the spirit if it, say, prevented you from uploading it to a GitLab instance you self-host... but since you self-host it, you could just patch out any suppression code, so that case can&#x27;t come up.)')
