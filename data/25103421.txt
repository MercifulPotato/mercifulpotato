The hardest part of the whole thing is accurately distilling exactly what was causing the failure. And this is also where you the user is the best placed.<p>Mine had to do with Python Datetimes and timezones and after figuring out how to reliably reproduce it with a minimal case I could step through the stack trace and see what the library was doing (not much, just &#x27;adding&#x27; some times together) and could see what might be causing it. (I haven&#x27;t actually got to the bottom of it yet - I had other stuff to do.) But really the hard and time consuming step is that first bit. Of course, like anything it&#x27;s a cost benefit - if it&#x27;ll take weeks to nail it down and fix, vs using something else - then of course, a new approach is needed.')
