Looking back, I think the most impactfull book for me was The Art of Loving (1956) by Erich Fromm because it opened up  a world of psychology and psychoanalysis and significantly altered my view on how humans think.<p>Among the classic fiction the best so far were: T. Dreiser - The Bulwark, S. Maugham - Of Human Bondage, L. Tolstoy - The Kreutzer Sonata and E. Zola - l&#x27;Oeuvre &amp; Germinal.')
