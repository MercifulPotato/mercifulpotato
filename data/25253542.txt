It&#x27;s &quot;shitty&quot; because almost no thought or design went into it. It started as 20-30 lines of code and grew into ~1000. It&#x27;s got hacks, bad decisions, it redoes work like reading files more than ones or reading the files it already wrote.<p>But, it works, it has rare features I need, features that AFAIK most of the famous ones do not and could not be easily added (well, at least when I checked)<p>That said, while it started 100% hand written I did add stuff over the years. For example I had my own templating system but switched to &#x27;handlebars&#x27; at some point. I don&#x27;t actually remember if there was a good reason or not. A long time ago I wanted to add RSS&#x2F;Atom support. Sure that should be easy to do on my own (i&#x27;ve done it in the past) but whatever library I looked into was easy without too many dependencies. The latest, I added jsdom to process a few more automated transformations.<p>The word &quot;shitty&quot; really does describe the code and I&#x27;m embarrassed to show it really but it works and I have better things to do than refactor to make it clean.')
