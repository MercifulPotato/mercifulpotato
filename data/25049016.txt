Most lenders won’t touch RSUs unless you had 2+ years at the same income level and even then they don’t like it. So taking 45% DTI (debt to income) ratio of base + bonus nets $9000 payment (principle + interest + taxes + insurance) and translates into $2mil purchase price assuming the hypothetical person also has $400k downpayment and reserves. That price point gets something like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redfin.com&#x2F;CA&#x2F;Mountain-View&#x2F;2507-Alvin-St-94043&#x2F;home&#x2F;606881" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redfin.com&#x2F;CA&#x2F;Mountain-View&#x2F;2507-Alvin-St-94043&#x2F;...</a>? (3&#x2F;1.5 1500 sqft 5800 sqft lot)<p>Let’s say RSUs take care of savings&#x2F;extras.<p>Schools don’t look great for this house. This is where commute comes into play - you can trade long commute for more house and better schools.<p>Unfortunately, the geographical reality of Bay Area mean that there isn’t a lot of middle ground between short commute&#x2F;lots of cost&#x2F;other trade-offs or very long commute, but better everything else.')
