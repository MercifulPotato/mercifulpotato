Anectodal ofc: I thought about creating something similar - an app that would take my headshot and randomly alter metrics like eye distance and other general ratios etc for use as profile images for various social networks, thinking it might improve recognizability for people I actually know &#x2F; have met.<p>However, I quickly came to the realization that the metrics I&#x27;d try to alter would probably not be sufficient and reveal enough information that the whole thing would be rendered moot.<p>A nice first step to remediate trust (or at least shift trust relationship to other parties) would be for vendors to implement highly restricted sandbox models (i.e. not allowing _any_ network access and restrict&#x2F;alter ways of in- and output, like adding noise and artefacts to image data that can leave the app e.g. via share&#x2F;save to camera roll).')
