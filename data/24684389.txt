Original employer A went to a lot of expensive effort to find a very particular set of qualified engineers that could work together at the same time -- where the sum is much more than the parts.<p>If employer B hires the team already put together perfectly qualified for a similar task roughly all at once... they&#x27;re not just taking advantage of employees&#x27; freedom (which is fine) but literally essentially &quot;stealing&quot; the massive work employer A did to assemble the team piece by piece.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it should be illegal, because I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d write any effective law against it. But when you take a whole team at once, I think the word &quot;poaching&quot; is apt.')
