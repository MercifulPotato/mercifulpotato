Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608152360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445493, text='&gt; I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months.<p>He lists 8 months of study and that before starting the curriculum he was &quot;self-taught&quot; meaning he at least knew how to code and do a little more than &quot;hello world&quot;.<p>If we add his &quot;self-taught&quot; time it gets us pretty close to an actual CS degree. He&#x27;s missing language classes, some electives, math and stats but he&#x27;s mostly there in terms of content. He&#x27;s missing labs, projects, problem sets of course.<p>When viewed like that it doesn&#x27;t sound as clickbaity as the tittle implies, that you don&#x27;t need a degree to go in the field. He&#x27;s just a really really motivated self learner. And almost got a CS degree&#x27;s worth of material.<p>Kinda like Gates &quot;dropping out&quot; a few credits short of getting his diploma, not after failing intro to econ like a lot of &quot;drop out entrepreneurs&quot; out there.')
