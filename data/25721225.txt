I&#x27;m sure not interested in any sort of VR teleconferencing and I don&#x27;t really want Second Life 2.0 either. I do think easier sharing of sketches and the like might be interesting--although that tends to require some commonality of hardware and whiteboards don&#x27;t necessarily scale down to iPad size very well. (Furthermore, just shared docs actually serve a lot of the functions we thought we needed whiteboards for pretty well.)')
