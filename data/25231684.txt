However, if you have a degree in computer science already, it doesn&#x27;t really matter to recruiters if you also have a master&#x27;s degree except for certain specific circumstances. Certainly Georgia Tech and UT Austin are good schools, but they are not top tier schools, so you&#x27;re not going to get the name recognition benefit that you seem to be looking for anyway. If you&#x27;re looking for a top job, what would help more is first getting some work experience, and then getting really good at interview questions.')
