I meant the customer that comes back after their repaired iPhone gets dunked in water and they don&#x27;t have a backup anymore and now it becomes Apple&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot; that they didn&#x27;t keep this customer&#x27;s backup. There&#x27;s way too many variables for that to be feasible when it&#x27;s better to just promote that customers do their own backups and&#x2F;or sell their service to automate it for them.')
