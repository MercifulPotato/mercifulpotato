Couldn&#x27;t see how to do that using ImageMagick, and didn&#x27;t want to write it manually!<p>The high-pass filter maps &quot;look okay&quot;, but i haven&#x27;t looked at their spectrum. How important is it that they have a specific frequency response? What is the failure mode if they don&#x27;t?<p>The shuffling maps don&#x27;t &quot;look&quot; so hot. There aren&#x27;t border artifacts or repeating blocks (and you wouldn&#x27;t expect these a priori - not sure why you think that), but indeed, it&#x27;s not very different to white noise.')
