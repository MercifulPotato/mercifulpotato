Still, I have no idea whether we&#x27;d have fared better in a flu pandemic - maybe the assumption was that we&#x27;d be able to get a vaccine quicker in that case?<p>In any case, it&#x27;s still somewhat unclear why the UK has done so badly with Covid. There are some obvious things the government should have done better - and unless Brexit turns out to be a &quot;titanic success&quot;, I can&#x27;t see how Boris Johnson will remain PM until the next election. But even compared to countries that have implemented weaker measures, slower than we have, or have had their healthcare systems overwhelmed, or struggled with testing - we&#x27;ve suffered much worse. And the reason why is, at this point, unknown.<p>One argument is we have a less healthy population, either due to lifestyle factors or due to having relatively mild previous flu seasons. Another is our dense, poor housing and service economy. Another is travel and weather.  Will be interesting to see what falls out over the analyses over the next few years, and if anything is done to act on the problems (I doubt..).<p>The factor that these preparedness plans can&#x27;t account for who is in charge at the time the disaster hits. We might have technically had the best plans, best scientists, best civil service, best procedures - and then the person in charge refused to listen to them. Like Trump and the CDC. Maybe people will vote for competence over bluster next time around? (I doubt..)')
