Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603593924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24883447, text='You can <i>model</i> it as a spring, but it&#x27;s not a spring in the slinky sense - it&#x27;s just a thin piece of material whose electrical properties are affected by tiny changes in stress&#x2F;strain.<p>Its operation fundamentally involves (near infinitesimal) movements, but then so does a cell phone pole. I don&#x27;t see what we gain with debating its &quot;solid stateness&quot; (especially when hedged with &quot;effectively&quot;). Maybe you could point to some effect that this distinction implies?')
