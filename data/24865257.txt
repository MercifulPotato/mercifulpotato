The really bad outcome is reverse-charging, where one cell is completely drained, then charged to a negative voltage. The probability of an explosion is significant.<p>If the flashlight has a low-voltage shutoff for the series at 2.5V per cell, it would take a series of four before that&#x27;s possible, and even then it&#x27;s pretty improbable. You&#x27;d have to mix a discharged cell with three full cells; a moderate difference in capacity or internal resistance wouldn&#x27;t be enough by itself.<p>It is <i>easily</i> possible to over-discharge a cell under those conditions, after which charging and using it again is risky, but if you&#x27;re salvaging laptop cells you probably already know that.')
