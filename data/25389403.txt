Every COVID bed is a bed that can&#x27;t be used to treat someone who would have otherwise gotten sick or injured, and that person will have to go somewhere. Early on in Washington when the Army was setting up temporary field hospitals, it wasn&#x27;t to handle COVID patients, it was to handle the normal patients who would have otherwise gone to the regular hospital.<p>What&#x27;s messed up about this whole &quot;crisis&quot; is it&#x27;s being framed as an individual choice to wear a mask. People make it sound like wearing a mask protects you somehow. And that&#x27;s simply not true. I think in all this &quot;individual freedom&quot; sabre rattling someone is forgetting that you do not have the freedom to harm someone else. And your choice to not wear a mask is a choice to harm the people around you.<p>So really choosing not to wear a mask is more like choosing to drive drunk, and you won&#x27;t ever know how many people you kill.')
