I was very inspired by this site (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pocketjavascript.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;introducing-pokedex-org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pocketjavascript.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;introducing-pok...</a>) and thought it would make the user experience a lot better by making the site easier to navigate.<p>I preloaded data such that a user could navigate via search or clicking through some drill-down menus without having to wait for a full page refresh. The data would hydrate the views so that the transition time between views was almost always fast, even on slow mobile traffic.<p>One aspect that was very difficult to figure out was incorporating views that would require more data from the server. Once a user drilled down to such a view, the challenge became how to load the view via AJAX without having to make another AJAX call to load more data.<p>The solution was to return server side rendered HTML instead of JSON...<p>Looking at the demo, this seems very similar to some of the things I had to do minus 95% of the hacky Angular&#x2F;PHP code I had to set up.<p>This is a killer feature to have in Rails and I am looking forward to learn more of the conventions that will surround the implementation.')
