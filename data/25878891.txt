If you say you don&#x27;t like it when <i>people</i> do something, you are calling out a behavior. If you say you don&#x27;t like it when <i>men</i> do something, you are (intentionally or not) causing the listener to associate men with that action when they may not have otherwise. You are proposing a negative association for them. It makes no difference how big the group is or how many subgroups there are.<p>There are definitely worse things that people can say about men than &quot;I hate that some men do x&quot;, such as &quot;all men are trash.&quot; (I&#x27;ve actually heard someone acting men should not be offended by this). I&#x27;m more offended by that sort of talk, but I think when people stop being careful about the words they choose, it will easily devolve into the latter.')
