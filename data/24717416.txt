At least, I remember it being there in about 2001.<p>Additionally, the metadata on voting was particularly important for meta-moderation which other platforms don&#x27;t really have. Users were (at random) shown a comment that you&#x27;ve voted on and your vote. They then said whether your vote was fair or not, based on what they see.<p>Stepping back a bit -  the most important difference between the Slashdot system (vs something like Reddit) was that votes were much more limited on Slashdot. Not everyone had modpoints (votes) and you only got a handful at a time.   This allowed meta-moderation to actually have some impact - if you continuously abused modpoints by downvoting someone as troll just because you disagreed with them then you wouldn&#x27;t get banned - just you&#x27;d get less votes in the future. The system was a little opaque and I&#x27;ve not used the site in years but that was my understanding back then, it may have changed since then.<p>While it&#x27;s a bit complex I think the fundamental idea is very good. Ok making a distinction between informative vs insightful never seemed that useful to me, but certainly allowing people to hide &quot;Funny&quot; content definitely has value because funny one liners tend to crowd out other content by sheer volume.')
