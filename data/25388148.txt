Incidents like this tell a lot about internal culture. Things in highbays aren&#x27;t supposed to fall over just like that, that sort of accident could have cost a life and certainly has lost the company money and set it back a few months. Safety is very clearly an afterthought at the Starship site. You can&#x27;t have that in rocketry. They want to go to Mars and can&#x27;t even get out of the assembly building in one piece!<p>Starship is basic engineering in metal. The thing sat there and just fell over. There wasn&#x27;t even any kind of load on it. That takes some effort!')
