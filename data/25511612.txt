The pronunciation of something is secondary to its definition. But with a phonetic language, it&#x27;s easy to fool yourself as well as others of an understanding that is not very deep.<p>I remember once in middle school I elicited a laugh from my classmates when during group reading, I mispronounced &quot;awry&quot; (I had put the stress on the wrong syllable as well as pronounced the &quot;y&quot; as &quot;ee&quot;). However, I had a very good idea of what it meant at that time. OTOH, in that same class, it was a very unusual occurence for the teacher to interrupt group reading and confirm everyone knew what a word meant, so I believe many misunderstood words were glossed over routinely.<p>I&#x27;m not saying being phonetic is a net loss, of course, just that &quot;understanding&quot; is a tricky thing to gauge, and may be harder as a side effect of some language being phonetic.')
