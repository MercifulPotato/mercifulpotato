Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607015451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286177, text='This sounds like you&#x27;re saying &quot;Let&#x27;s make this change, because we don&#x27;t have any evidence that it will bite us.&quot;  Given that the evidence would show up <i>after</i> the change, that seems rather short-sighted.<p>But if you want evidence, I would cite the lawsuit climate in the US.  If it smells like money, there will be a lawyer willing to come up with a case, no matter how far-fetched or unrealistic.  I&#x27;ve seen too many examples of that over the years.  (If you want specifics, the one I&#x27;m most familiar with is <i>SCO v IBM</i>.)<p>So if you make this change, I say there is enough evidence to believe that some lawyer will decide there&#x27;s money to be made finding &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;discriminator speech&quot; or something on HN, and suing YCombinator for it.  (Because even if HN per se doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money, YCombinator does.)  And if that happens, that&#x27;s probably the end of HN.')
