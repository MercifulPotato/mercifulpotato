Which isn&#x27;t to say that it applies here. Simply pointing out that stripping out context can lead to false equivalences is lazy, it needs to be shown.<p>Well, the key part is that the Axis was centered on the imperial ambitions of a a famous genocidal dictatorship that you&#x27;ve probably heard of.  There&#x27;s pretty much a unanimous consensus that that dictatorship was very, very bad and its allies were not much better.<p>Regarding the recent violence, here the context:<p>1. BLM is mainly against the police&#x27;s pattern disproportionate killing of black people, often unarmed, and racism in general.  While there had been looting and rioting, it&#x27;s worth noting that from the very beginning there&#x27;s evidence that these protests were actually infiltrated by violent agitators with other aims (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcchicago.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;illinois-man-accused-of-handing-out-explosives-at-minneapolis-protest&#x2F;2282034&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcchicago.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;illinois-man-accused-o...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;23&#x2F;texas-boogaloo-boi-minneapolis-police-building-george-floyd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;23&#x2F;texas-boogaloo...</a>).<p>2. The capitol attack was literally against the results of a free and fair election, and deliberately attacked some of the actual institutions of American democracy.  There&#x27;s also no evidence of infiltration, though such claims are now being made to deflect blame.  And the riots often loudly expressed violent aims (e.g. erecting a literal gallows and chanting &quot;Hang Mike Pence&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;hang-mike-pence-chant-capitol-riot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;hang-mike-pence-chant-capi...</a>).')
