But like it or not, HN is the newspaper of our time. For many of us, anyway. So stuff like this tends to percolate in unexpected ways. And as a hiring manager, you get no feedback when people decide not to apply to your company, so it&#x27;s probably better not to kill your hiring momentum.<p>If it seems absurd that anyone would turn down a job at DeepMind, well... Let&#x27;s just say, in my experience, prestigious institutions tend to come with a pile of downsides that everyone puts up with (because prestige) but no one really talks about (because no reason).

(b) was painful but possibly worthwhile, with arxiv serving as a bucket to catch everything else. Why roll your own internal review process? And why is Google trying to micromanage what researchers are allowed to publish?<p>I know we&#x27;re probably missing a lot of the story. But on the other hand, Jeff has now given an official side of that story, so it&#x27;s not like they didn&#x27;t have a chance to set expectations.')
