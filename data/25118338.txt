I&#x27;m all for improving technology and efficiency and believe that it will never truly be a life threatening issue and it&#x27;s foolish to sit around and be afraid of it. You say it&#x27;s going to be my problem but how? What would that look like exactly? Maybe in 1000 years it would literally be a problem but by then through the natural course of technological evolution it will just not be a problem. If freeman dyson, a man who solved some of the hardest problems of the 20th century, can say that there is little scientific rogor in our models, estimation and understanding of our affect on climate change, why should I pretend like you know what you&#x27;re talking about?')
