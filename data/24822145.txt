There isn&#x27;t currently any serious attempt at an arms race taking place there as far as I can tell. It&#x27;s agent doesn&#x27;t look <i>anything</i> like a regular browser and the way it hits their backend is <i>nowhere near</i> the way the official js player does, yet it continues to work for me.<p>If an arms race ever did take place my money is (sadly) 100% on Google. Just look at the level of automated obfuscation Snapchat employs. You could reasonably expect the equivalent of a WASM based video player compiled with a custom equivalent to OLLVM, communicating with a procedurally generated API, and updated versions of API and player automatically rolled out hourly with a small overlap (equivalent to certificate renewal).<p>(Something vaguely resembling the above is already employed for the reCAPTCHA check boxes IIUC.)')
