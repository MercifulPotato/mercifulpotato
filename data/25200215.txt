The cable you need for 50 Mb&#x2F;s costs exactly the same whether you use it 2 hours per day or 20. Anyone downloading 100 TB in a month is already paying a hefty premium for the (at bare minimum) 370 Mb&#x2F;s they need to achieve that download.<p>For electricity, in part you are paying for the infrastructure, but you are also paying for the fuel that&#x27;s being consumed by the powerplant. If comcast charged per GB of data that it hosted, that would be fine (and hosting providers do exactly that without complaint), but Comcast&#x27;s costs don&#x27;t vary with the amount you download.<p>In the extreme, costs do scale to some degree with duty cycle - a line with lower capacity can service more people so long as they don&#x27;t use it at the same time, and technically sending a packet through causes some infinitesimally tiny wear and tear. In practice though, a data cap doesn&#x27;t stop multiple people from doing their 1.2 TB download all at the same time, and the reduced lifetime of components is a rounding error compared to the variability just from their manufacture.')
