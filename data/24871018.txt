It&#x27;s like saying that %99 of StartUps fail but that stat is meaningless to the individual startups(meaningful to govt &amp; investors that will have to deal with 100s or more startups).<p>From subjects perspective, their own startup have %100 chance of success and Trump has %100 chance of winning.<p>Maybe these &quot;chance of winning&quot; statistics should be compiled by examining the roadblocks to the success.')
