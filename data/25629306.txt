But this doesn&#x27;t prove that Europe is more or less equal than the US. The US has only existed for ~2 centuries. In 1870 the US surpassed the UK to become the world&#x27;s largest economy, and remains so. So there&#x27;s only been 2 centuries or less for dynastic wealth to form in the US, as opposed to ~10 centuries in Europe.')
