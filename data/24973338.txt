I haven&#x27;t tried the Bernanke (sounds like it&#x27;s popular among left-handed folks) but I have a bottle of American Eel. It&#x27;s just me, but I like really black inks. Noodler inks while quick drying aren&#x27;t black enough for me. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch and finally landed on Rohrer &amp; Klingner&#x27;s Leipziger Schwartz. Thanks for the tip on TruRed. I have several Platinum Preppy Fines but results are still a little less fine than the Hi-Tec-C 0.3mm (likely due to higher inkflow).')
