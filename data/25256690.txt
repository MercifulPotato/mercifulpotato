They approximated a solution to protein folding.<p>The two are different concepts -- this isn&#x27;t the typical HN pedantry.<p>&quot;Solving&quot; the problem would entail developing an interpretable algorithm for taking a string of amino acids and determining the 3D structure once folded.<p>Approximating a solution would entail simulating that algorithm, which is what their neural network is doing. It is of course usually accurate, but you would expect this with any suitable universal function approximator.<p>Props to DeepMind and congrats to CASP but is it not obvious that this is more hype-rhetoric for public consumption?')
