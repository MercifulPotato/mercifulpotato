People in Florida, where the government was very slow, locked down roughly the same time as the people in New York, where the government was very quick.<p>Under this lens, you can look at the government&#x27;s response to COVID 19 as not a response to the pandemic, but a response to <i>people&#x27;s response</i> to the pandemic.')
