Tesla uses a Tesla proprietary plug in USA, and now a CCS-Type2 combo in Europe, which is the standard.<p>Even though the plug is standard, you actually can&#x27;t charge a non Tesla on a Tesla charger because the charger only accepts Tesla. Recently it has been possible to charge cars from other brands for free during a few days in Germany, some say it was a bug, some other say it was a trial.<p>Also unless it has changed recently, in the Tesla ecosystem the car is connected to internet and reporting the consumption to the paiement system, not the charger. This is not standard and Tesla would have to put some 4G&#x2F;5G network equipment in their chargers if they have to support cars from other brands.<p>They may be required at some point in Europe.<p>The Nissan Leaf uses a Chademo plug which is another standard, more common in Japan and it&#x27;s very unlikely to charge on a Tesla charger ever, unless someone hacks an adapter.')
