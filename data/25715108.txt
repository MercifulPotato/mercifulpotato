They should protect them from harm, so laying an actual trap (or just not warning about a potential danger) so that a student gets hurt would be in violation of the teacher&#x27;s duty. But giving your students a test to make sure they&#x27;re actually studying is such a common (and common-sense) expression of distrust that I&#x27;d be surprised if it were illegal to not expect good faith from their students.<p>Relevant: ยง2 LehrErzVDBest <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;lehrerzvdbest_1&#x2F;DDNR000190966.html#DDNR000190966BJNG000100307" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;lehrerzvdbest_1&#x2F;DDNR00019...</a> (Former GDR law that was kept in force after reunification.
