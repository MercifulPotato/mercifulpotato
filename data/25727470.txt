Item(by='pdimitar', descendants=None, kids=[25727522], score=None, time=1610363992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727405, text='I would consider it... if I ever see any other criticism in HN besides &quot;they don&#x27;t have massively peer- and pro-reviewed encryption&quot; and very childish snark with zero facts interspersed.<p>What&#x27;s this &quot;Telegram behaviour&quot;? Seriously, enlighten me -- this is not a snark. I&#x27;ve been following HN Telegram threads for a long time and I&#x27;ve only seen the two things I mentioned above.<p>It&#x27;s really puzzling, especially in a world where a ton of very public and everyday software has much more flaws than Telegram. The whole very directed and non-HN-esque hate towards it does stands out.')
