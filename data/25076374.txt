I&#x27;ll also be 40 this year. Getting through to the offer stages of the process has become impossible for me today, despite how well the phone screens, zoom calls, take-home tests, and technical interviews have gone. To be fair, I&#x27;m not actively seeking employment but I have had about a dozen job opportunities land on my lap this year that I have not outright rejected. I&#x27;m in the process of interviewing for yet another company. Like many of the others, I was recommended for the position internally by a former colleague but I assume it will go the same as the others.')
