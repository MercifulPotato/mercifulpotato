Since &quot;most&quot; people are prone to a fall while taking a shower, my company also mandatorily installs a camera alongside, so that we can monitor for accidents, given our deep concern for our customers.<p>&quot;Some&quot; customers have raised concerns about their privacy, but this is for the greater good. My company is very ethical in its practices, and really values each customer&#x27;s privacy (pinky promise).<p>The footage of you and your loved ones showering is completely safe with us, although you can choose not to be recorded while showering by not purchasing our products.<p>Oh by the way, our showerheads are sleeker and more convenient than anything else in the market.')
