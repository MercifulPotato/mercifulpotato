They don&#x27;t have to do so sustainably either.<p>one could reasonably argue otherwise. let&#x27;s take the example of toilet paper in the early weeks of quarantine. with or without the action of scalpers, such a massive shift in demand was going to cause toilet paper to go out of stock regardless. without scalpers, you are shit out of luck when this happens (perhaps literally). with scalpers, you at least have the ability to buy it at an eye-watering price. even before you run out, knowing that you have to pay $20&#x2F;roll is a strong signal that you ought to use one or two squares per wipe instead of 3+.')
