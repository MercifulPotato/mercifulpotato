Backups of my computers (which could potentially compromise credentials) are encrypted before they go on the NAS, and if I needed to sync anything sensitive it would be encrypted locally.<p>Using my NAS for sharing photos and files with family&#x2F;friends opens up security holes that encryption at rest wouldn&#x27;t help with, and I accept the tradeoff of potentially leaking data. What is less acceptable to me is any risk of data loss.')
