After I was done extracting them and storing them on Dropbox, I tried to delete the zip files, but my machine froze without so much of a bluescreen. After a hard reboot, I could reproduce the behavior. I can still change the focus of apps, but everything that requires the ssd to do anything is waiting for i&#x2F;o until the system freezes completely.<p>Unplugging the notebook seems to help, sometimes, but I can&#x27;t make this work coherently at the moment.<p>Until this post I thought my SSD (Samsung Evo 970 Plus) was faulty, despite working perfectly for everything else.')
