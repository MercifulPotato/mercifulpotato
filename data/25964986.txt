Also why do they have to be broken up to be regulated by the government?  Laws shouldn&#x27;t apply to extremely specific situations or single entities.  If you are really worried about scale and power, you actually have a long list of companies to go through before you even get to Facebook.<p>So break them up, how?  In what way?  And if you&#x27;ve broken them up, how have you ensured that you&#x27;ve actually solved the problem you intend to solve.')
