Code, notes etc. It makes me feel like a hacker from a Neal Stephenson novel, or cyperpunk film. It&#x27;s fun.<p>If I&#x27;m working on a coding project, especially in a statically-typed language, hacker text editors are hard to justify compared to a Jetbrains IDE: The latter have a powerful understanding of the language you&#x27;re using, and use it to catch errors and suggest things as you type, refactor, jump to definitions etc. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any plugin combination for VIM, emacs etc that&#x27;s on Jetbrains&#x27; level of language integration.')
