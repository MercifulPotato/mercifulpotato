It goes in painstaking detail about every single minutia you could possibly be thinking of, often formally proving things that everyone with even a modicum of mathematical education should be able to independently come up with a proof for (<i>white path theorem</i>, anyone?).<p>All of that is great for beginners (there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s a standard textbooks), but I remember that even when I was in school I found it a little too verbose and used to prefer the Sedgewick.<p>With that said, I still agree that the author&#x27;s timetable is <i>very</i> optimistic.')
