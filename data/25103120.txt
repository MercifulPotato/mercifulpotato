The former welcome your work because there is (usually) a monetization path for it and your bugreport actually IS a bugreport (what is the intended behavior, what is the actual behavior, how can the bug be triggered). The later ones typically get swamped with &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work, fix it!&quot; which then turns into a game of twenty questions and the conclusion that the user was doing something stupid(TM).<p>Also, seeing your nickname, I&#x27;d like to mention &quot;Medienkompetenz√ºbung&quot;: The point of the article is not about not accepting bug reports, but support requests being disguised as bug reports in order to bypass the fee, to a point where the abuse greatly outweighted the benefits. The logical conclusion: shut the channel down at the risk of loosing some value. I believe, you have a similar policy with the killfile for your blog.')
