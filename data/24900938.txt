Never trust when someone says they are absolutely not racist - it&#x27;s something we all struggle with because of our shared conditioning.<p>A Dean saying they are racist and a &quot;gatekeeper of white supremacy&quot; is just acknowledging that through the power of their position, thet exercise a system  that furthers white privilege.<p>If anything, that Dean should be applauded for confronting and acknowledging their own role in racist systems.<p>All the same, I can acknowledge that part of me becomes somewhat racist when walking through a less white part of town at night (and I&#x27;m not white).')
