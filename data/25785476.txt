Item(by='kergonath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610672175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782843, text='Le petit prince, although understandable by children, evokes deep philosophical ideas and a subtle sense of humour and can also be a great experience for adults. The language is beautiful and would really shine in a good audiobook.<p>&gt; hopefully _Lupin_: it’s brand new, I haven’t watched it yet but friends say it’s great. It seems to have a wide variety of contemporary accents, fast paced dialogue so not for the early learner.<p>Yes, Lupin is great for that. The accents are not too heavy and the text, though not high literature, is not too dumb (often a problem with series, to be honest). The language is contemporary with a bit of slang but nothing outlandish that I recall. Also, the American accents of the dubbed version are completely out of character so the French audio is the way to go anyway.')
