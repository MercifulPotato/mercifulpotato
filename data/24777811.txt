It&#x27;s slightly more prone to breaks but it creates a less vulnerable runtime app env.<p>&gt; Do not use ‘latest’ tag for base image<p>Depends on the org but sometimes pinning means that you will likely end up using and end-of-life image because it requires proactive work to maintain. If you leave it as &#x27;latest&#x27; this won&#x27;t happen but you will get out-of-band breaks to keep that working. Choose wisely.<p>A few things I would add too:<p>- Don&#x27;t mount Docker socket into <i>any</i> container unless absolutely necessary<p>- Your biggest security threat will be from your app&#x27;s dependencies, not the container&#x27;s setup<p>- Do not run a full init system unless absolutely necessary as this is just a security disaster waiting to happen. There are valid use cases for it but they&#x27;re rare.')
