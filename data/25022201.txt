It&#x27;s not cool, but if we claim that all those choosing that direction are endorsing Trump, we&#x27;re saying that there&#x27;s no democratic choice whatsoever for those that recognize his failures.<p>In my opinion, there is something wrong with the two-party system much more so than there is something wrong with &quot;republicans&quot;.')
