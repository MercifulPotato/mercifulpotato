When I was in grad school I was playing with assembly language to click a speaker in a timed loop, such that it would generate A440.<p>I played it to my coworker who was working in my lab, and he said: &quot;I&#x27;m a singer and I have perfect pitch.  THat isn&#x27;t A440, it&#x27;s slightly low.  Probably one hertz.&quot;<p>I checked my code and indeed, I had miscomputed the timer, it was slightly longer than it should have been.  Fixed the code and he confirmed it sounded better, but not absolutely perfect.')
