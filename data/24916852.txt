For example, I might break a large switch statement up into “sets” of handlers.<p>The main motivation for this, is because I use what I call “evolutionary design.” I tend to refine design as I progress through development, as opposed to having it substantially complete at the start (A lot of classic developers probably just defecated masonry at the very thought of that, but it WFM). Having a finer granularity goes a long way, in supporting this methodology.<p>It also helps a lot for refactoring, improvements, and testing. The overall quality of my products is drastically enhanced by modularity.')
