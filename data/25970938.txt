There is no such thing as “creating” a short squeeze. There is just a buying strategy based on hard work of appraising the fundamentals and speculating correctly, and you are perfectly free to tell others you plan to do that and coordinate with them.<p>Calling anything the retail &#x2F; WSB investor crowd did in this  scenario “manipulation” is ridiculous and insulting. “Coordinating” by explaining a strategy and inviting others to participate is not “manipulation.”')
