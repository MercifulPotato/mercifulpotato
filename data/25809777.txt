I&#x27;m free to examine it and build an exact replica. I can give my chair to whomever I want and let any number of strangers sit on it. Such is the nature of property.<p>If you sell me a song, I must keep it in your proprietary system, leave the DRM intact, and definitely never even think about remixing it and selling my derived works.<p>IP is not property, it&#x27;s a distinct beast of its own. It can&#x27;t be &quot;stolen&quot; in the traditional sense, and it seems it can&#x27;t really be bought or sold either.')
