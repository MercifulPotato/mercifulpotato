Why not both? My team is kicking around the idea of being on-site one day every week or two. We have noticed an increased productivity while working from home yet there are things we miss working together. My employer is paying attention and realizing they can significantly reduce their office expenses while providing a space for teams to meet periodically.<p>My employer is also realizing you don&#x27;t have to rely exclusively on local talent. For practical purposes if you&#x27;re meeting every week or two then you still have to live in the same region. For example, one of the guys on my team just bought a house that&#x27;s 2-2.5 hours away from the office. If he has to make that trip once every other week then it&#x27;s not bad. Given that traffic congestion has dramatically decreased that 2-2.5 hours provides you with considerable range and options with where to live. Yet you still get to interact with your team face-to-face every other week. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds - I think.<p>Is this a scenario you guys have been thinking about?')
