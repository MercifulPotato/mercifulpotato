There are multiple ways to integrate Python and C, depending on exactly what you want to do. The simplest is to use ctypes, which <i>almost</i> reduces calling C APIs in a DLL&#x2F;SO to calling a function to load the shared library and then calling the APIs like any other function.<p>The most obvious practical limitation is that ctypes can only infer so much about the required parameter and return types of the C functions from how you call them, so you have to specify the types explicitly in your Python code in any other case. That&#x27;s no harder than writing a C header file, though, and I expect there is probably a tool somewhere that would automatically generate the corresponding Python&#x2F;ctypes code for the common use cases.<p>There are a few other warts that aren&#x27;t quite as intrusive, including some restrictions relating to pointers and some verbose marshalling if you&#x27;re passing strings around. But overall, it&#x27;s a very convenient way to call out to C-style APIs from Python code that probably covers 95+% of practical use cases with only minor inconvenience compared to what you&#x27;d have written doing everything in either language on its own.')
