I&#x27;m a big fan.)<p>Anyway, while reducing risk this way is laudable, and will improve your fleet&#x27;s health, as per TFA it&#x27;s a poor substitute, with bad economics and worse politics behind it, than simply stumping up for ECC.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that, for example, Google&#x27;s sitting on ~3 million servers so that ~4k LoC just blew out to 12,000,000,000 LoC -- and that&#x27;s for the hypervisors only.<p>Multiply that out by ~50 to include VM&#x27;s microkernels, and the amount of memory you&#x27;ve now got that is highly susceptible to undetected bit-flips is well into the mind-blowing range.')
