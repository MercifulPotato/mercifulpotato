I feel like Satya brought in fresh eyes to the &quot;project&quot; (that being the running of the office of the CEO of Microsoft). Microsoft was locked into a certain way of doing things, and with Satya, they were free to pop their head up and look around at how the world was evolving without them. And you can see how that led them directly into bold new areas, such as WSL, Azure as it is today (highly Linux-and-kubernetes-focused), Github, Linkedin, lots of gaming companies (Mojang, Havok, etc.). It also allowed them to question areas where Microsoft probably thought it &quot;should be winning&quot;, but just wasn&#x27;t working, and might have poured billions into, such as Nokia phones, Skype, Bing, etc.')
