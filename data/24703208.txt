A ring part that you place the shaft and balls through. Then the container that when placed over the shaft and locked to the ring leaves a gap the balls can no longer get through. Thus it is attached until the lock is released and the ring and container are separated again.<p>It&#x27;s a chastity device so the point is that when it&#x27;s on you can&#x27;t actually do anything sexual with the contained bits (or maybe it&#x27;s painful if aroused and some get off on that). The secondary sexual goals are any emotional arousal from fear&#x2F;trust&#x2F;control&#x2F;submission&#x2F;etc.')
