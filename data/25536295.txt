More landfill, for no reason.<p>Real users <i>hate</i> this experience and are relieved when you tell them that some device they&#x27;re getting doesn&#x27;t &quot;need drivers&quot;. Of course it <i>does</i> actually need drivers, it just uses the OS vendor&#x27;s class drivers, which work out of the box and are properly maintained, but the user experience is of relief.')
