In recent years, Twitter started to block public proxies and Tor aggressively, if an IP address is rate-limited, all accesses are denied. Worse, because of JavaScript, it only denies access after the script has given up after spending 60 seconds. And even when I&#x27;m not blocked, the script is still slow, and if you accidentally refreshed the page while in the middle of an endless scrolling, you&#x27;ll have to try again. Nitter.net solves all the problems at once. I don&#x27;t use Twitter but I do maintain a list of people in tech, which I check from time to time.')
