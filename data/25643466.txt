Item(by='saberdancer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609835877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643177, text='Isn&#x27;t the instruction in fact to limit resuscitation efforts to in field? To take it to an extreme, if someone collapses and has a heart attack near a hospital, by this instruction they would have to revive the person (get a pulse&#x2F;breathing) before transporting them to a hospital.<p>It sounds very different to what normal procedure would be. I am assuming that usually they try to get the pulse back but that they can continue to do that while in the ambulance (at least that&#x27;s how it works in the movies). This change would limit that.')
