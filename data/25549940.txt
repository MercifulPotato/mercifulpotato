That profiling is usually of poor quality. I&#x27;ve actually never seen a targeted ad that interests me, they are usually just trying to sell me something I&#x27;ve already looked at or even bought (re-targeting). From an advertiser standpoint I&#x27;m pretty certain that they are an absolute waste of money. In G̶e̶r̶m̶a̶n̶y̶ the Netherlands (following the GDRP) some publishers have switched to the old model of direct-sold ads where advertisers bid on placement next to relevant content instead of bidding on users. That has increased publisher ad revenue and those ads actually get more clicks.')
