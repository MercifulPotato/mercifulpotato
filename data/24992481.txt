Kettle uses deep learning and proprietary algorithms to reshape the reinsurance industry and better protect people from the growing risks associated with climate change. Kettle’s first product protects Californians’ businesses, homes, and livelihoods with wildfire reinsurance. To learn more, visit ourkettle.com<p>You probably have never heard of the $300bn reinsurance industry, but it is the single most important industry in the world to protect ourselves and help society recover from the effects of climate change disasters. This industry is failing due to a 3x increase in $1B+ crises caused by climate change. Kettle’s aim is to use deep learning to ensure that people’s lives are not destroyed when these events happen. By building the most sophisticated machine learning models to predict when and where wildfires happen, Kettle accurately prices the cost of covering wildfire prone areas in California. We are a machine-learning-powered reinsurer, in that we sell reinsurance to insurers, we don&#x27;t sell software to reinsurers.<p>The Role<p>We are looking for a passionate Data Scientist to join our team and work with a growing team of engineers, deep learning experts, and other data scientists to model risk using the most advanced tools available,<p>Role Primary Responsibilities<p>Develop new climate risk estimation methods at the forefront of science and technology\nImprove Kettle’s existing algorithms to extract data from satellites, sensors, and other data sources\nExplore and validate new data sources that improves the performance of Kettle’s current system\nTest and improve components of Kettle’s machine learning wildfire models\nExpand and scale Kettle’s system to other perils such as wind and flood\nHelp build out advanced financial and quantitative models of balancing risk portfolios and understanding volatility&#x2F;return profiles of our risk')
