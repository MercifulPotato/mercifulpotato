There are many elites in Thailand that don&#x27;t like him. Thai elites only like his father! The current king&#x27;s behaviour does not spark joy (does not serve their cultural value whatever). I&#x27;m quite sure there are more people in Thailand than in Germany who like to criticize the king (and they&#x27;ve been gossiping for many decades!, he does not like these gossip .. he can&#x27;t throw these elites in jail easily, too much damange)<p>- Bavaria is nicer than Bangkok apparently since he like riding bikes .. nicer nature than bangkok.<p>- He likes power, money, women, but he does not like anything that interfere his private life! In thailand, he has to do lots of ceremonies, it&#x27;s annoying.')
