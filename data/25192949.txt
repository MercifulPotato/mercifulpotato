Hybrid HV wiring has a conductive sheath around the actual wiring, separated by non conductive layers. The purpose of this is that when your tool cuts such wiring, it shorts the sheath first and trips a breaker, so that you should be able to cut.<p>There&#x27;s a group near here (WA state) that does demos including &quot;throwing&quot; (dropping) battery packs into wading pools while still supplying power, and cutting HV cables on running hybrids to demonstrate this.<p>But then again, there&#x27;s near zero reason to do so. Stabilize the vehicle, kill the 12V. Our general go-to? Put the hazard lights on. If you stop the hazards, the vehicle is &quot;generally electrically safe&quot;.<p>Biggest risk that isn&#x27;t often talked about? HID headlights. Picture being up against the frame of the car. Regular headlights, bulb broken, possibly? Pretty low risk. Broken headlight, and behind it is a high voltage arc? That&#x27;s a very real electrocution hazard.')
