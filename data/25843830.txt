The first one (&quot;using automated scripts to look through her messages&quot;) says nothing about downloading at all; the second, official one, says that &quot;thousands of files&quot; were &quot;shared with multiple external accounts.&quot; The allegation is clearly that the researcher wrote scripts to select (an apparently large number of) specific messages and forwarded those messages to people outside the company.<p>Nobody is saying &quot;OMG SHE USED IMAP!&quot;. They&#x27;re saying &quot;She sent internal corporate emails to people outside the corporation.&quot;')
