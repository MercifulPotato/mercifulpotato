I&#x27;m sure they think I&#x27;m an idiot, but I&#x27;m completely serious. You can&#x27;t learn what it takes to get a good publication until you&#x27;ve had some rejections. It&#x27;s all part of the learning process.<p>I think that&#x27;s the real message here. Be prolific in activities that can teach you something useful. Just pumping out a load of garbage won&#x27;t help you any more than practicing bad shooting form will make you a good basketball player.')
