Example: If the second replica fails to store it, then the first replica will still have the data and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way that it will be removed. This might end up &quot;leaking&quot; storage. Also, if you then attempt to do a rebuild it seems to me that the file will be revived.<p>&gt; All in all I believe it does quite a lot for less than 1000 lines already.<p>Oh sure. I wasn&#x27;t trying to be negative. I think it&#x27;s great that people play around with these ideas! Distributed systems are complicated beast, and there&#x27;s only so much you can do in 1000 lines.<p>Another thing I realized: It buffers all received values in-memory in the master server. You might need quite a lot of memory if you intend handle uploads of big files in parallel.')
