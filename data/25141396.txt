C assumes word size, Macro functioning and the libraries are all radically different, it wouldn&#x27;t even compile.  C is definitely not portable.<p>I had some Pascal code from 1994, when 16&#x2F;32 bits ruled the world, I compiled&#x2F;ran it in 64 bit glory, I did have to take out the one assembly optimization I wrote back then.<p>If there were Lazarus&#x2F;Free Pascal for the new Apple Silicon, I have no doubt that code would work there as well, with zero changes.')
