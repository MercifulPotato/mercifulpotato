But faced with reviewing and watching actual shows&#x2F;movies, true intent is never uncovered (unless the director admits to it). You can get cases where a person enjoys a film and another dislikes how they were &#x27;manipulated&#x27;.<p>Take a example of a clueless director putting rise of the valkeryies on a chopper scene in his movie without knowing about the scene in &#x27;apocalyse now&#x27;. He knows the song as certain qualities to it and his intent is to bring these emotions across.

Is the director being clumsily formulaic (common with many netflix shows now) or does it fit coherently as a work.')
