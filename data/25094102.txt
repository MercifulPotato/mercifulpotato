Item(by='libraryofbabel', descendants=None, kids=[25094848, 25094323], score=None, time=1605376847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093394, text='Chandrashekar&#x27;s book is a wonderful labor of love by a brilliant Physicist, but it&#x27;s really a <i>translation</i> of the Principia into modern physics and mathematics, with little attention paid to historical context.<p>To understand the book (and Newton) on their own terms, you have to go to the historians of science. I&#x27;d recommend pairing Chandrashekar with I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman&#x27;s translation of <i>The Principia</i>, I. Bernard Cohen&#x27;s, <i>A Guide to Newtonâ€™s Principia</i>, Robert Westfall&#x27;s biography <i>Never at Rest</i>, and the more recent synthesis of Newton scholarship, <i>The Cambridge Companion to Newton</i>.<p>Oh, and if you <i>really</i> want to understand Newton and his view of the universe, you have to dip into his alchemy and theology. Historians have known for a long time that Newton spent far more time on alchemy and theology than he did on mathematics&#x2F;physics, but it still comes as a surprise to most people not in the field. (Although, if you&#x27;ve read Neal Stephenson&#x27;s <i>The Baroque Cycle</i>, you probably have some idea.) A <i>ton</i> of work has been done on these areas in the last 30 years. See for example, <i>The Chymistry of Isaac Newton</i> project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu&#x2F;newton&#x2F;project&#x2F;about.do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu&#x2F;newton&#x2F;project&#x2F;about.do</a>), and <i>The Newton Project</i> (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk&#x2F;view&#x2F;contexts&#x2F;CNTX00001" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk&#x2F;view&#x2F;contexts&#x2F;CNTX00001</a>)')
