Nobody is around. Nobody is even using the all that light! Driving at night would be dangerous without light of course, but that&#x27;s why they have headlights. Those lights are burning all night long and they&#x27;re not even doing anything.<p>People seem to abhor silence and emptiness. They hate it, or maybe they&#x27;re afraid of it. They always want to fill it with something.<p>I love to walk around in the middle of the night because the car traffic around here virtually stops and silence and some degree of darkness returns. The busyness goes away. I&#x27;m always amazed that I rarely see anyone else out at night. Don&#x27;t others crave emptiness too?')
