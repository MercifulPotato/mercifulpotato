I wasn&#x27;t adding anything with that comment. I did find the parent comment jarring, as if it was willfully ignoring the downsides in an effort to promote AWS. That&#x27;s in a comment thread that otherwise seemed like a candid discussion of the pros, the cons, and how it&#x27;s a good deal for some but a worse deal for others.<p>Of course, the cost is built into other services. As pointed out, AWS can get very expensive for many use cases, and that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re paying for: access to managed services.<p>Beyond that by developing on AWS you are taking steps to lock yourself into using their system - your configuration isn&#x27;t portable to other services. So the time&#x2F;manpower you spend configuring AWS-specific things is another cost associated exclusively with its use.')
