So wise commenters won&#x27;t say that, instead they will do what you&#x27;ve noted.  Imply that folks are saying the election was perfect, and then say that they think there might have been some &quot;imperfections&quot; going on.<p>That way the listener doesn&#x27;t automatically correctly categorized their point of view as nuttery, but is drawn into listening longer out of decorum.  And the speaker doesn&#x27;t suffer a loss of reasonableness for &quot;wanting the truth&quot;.')
