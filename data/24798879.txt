I would be keen on a usage-based pricing model based on amount of data stored, with a free tier for personal projects.\nThis would allow me to play around with it myself for free, while internal business tools with higher usage would be paid.<p>Interested in talking about what pricing may turn out to be - if you want to get in touch, my email address is on a feature request I submitted about adding a datetime field.<p>(edit to remove extraneous character, in the process adding lots more extraneous characters)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsonapi.org&#x2F;format&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsonapi.org&#x2F;format&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swagger.io&#x2F;specification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swagger.io&#x2F;specification</a>')
