One dialogue failed to trigger and I had to load a checkpoint to continue. I had some minor RTX shadow issues in the Hotel heist mission. Last night after about 15 hours of gameplay I had my first CTD. The most annoying bug is how frame rate tanks when in a car.<p>The game definitely has issues and the patch notes for 1.05 show how there are severe scripting problems in many missions. However there are also huge disparities between the game running on different systems and even within subsets of PCs. The removal of AVX support is particularly interesting in this regard.<p>Apart from all that the game is very similar to the Witcher 3 in terms of its core gameplay and mechanics. So yes, the implementation of crowds and traffic is poor compared to what we see in GTA. The world is a very densely detailed backdrop and not much else. It definitely could have (should have) been delayed but that would not change much about the core of the game.<p>If you want a Deus Ex game from the folks who brought you the Witcher this is pretty good, if excellent at times.')
