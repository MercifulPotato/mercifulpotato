Aggressively relax zoning in areas that have already gentrified where that battle is simply lost and never coming back.  Massively expand the supply of $1M+ homes until the supply outstrips the demand and developers are stuck with inventory of housing that they can&#x27;t move without slashing asking prices and taking losses.  Watch as property values fall.<p>The problem is that both liberals and conservatives are against that, because they don&#x27;t want to see their property values fall, and that background of NIMBY&#x27;ing is where we are.  Without really opening up zoning to generate a glut what you are generally talking about is relaxed zoing in a few areas which will be too little to affect the trajectory of housing markets, but will enrich a lot of rich people.<p>Leftists kinda instinctively know that this economic fantasy of creating a supply glut is just a fantasy, so it does make sense to support things like rent control.<p>But you know keep punching left like they&#x27;re the biggest problem, and not the people who understand the limitations of the system.<p>(This comment&#x27;s tone totally changed from the start, but I&#x27;ll leave it as it is instead of cleaning it up so you can take the journey with me...)')
