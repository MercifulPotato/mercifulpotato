The real numbers, with all the uncomputable reals included, are used in every corner of physics, not just in string theory. There is no treatment of calculus (with any semblance of popularity) that does not feature the usual real line.</i><p>First of all, there is no application of physics where uncomputable reals make one bit of difference.  Unpopular treatments of Calculus that only deal with computable numbers exist and produce the same results for physics.<p>Secondly, physicists have a well-known disregard for whether official mathematical constructions support how they are using them.  To name but two examples, both the Dirac delta and renormalization were in wide use long before any formalization existed that could justify them.<p>Given that, there is no way in which the use of mathematics by physics serves as justification for the reality of the obscure mathematical notions that mathematicians have developed.')
