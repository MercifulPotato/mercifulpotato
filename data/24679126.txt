They are dependent upon a collection of tools to do large portions of their job for them.<p>Do not feel bad about it. This practice applies as much to the back end development, the whole of programming, and human experience in general. There is only as deep as you can go. I would never be able to build a computer from electronic parts and bootstrap even a simple operating system from scratch.<p>If I understand you correctly is what you probably mean is that many developers approach their job mechanistically, without getting into understanding of the parts of the knowledge that would allow them be much better at what they do.<p>To that I say - it is because of immense and fast growing demand and the fact that FE development sits on the very top of one of the most complicated infrastructure stacks in human history.')
