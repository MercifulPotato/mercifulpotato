The state <i>has</i> an army of contact tracers, you just don&#x27;t hear about them or their work because all of it is private and confidential.  I know people through the grapevine who have been informed that they&#x27;ve been exposed through daycare etc.  I&#x27;m awaiting the results of my second COVID test (out of an abundance of caution, I don&#x27;t actually believe I have it), and the process for getting it is super easy - fill out a form online and drive through, you&#x27;re in and out in 5 minutes.
