Have you ever lived in Texas?<p>Yes the like most urban areas they trend left and more ethnically diverse. Thus Texas is also trending left. I&#x27;m not sure what your point is.<p>Is your point that change is coming for Texas? I totally agree with that, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a longer and harder fight than most think. From my experience a lot of the white population there are some of the worse bigots I&#x27;ve ever met.<p>My point was it&#x27;s not a very free state, lol there are just certain specific things allowed. And it has low taxes so it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re already rich and successful.')
