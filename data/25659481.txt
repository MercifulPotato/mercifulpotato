Author links Suz Hinton&#x27;s excellent talk, which goes through a bunch of projects &amp; background &amp; culminates with an Arduino programmer on the web[1]. Sue talks about this as a much friendlier interface than a lot of her other work, with the already excellent avrgrl programming project[2].<p>in contrast, the author presents Mozilla&#x27;s view,<p>&gt; “Because many USB devices are not designed to handle potentially-malicious interactions over the USB protocols and because those devices can have significant effects on the computer they’re connected to, we believe that the security risks of exposing USB devices to the Web are too broad to risk exposing users to them or to explain properly to end users to obtain meaningful informed consent.”<p>while i do not disagree with the risks, i for one think this clawing for absolute security, this idea that the web must only allow a narrow enough path that nothing ever goes wrong, is death. there is indeed great cause for Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)[3], but we have to do it anyways.<p>and frankly, most usb devices are pretty boring &amp; isolated. yes you can hurt a usb flash drive if you do the wrong things to it, you can install an autorun.inf nasty malware. yes you can play gross sounds or listen on a usb sound card. but few devices are going to do anything to the system. mostly it&#x27;s a bunch of mice &amp; keyboards.<p>there&#x27;s such amazing tension between those who want to secure &amp; lock things down, &amp; those who still have hope, who see the web as one of the few remaining ways to keep doors open, to leave something neutral &amp; available &amp; capable about for humanity to use, without endless gatekeeping rigamarole. nothing comes close to the web for being able to get your idea out there, the web is the epitome of online, and in spite of much danger &amp; scariness, it seems obvious- my soul yearns to amplify &amp; enhance &amp; empower ourselves more with this amazing, unique, utterly special system.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IpfZ8Nj3uiE#t=20m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IpfZ8Nj3uiE#t=20m</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noopkat&#x2F;avrgirl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noopkat&#x2F;avrgirl</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt</a>')
