Most people (at least in the US) hardly exercise at all, so a control groups that exercises 30 minutes a day is already a group that exercises a lot compared to the average person. I agree with you that its reasonable, but the study then teaches you about the relative merits of different kinds of exercise, rather than the effect of exercise compared to &quot;no exercise&quot; which is how people tend to think of a control group.')
