Item(by='fsloth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604158179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952052, text='Autocad is not really a good example of a &#x27;pro&#x27; tool in the sense that it would necessarily signal quality. Sure it&#x27;s old and its DWG format is the market leading proprietary black box blob format. It does not have any features though that would make the design for he house to be of better quality than with any other drafting tool.<p>Revit is probably closer to what you meant, but I have no idea how the quality of the drawing tool would affect the quality of the architects output.<p>Construction design tools are all more or less old and crufty. For the love of god, someone please disrupt the industry.<p>The domain is shallow but complex. Open source is probably <i>not</i> the answer - but open tools most certainly won&#x27;t hurt.')
