It used to be that games made a healthy chunk of their income in the first month of launch.  Back then it made total sense to rush a crappy game out before the holiday season.<p>However, today, the best selling games do so at steady rates over the span of years.  The first month or so of sales may only represent 10-20% of total sales over five years.  The Witcher 3 looks like it sold around 1.5 million preorders, but almost 30 million units in total.<p>All the bad publicity around this game is going to reduce gross sales of CP2077 and ensure that the public is leery of pre-ordering a CDPR in the future.')
