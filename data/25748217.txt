That said, I saw this tweet as a reply<p>&gt; They are banned from social media because they were inciting violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Their platform is being shutdown because they were inciting violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; And now they are inciting violence because of that?<p>Some of these angry users obviously don&#x27;t appreciate being silenced, no matter how awful their message is. I totally get silencing their message if it&#x27;s threatening someone, but how else can they voice their opposition to Parler being shut down? They become deplatformed, and no one is willing to listen to them or publish their message.<p>At some point, they&#x27;ll just reach a breaking point where they feel the only way to be listened is to use extreme measures. I frankly don&#x27;t know what we can do to defuse this situation other than punishing those directly associated with hateful messages instead of deplatforming everyone on it.')
