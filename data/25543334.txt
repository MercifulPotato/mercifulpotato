It would already have known.<p>Eh? That&#x27;s how most package managers work. They only issue a very small number of commands to put them into an &quot;updated&quot; state. They don&#x27;t generally do arbitrary things.<p>For example, if we take a look into aptitude, the deb packages it eventually fetches after running various authentications, contains:<p>+ A directory listing. (Contents-&lt;arch&gt;.gz)<p>+ Paths and checksums. (Release)<p>+ Signing information.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have an arbitrary listing of commands to put it into the &quot;updated&quot; set - that&#x27;s already decided by the format. The machine _does_ know the sequence of actions that is necessary. You don&#x27;t need some kind of Turing complete monstrosity that can do absolutely anything to update it.<p>In the case of a _firmware update_ that&#x27;s even simpler! Most of the time you&#x27;re either replacing a kernel, or flashing the firmware to a pre-decided memory address. Both of those actions are decided long before you even begin issuing updates.')
