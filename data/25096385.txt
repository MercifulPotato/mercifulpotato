In software, that&#x27;s usually not the case, but I can imagine a number other instances where it wouldn&#x27;t work. This seems like it would show up the most when the problem isn&#x27;t a greenfield where getting the first 90% working is the hard part, but on the other end, where the difference comes from optimizing the last 10%, which can be really expensive (i.e. figuring out how to profitably and effectively take production from 1000 parts to 10,000 parts can be much more difficult and costly than moving from 100 to 1000).')
