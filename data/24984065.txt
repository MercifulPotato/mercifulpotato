If I don&#x27;t get the memo that X can be recycled I won&#x27;t put it into the right bin, but if it is sorted automatically the garbage company just installed the equipment and we are done.<p>Not to mention all the lazy people who don&#x27;t bother to sort anything still get the right thing done.<p>There isn&#x27;t much cost to the above: I&#x27;m not perfect so they need to re-sort my recyclables anyway (this is why I only have two bins, one for non-recyclables, one for recyclables instead of a dozen for each type).  The real trick is to make the machines cheap and reliable enough to handle any input. I think the main reason they don&#x27;t do this already is the machines jam if you feed them plastic bags.')
