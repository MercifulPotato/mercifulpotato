What should that limit be? Well that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m afraid nobody can provide you the definitive answer you are looking for. Not least me, I&#x27;ve enough on my plate at the moment and it deserves more time than I can give to it.<p>As for the second point - you can surely see how your original comment could be interpreted how it was. Nobody replying wanted to shut down a discussion on the nuances of whether tech giants should restrict expression or activities on their platforms. However your comment was (inadvertently it seems) similar in flavour to an argument many of us have seen over and over from the far-right - holding up a very uncontroversial everyday thing and a very divisive hot-button issue and demanding to know how they are different. In that circumstance - and I am speaking from experience here - <i>normally</i> nothing good comes from engaging.')
