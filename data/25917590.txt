Firstly in that &quot;Signal&#x27;s Audience&quot; is not a thing under contention - it&#x27;s willing parties who are already both using Signal being prevented from using that tool to talk about [x] with one another.  It&#x27;s <i>constraining communication by content</i> once you&#x27;ve already granted someone the tools that is the problem.<p>Even so, I agree you have neither a constitutional nor a moral right to anything of Signal&#x27;s in any case.  And yet, the world would be a better place - for <i>all people, Signal&#x27;s staff and shareholders included</i> - if they gave it freely.  Nobody is obligated to spend their own time or effort to improve the world, but if we want the world to be a better place then somebody has to.<p>The more accessible unfettered communication is, the better the world is able to become.  Full stop.  Restrained communication is less capable of improving the world, because restrained communication is less capable of changing the world at all, because those invested in the status quo have incentive to restrain communication which could make change.')
