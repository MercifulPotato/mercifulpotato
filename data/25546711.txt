If that&#x27;s the case, I completely understand and can even relate (my home network is a textbook example of an &quot;over-engineered solution&quot;: close to a dozen &quot;enterprise-class&quot; servers in the basement, ~35 various subnets, VMware Enterprise Plus clusters, BGP for anycast, and so on).<p>AFAICT, though, this is just some developers running a blog and podcasts aimed at other developers? I mean, we&#x27;re not exactly talking about a &quot;mission critical&quot; web site that&#x27;s going to result in death and destruction the next time it goes down or Linode shits itself, right?<p>Or am I missing something?<p>--<p><i>EDIT:</i> I&#x27;ve read through the rest of the comments now ...<p>&gt; <i>This is for fun, to some degree ...
