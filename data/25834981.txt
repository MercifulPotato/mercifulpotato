The &quot;our code&quot; Shay talks about is community&#x27;s too: All the evangelizing through blog posts, talks; and the countless hours spent reporting bugs or even fixing them. If anyone thinks a community&#x27;s contributions are any less than their own company&#x27;s, then they don&#x27;t get to claim to be torch-bearers of F&#x2F;OSS (which Elastic is without realizing the irony).<p>Shay keeps claiming &quot;our users&quot; aren&#x27;t affected, but who&#x27;s he fooling? They say, AWS cornered them to adopting dual-license SSPL, what&#x27;s to say they woudln&#x27;t do an Oracle in the future (like Sun did with Java and continue to do with their DB offerings?). Slippery slope, sure, but it is indeed <i>slippery</i> for a company struggling to compete with competition and seeking predatory avenues as last ditch attempt to stay alive.<p>I believe, in all my naivety, that Elastic could have created an <i>Elastic Foundation</i> (like Joyent did with NodeJS, who btw didn&#x27;t throw a hissy-fit at AWS for Lambda) and invited developers from all walks to shoulder the burden of the core software (which they themselves commoditized by F&#x2F;OSSing it) so that they could focus on SaaS (like AWS).<p>I&#x27;d like to think, Elastic&#x27;s real problem is they have hard time competing with AWS in terms of pricing for SaaS (of course, AWS owns infrastructure and so it is a tough battle-front), but if they were paying any attention, AWS Elasticsearch Service was <i>very</i> poor in 2015 and continued to remain so for a long time (it sucks less now), but Elastic&#x27;s own service wasn&#x27;t up to the mark, either. I think they misplaced their priorities (see GCP&#x27;s flawless execution with k8s, managed-k8s, and Anthos) and were caught asleep at the wheel when they could have captured SaaS market away from AWS in those interim years (2015-19) by focusing solely on differentiated features and not on the core Elasticsearch software (which was <i>libre</i> and hence <i>undifferentiated</i>).<p>Of course, Shay and Elastic know better than I do and I am indeed a grumpy developer who&#x27;s upset, but I want Elastic to give up their misleading messaging viz. &#x27;doesn&#x27;t affect &#x2F; nothing changes for our users&#x27;. They&#x27;re being hypocritical and not doing anyone any favours.<p>&gt; <i>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.</i><p>No, Shay. It does affect the community, who are also the users of the software.<p>&gt; <i>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our lifeâ€™s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.</i><p>I see a lot of &quot;We&quot;s and &quot;Our&quot;s. And that&#x27;s the problem with CLAs and stealing someone else&#x27;s work. Companies can&#x27;t tell anymore who&#x27;s stealing from whom.')
