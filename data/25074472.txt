We first shared Flowdash on HN earlier this year when we were just getting started (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22476985" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22476985</a>).<p>Since then, we’ve gotten tons of feedback from customers and have been impressed by the kind of workflows people built on Flowdash. We’ve been hard at work taking all the feedback, and I’m both nervous and excited to share our latest iteration with HN.<p>Our thesis is that operations teams are critical to many companies, yet tend to be underserved when it comes to the tools they use. The choices are either hacking things through spreadsheets, notion, airtable, zapier, slack, etc... Or investing a lot of time building and maintaining internal tools.<p>We created Flowdash specifically to offer the best of both worlds. You can build powerful workflows in minutes and without code. But it can be further customized through built-in blocks (e.g. widgets) and API integrations.<p>Customers have described Flowdash in many ways: “Jira + Zapier”, “API-backed spreadsheets”, “Semi-automated workflows”, “Retool for async flows”, “human in the loop platform”, and even “Human-powered background jobs”.
