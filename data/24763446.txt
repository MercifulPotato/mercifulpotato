I don&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license because public transit is good enough for 99.9% of trips. There <i>are</i> situations where it would be nice to be able to drive a car (esp. to get a rental car for countryside vacations, or for large Ikea purchases). But getting a driver&#x27;s license doesn&#x27;t make sense when you never really use it and fall out of practice, so my money is better invested in the national public transit flatrate card.')
