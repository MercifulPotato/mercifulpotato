I haven&#x27;t seen anything CCS related in the US.  Is that a European accessory? Don&#x27;t all Teslas outside the US ship with CCS standard?<p>The US Teslas come with a J1772-to-Tesla adapter so you can use L2 Chargers.<p>There is a ChaDeMo-to-Teska adapter for $400.  No idea why anyone would want this though, ChaDeMo is rare and, in my experience with my Leaf, often broken.')
