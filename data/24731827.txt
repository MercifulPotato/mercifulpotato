Most podcast ads I hear are read by the hosts themselves, though a small number splice in targeted advertiser-provided audio (eg a UK soccer podcast will play me local Canadian ads).<p>For the podcasts that follow the former model, they don&#x27;t seem to rely on timeslots (i.e. payment just for ad being shown), though some may be involved.  Instead, it seems they rely on coupon codes to measure conversions.  I assume the podcast gets paid per coupon code redeemed. Barring show sponsors, in my experience ever single podcast ad read by a host will use a coupon code.')
