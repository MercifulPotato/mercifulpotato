I guess by &quot;use&quot; I meant &quot;incorporate in another program&quot;. But I still think it counts as free and open source because it doesn&#x27;t actually prohibit commercial redistribution, it just switches to a different license type.<p>It&#x27;s GPL plus an additional permission that noncommercial derivative works don&#x27;t have to share the source code.<p>Anyway it&#x27;s probably not actually a good idea.')
