Walking has a lot of health benefits but they&#x27;re largely orthogonal to traditional vigorous exercise.<p>Modern research has identified that the major mediator of exercise&#x27;s physiological benefits is the down-regulation of the adrenal axis.[1] In other words, activating the fight-or-flight sensation is a key component of an exercise program. It&#x27;s also why very high-intensity exercise seems to produce the most rapid improvement in key biomarkers.[2]<p>Many people don&#x27;t like vigorous exercise because they feel like they&#x27;re dying from the strain.
