From 2007 to 2017, USA reduced emissions by 20%, whereas if we take Germany as an example of a country with strong &quot;green&quot; element in politics, Germany reduced by 8%.<p>Which is primarily due to Obama era regulations that Trump has done everything he can to roll back.  Had the price of gas not skyrocketed and the mortgage crisis not hit, we would&#x27;ve had almost no improvements from 2000-2008.<p>If you look at the data available from 2016-2018 we went BACKWARDS.  You can&#x27;t extrapolate the data from Obama&#x27;s regulations that have rolled back and say: look it&#x27;ll take care of itself.')
