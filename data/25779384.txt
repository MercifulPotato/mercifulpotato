But the gamma tocopherol form might be the more important one. You can get low quantities of tocotrienols from rice, but its not too practical because it will come along with some arsenic ;) Also, they should all be gotten in balance, not just one out of proportion to the others. One supplement that does this is Jarrow Famil-e but there are others.<p>Vitamin C is also tricky, its much more bioactive when present with certain bioflavanoids. So it might be best to get a lower dosage from fruits (like kiwis, which are high in Vitamin C) rather than a high dosage from supplement w&#x2F;o bioflavanoids.<p>With respect to mitohormesis, the study mentioned above does not seem to indicate the proximity of antioxidant supplementation to the exercise in its methods section, it simply says:<p>&quot; Participants in the antioxidant treatment groups (n=20 each, out of which n=10 were untrained and n=10 were pretrained) received 500 mg vitamin C (ascorbic acid, Jenapharm) twice a day and 400 IU vitamin E (RRR-&#x2F;D-\x04-tocopherol, Jenapharm) once a day&quot;<p>In my mind, I would not take antioxidants &quot;near&quot; exercise, within an 8 hour window (4 hours before &#x2F; after), but it would be nice to get some clarifications on this.<p>I agree though, things are not so simple. Recently there was a story &quot;Antioxidant-rich foods like black tea, chocolate, and berries may increase risk for certain cancers, new study finds&quot;. The theme is similar, antioxiandts gotten thorough the diet may short circuit your body&#x27;s abilities.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medicalxpress.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-07-antioxidant-rich-foods-black-tea-chocolate.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medicalxpress.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-07-antioxidant-rich-food...</a>')
