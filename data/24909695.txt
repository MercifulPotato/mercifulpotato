The structure seems so much more logical and easy to navigate.<p>The Web (and React) paradigm of putting some code in HTML, some in CSS, and then some in JS, just seems like a step backwards to me after using Flutter where everything is just code.  Designers build in Adobe XD or Figma, and then they hit export, and it dumps out FLutter code that a developer can directly read and incorporate into her project.  There isn&#x27;t a bewildering array of different things all being processed by different other things ... dumping out yet more things.  Its just code to binary ... that&#x27;s it.<p>And that&#x27;s another thing ... I like the code to binary direct link.  React Native&#x27;s JS logic + bridge to native always seemed like such an inefficient shim.  And seeing the framerate of widgets in Flutter its pretty clear we have been leaving some performance on the table for the convenience of making everything in Javascript.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m sure Flutter on the web is as bulky as any other JS framework, as there it has to run on JS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS like everyone else.')
