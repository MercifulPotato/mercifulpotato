If I really care about the non-stick-ness I&#x27;ll usually use nonstick. But nonstick doesn&#x27;t char well (and isn&#x27;t safe). So when I want a serious sear or browning, I use iron &amp; stell.<p>Problem is, if something burns on, it burns on hard. Soap doesn&#x27;t really help. Water and scrubbing mostly do, but they don&#x27;t completely get it off. I can&#x27;t even tell when the remaining patina is seasoning and when it&#x27;s just gunk -- until it becomes rough to the touch, in which case it&#x27;s obvious, and I scrub hard.')
