Their complexity so hugely beyond that of old 8-bit micros that I doubt a single person could completely understand it. I mean to the level it’s possible to understand a BBC micro - what every CPU cycle does, what function every gate in the video output performs, etc.<p>A lot of the improvements listed are due to understanding very minute details of the operation, like timing CPU exactly with the video output, changing palettes and sprites on the fly, racing the CRT beam, etc. With a reasonably modern CPU you can’t even reliably tell in advance how many cycles a simple instruction will take.')
