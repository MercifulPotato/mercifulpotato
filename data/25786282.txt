Some systems are very complex and not well understood yet (climate, ecosystems, food chain, etc) and the risk of disrupting something we depend on and not have alternative place to live on if something unexpected happens.<p>We are kind of living that scenario already, the global transport and energy &quot;megastructures&quot; are causing global warming, maybe not as construction but as system with many components. Imagine building something planned 100 years ago when the people of that time wasn&#x27;t aware of the polar vortex, the gulf stream or positive reinforcement loops, or were not aware of their importance.<p>Limited impact, controlled&#x2F;limited side effects, composable for a planned&#x2F;measured growth, instead of a big cathedral that must be all of it or nothing, may be factors that make some future projects be safe enough.<p>It is not just being able to draw it and that have an sound math on its factibility. With big enough things, you may have to factor the impact for all of us, on things that are outside the construction itself.')
