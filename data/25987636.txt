See the FAQ again at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html</a>:<p>&gt; 1.4 Do you really think you can replace the web?<p>&gt; Not for a minute! Nor does anybody involved with Gemini want to destroy Gopherspace. Gemini is not intended to replace either Gopher or the web, but to co-exist peacefully alongside them as one more option which people can freely choose to use if it suits them. In the same way that many people currently serve the same content via gopher and the web, people will be able to &quot;bihost&quot; or &quot;trihost&quot; content on whichever combination of protocols they think offer the best match to their technical, philosophical and aesthetic requirements and those of their intended audience.<p>For the other point you seem to forget that gemini doesn&#x27;t exist on technical grounds but on philosophical grounds: it wants to create a new space with its own rules, even though the technicalities are close to something that already exist. People have written blogs (called gemlogs in gemini), and they &quot;hacked&quot; the format to build an informal replacement to Atom. The constraints of the medium created the requirements and the result is a simple, human-readable and human-editable document that can replace Atom in most cases: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy.flounder.online&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;companion&#x2F;subscription.gmi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy.flounder.online&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;...</a>. It follows the philosophy of making this new space more human-centered.')
