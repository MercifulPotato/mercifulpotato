Oncoming carbon regulation, consumer reaction against gas, and the declining price-point of renewables, mean that the US is sitting on a carbon bubble waiting to explode.<p>One of the real silver linings of 2020, conspicuously absent from the Vox article, is that South Korea, Japan and China all committed to reach net zero emissions by around mid century, while the EU also brought forward it&#x27;s targets. I would add that the Iranian nuclear deal is now being revived, breaking the power of militaristic hardliners in Iran, and quashing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Note that both were achieved despite the US: it left the Paris Agreement and reneged on its commitment to the Iranian nuclear deal.')
