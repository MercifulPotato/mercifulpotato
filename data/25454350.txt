It&#x27;s a lot less flexible in terms of handwriting, but said restrictions are to help transcribe your handwritten notes to typed text if you want it. It&#x27;s also a cross-platform option with Android.<p>----<p>Handwritten notetaking in general:<p>All apps use proprietary formats, but they&#x27;re all generally capable of exporting to PDF for archiving purposes if need be.<p>Notability and GoodNotes are good staple options.\nI personally like ZoomNotes myself, it has a worse looking UI but it has a lot more features.<p>OneNote is fairly special, because I find it the best cross-platform solution (Android and iOS, desktop is a bonus). I feel that Samsung and Huawei tabs have been getting a lot better over time, despite there being few people talking about them.')
