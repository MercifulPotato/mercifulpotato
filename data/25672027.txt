In the case of the 4-way usually the stopping direction have a stop sign with a missing &quot;All Way&quot; sign below it. But thats not required in all jurisdictions. Nor is the non-stopping direction 100% sure their stop sign is still visible (shrubs, weather, etc)  and can proceed at regular speed.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of reasons for the way things are, I just think the outcome is you can&#x27;t really ever be 100% sure what the correct thing to do is without slowing down and observing.')
