In any case, if you aren&#x27;t using git and don&#x27;t know how to at least back things up you really should be asking yourself if a tech company is right for you, as a one man&#x2F;woman operation. There are countless other ways to make money online. Etsy, Craigslist, Shopify, etc.<p>&gt; until a node dies and you need to recreate it<p>The way to solve both of these problems on a single node operation is to create a snapshot&#x2F;clone of your machine. At that point you would really just need to worry about the IP address changing and&#x2F;or updating DNS when restoring the image. The best part is you can take this &quot;master&quot; copy and deploy it as a staging server. Or even horizontally scale by throwing a load balancer on top. You can even get your VM exactly how you want it locally and then deploy it to DO, Linode, Vultr or whatever.')
