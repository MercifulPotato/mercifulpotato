I use Fedora fwiw also so Windows&#x2F;macOS slowing down over time isn&#x27;t applicable in my case.<p>That said, it is definitely not true in the case of server hardware.<p>I have a home lab with a few R620s that have 2014 era Xeons in them, and while there are a lot of parallel cores, single core performance is abysmal compared to newer in-class hardware.  For CPU-bound single-threaded tasks, I actually spin up a Linode and use that, rather than my on-prem hardware.<p>I would also note, I have only Intel.  I&#x27;m going to build an AMD rig here within the next few months though because I&#x27;ve had numerous people tell me that it&#x27;s noticeably better.')
