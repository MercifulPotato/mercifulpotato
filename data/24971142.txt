It seems like it would have to be rather strange</i><p>Yes.<p><i>&gt; if non-standard numbers aren&#x27;t infinite, how can the proof be infinite?</i><p>I am not an expert on this, but as I understand it, it has to do with how Godel numbering would have to work if non-standard numbers can be Godel numbers. Basically, only a standard natural number can be the Godel number of a finite proof; any proof that has a non-standard number as its Godel number must be infinite (i.e., it must have an infinite number of steps). But unfortunately I cannot explain why that is true. Maybe another poster here can, or can correct me if my understanding is wrong.')
