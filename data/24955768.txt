Yes, HP may have done that in error, but how can apple know or reasonably assume an error here and retain trust?<p>No actual malware ot breach was involved in this case, but what is the system supposed to do if the org responsible for the software revokes the trust anchor? Continue just as if trust was still established? What if the certificate had actually been used to distribute malware?<p>The system worked as designed, but HP needs to figure out how that to revocation happened.')
