It uses the word &quot;rasterizer&quot; to mean &quot;renderer that works by applying transforms to polygons&quot;, as contrastive with a &quot;raytracer&quot; (more generally, a physically-based light transport model).  (e.g. &quot;Raytracing and Rasterization, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data&quot;).<p>Properly (from a descriptivist standpoint), a &quot;rasterizer&quot; is any algorithm that transforms vector data into raster data, where rasters are arrays of horizontal lines, each horizontal line composed of pixels.  RAYTRACERS ARE RASTERIZERS.  (I mean, not if you&#x27;re using the raytracer to detect collisions or for some other purpose; only if you&#x27;re using it to generate 2d images of any kind.)<p>Surely there must be some better terminology for the non-physically-based option?  I tend to say &quot;polygon-pusher&quot;, but this is my own neologism.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a more accurate name for this type of renderer?<p>Saying &quot;rasterizer&quot; in the sense the book does is as common as saying &quot;literally&quot; to mean &quot;figuratively&quot;, as common as writing &quot;there&quot; to mean &quot;they&#x27;re&quot;.  So I know that probably there&#x27;s no fixing it.  But I&#x27;m still hoping.')
