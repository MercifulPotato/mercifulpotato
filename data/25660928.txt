The proper way is to accept the sad state of affairs voluntarily and then try to make the best of it and that&#x27;ll provide you with enough meaning to bear your existential suffering. That&#x27;s the best you can hope for, really.<p>(This is what you do if you get diagnosed with terminal illness btw: you get your affairs in order, you gather your loved ones and you try to make the best of your limited time left, and it&#x27;ll be good enough)')
