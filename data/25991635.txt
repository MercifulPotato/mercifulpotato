What do you think men were protecting women from? If you&#x27;re going to talk about war, you have to talk about offense as well as defense, and some significant percentage of warriors were injured&#x2F;killed while attacking, not defending, and then the survivors went on to rape and pillage. Some of these men were taking resources, not protecting them. For some men to be &quot;protectors&quot; means others are aggressors. If men lead more dangerous lives due to war and violence, you&#x27;ve got to consider how much of that danger they created themselves.<p>&quot;Protection&quot; that involves attacking others first is pretty questionable from a moral and practical standpoint. &quot;No first strike&quot; policies for nuclear weapons, for instance, would go a long way to making the world safer.')
