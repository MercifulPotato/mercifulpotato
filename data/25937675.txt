I have them because it is so easy -- once you figured out how to do something, get the history and copy relevant stuff. At work, we share the commands on Slack, put them into Wiki, paste them in the docs, and so on. If the commands grow too complex, they turn into scripts -- after all, scripts are just file rename away.<p>I don&#x27;t think I could do this efficiently I had to use GUIs. Theoretically, I could write an manuals with dozens of steps[0], but this is much more significant effort, and they&#x27;ll likely go stale anyway.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;iis&#x2F;application-frameworks&#x2F;scenario-build-a-php-website-on-iis&#x2F;configuring-step-1-install-iis-and-php#to-download-and-install-php-and-wincache" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;iis&#x2F;application-frameworks&#x2F;...</a>')
