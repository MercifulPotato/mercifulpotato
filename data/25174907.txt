And they showed me really three things. But I was so blinded by the first one that I didn’t even really see the other two. One of the things they showed me was object oriented programming – they showed me that but I didn’t even see that. The other one they showed me was a networked computer system… they had over a hundred Alto computers all networked using email etc., etc., I didn’t even see that. I was so blinded by the first thing they showed me, which was the graphical user interface. I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life.</i><p>Maybe the best way to describe NeXT is Jobs getting back to the two other things he missed at Xerox.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mac-history.net&#x2F;computer-history&#x2F;2012-03-22&#x2F;apple-and-xerox-parc&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mac-history.net&#x2F;computer-history&#x2F;2012-03-22&#x2F;appl...</a>')
