Last year it started garbling the incoming audio from outgoing phone calls, about 50% of the time.  This week it garbled an incoming phone call, so I really can&#x27;t put off upgrading any longer.  I don&#x27;t make a lot of voice calls, and from home I can use my land line, but if I can&#x27;t receive calls, it&#x27;s not a phone.<p>I&#x27;ve really liked the phone apart from that, but it&#x27;s a pretty big &quot;apart from that&quot;, so I&#x27;m iffy on going OnePlus again.  Support talked me through making a bug report, and then...nothing.<p>Anybody else have a similar experience?')
