Item(by='dnessett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611459435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25860388, text='I have written a commentary on this poem, that critiques it several lines at a time. I wrote this before knowing about this web site or this thread, so I may repeat some of the criticism provided here. The critique is 9 pages long, although this exaggerates its true length. There is plenty of white space in the document. Because it is so long, I assume it would be inappropriate for me to dump it into a thread entry, so I am providing a link to a PDF file on my Google Drive account. I hope this does not contravene any rules of the web site (I looked, but could not find any guidance on this). I would welcome any feedback you have to give.
