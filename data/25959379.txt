I started Ruby because I got a job at a Rails shop.  I didn&#x27;t like it all that much for a while, but then I decided to write a CLI program in Ruby and break out of rails.<p>I quickly realized nearly everything I didn&#x27;t like about &quot;ruby&quot; was actually rails.  After a couple of years I moved on and don&#x27;t do rails anymore, but I ruby is still my go to for any script that requires arrays or maps (the point where bash begins to be really painful).<p>Ruby is the best scripting language ever IMHO*.  Ruby one-liners (inherited from Perl tradition) make it plug nicely into a bash script also.<p>* I haven&#x27;t tried Julia yet but plan to.')
