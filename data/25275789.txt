Bush presidency.<p>So now someone wants to schedule an appointment several months away, at e.g. 4PM in that new timezone. Has the software been updated to know that that 4PM will be in that newly-announced but not yet valid timezone? Otherwise it will store the time with the current UTC offset, which will be the wrong offset the time that appointment arrives.')
