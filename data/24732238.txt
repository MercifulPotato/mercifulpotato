I would guess that people today are about as good at working on an assembly line as they were 50 years ago, and we&#x27;re more productive only because of capital improvements in machinery and infrastructure.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we shouldn&#x27;t work to improve the average worker&#x27;s wealth and quality of life, of course! I&#x27;m all in favor. But it&#x27;s not a matter of gains getting &quot;sucked up&quot; from where they naturally would have gone; recent gains in manufacturing productivity just aren&#x27;t at the individual level in the first place.')
