Item(by='patio11', descendants=None, kids=[25292279, 25292155, 25292259, 25292839], score=None, time=1607017738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291634, text='Suppose a driver for a rideshare app wants to pay their car payment.<p>Stripe Connect can&#x27;t be used to hold funds from many rides for a month; they have to pay it out to a bank account (which they might not have) or to a disbursement card, which (because loan repayments are generally not paid on a card in the U.S.) likely doesn&#x27;t solve their problem without withdrawing cash and buying a money order. That is extra effort and cost for the driver.<p>Stripe Treasury would let the rideshare platform give their drivers an embedded money management account. That <i>would</i> allow indefinitely holding money, and would allow them to use e.g. bill pay for car payments, similar to the way that many HNers probably pay their own car payments today.<p>This is good for the platform (solves a pain point for many drivers) and good for the drivers (they get faster access to their funds, decreasing the likelihood they&#x27;ll get dinged for a late repayment, and can spend less of their time managing low-value-added money movement when they could instead be driving).')
