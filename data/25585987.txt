Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609361743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583741, text='I disagree with that; in my mind the distinction is not whether the manufacturer wants me to to run arbitrary code, but whether they expect&#x2F;intend themselves to be able to run arbitrary code after the device is shipped. So ex. a dumb digital watch that just has time&#x2F;date&#x2F;alarm&#x2F;stopwatch functions is fine because once it&#x27;s sold the manufacturer never expects to update its code (and said code is probably on actual read-only ROM), but an Apple Watch is intended to run arbitrary code - just that Apple locks down that ability to code that they allow, which I do object to even though Apple never intended to let users run their own code at will.')
