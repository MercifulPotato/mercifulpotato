Even if you haven&#x27;t, the things that it doesn&#x27;t aren&#x27;t a stretch to come up with and I might as well just list them here:<p>&gt; Eventually, the list is so large that many applications need access to at least one thing from which they may escalate to full access.<p>This makes zero sense. If an app wants access to keylogging APIs, then it better be an app where it makes sense to be able to keylog other apps. 99% of apps have no reason to do this and have no need for full access.<p>&gt; In the alternative, one has to grant it access to files, or directories, on an individual basis with every save,<p>No, the alternative is that you give the application access to a file and now it owns that file.<p>&gt; And you didn&#x27;t address the fact that if he browser have recursive write permissions to the `~&#x2F;Downloads` folder, it can alter anything that any other application downloaded to it, and thus install whatever malware it wish in there.<p>You can deny the browser the ability to read or write to the directory in general, but it may create new files and have permission to those.<p>Overall, it is eminently possible to make useful software, perhaps even most useful software, that operates under a reasonable sandbox.')
