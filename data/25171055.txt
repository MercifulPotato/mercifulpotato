This person was the first in their family to go to college, and was unable to find a job in their field.   Most of this persons peers are in a similar situation with respect to debt and being unable to find jobs in their field.  The jobs these people have are entry-level tech support, bar-tending &#x2F; waiting tables, starbucks, etc.  None of them are upper middle class.')
