Best ISP in the world sonic.net is still reselling Fiber To The Node (FTTN) AT&amp;T 50Mbps DSL in my area. It&#x27;s still really unfortunate, we only have one option (Comcast) for truly fast Internet. I will say that I would rather have Sonic than Comcast, the latter is very unreliable and the DSL has been rock-solid if you reboot the router every couple months. Really, really hoping 5G creates some competition in the home Internet space.')
