Ideas can inspire wars, murder, revolution, they can warp minds.  People previously productive can end up obsessed with crazy junk. It is important to protect each other and ourselves from bad ideas.  The question is how, of course. Some people violently oppose any form of curation, whether it be censorship by government, or choices made by companies like facebook.  Others insist the solution to bad speech is good speech, but I&#x27;ve been seeing that fail on the internet for 30 years. Perhaps higher quality education can help, perhaps improving economic inequity can help.  Other ideas are welcome!')
