That they happen to cooperate to a greater or lesser degree with one another and the rest of Python doesn&#x27;t change that fact. Most Racket DSLs that aren&#x27;t teaching languages allow for using almost all of the Racket features in addition to some new ones and today it is generally more popular in the community to create mini-languages which are basically just a set of macros and functions that work on within Racket.<p>Macros actually make the DSL situation better because it heavily discourages the nonsense YAML&#x2F;JSON DSLs that everyone despises. Instead of thinking of the complexity macros will introduce, think of how many YAML DSLs will be killed instead!')
