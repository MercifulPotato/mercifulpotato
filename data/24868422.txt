What does a failed prediction about super-symmetry in 1996 have to do with the opportunities of the next collider? How does &quot;we didn&#x27;t find evidence for or against supersymmetry at LHC&quot; connect to dark matter experiments in its successor?<p>I&#x27;m also not really convinced of what she categorizes as failure. She enumerates quite a few incorrect predictions, but is that sufficient to show that the experiments were a failure? There are literally thousands of papers published because of the LHC and CERN claims hundreds of results. Maybe you can show that they are mostly worthless (which is not the same as boring or not spectecular), but she doesn&#x27;t really seem to even try to do that.')
