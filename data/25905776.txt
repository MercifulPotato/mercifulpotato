You have to constantly watch the kid to make sure they&#x27;re not running into the waves, or eating sand, or throwing sand at other beachgoers, or about to fall into the creek.  It&#x27;s not at all as relaxing as going to the beach as a single person or couple is, for reasons entirely unrelated to how much going to the beach costs.')
