I am left dumbfounded, as you become completely reliant on this technology which may break down or (more likely) fail to perform to spec or (even more likely) be spec’d incorrectly or incompatibly relative to future uses.<p>It seems to me it would be far better to have large thermal masses and radiant heat, and then allow for the usual air loss around windows and doors and attics.\nAnyone here have thoughts on this approach vs Passive House?')
