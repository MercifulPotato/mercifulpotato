I&#x27;m not sure how the last idea would work in the long run, as much as it should in an idealistic sense. I definitely agree that working from the office is better for some people than others. However, the unfortunate reality is if <i>the boss</i> is working from the office, it&#x27;s often the case that people who are also in the office get better opportunities, recognition, and possibly resulting promotions than those who work remotely. Even if that&#x27;s not the reality, I&#x27;d imagine that could become a pervasive fear or assumption. Having a split work force like that would require a really deep-rooted culture that supports it.')
