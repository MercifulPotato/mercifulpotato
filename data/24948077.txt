What&#x27;s the alternative?<p>The US federal system of elections <i>is not</i> democratic, and even if it were, democracy is necessary for, but not sufficient to, a government which is in accord with the rights of the people. Popular tyranny remains tyranny, and its victims are no less justified in resisting.<p>Now, you can argue that the outcome these people fear would not actually be a tyranny, but that&#x27;s a different argument than that your apparent argument that not submitting to a democratic output irrespective of its content is equivalent to fascism.')
