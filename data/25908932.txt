Due to the scarcity of them at that time (I was a reasonably early pre-order, but certainly not first in the queue), I managed to sell it for more than double my cost, which was at least nice for me.  It was only about 18 months later when I read something about it and realised there were still people waiting that I understood how lucky I&#x27;d been!')
