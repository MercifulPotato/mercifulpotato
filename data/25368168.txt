They&#x27;ve got no scientific or reasonable leg to stand on, yet they publish so much unscientific garbage as to be garnering support.  It will LOOK like they are more credible because the shear amount of garbage they push will go unresponded to by the other side.  Meanwhile, they&#x27;ll just simply ignore the other half of the argument.  They refuse to address those points while making a ton of their own.<p>It gets worse.  There&#x27;s starting to be major bubbles of misinformation forming.  So broad that the arguments made are almost impossible for the other side to decode.  A great example of this is something like the comet pizza Q anon conspiracy.  If you don&#x27;t know, it goes something like this &quot;A pizzeria in DC was a central location in a pedophile ring which the Clinton&#x27;s had deep connections to.&quot;<p>Where does a reasonable debate even begin with something like that?  It&#x27;s easy enough to show that &quot;No, that&#x27;s crazy&quot; Heck, even minimal rational thought should be enough to debunk this garbage.  Yet it still flows (so much so that someone decided to show up armed to demand the pizzeria release the kids[1])<p>Yet, when a debate comes up, all a Q anon follower would pretty much have to say something like &quot;Yeah and I bet you like comet pizza as well&quot;.  That sort of attack would be devastating in the eyes of those already tuned into Q anon crap yet would be completely reasonable for an outsider to be like &quot;Yeah, I like their pizza&quot;.<p>These techniques are effective which is evidenced by how much misinformation flows throughout the internet.  Giving equal time and access to both sides doesn&#x27;t appear to be effective in combating this misinformation.  There&#x27;s got to be a better way.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;thetwo-way&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;533941689&#x2F;pizzagate-gunman-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;thetwo-way&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;533941689...</a>')
