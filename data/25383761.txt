The error being pointed out to you is that your tone is dismissive, which this diatribe did nothing to correct. The culture people are trying to cultivate here is one that actively avoids suppressing ideas, and dismissiveness is antithetical to that end.<p>Furthermore, the conversation on linguistic relativism is far from done and dusted. The distinction you make between &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; forms sort of shows a loose grasp on the subject matter. I&#x27;m also more than a little stumped trying to figure out what correlation you meant.<p>... that&#x27;s also not what &quot;Turing complete&quot; means.')
