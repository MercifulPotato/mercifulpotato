Clarity trumps all other concerns.<p>Generally this is true, but with the caveat that what actually matters is 90th percentile (or maybe even 99th percentile) complexity. If you have a choice between spreading low-grade complexity across the codebase or having one module that is nearly incomprehensible but that provides an abstraction that makes the rest of the code very simple, the latter is almost always to be preferred. Once you&#x27;ve distilled out the evil into one place and gotten it working reliably, chances are you&#x27;re never going to need to touch it again, and if you do need to, at least you only need to deal with it in one place.')
