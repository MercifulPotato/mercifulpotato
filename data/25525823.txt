I found it surprisingly easy to use compared to things that try to be automatic, like linkerd and istio.  (Plus, I can verify the authenticity of the connection at the application layer, and make appropriate decisions rather than having to trust &quot;oh yeah, the sidecar has it under control, nothing to see here&quot;.)<p>It&#x27;s a downgrade in security compared to pressing a physical button a YubiKey every so often... but I am OK with things being automatically renewed.  (It basically means, if you own the apiserver, you own the network, which is a tradeoff I can live with.  Compare this to &quot;if you can intercept any packet, you own the network&quot;, which is what non-mTLS is.)')
