Belief does not subscribe to the first law of thermodynamics. It is not a preexisting condition with neatly defined boundaries. People have no need for consistency in their beliefs, or even any understanding of why they hold them or where they came from.<p>Point being, it is not just the systemic political issue of being for or against that SA suggests shores up the Weak Man, but their beliefs themselves which shift and flow and pop in and out of existence. The only antidote to not fall in with the politics or the belief is to maintaina sense of self doubt and empathy. (And i say that as someone who also self diagnosed with much research, but also doubts).<p>And even that doesn&#x27;t protect you from other peoples&#x27; beliefs. Has no one read Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum?')
