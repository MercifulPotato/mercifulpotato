If I go to a mall or a big box store, I&#x27;m not going to hear my car alarm going off and other people are going to largely ignore it (since they&#x27;ve experienced so many false alarms in the past).<p>Car alarm systems should be silent and sent an alert to your phone so that you know someone is doing something to your vehicle and can check on it in a timely fashion.')
