All ints are reals, but only an infinitely small proportion of reals are ints.<p>If, however, you meant &quot;the integer datatypes can&#x27;t represent all integers&quot;, then you probably want to say that instead of mixing maths terminology. And you&#x27;ll also have to back up that claim because bigintegers are as accurate as you have space to store them in; their limitation is not imposed by their spec, but by your hardware.<p>Unlike IEEE floating point decimal numbers, where the limitation is explicitly part of the spec itself. That limitation is literally why floats even work at all.')
