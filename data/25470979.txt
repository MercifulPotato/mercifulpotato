You&#x27;re correct that he enjoys a broad base of bipartisan support, but the combination of turning on Trump, leaving the Republican party, and having a well-recognized opponent imperiled his chances in that district.  He would have had to snag approximately 25% of the Democratic vote and 45% of the Republican vote to achieve that feat.')
