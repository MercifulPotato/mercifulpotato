What is true is that there is no information out there to conclusively support long term retention of antibodies, in large part because we&#x27;ve only got 6 months of data.<p>As to the latter point, I wonder about the trial design. If they didn&#x27;t give all participants a Covid antibody test before starting, it is very likely that several participants were previously infected. Smaller sample size though.')
