It leads the Hammond-Snyder Loop Trail (which hasn&#x27;t been much of a loop for years–it&#x27;s been closed for a watershed project that should&#x27;ve ended a while ago) which is a nice way to get to Anza Knoll, which is not all that tall but has a pretty good view of the valley (a more obvious way to access it is on the other side of Cristo Rey Drive). If you follow the train tracks it goes past a culvert for Stevens Creek under I-280 next to which seems to be the local hangout spot for teenagers–it&#x27;s heavily graffitied (unlike any other part of Cupertino I have seen) and it looks like someone&#x27;s constructed a sort of BMX park out of the dirt. And this is just from me walking in an ~2 mile radius in the suburbs! There&#x27;s a whole lot of cool things you can find while walking that no online mapping service will cover.')
