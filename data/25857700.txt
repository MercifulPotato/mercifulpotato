Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would love for musicians to be paid a higher amount for being played but this is just what the music industry has evolved into, also because this is the model that listeners have chosen.<p>My point is that the way it works now also comes with huge benefits for artists. Some years ago there has been no way to get played and discovered a million times as an indie artist. Today this is possible. Streaming services have replaced radios in many parts and it is possible for nearly everybody to get traction in that system. What also has changed is where artists make their money, which today is more in playing live and selling merch. It is true that in former times artists got much more for being played or selling records but this was reserved for artists signed by big lables and it was hard to get into that business.<p>As an anecdote, I remeber hearing Alfa Mist play live in Berlin and in disbelief stated how surreal it feels to play a sold out show in Berlin. He told how he some years ago was just for the heck of it recording and releasing an album together with his brother from their homes. Without them expecting it the album was catching on all over the world and they could tour it and live from it. I feel this sums up how streaming can be a big chance for artists.')
