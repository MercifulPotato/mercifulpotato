One class&#x27;s PDF was so bad our teacher got into direct contact with the McGraw-Hill rep. The PDF cost more than the physical book and the text was completely unreadable. They ended up giving us some kind of Xerox copy of the book because they were unable to supply a pdf you could read. The resolution of the text was absolutely terrible.<p>I am glad I graduated before they started monitoring us. Most of my major classes were open book but there&#x27;s no way you had enough time to look everything up or understand the complex subject.<p>McGraw-Hill is looking for any way to squeeze more money out of the school and students.')
