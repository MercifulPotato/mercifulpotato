Is the Tulane Card still accepted for drive-thru daquiris?<p>Edit: from wikipedia &quot;Garrison explains that cover stories were circulated in an attempt to blame the killing on the Cubans and the Mafia but he blames the conspiracy to kill the president firmly on the CIA who wanted to continue the Cold War.&quot; I don&#x27;t know about CIA specifically (nor do I know the Mafia be completely distinct from them), but there is the coincidence that Kennedy and Khrushchev, having averted global thermonuclear war together, soon after were both cancelled.<p>Edit2: as long as I&#x27;m already thinking of conspiracy theories, sometime I&#x27;ll have to rewatch <i>Cool Hand Luke</i> to see if a valid retcon would be that Boss Godfrey doesn&#x27;t have much to say because his name (in northern italy, where he served under Karl Wolff) was Marco Gottifredi, and he changed it when he escaped down a ratline at the end of the war to the US south. But he&#x27;s laconic because his english still isn&#x27;t so good.')
