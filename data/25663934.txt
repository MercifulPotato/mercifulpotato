Item(by='lrossi', descendants=None, kids=[25668298], score=None, time=1609974205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662824, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sunsetcss.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sunsetcss.com&#x2F;</a> has some nice demos.<p>I liked most the wobble: it works great for giving feedback on error when a button cannot do something.<p>However I would not use many of these effects. You are showing them in terms of their implementation, instead of functionality&#x2F;use case.<p>My advice is to offer ready to use effects tailored for specific usecases.<p>Maybe also combine with popular frameworks; Tailwind combined with this might be interesting.')
