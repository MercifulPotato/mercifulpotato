The\nrecord holder in that regard is still the Apple II with 30ms[0].<p>But I agree, modern software should react much faster. It&#x27;s kind\nof weird how on one hand we have hardware that can run VR with\n120Hz and extremely low input latency, and at the same time some\nprograms that only need to display and change a couple bytes in\na text file need 4 seconds to even start.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;input-lag&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;input-lag&#x2F;</a>')
