The choice given to Google is either you link news and pay Aussie firms, or you offer zero news at all.<p>This prevents Google from simply delisting local media and offering up alternative US, UK, Canadian, NZer sites that would - sensing new eyeballs - likely step up and cover Aussie news.<p>In addition, Google has to give the media companies 14 days advance warning of any change to their search algorithm that might impact the media organizations. In reality, that probably means giving this subset of corporations in Australia a heads-up on <i>every</i> algorithm change.<p>Hence, Google’s choice is less about &#x27;list Aussie news and pay&#x27; or &#x27;list no Aussie news’, it’s ‘list Aussie news and pay and share your search algorithm changes in advance of any change’ or ‘don’t offer search in Australia’.<p>Facebook (also concerned by the changes) has already said&#x2F;threatened to stop sharing of news articles in Australia to align with the regulation. If Google also pulled back, I’m not sure the media companies would be so very happy.')
