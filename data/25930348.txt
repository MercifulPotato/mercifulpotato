That is exactly what Enron did - they used to sign a contract and <i>immediately</i> book all the <i>projected</i> profits.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>1) If the goods weren&#x27;t delivered and the customer hasn&#x27;t paid then they&#x27;re in the inventory on the balance sheet (assuming the goods were already produced) and nothing is in the income statement.<p>2) If the goods were delivered but the customer hasn&#x27;t paid then this is in accounts receivable on the assets in the balance sheet and in the revenue in the income statement.<p>3) If the goods were delivered and the customer has paid then this is in cash on the balance sheet and in the revenue in the income statement.<p>4) If the goods weren&#x27;t delivered but the customer has already (pre)paid then this is in cash on the balance sheet, but also in deferred revenue in liabilities, and <i>not</i> in the revenue in the income statement.<p>TL;DR: you can only recognize revenue if you deliver the product&#x2F;service, until that time it&#x27;s either just inventory (asset) or inventory(asset)+cash(asset)+deferred revenue(liability).
