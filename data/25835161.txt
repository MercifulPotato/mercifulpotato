And as far as I know, Amazon hasn&#x27;t either. Have I missed something from them?<p>I&#x27;m talking about the general sentiment here. Either Amazon have been playing by the rules and Elastic is within their rights to change those rules, so no problem anywhere, or Amazon has been harming a part of the OSS ecosystem and forced Elastic to make an unpopular change.<p>&gt; Amazon used Elastic per terms of the license<p>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have used &quot;in the wrong&quot; and said &quot;is the problem&quot; instead.

That&#x27;s a win-win situation to me.')
