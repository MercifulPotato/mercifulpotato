See the map at the bottom of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statehood.dc.gov&#x2F;page&#x2F;resource-center" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statehood.dc.gov&#x2F;page&#x2F;resource-center</a> .<p>If you haven&#x27;t been to DC or looked closely at a map, it might surprise you that the vast majority of it is an ordinary city with residences and shops and schools, and the seat of federal government is a pretty small area. I didn&#x27;t actually realize that until poking at a map and talking with friends who have lived in DC - I had the impression that DC was <i>already</i> small and most non-federal stuff was across the border in Virginia or Maryland, but that isn&#x27;t actually true. DC is larger in area than SF!<p>(Also, federal districts like DC are relatively rare: most other countries don&#x27;t have them. The hypothesis may not have changed since the founding, but we have a couple of centuries of experimental data now. Even the UN has buildings in Manhattan that are part of Manhattan and the US and not a separate UN exclave - I can and do bike down First Avenue, with UN buildings on both sides, without going through a border crossing.)')
