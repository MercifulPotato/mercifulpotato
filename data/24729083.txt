The main space Facebook has is social advertising and there is no competitors and anyone tries to enter that market gets attacked by Facebook since Facebook runs it. Try starting a company that will allow you to buy influencer ads on Instagram and uses the API the influencer can grant to you to correctly identify how much money to pay the influencer. Facebook will remove your API access the minute it realises you&#x27;re trying to do advertising and they&#x27;re not getting a cut. Facebook are very open that their problem is they&#x27;re not making any money on it. We understand their reasoning but it&#x27;s againist the law to then sue companies for trying to get public data and the other attacks. If Google can&#x27;t rank it&#x27;s own products higher in google search Facebook shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to remove API access solely because you&#x27;re providing a service they don&#x27;t even provide and don&#x27;t even want to provide.')
