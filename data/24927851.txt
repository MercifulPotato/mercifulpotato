Combined with the subsequent follow-through, it would be pretty straightforward to attribute the folks who said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to do this thing soon&quot; as the folks who then ended up doing exactly that thing.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I know nothing more about this than what was presented in the article.')
