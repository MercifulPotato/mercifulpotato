It was untested and, by any reasonable definition of common expert knowledge, a far bet.<p>Saying this list’s existence disproves SpaceX’s technological work is arguing home brewers as evidence that Apple did nothing groundbreaking. Or Alberto Santos-Dumont as evidence the Wright Brothers were just incremental inventors.<p>Yes, they weren’t the <i>only</i> ones on the bleeding edge. But they <i>were</i> right there on it, and doing the lion’s share of the pushing of it.<p>&gt; <i>better equipped than many, though not all</i><p>SpaceX is miles ahead of all of them. Literally, hundreds of thousands of miles of flight time ahead. Ahead in vehicle manufacturing. Number of engineers working on number of problem domains. Hell, out of your list, only Scaled Composites still builds anything.<p>If we say SpaceX does no science, we must argue that the Japanese and Indian space programs do no science. Which nobody claims because it’s baseless. Designing new motors and engines and control systems and crew capsules and space suits and ultrasonic reëntry systems requires new science, technology and production expertise.')
