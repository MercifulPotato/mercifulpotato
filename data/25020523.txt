It is deeply ingrained in the culture of this country that the gov&#x27;t is bad, and private corporations are good.  So we willingly accept death panels as long as it&#x27;s some faceless insurance company, because hey, it&#x27;s not the gov&#x27;t.<p>Nevermind that we arguably have more control over the gov&#x27;t than we do a faceless corporation.  Short of changing jobs, I don&#x27;t really have any leverage over my insurance provider.')
