It’s extremely trivial for those in SF to move anywhere else in CA without having to even change their tax status (Edit: for withholding. Crossing state lines is more of a paperwork hassle for some companies), depriving SF of rents and taxes. And that’s not even counting the people willing to leave California for the various PADS (Portland, Austin, Seattle, Denver) cities.<p>This coming decade is going to be bad for SF.
