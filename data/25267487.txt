So why the fuck would anyone trust google that the capital of Texas is Austin? Because you think you can intuit the boundaries of what their AI will and won&#x27;t fuck up?

Because once the obvious things are fixed the un-obvious ones will linger as even more unwarranted trust is be placed in the feature.
