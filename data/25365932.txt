It&#x27;s simply a technical&#x2F;design lock-in. Going from unstructured to structured data presents problems, and if you do that, it&#x27;s rightfully up to you to fix.<p>It is different from the vendor lock-in that prevents one from migrating from AWS to Google Cloud because all of your code uses their APIs and libraries specifically.<p>However, the effect is the same, of course. You are locked in! It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but this is why you must choose your poison carefully.')
