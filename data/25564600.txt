Sequential yes, but almost all backup tasks are sequential.<p>Optical has 10MB&#x2F;s or so. You get more out of a 100Mbps connection to (insert cloud storage provider here), let alone Gbps.<p>At a minimum, a modern, reasonable mechanism for backups needs to be faster than cloud (100Mbps or Gbps), otherwise its basically worthless to the consumer. Hard drives and Tape get there, but there was no real way to improve Optical&#x27;s read&#x2F;write performance (outside of overengineered &quot;jukebox&quot; robots available to Facebook and a few other select groups), so it went fully obsolete.')
