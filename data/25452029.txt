I had been under the impression that police had better salaries than what appears to be the case. A quick web search suggests that the average salary is roughly $60-65k. I had thought they were more around $80-120k, depending on position and seniority. I don’t recall where I got that impression.<p>As mentioned by others, cashiers are monitored by security cameras constantly. It’s just that footage of them stealing from the till doesn’t go viral.
