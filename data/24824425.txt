It’s not as common in the US to have a trailer with a car (as opposed to a pickup truck), but you can do so much (and replace an expensive truck with a cheap car). Dump runs, green waste, buying appliances or bulky items, cleanups, helping friends, etc.<p>I’m not even sure my car is rated for towing (the hitch is for a bike rack that I also use) but as long as the load is small (under 1000 lbs) and the road is flat, it’s fine (I do have the lights harness and safety chains). I can’t tow a boat or a horse trailer over the Rockies, but I could take a jet ski to the local lake.')
