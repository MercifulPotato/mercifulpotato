Wanted to give some background and the TLDR version.<p>I’ve never been great at design; the idea of designing a logo I was proud of has always seemed daunting.<p>Over the last few months, I’ve been hacking away at a few side projects, all web apps. In doing so, I put together a repeatable process for designing an above-average logo as a non-designer.<p><i></i>I break it down into 4 steps:<i></i><p>1. Choose a color palette - I stumbled upon this site called Colorhunt (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colorhunt.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colorhunt.co&#x2F;</a>) on ProductHunt awhile back.<p>2. Choose a Google Font - I find it easiest to start by Googling for some articles where authors list their favorites.<p>3. Find a logo mark - I’ve used free icons on Flaticon. You need to include an attribution link for your free icons, but I don’t mind doing that for side projects.<p>I recently discovered that if you download an SVG file, you can import it into a design tool like Figma and edit it!<p>4. Combine logo text and mark in Figma<p><i></i>For you non-designers out there, how do you make your logos?<i></i>')
