I am astronomically offended at the idea of &quot;midday&quot; meaning &quot;an hour before the sun is at its highest&quot;. That&#x27;s just wrong.<p>If we&#x27;re doing away with DST, so be it. I mean, it&#x27;ll be horrible in the winter when sunrise is at like 9AM (or in the summer when it sets at 8PM, depending on which option you choose), but I understand the arguments.<p>But if we get rid of it, permanent standard time is the only sane choice.')
