I meant:<p>Some of what you are saying I agree with and believe is true. Other parts of what you are saying are, I believe, overly reductive and not accurate. I think your post articulates some important points and also overlooks some. But they&#x27;re also kinda mixed together and there&#x27;s a lot there, so, tbh, I can&#x27;t take the time to fully parse out your comment and respond with the kind of clarity one ideally would wish to in an intellectual discussion, the kind you know that would stand up to analysis and reasoned argument. So, do I agree with you? Ehh, yes and no?<p>Just kind of imagine me saying it with a Larry David voice, if you&#x27;ve ever watched the show &#x27;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#x27; (speaking of American cultural imperialism&#x2F;colonization lol).')
