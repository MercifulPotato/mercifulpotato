Here are a few reasons off the top of my head.<p>1. Many users have issues where the unmute button is unresponsive. Typically the workaround is to turn off incoming video feeds which isn&#x27;t exactly ideal. This is a major turnoff.<p>2. Difficult to stay involved in multiple channels as described by another comment. I find it tedious to find what&#x27;s happened if I&#x27;ve been away for a while.<p>3. Slack has bots that do various helpful things including leaving channels you don&#x27;t use, asking you for your daily standup feedback if you don&#x27;t have an in person meeting, referencing external content, etc. I assume Teams must have something similar but I&#x27;ve never seen them used which likely indicates its a lot easier to do with Slack.<p>4. Nicer UI as you allude to yourself<p>5. Slack works with several video chat options including their own (based on AWS tools I believe?) and Zoom. I actually prefer Slack video chat over Zoom or Teams for pair programming as its so easy to annotate the screen without clicking into a bunch of menus or being the meeting owner or something. You literally just start drawing on the screen and your coworkers see it<p>6. Excellent mobile app which is quite important for a chat client<p>7. Ability to run a small chatroom for free which AFAIK Microsoft doesn&#x27;t offer (its included with other Microsoft products that were paid for usually)<p>8. Not tied in to only Microsoft products')
