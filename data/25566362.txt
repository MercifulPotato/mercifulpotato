There is also the &quot;replace by fee&quot; stuff that allows BCH to make instant payments with 0 confirmations for small values.<p>Can you elaborate on this? I did a quick search and the gist of it seems to be that BCH doesn&#x27;t support replace by fee and bitcoin does, so therefore it&#x27;s possible to &quot;safely&quot; accept 0 confirmation transactions on BCH because you can reasonably believe that it won&#x27;t be double-spent before it gets its first confirmation. The only problem I can think of is that there&#x27;s nothing preventing the attacker (the person making the purchase) from bribing a miner to mine his double spend transaction. Indeed, even without RPF there are &quot;transaction accelerators&quot;[1] that allow you make out of band payments to miners to increase your transaction&#x27;s priority. It&#x27;s not too hard to imagine a service where you can pay $$$ for a miner to mine your double-spend transaction.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transaction_accelerator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transaction_accelerator</a>')
