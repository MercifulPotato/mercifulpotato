I saw delivery drones on the list. I&#x27;m skeptical of this idea for consumers but could see the military using it for resupply logistics or something like that, but what always surprises me is how they use quadcopters (or some other type of multicopter with no swashplate). Seems like you&#x27;d want something like an autonomous Chinook (scaled down obviously) or other heavy lift helicopter if you were really going to pursue this idea. And while electric is sexy, from a cost perspective some sort of piston or turbine engine seems more reasonable unless distances traveled are really short and the batteries are swappable.')
