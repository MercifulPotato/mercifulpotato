When the PBS children&#x27;s show The Electric Company starts with the cry, &quot;Hey, you guys!&quot; it is not excluding the female of the species.  It&#x27;s an idiom.<p>There are places where &quot;you guys&quot; is unusual.  For example, when I moved to a certain part of Texas, it was unfamiliar to the people living there.  Perhaps you live in a place where &quot;guys&quot; is uncommon and are unfamiliar with the term.  In that case, I suggest you respect other people&#x27;s cultures and embrace diversity.')
