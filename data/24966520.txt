It&#x27;s the constant need to receive emails as others have noted below is my fear.<p>If I&#x27;ll get locked out will I be able to reset my password to the other bank account I almost forgot about? How long will it take for my old recruters to figure out not to mail me there? etc.<p>I run Thunderbird sometimes on desktop to cache all emails locally. I also have a NAS wich is downloading emails 24&#x2F;7 and I can browse all locally from backup. This also gets backed up to 2 other locations :)')
