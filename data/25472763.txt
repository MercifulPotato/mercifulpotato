Though using a backpack + monitor + keyboard + mac mini + uninterruptible power supply is ... well ... maybe not too practical. It&#x27;s hard to decide.<p>Perhaps the most HN comment ever. :-)<p>The Mini is great if it’s sitting under your desk. I’ve had one running for 10 years now. OS updates stopped last year but for what I use it for, it’s a champion.<p>But c’mon, the idea of schlepping it around with a portable tiny monitor is madness. Think of the time you save in build time and how badly it’s offset by the setup time for the Mini + all the gear every time you get a place.<p>Get the Air.')
