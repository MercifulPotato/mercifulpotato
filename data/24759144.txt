Just saying.<p>On that point, my next machine will be in the cloud.  32 GB laptops cost around $1,500.  For the same cost I can buy 6,250 hours on a VPS ($.24 &#x2F; hr) which is three years&#x27; working-hours use.  It&#x27;s even cheaper if I only need all 32 GB for a fraction of the time.<p>In return I get zero risk of theft, zero risk of hardware faults, zero capital outlay.  The best part is that I can try it for a month for $10[1] and if I don&#x27;t like it I can revert to the status quo!<p>[1] I&#x27;ll probably start with an 8 GB machine')
