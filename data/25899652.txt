Charging in 2-5 minutes for 300 miles of range is still 5-10 years away, and is likely to cause accelerated wear on the battery pack. Also charging locations will be more difficult as you now need to supply 1 megawatt per station rather than the 120-250kW you need now. The charging station will likely need to charge your car from a bigger battery at the station as power companies are not fans of people suddenly[0] connecting and disconnecting several 1MW loads.<p>Day to day charging of batteries is likely to remain around 6-8hrs just to reduce wear on the battery pack.<p>[0]: Sudden for most power companies is anything measured in minutes. Also, they will likely flat out prohibit you from turning on your load when the grid is near capacity, unless you want to pay ruinous rates, like $10+&#x2F;kW&#x2F;hr.')
