She would say, &quot;Why do you use this word fair? Life is not fair. It is a useless idea.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI can see the point of that, to a certain extent.<p>We [well most of us] are brought up to play fair and with a deeply inculcated sense that it&#x27;s shameful to cheat and that &quot;cheaters never win&quot;.  Then [in my case anyway], when we get a bit older and more worldly wise we realise that there are people everywhere, richer and more successful than us. Not because they&#x27;re better or cleverer but because they went to the right school, or they knew the right people, or they had the right parents, or they could use money and&#x2F;or influence to get out of trouble. That, in essence, they didn&#x27;t have to play by the same rules as the rest of us. And, isn&#x27;t that by definition &quot;cheating&quot;?  In this case, cheating at life. I sometimes think maybe I&#x27;d have achieved a lot more, without the burden of having such a heightened sense of morality and fair play as I do.<p>I&#x27;d never contemplate cheating when playing a game for enjoyment though. Because that enjoyment comes from the self-satisfaction of getting a wee bit better each time. I think in most sports&#x2F;hobbies&#x2F;games the old clich√© is true. In the end, you&#x27;re competing against yourself. So there&#x27;s no point in cheating.')
