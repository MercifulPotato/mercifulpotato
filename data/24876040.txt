For example, the first phase allows an exception-handling mechanism to dismiss an exception before stack unwinding begins, which allows resumptive exception handling (correcting the exceptional condition and resuming execution at the point where it was raised). While C++ does not support resumptive exception handling, other languages do, and the two-phase model allows C++ to coexist with those languages on the stack.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itanium-cxx-abi.github.io&#x2F;cxx-abi&#x2F;abi-eh.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;itanium-cxx-abi.github.io&#x2F;cxx-abi&#x2F;abi-eh.html</a>')
