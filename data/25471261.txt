I have dozens of hours and I only ran into a single bug that forced me to reload. Everything else I have seen have been cosmetic issues.<p>Cosmetic issues in a game that is supposed to be a 3D immersive world are really bad issues. We shouldn&#x27;t be writing them off as minor.<p>We should expect better for $59.99 after years of development. We should not normalize the expectation that new games will be half-baked. New games should be finished, and they should work properly on all of the platforms they claim to support.<p>If you want to play unfinished games, there is Steam Early Access. All other games are supposed to be finished when they are sold. And if they don&#x27;t work on the PS4 they should not be sold for the PS4!')
