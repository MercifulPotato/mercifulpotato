Otherwise your teammates aren&#x27;t going to be very happy that you&#x27;re writing it that way.<p>This defines some subset of computable functions that has some real nice properties. Eventually I expect us to gain more and more understanding of where that boundary lies, defining humans-give-a-shit-about-these-programs-space. Over time, I expect our tools will slowly gain the ability to automatically check the things that we care about and restrict us from doing it in ways that get too hairy. I expect that that future is a very long way off.')
