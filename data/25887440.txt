The clients you would like to sync just need to enter the same sync id and password. If I understand right, the password is used to encrypt your data on client-side. The server (called &quot;service&quot; in xbrowsersync lingo) only sees an anonymous sync id with a binary blob it can&#x27;t read.<p>If a sync id is not used for a while, the associated stored data gets deleted. That&#x27;s it. There is no &quot;account&quot; in the traditional sense. I really like this simplistic approach.<p>It&#x27;s even open-source.<p>You don&#x27;t need to use the default <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.xbrowsersync.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.xbrowsersync.org</a> service but can also host it yourself.<p>I&#x27;m using it and it works quite good. Every now and then sync fails, but I think I narrowed it down: It fails only when you create a bookmark in a just-created directory. But am not sure and didn&#x27;t file a bug report, though.')
