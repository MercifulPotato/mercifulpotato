If housing prices surge and you&#x27;re renting, then you might not be afford to continue to live in your rented home, and so you might need to move; insurance against this sort of disruption is worth more than $0 to pretty much everyone and so it should be included in the cost&#x2F;benefit consideration.<p>Put more generally, your model should consider not just the possibility that growth in your real estate market is 1% YoY for the next 30 years, but also 10% YoY and -10% YoY. The advantage of renting of course is that if housing prices collapse, then you either pay less or can pay the same and upgrade.<p>&gt; Between 1948 and 2004 the real increase in value in the U.S real estate market was less than 1% a year.<p>True but not the whole picture; buying a house doesn&#x27;t give you exposure to &quot;the US real estate market&quot; in aggregate, you get exposure to a hyper-localized slice of the market, i.e. the neighborhood in which you buy your house. For example in the Bay Area you&#x27;re looking at something like 5-10% YoY increases over the last few decades, and in the same period I imagine that prices have gone down in Flint, MI. This would be like saying &quot;the stock market increases by 8% YoY on average&quot; in an article about &quot;should I buy AAPL&quot;; you can see that it&#x27;s relevant information that should be considered but it&#x27;s not sufficiently specific to stand as an argument on its own.')
