Inefficient in many ways (parking, space utilization, HVAC), but the idea of locating teams in small (fishbowl?) office-like pods seems interesting.<p>Natural light would be a problem. The food court could be appealing...<p>Some of the complaints you mention sound like they might be specific to that building? Commercial floors should be standard build slab&#x2F;tray concrete in a mall or office building. Retail HVAC should be adequate if inefficient.. Then again, a failed mall might have failed for a long list of reasons, and a crappy physical plant is definitely one of them!')
