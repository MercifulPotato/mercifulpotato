Should this also be extended to other races or ethnicities? (e.g Iranians, Vietnamese, Latinx, Greeks) Should we maintain a ratio of doctors according to race percentages? What should we do with those ethnicities that are over represented in medicine, should we curtail them? What do we do with mixed race patients?')
