Whilst I was on a long training run round the city, I received a message that the marathon was just cancelled. At this point I decided to run as far as possible as it was my only chance to do so. Around half way I started to get a weird pain in the side of my ankle but pushed through it.<p>I still have that pain almost a year later, multiple MRIs and orthopedics have been unsuccessful in finding out what it is. I&#x27;m only now able to run very short (2.5km) distances. Pushing yourself to ignore pain is very possible and can be very dangerous.')
