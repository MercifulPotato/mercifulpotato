Many non-smokers actually do enjoy the smell of an unlit real cigar, some even like the smoke smell (to a degree). As a cigar smoker, I could never smoke a Marlboro cig or of that ilk. Those smell horrid. All jokes aside, it&#x27;s almost like the difference between organic and &quot;conventional&quot;. So them using smoking as an air freshener is a pretty legit way of covering up horse shit stench.<p>Before anyone says it, yes it&#x27;s still bad for me, no I don&#x27;t care.')
