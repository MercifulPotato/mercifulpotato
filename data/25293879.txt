Anything new that comes now can be built according to the expectations smartphones have set over the past decade and a half. Closed systems that are treated like disposable items. Even PCs in their mobile incarnation are now far less open and flexible than they used to be.<p>The reason PCs are still open is historical, they started like this and people can&#x27;t really see <i>PCs</i> any other way but they&#x27;re a dying breed and whatever comes after is a different game with different rules. We&#x27;ll have some niche manufacturer building something more open for the small segment of enthusiasts.')
