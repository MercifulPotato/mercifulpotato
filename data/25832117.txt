The title mentions only Google.<p>2. The article then talks about both Facebook and Google and links to some of Facebook&#x27;s most egregious incidents like data sharing, Cambridge Analytica, WhatsApp.<p>3. The article then proceeds to tell you how to leave Google.<p>It just comes across in a bad way. Don&#x27;t mix up the two companies - they aren&#x27;t equivalent.
