Objectivism? Marxism? Freebasing Solipsism?<p>I&#x27;m only somewhat subscribe to one of those philosophies and none of them are treated very charitably by you. Besides that, as much as I disagree with the statement you&#x27;re replying to, it&#x27;s not a philosophy, it&#x27;s an empirical statement.

The fact that people believe in morality does not mean we have access to the world of moral facts. Moral facts are supposed to motivate us inherently, which is a perculiar quality for a fact to have.')
