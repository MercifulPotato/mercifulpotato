Is all talk of election fraud fake news, or is it only applicable when your candidate seemingly won? Its mere months ago that everyone left to right was frothing at their mouth due to the election in Belarus...<p>I find it scary that sites like twitter dare to put a sticker on what they believe is fake or misleading, especially when we are talking hundreds of unique video clips and pictures showing obvious dubious actions by election officials, have a particular video been &quot;debunked&quot; ? Fine put on a note saying its false, but I find it dystopic that americans are fine with mega corps defining what truth is...<p>You have to be pretty blind not to at least think that there was some odd stuff going on in the US elections. The states have become a banana republic where the democrats have become dependent on ballot harvesting of the uneducated masses.<p>Two party system, every 4 years you must choose between the giant douch√© or the turd sandwich. The whole world is laughing at Americans and their interpretation of democracy.')
