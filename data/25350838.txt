Item(by='michaelt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607459063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344530, text='<i>&gt; For some reason you&#x27;re completely ignoring the positive test results</i><p>For a good reason.<p>By almost all the statistics, the second wave hasn&#x27;t been as bad as the first. Comparing peaks, measures like &quot;Deaths within 28 days of positive test&quot; (942 vs 486) and &quot;Weekly deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate&quot; (9,495 vs 3,371) and &quot;Patients in hospital&quot; (19,518 vs 16,421) and &quot;Patients in mechanical ventilation beds&quot; (3,252 vs 1,461) say the second peak was about half the height of the first one.<p>On the other hand, &quot;Cases by date reported&quot; peaked at 5,113 in the first lockdown and 25,329 in the second lockdown - making the second wave 5x higher than the first. Presumably due to a lack of test capacity.<p>If I&#x27;d chosen the one metric which makes the second wave look 5x the first instead of 0.5x, that&#x27;d be a pretty deceptive way of describing the results of government policy (although technically accurate).')
