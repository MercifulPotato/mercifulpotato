What you&#x27;re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU&#x2F;Linux, or as I&#x27;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but<p>sure you can contribute to the Linux kernel pseudonymously. Think of a plausible name, &quot;git commit --signoff&quot;, and you&#x27;re good to go. There&#x27;s no <i>enforcement</i> of slave names for kernel contributions, it&#x27;s all just a minimally viable legal fiction.')
