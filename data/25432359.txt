Up to 1 in 12 people are at the very least at the OSDD-1b spectrum, down to 1 in 100ish and &gt; with DID, so it&#x27;s super common.<p>Most people don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re systems, but usually it involves a lot of talking to one&#x27;s self, having a lot of very distinct &quot;modes&quot;, certain kinds of memory issues&#x2F;weird amnesia&#x2F;short term stuff, the ability&#x2F;feeling like you could be really good friends with yourself (alternately, the ability to deeply hate yourself as well), and being able to go from having an amazing day to absolute raw terror, not even recognizing it because of emotional amnesia.<p>So yes, it is normal, and this sounds very system-ey. If you are a system, don&#x27;t pass over this! Discovering your dissociative spectrum tendencies, if you have them, is very hard and requires a lot of effort, but it is a transition that is very significantly life-changing, in a very positive direction.<p>The most important thing is that if your identity is fragmented, most people only focus on meeting the needs&#x2F;listening to the people near the front of the brain&#x2F;consciousness, so the younger alters&#x2F;personality states&#x2F;people&#x2F;etc. get ignored and there&#x27;s always anxiety and never-ending loops of feeling a desperate need for something but not getting it (because communication between people in the brain -- and yes, they are individual people! you can share multiple people in a brain, it&#x27;s just like your body is more of a mech than anything else -- is usually completely cut off with DID and vastly inhibited with dissociative spectrum disorders, but the emotions eventually build up under pressure and finally leak out there.)')
