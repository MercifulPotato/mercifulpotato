Mine’s something like <i>91xxxx.wa.efo@bankname</i>. Life would be a lot easier if we get something like <i>91xxx@whatsapp</i>. That would also enable me to pay directly via WA while shopping on Amazon&#x2F; Flipkart. Currently, I depend on PhonePe and PayTM to complete my online transactions using UPI. I understand the characters succeeding @ is mostly a bank name offering UPI platform but even taking that into consideration, a username like 91xxx.wa@bankname would be much more convenient.<p>PS - I know “wa” in my username stands for WhatsApp but have no idea about “efo”. If someone would kindly proffer a suggestion.')
