A lot of the time you only know the people you&#x27;re interacting with as a screen name, so you don&#x27;t even know their race or gender.  And 100% of the content of the discussion is either <i>purely</i> technical in nature (e.g. how do I use this API feature, what JSON structure is expected etc) or is something operational like the timelines and priorities of the project.<p>It&#x27;s just hard to imagine how racism or sexism would enter into to a community like this because the race and sex of the participants is not known, and you&#x27;re not even discussing races or genders at all, heck you&#x27;re generally not discussing people at all.')
