Readable bytes -&gt; Preview -&gt; unreadable bytes is my mental model so far.<p>Edit: absolutely unacceptable this is downvoted to -4. I&#x27;ve observed for a couple months  that participation in Apple-related threads, outside indignation that Apple was involved in the discussion at all, gets down to -5 before getting back to -1 a day or two later. No matter what tone is used, this happens, and it makes the problem even worse in the long run. Been here 10 years, always been a _slight_ problem, but over the last year, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to participate without continuing to slowly destroy my 11 year old account. Not sure how much longer I can keep trying.')
