I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true. I reckon if the battery is designed to take fast charging all the time, it should be okay. Another thing that affects batteries is weather. In colder climates like Europe you&#x27;re probably okay. We have had reports of batteries losing half their capacity due to heat in Australia. Those were all Nissan Leafs, which didn&#x27;t have any active cooling in place. We don&#x27;t have an extensive supercharger network either. You&#x27;ll probably be okay in East coast region. Forget about charging your car, in some remote areas you&#x27;re probably not gonna get petrol either. You can only get diesel. Seems like EU is far ahead in EV adoption than AU.')
