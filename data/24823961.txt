At a previous company I was the one and only Principal engineer in a division with enough Sr.Directors (equivalent level there) to fill a school bus.<p>Currently I&#x27;m at a Distinguished engineer level which is even more limited, but it is still less than a VP. But we have hundreds of VPs of this and that on the management ladder.<p>The fact that you bring up celebrity engineers as examples pretty much showcases the problem. There are very, very few of them.')
