Instructions can fit inside that 512kB L2 cache just fine.<p>AMD Zen 3 has 32MB L3 cache across 8-cores.<p>By all accounts, Zen3 has &quot;more cache per core&quot; than Apple&#x27;s M1. The question whether AMD&#x27;s (or Intel&#x27;s) L1&#x2F;L2 split is worthwhile.<p>---------<p>The difference in cache, is that Apple has decided on having an L1 cache that&#x27;s smaller than AMD &#x2F; Intel&#x27;s L2 cache, but larger than AMD &#x2F; Intel&#x27;s L1 cache. That&#x27;s it.<p>Its a question of cache configuration: &quot;flatter&quot; 2-level cache on M1 vs a &quot;bigger&quot; 3-level cache on Skylake &#x2F; Zen.<p>-------<p>That&#x27;s the thing: its a very complicated question. Bigger caches simply have more latency. There&#x27;s no way around that problem. That&#x27;s why x86 processors have multi-tiered caches.<p>Apple has gone against the grain, and made an absurdly large L1 cache, and skipped the intermediate cache entirely. I&#x27;m sure Apple engineers have done their research into it, but there&#x27;s nothing simple about this decision at all. I&#x27;m interested to see how this performs in the future (whether new bottlenecks will come forth).')
