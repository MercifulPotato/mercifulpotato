People who <i>actively</i> try to ban same-sex marriage are just as bad as segregation was back in the day.<p>Calling this &quot;narrow ideology&quot; is preposterous.<p>There is nothing wrong with homosexuality and they should be given the same rights as everyone else.  It&#x27;s NOT a debate.  So if someone is actively trying to campaign against equality then they are flat out wrong and deserve the backlash.')
