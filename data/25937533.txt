What will under normal circumstances keep a put close to the &quot;correct&quot; price? Well, if the price goes too high, people will start writing puts, driving the price down.<p>If you write a put, you&#x27;re long the stock. To hedge yourself, you&#x27;ll need to short it. To the extent that that is difficult right now, nobody will be willing to write puts. (Strictly speaking, the put is so out of the money right now, that one would not have to short much today. But as soon as the stock price falls and approaches the strike, the writer of the put would need to start shorting. &quot;Hey, anyone got some shares I could borrow?&quot;)<p>On the other hand, if you want to take a negative view on the company, buying a put is sensible thing to do. That&#x27;ll drive the price of the puts up.')
