Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=[25635433], score=None, time=1609781414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634177, text='It&#x27;s not a huge stretch to imagine the following scenario play out though:<p>1. Tech workers unionize, negotiate with employer that any work &gt; 40 hours &#x2F; week get paid overtime.<p>2. The company now has two choices: A) Pay their employees more than their competitors for the same work. Or B) Don&#x27;t authorize any overtime.<p>3. In scenario A, they&#x27;re either running at (much) higher cost than their competitors, and thus a disadvantage. In Scenario B, they&#x27;re either slower to ship products, or there&#x27;s a bunch of &quot;off the books&quot; work done by engineers trying to ship things anyways (which is basically the status quo today, except now it would cost you 1% of your salary).<p>I could see the first scenario potentially attracting better talent for the significantly higher pay in the short term. But it&#x27;s also a perverse incentive structure where if my 8 hours of work suddenly takes 9 hours, I get paid more, so why would I finish it early? Oh and because I&#x27;m in a union, it&#x27;s now much harder to get rid of me, even if I&#x27;m half-assing it.')
