I thought maybe there was history&#x2F;ties&#x2F;etc I was missing, but apparently it&#x27;s just some politically driven people spewing nonsense.<p>Perhaps foreigners just don&#x27;t know what &quot;common heritage&quot; means.<p>Spot the foreigner.<p>Edit: As I noted in my other comment, to say greeks and turks share the same heritage is like saying americans and native americans share the same heritage. American heritage stems from britain, but no sane person would claim that native american heritage comes from britain. I don&#x27;t think any sane person would associate the ottoman empire with greeks. They would associate it with the turks because it was a turkish empire. I bet most greeks see their heritage as ancient greece.')
