Look into contracting maybe, I&#x27;ve never heard of a contractor being on call.<p>Sleep matters.<p>I wonder if maybe it&#x27;s a FAANG thing that cheap startups try to copy?<p>We were on-call (a week every 3 months) with my last employer but it wasn&#x27;t too bad and it was spread equally across people. It wasn&#x27;t compensated but during the on-call you didn&#x27;t do any product work, just improving monitoring and alerts so that being on-call didn&#x27;t suck &amp; recovering if something happened at a bad time.<p>Still, being on-call sucked because we had too many stupid monitors checking on trivial things that weren&#x27;t important and that people were too afraid to touch.<p>A few other companies I&#x27;ve been at just have a dedicated infra team on-call, which gets paid more.<p>This sounds like a fair solution. I would&#x27;ve liked the extra money as a youngster and now I would gladly avoid messing up my limited sleep.')
