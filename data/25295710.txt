It&#x27;s on the big screen and it&#x27;s entertaining, in the same way a boxing or football match would be. People would cheer and enjoy those too. But is it cinema? I don&#x27;t think so, I would say that it&#x27;s a completely different form of visual entertainment that just so happens to share the medium and venue.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;martin-scorsese-marvel.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;martin-scorsese-m...</a>')
