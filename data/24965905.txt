Item(by='regularfry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604306962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965839, text='Yeah, so I watched a teardown from one of the sibling comments. Looks like there are vents underneath, but no fan (which would have ruined it for me). Turns out it&#x27;s got both a huge heat spreader and a newer version of the Broadcom SOC. That&#x27;s really interesting, because it means they&#x27;ve got the bugs ironed out to be able to do a better pi 4 board which isn&#x27;t so finicky about its enclosures. And that means I could potentially upgrade the pi 3 that&#x27;s currently sat in my dusty workshop without caring about fans getting clogged. (yes, I know there are passively-cooled pi 4 cases about. They don&#x27;t quite do it for me.)')
