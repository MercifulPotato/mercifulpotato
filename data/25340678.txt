Already, the PC laptop market is getting pummeled on both sides by Macs and Chromebooks, this will only accelerate that - no one with full conscience can recommend a PC laptop to a regular user anymore - go with a cheap chromebook or get an air at $1000.<p>Furthermore, the biggest casualty here is probably going to be Intel: graviton and M1 clearly show ARM is the future, so someone on the PC side is going to step up and create the M1 competition. It&#x27;s probably not going to be as good but comparable, but it&#x27;ll go circles around x86 again. This will then accelerate the transformation of more and more software to ARM compatibility and intel will probably play a similar song to Nokia or IBM and play a sad slow tune of death while it&#x27;s only customers would be lazy monoliths sticking to their old server architectures.')
