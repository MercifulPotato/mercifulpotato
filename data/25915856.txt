I went to a dinner 5 1&#x2F;2 years ago with my partner and 11 month old. Jim was so kind and seemed happy we came with a baby. He let us use his room when our kid was crying, and coming from big cities in the US, I wondered how he didn&#x27;t get everything ripped off.<p>The food wasn&#x27;t great - a massive, massive bowl of spaghetti - and it was so crowded it was hard to actually talk to and meet that many people, but they vibe was special. It was my parents&#x27; hippy idealism in plain, unassuming practice. I was hoping to go again when we could travel finally.')
