Rebooting a project or cloning another project and copying the old UI without sharing code isn&#x27;t necessarily hard.  I&#x27;ve done it plenty.  Netscape was already doing it internally—each platform&#x27;s (Unix, Windows, etc) GUI was a separate project.  The details don&#x27;t really match up, either.  Netscape 3 was written in C.  Netscape 6, Thunderbird et al are drawn by Gecko and written in JavaScript and XUL—which didn&#x27;t even exist at the time of Netscape 3.')
