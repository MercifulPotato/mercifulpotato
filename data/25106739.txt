Due to the tourism, it is rather loaded with good restaurants and entertainment like museums, Imax theater, camping, hiking, etc. Though you do have to deal with a lot of tourists and traffic during the summer busy season.<p>Some areas in Branson even have symetric fiber, I believe even gigabit.<p>You could probably get a nice house in a gated community on the golf course for $500k+.')
