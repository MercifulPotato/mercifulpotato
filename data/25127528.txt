Of course companies will think its great for them to have only one codebase for every platform, but applications built with Javascript or Typescript for the web, with eventual WASM module here and there will be a better fit, so it will be risky to try to cut expenses and development there.<p>WASM will be awesome to bring great tech that is only available in native platform to the web, like FFMPEG, or to accelerate some code that uses a lot of math. But i think that people that are going way down into this WASM rabbit hole will have a wake-up call pretty soon.<p>WASM will open some blue-seas for sure, but they are limited to some niche scenarios and using WASM for application development for the web, desktop and mobile wont be one of them.')
