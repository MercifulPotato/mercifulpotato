How do you characterize &quot;clock&quot; in this context? Base (minimum) and Boost (hard limit, now split to Max Turbo &lt;2C and All Boost MC) seem to be reasonably sensible numbers.<p>Now we can argue semantics all day, but to bring it back around if you&#x27;re just going to say &quot;top clocks&quot; is what the SoC was designed for at a specific workload&#x2F;power envelope (In AMD&#x27;s PB, that&#x27;d be PPT, TDC, and EDC) then <i>every</i> laptops will &quot;hit their top clocks with no issues,&quot; but I&#x27;d say that argument (statement?) is a bit circular&#x2F;pointless. ;P')
