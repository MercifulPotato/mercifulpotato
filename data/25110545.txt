I own an Android device and use Google services and yet, I&#x27;m perfectly capable of criticising Google and their practices (criticism that, I might add, is least as frequent on this page as criticism of Apple - see AMP et al.). I expect that especially on a forum such as this one, people would be able to make informed choices and understand trade-offs. To say &quot;I use Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Microsoft devices because the trade-offs work best for me&quot; is completely reasonable. What I don&#x27;t think is reasonable is to perceive any criticism of a big corporation whose products you happen to be using as a personal attack.')
