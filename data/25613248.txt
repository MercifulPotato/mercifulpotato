Item(by='JimDabell', descendants=None, kids=[25618867], score=None, time=1609599964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612992, text='&gt; This is a terrifying sentence to me, because what it implies but doesn&#x27;t say outright, is that there&#x27;s not a single person in the organization who actually fully knows what is being released. If there were, then they should already have this information!<p>It’s not the collection of the information that’s difficult, it’s delivering it to the user in an appropriate way when you use phased rollouts with feature flags.<p>The change log that the App Store presents to the user is static and identical for everybody.  The changes that a user actually experiences are not.  So you might have 0% of your users experiencing a certain feature when the release goes out, 10% a day later, 50% a day after that, and 100% at the end of the week.  Or, if the metrics show a bad response, it might end up at maximum 10% seeing it, and then it dropping back down to 0% the next day.<p>Apple gives you a static text field to enter the change log information, with limited length.  If you have ten different features to release, your users will all receive them at different times, and not all of them are guaranteed to make it out to everybody, how is a static text field supposed to deliver that information?')
