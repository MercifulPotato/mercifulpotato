What was the purpose of the protest on Jan 6?<p>It&#x27;s dishonest to equate the two.  Jan 6 protest existed explicitly to overthrow the democratic transfer of power in this country.<p>Multiple explosive devices were found, guns were found, and the crowd came armed with pepper spray and tasers and clubs.  They also were wearing body armor.  Your representation of the events of Jan 6 is completely at odds with all the video evidence (and there is a lot of that) that exists.<p>The murdered a cop, ffs.')
