It&#x27;s wonderful.<p>It&#x27;ll check for updates on launch, performing a single HTTP request, but if you really like you can disable that with an environment variable on first launch and a configuration option going forward.<p>We need more software like this, honestly. I hate how we as users have to depend on enormous multinational entities to get back the privacy we once had. I happily paid for my Ripcord license and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone else who cares about the same things I do :)')
