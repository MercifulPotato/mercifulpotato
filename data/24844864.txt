As the site is build with a static site generator (Zola), it would need to be an SSG friendly system.<p>The code is already hosted on Github, so I created a separate repo for the comments where each post would get an issue. Zola will pull all the comments on each issue on built time and embed them on the respective blog pages. A webhook on the repo will trigger a built when a new comment is made.<p>Can&#x27;t say this system is battle tested yet, as there&#x27;s been nary a comment posted, save for the couple test ones by me...')
