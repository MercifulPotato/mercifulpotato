They claim that the effect is a positive bias, but if that were the case, you&#x27;d expect the two lines to move roughly in parallel. Instead, they overlap, so that the bottom group is positively biased and the top group is negatively biased.<p>There is a suggestion that that&#x27;s caused by &quot;regression to the mean&quot;, but that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t match my understanding of regression to the mean. &quot;Regression to the mean&quot; implies some kind of outlier. And the outlier here is a consistent effect where the least knowledgeable quartile was the most overconfident. That is, the Dunning-Kruger effect.<p>This isn&#x27;t my area of expertise so perhaps I&#x27;m getting this wrong. And yes, I&#x27;m aware of the irony.')
