Sometimes setting boundaries, doing the work, can help the other person see the way their behavior is impacting you. Other times, it won&#x27;t, so if you want the relationship to continue you have to be willing to always and repeatedly do all the work to maintain the relationship. Without the other person being capable and willing to recognize their own issues (and maybe get some therapy), no amount of your own effort can effect a permanent change.')
