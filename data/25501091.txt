What other pieces of personal property does Western society openly embrace everyone owning but that can be used to murder people? I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the intent but when people call them murder machine the point they&#x27;re raising (hyperbolically) is that cars and dangerous pieces of machinery and that has to be taken into account more when we consider urban design.')
