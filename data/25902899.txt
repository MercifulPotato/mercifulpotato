I prefer them to almost any bug. They are very useful for pest control. Similar diet to spiders as I understand it, and I find them much less “frightening”. My deal with them is they need to stay out of my bed. They have had no issue with that...However, my wife’s rule is they have to stay out of her sight. she generally falls asleep on the earlier side. Especially now that we have children. This keeps the centipedes safe and the pest numbers low.')
