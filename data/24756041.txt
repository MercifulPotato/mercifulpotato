It seems to me we&#x27;d be remarkably better off with fewer kids. I reject the notion that systems optimizing for raising kids would put society in a superior place. I&#x27;m not against anyone having kids, but I reject the notion that it&#x27;s a benefit for society that we encourage people to bear and raise children. People will bear and raise children regardless and I think reducing incentives there would ultimately have better societal outcomes. This is reflected all over the world with developed countries having fewer kids per family. Correlation != causation, but it&#x27;s certainly evidence.')
