That long period was only used because it took that long time for enough people to catch Covid naturally for them to prove statistical effectiveness. In the current system, if Covid had been raging at an extreme rate they would have had enough positives in the control group after a month and ended the trial then. If it had been under control, it actually would have taken many more months to declare effectiveness even though the extra wait time would have shown no more data on safety.<p>Whether or not phase II was sufficient on its own they could have declared the vaccine <i>probably</i> safe a month after phase III began instead of after three months. This would have still saved 50,000 lives in the US at minimum.')
