ML is very good at building things much more general than rules.<p>As a person that’s built and deployed a lot of ML solutions in a related space and brought a product to market meant to help others do the same, we consistently ran into two main camps:  1) people that had a long history of rule writing and were unreasonably closed off to the idea that ML could help and 2) people that thought ML was magic and could do things it most certainly cannot.<p>I understand the sentiment of being skeptical in a world of outrageous claims from “fake it till you make it” startups,  but the idea that most ML is not better than rule based systems is just wrong. You need both and they solve slightly different problems.')
