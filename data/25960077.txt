Not an issue. Problem solved.<p>I&#x27;m old, anyway, and I&#x27;ve already learned that&#x27;s an automatic showstopper. No one wants to work with us older folks. It was pretty jarring, encountering that, as I had always worked on large, distributed, heterogenous, teams, my whole career, and was used to some basic respect. That seems to be something that isn&#x27;t really practiced, these days. It&#x27;s all about competing with each other.<p>I had to figure out how to do the kind of work that I need to do, alone. The only viable way, is to work with such a level of quality, that I can close the door on modules as I progress, and leave code of such quality, that I can go back and work on it fairly easily, as needed. It&#x27;s actually done at a ferocious pace. I&#x27;m having to take a break, for a bit, as I&#x27;m leaving the rest of the team behind, and they need time to catch up. It&#x27;s tax time, anyway, and I have a couple of businesses I need to get tied up.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s not what you want, but it is what some other folks want. It is certainly what I want. I simply won&#x27;t do bad quality work. It hurts, and I&#x27;m a wuss. I don&#x27;t like pain.')
