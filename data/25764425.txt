Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610556083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25764030, text='Right now it is entirely likely that people searching for 8chan are interested in it&#x27;s news value, so surfacing news stories about it-- with the wikipedia results at the top providing a &quot;what is 8chan&quot; result-- is entirely possible that it&#x27;s part of the &quot;secret sauce&quot;<p>Regardless, the true purpose of the &quot;secret sauce&quot; is to maximize use of the search engine to maximize ad impressions &amp; revenue. It could very well be the case that putting the actual 8chan website at the top of the listings wouldn&#x27;t actually do that. Advertisers are probably more likely to target attributes associated with people searching for 8chan-- news seekers-- rather than targeting 8chan itself. Just a guess though-- I&#x27;m essentially saying this behavior doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be Google messing with it&#x27;s secret sauce (although that is entirely possible too)')
