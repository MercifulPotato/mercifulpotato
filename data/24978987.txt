Either it causes CPI inflation immediately or it&#x27;s stored up for later. When money printing does not cause immediate CPI inflation, surplus money is stored in scarce assets which creates asset price inflation and increasing fragility which will inevitably lead to CPI inflation later.<p>The fact that new money is mostly backed by debt is irrelevant because those who own a lot of capital assets know that they will always be able to use their assets as collateral to take increasingly large loans in the future... Wealthy capital holders can always take new, bigger loans to pay off old smaller loans.<p>Those who value growth above independence must enslave themselves to banks in order to guarantee that they can keep borrowing in perpetuity. If you know that you can borrow in perpetuity to buyback your stock and make repayments on your old loans, then you can rest assured that debt is never going to be a problem for you. You can just do what the government does with treasury bonds; issue new bonds to pay off your old bonds; the government is not the only institution which can do this.')
