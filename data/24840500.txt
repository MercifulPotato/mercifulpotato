I think things have gotten better in the meantime. My father died last year and I decided to digitize our home videos to reminisce with.<p>The capture part was easy enough, did it over a single weekend. I bought a camera that could play the tapes (~$100) and an Elgato Video Capture (~$80). Quality was as good as possible from the tapes and no audio issues. I also did not want to use a third party because I was concerned they might botch the job &#x2F; lose the irreplaceable tapes &#x2F; etc.<p>The editing took about a month, I&#x27;ve never done video editing before. I just loaded up stuff in iMovie and grouped stuff together as it made sense to me. Most of the time was spent just watching the videos (I think I had around 60 hours of footage) which was enjoyable and necessary.<p>In terms of sharing, I paid a friend who does video editing to make a supercut of all the best moments and I screened it at the family Christmas (many laughs and tears). I gave folks thumb drives of clips that were specific to them, but honestly I&#x27;m not sure if people even watched them. The movie format made it more digestible.<p>If anyone wants the Elgato, I still have it and can give it to you for the cost of shipping. Also happy to refer you to my friend for editing needs, he&#x27;s very affordable.')
