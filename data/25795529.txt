Sure there may be some WISPs in the middle of nowhere which aren&#x27;t affected, but you&#x27;ve accomplished most of your goal.<p>There&#x27;s two ways for internet to be shut down.<p>One is legal -- the government tells registered ISPs &quot;stop forwarding packets&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t matter how good your connectivity is when you simply have to turn it off. Your protection there are courts etc, but it&#x27;s not technically difficult.<p>The other approach is extra-legal -- e.g a terrorist attack.<p>Just look at the effect from a car bomb in Nashville last month, I quote from a newspaper:<p>&gt; The immediate repercussions were surprisingly widespread. AT&amp;T customers lost service — phones, internet or video — across large parts of Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama. There were 911 centers in the region that couldn&#x27;t take calls; others didn&#x27;t receive crucial data associated with callers such as their locations. The Nashville police department&#x27;s phones and internet failed. Stores went cash-only.<p>&gt; At some hospitals, electronic medical records, internet service or phones stopped working. The Nashville airport halted flights for about three hours on Christmas. Rival carrier T-Mobile also had service issues as far away as Atlanta, 250 miles away, because the company uses AT&amp;T equipment for moving customer data from towers to the T-Mobile network.<p>The area effected was about 100,000 square miles, roughly the same size as Uganda. From one carbomb outside one building.<p>I think there&#x27;s only one major Internet Exchange point in Uganda (just like it seems there was one in the south east of the US), but there&#x27;s certainly multiple fibres in and out. If you&#x27;re in Mbarara and sending traffic to Rwanda it&#x27;s unlikely to go via Kampala.<p>Here&#x27;s a network map of one provider in Uganda: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcs-ea.com&#x2F;service&#x2F;uganda&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bcs-ea.com&#x2F;service&#x2F;uganda&#x2F;</a><p>The UK has a few exchanges, but almost everything runs through Docklands in London - various Telehouse buildings within a mile of each other, Telecity etc. Almost all internet traffic in the UK runs through London, and the sites that aren&#x27;t are owned by Linx (IXLeeds is the only one that isn&#x27;t).
