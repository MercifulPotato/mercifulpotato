Everything is just an opinion and subjective preference.<p>In fact point out any mistake to me ever made and I&#x27;ll just tell you that it&#x27;s just your opinion and I have a different one.<p>I&#x27;ll take it a step further and say that people can hold opinions but those opinions can be categorically wrong or right.<p>So this article is about one persons subjective opinion, but all his subjective opinions are definitively right and anyone who shares opposing opinions is wrong.<p>Just want to caveat this post with the fact that I&#x27;m just sharing my subjective opinion on this issue, you can agree or disagree.<p>But if you disagree with me then you are categorically mistaken, but again it&#x27;s just my opinion you have the freedom to form your own opinion.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s pointless to call something an objective opinion because literally that&#x27;s what everything is. The man calls aspects of css a design mistake, you disagree, prove to me why he&#x27;s wrong')
