Item(by='kthejoker2', descendants=None, kids=[25839576], score=None, time=1611087477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836026, text='&gt; Most of those didn&#x27;t have large groups just standing around waving signs and chanting -- almost everyone was involved in the violence and destruction<p>This is demonstrably false, and you should retract it.<p>Second, it is qualitatively different to riot and break into one of our main bodies of government and threaten the lives of anyone (even if it was just a select few out of the larger whole) during an important part of the process of our peaceful transition of power. To simply equate this rioting to this summer&#x27;s protests (and yes riots) and say &quot;it&#x27;s all wrong&quot; is to almost miss the point entirely about what the impact, the risks, and the response to these two things should be.<p>And while I would broadly agree that most of the content collected here is of angry, mostly harmless (and willfully misinformed) constituents asking for their voice to be heard, what I also saw was:<p>* Largely unanimous support for attacking the police,  breaking and entering into the Capitol, people cheering and laughing at everyone trespassing, breaking barricades. Definitely no signs of disapproval or concern for the police, the Congress, public property, or even the optics of the situation.<p>There were of course a couple of instances of &quot;don&#x27;t hurt the cops&quot; but they were completely outnumbered by the &quot;this is OUR HOUSE&quot;&#x2F;1776 crowd.<p>* If you just watch the last 2 hours of video - when the National Guard arrived, pushed people out of the building, then off the Capitol, out of the Mall, and so on - the videos turned extremely angry, negative, &quot;f*k the police&quot;, &quot;traitors!&quot; etc it is absolutely clear that the only reason you have such a positive vibe about the first half of the videos is because there was such little resistance to their actions during the first half.<p>If there had been armed National Guard presence there from the outset, this would&#x27;ve been much uglier, without the &quot;waving flags and chanting&quot; you see.')
