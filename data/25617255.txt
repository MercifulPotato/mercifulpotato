It&#x27;s the closest I know of to &quot;Google Maps, but open source and based on open data&quot;. It was an app built for _end users_, not OSM editors. And it worked pretty darn well. When it didn&#x27;t, any problems could (at least theoretically) be addressed with improvements to OSM data or the Mapzen open-source projects.<p>There was a team of at least two people working on it full time, plus lots of work on the design, product, and integration with geocoding, routing, transit etc. The multi-modal (switching from walking to transit to car, etc) transit directions were particularly awesome.<p>I used it as my daily driver for much of my navigation around NYC, and as time went on only had to fall back to Google Maps maybe 25% of the time, usually for missing POI data.<p>Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s one of the few Mapzen projects that hasn&#x27;t seen new life after the company shut down, and like you said it would take quite a bit of work (read: money) to keep it going. It might be possible with some work to find grant money through a couple organizations. The OSMF has done some awesome work lately with the micro-grants, but this would definitely be a level we haven&#x27;t seen (yet).')
