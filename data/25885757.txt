When you are making <i>libraries</i> that lots of other projects might depend on, this is probably more important than when making apps, especially relatively small apps.<p>“Getter&#x2F;setter from the start” optimizes for induced maintenance cost on dependent code.<p>Now, in some other languages, access via getters&#x2F;setters is at least source-compatible with field access, which makes this less of (or not at all, for dynamic languages, or if it is object and not just source compatibility) an issue. But that&#x27;s not the case with Java.')
