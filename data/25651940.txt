It would be shocking if they don&#x27;t provide one, to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t trust that company with anything in the future and would likely file a chargeback to get the refund.<p>The fact that there are now dozens of services that exist to provide you with a burner CC number in order to sign up for these trials indicate that almost nobody actually wants to provide a credit card number for a trial. It&#x27;s also just ridiculously user-hostile with very little proof that it results in higher customer activation compared to a trial that doesn&#x27;t require a credit card.<p>Good luck!')
