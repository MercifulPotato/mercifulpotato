I thought you were referring to third-party auth specifically.<p>Another option more on the cheaper side would be a library that handles algorithm selection and migration in a &quot;black box&quot; way. I.e. the public interface is only `db.put(user,newPass)`, `db.compare(user,suppliedPass)` and maybe something like `db.doMaintenance()`. You would need to handle storage yourself in that case but I don&#x27;t see the downside of this when you are storing your users&#x27; data anyways. I&#x27;m not aware if such a library exists though.')
