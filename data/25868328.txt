It certainly shouldn&#x27;t be left out when known, <i>merely</i> because the subject prefers it not be stated.<p>If there&#x27;s a clear, consistent, and disclosed reason for not revealing the subject&#x27;s identity, that&#x27;s one thing. But you&#x27;re suggesting journalists, or worse subjects themselves, should decide whether their identity  has journalistic value?<p>Furthermore, I disagree with characterizing the use of one&#x27;s real name as a &quot;slip up&quot;. It seems like pretty clear evidence that the author did not seriously care about their anonymity.')
