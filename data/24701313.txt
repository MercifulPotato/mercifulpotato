So maybe my idea relates to you.<p>Are you familar with the concept of the Big O notation [1], which computer scientists use to (more or less) describe the &quot;growth&quot; of their algorithms? E.g. when you compare something that growth quadratically O(n²) to something that only growth linear O(n) you will see, that at some point the quadratically growth will grow faster as the linear growth. Forever! The linear growth will never win.<p>Comparing this to the horizontal sprawl of a city is easy. The area of a city is planar which is mathematically described as quadratic O(n²) but the average growth of the domestic product is just linear O(n). Assuming the maintainance cost of a planar sprawling city growth quadratic while the domestic product only growth linear then the costs will win over the income. Forever!<p>The conclusion is to limit the horizontal sprawl of a city to linear growth. This means every new house, street, rail road, pipe system, power line and so on must be build inside a diameter to the city&#x27;s center with a distance which is logaritmic O(lg(n)) on average. The rest must growth vertically.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_O_notation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_O_notation</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;graphic&#x2F;1&#x2F;268750&#x2F;global-gross-domestic-product-gdp.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;graphic&#x2F;1&#x2F;268750&#x2F;global-gross-domes...</a>')
