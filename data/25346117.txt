I personally wouldn’t trust it below ~20F; it can run white gas too, why risk it?<p>My actual favorite stove, although my heaviest, is my BioLite CampStove 2[0]. It consumes biomass (sticks, pine cones, etc.) and runs a fan that drives extra air into the burning chamber for more heat and less smoke. The part running the fan generates electricity from the heat (using a peltier device, I think) which is enough to run the fan and produce a small amount of spare power. It’s not the lightest stove, but it generates a lot of personal warmth and in areas with a lot of biomass it has effectively unlimited runtime. Illegal to use in areas with forest fire risks though, hence my dual ownership of a WhisperLite.<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bioliteenergy.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;campstove-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bioliteenergy.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;campstove-2</a>')
