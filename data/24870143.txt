Delegating session and cookie management to the framework or (in php&#x27;s case) the language is so much simpler that I have seen manual implementations of this behavior only 2-3 times in my career.  And the idea that logging in incorrectly would somehow return a malformed, but correct, session-setting header is again, pathological.\nMost of the time, these types of profound errors come from simply taking the path of least resistance provided in the framework.  Sometimes they do come from a complex homebrewed solution to a simple problem.<p>Back at my startup days, I once worked with a poor guy who was dynamically generating individual IDs for each element on a page and their corresponding CSS for each page.  He was unaware that CSS also had _classes_, which perfectly encapsulated the behavior he was trying to create.  His work was complex, and full of errors, but it had a certain logic to it- it was the path of least resistance that he saw available to him.<p>These don&#x27;t look like that.  They just look like weird errors designed to avoid showing up on, or triggering false positives on, DAST tools.  I thinking testing people&#x27;s skills without those tools is a good goal, i just think the methodology here is wrong.')
