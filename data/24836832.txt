If you want to learn about, say, Lewis and Clark, you could look it up on Wikipedia where you can find some pictures and a few source links where you can track down more info. Or you could watch a video about it on YouTube. Twenty years ago you could buy a single CD that would interweave video, audio, text, pictures, and interactive elements into a cohesive whole that felt much more alive. Is today&#x27;s free information better than yesterday&#x27;s expensive information? Probably, but I&#x27;d still point to Microsoft Dinosaurs if I wanted to light a fire in the heart of a child.')
