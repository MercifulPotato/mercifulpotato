Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604359893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971907, text='&gt;Surely you canâ€™t stipulate just anything in a contract and have that upheld as binding by a court, even in the US?<p>That&#x27;s a great question.  I&#x27;d expect that courts would not uphold claims to one&#x27;s first-born child[0][1], but only because that sort of thing is already illegal (human trafficking).  As for stuff that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> illegal, I expect that YMMV.<p>That said, people <i>actually</i> &quot;agreed&quot; to give up&#x2F;assign their first-born children with these &quot;Click-wrap&quot; agreements.<p>That people are so cavalier about such things should be a huge red flag for regulators to require not just a link to such terms, but that both parties should be required to <i>demonstrate</i> their specific understanding of terms and conditions <i>before</i> such a contract can be considered enforceable.<p>But that&#x27;s not how US courts have interpreted this sort of thing.  So, as always, Caveat Emptor!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2014&#x2F;sep&#x2F;29&#x2F;londoners-wi-fi-security-herod-clause" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2014&#x2F;sep&#x2F;29&#x2F;londoners...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;nobody-reads-tos-agreements-even-ones-that-demand-first-born-as-payment&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;nobody-reads-tos...</a><p>Edit: Fixed spacing.')
