If the project qualified itself as &quot;Improved Wolfenstein engine&quot;, it&#x27;d probably get no attention.<p>It&#x27;s admirable though that they released the assets with a very permissive license.<p>&gt; a different, better direction than which the mainstream technology is taking, though this involves taking some steps back to before the things started to go wrong<p>There&#x27;s definitely a significant self-absorption in this project. Modern mainstream gaming experience is different - not wrong - compared to what it was in the 90s; gamers looking for the 90s experience can still find modern retro-styled games. Also, it&#x27;s not like everything from the 90s was gold. I actually do enjoy both AAA and indie FPSs.<p>&gt; [&quot;modern&quot; programming (C++17, Rust, OOP etc.) or &quot;advanced&quot; engines] is an extremely bad choice for building long-lasting, accessible programs. New languages are a product of capitalism, evolved by the markets to serve corporations to make quick profit, not fulfilling the values that are good for the people.<p>I didn&#x27;t read long enough to understand if this is a satire or not.')
