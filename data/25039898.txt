Would something like this drown out the fakes and balance out e.g. the bias that unhappy customers are much more likely to leave a review than any other? Seems an obvious thing to try but I&#x27;ve never seen it.<p>Sometimes I see people leaving reviews for the most mundane items like tin foil and vegetable oil, and wonder why they do it.')
