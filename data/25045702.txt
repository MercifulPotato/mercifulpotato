Of course, the graphics API isn&#x27;t the only thing you have to get to work on multiple platforms. There&#x27;s also the sound stack, networking, window management, and so forth.<p>I think what you&#x27;re getting at is some kind of all-in-one platform that abstracts away all of those lower level interfaces. In that case, that&#x27;s basically what Unity is. Unity (and other cross-platform engines) do abstract away the metal in an open source, cross-platform set of APIs&#x2F;tooling.<p>If you&#x27;re more interested in application development, as opposed to videogame development, there&#x27;s toolkits like QT and VM-based environments like Java and Electron. The efficaciousness of these approaches do vary, however. Java UIs are famously ugly, due to how poorly they integrate with the host OS, Electron UIs are famously slow, due to literally being standalone web browser instances, and QT UIs are famously finicky, due to trying to abstract a lot less than the other approaches.')
