Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=[25209083], score=None, time=1606308129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207035, text='About VLANs, at a previous workplace, I&#x27;ve experienced firsthand the downsides of <i>not</i> segmenting the IoT devices in their own separate VLAN. One day, a misbehaving desktop hung during shutdown, and somehow went crazy spamming broadcast packets (I believe they were DHCP requests) to the network. The door access control was on the same network, and the broadcasts overloaded its tiny CPU, so nobody could get in. Had that device been in a separate VLAN, the errant broadcasts would never have reached it. (The fix was to unplug the broken desktop until it was fixed, segment the network so the door access control was not on the same VLAN as the desktops, and enable broadcast storm control on the switch.)')
