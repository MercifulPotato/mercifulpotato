Traditionally, one of these rights is the right to private capital. It&#x27;s the oldest right recorded in English common law. Giving up this right, even if it&#x27;s purported to be in the interests of society at large, will remove part of the &quot;rights-based&quot; part of the rights-based democracy above. It&#x27;s not something that should be done lightly. Civil forfeiture is rife for abuse, even in its current form.')
