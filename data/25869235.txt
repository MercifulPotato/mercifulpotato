Typically with dependencies used by an extension often assuming they can reach out to other servers.<p>I look at initial internet facing container creation as a separately managed snapshot process to grab dependencies which then gets configured for particular Dev, build, test, runtime and release containers that are built by the dependency collecting original container.<p>Ie something like vscode isn&#x27;t installed in the internet facing container, it is installed in the offline build of a Dev container. This is where the difficulties lay in my approach.')
