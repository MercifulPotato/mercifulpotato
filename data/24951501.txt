It&#x27;s on the drivers if they get complacent. There may even be precedents with similar products for trucks.<p>Moral: pushing this now will very likely kill some people that would otherwise be alive (drivers or pedestrians). But it&#x27;s very unlikely to be a carnage - I&#x27;d dare say even impossible. On the other hand, moving the technology forward and directly into widespread commercial use will save people, and likely even... what&#x27;s the equivalent word for a &quot;carnage&quot; but where people are saved? Miracle.<p>Branding: well, there you have a real risk. Public opinion is fickle, and a particularly gruesome accident might do some real damage, both to Tesla and to self driving technologies in general. But then, they do have a high risk high reward mentality, and the chance is good that the first bad accident (statistically inevitable) will come after the advantages are proven and well established.')
