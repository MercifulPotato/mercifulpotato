For such large changes, your schema and application logic both need to be changed anyway. So if you&#x27;re already changing the schema, why is it easier to change the application logic if it lives in a separate codebase?<p>If anything, it seems like it would go the other way around: With stored procedures, you&#x27;re guaranteed that any application logic is at least consistent with the current database schema, whereas with separate services, you need to maintain that consistency yourself. Not that I&#x27;m advocating for stored procedures in general because they come with a mountain of other drawbacks, I just don&#x27;t buy this particular argument.')
