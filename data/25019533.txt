This kind of &quot;context&quot; (which is human ascribed) has no bearing on acting rationally. Pay attention to consequence borne by data, not past intent.<p>&gt; I think our society suffers greatly because people don&#x27;t know history.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that applies to something that has circumstantial relevance, like past political conditions.')
