It&#x27;s amazing how brainwashed the west is in believing its own propaganda and naritive. So many don&#x27;t even realize they have been fed propaganda about communist run countries.  It&#x27;s mind boggling.<p>What people should be outraged by is that MOST VIETNAMESE ONLINE SENSORSHIP IS CREATED BY US COMPANIES.  No, not in the way facebook does in &#x27;being complicit&#x27;, but rather by blocking access from Vietnamese country ips entirely - no Vietnamese Government request required!<p>I lived there for over a year and what I was surprised by was how often I was blocked by the actual domain, and not some &#x27;comunist firewall&#x27; that people think.  Things like, signing into an Apple Developer account can not be done without a vpn.  Lots of others I wish I documented.<p>You will never see an article on that though because it doesn&#x27;t fit the wests propaganda nariative that &#x27;democracy good, communism bad&#x27;.')
