It is certainly a controversial method. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mass_comparison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mass_comparison</a><p>I will say that as a teenager, mass lexical comparison, in Merrit Ruhlen&#x27;s book &#x27;The Origin of Language: Tracing the Evolution of the Mother Tongue&#x27;, was very compelling. Ruhlen worked closely with Greenberg, who was a famous historical&#x2F;comparative linguist of African languages.<p>Ten or more years later, with the benefit of experience, I feel like aligning hundreds of languages in a common vector space (multilingual word embeddings) will probably answer these questions better. But I am not a comparative linguist.')
