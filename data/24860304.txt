The more you can check ahead of time, the better, and Rust isn&#x27;t such a bad fit there.<p>But given that Rust&#x27;s main advantages seem to be the ability to safely control multiple execution threads, and its handling of edge cases, I wonder if the first is going to be used at all, and if the second isn&#x27;t going to lead to extra instructions?')
