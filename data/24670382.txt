But if you pick monopolist, don’t expect regulation to necessarily go the way you want it to.  It probably will preserve everything you hate about the current system, just replacing Apple with a bureaucracy.<p>Forcing the return of the Wild West of the PC ecosystem Into mobile will only happen when consumers demand it.  They won’t, because that wasn’t a very user friendly approach.  It Was originally for tinkerers and hackers and that pedigree continues to this day.  Mobile carriers and government aren’t likely too fond of the idea of phones where anything can be installed on them.')
