I&#x27;m just saying we COULD blow all our money on a stupid little street,&quot; and the townspeople cheer again and lift him on their shoulders.<p>Anyway, your comment reminded me of that.<p>I&#x27;m less familiar with lead in water. If that was just lack of science knowledge, that&#x27;s different than, say, deliberately putting lead in water to make it easier to profit off the people drinking it.')
