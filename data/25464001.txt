That document states that the CVEs have historically required one of two preconditions:<p>&gt; The attacker can submit and run arbitrary SQL statements.<p>&gt; The attacker can submit a maliciously crafted database file to the application that the application will then open and query.<p>If you look at the actual list of CVEs, all but one start with ‘Malicious SQL statement’.  The single one that doesn&#x27;t is suffixed with ‘The bug never appeared in any official SQLite release’.<p>In other words, there has never been an official release of SQLite which was vulnerable when presented with a crafted database file.')
