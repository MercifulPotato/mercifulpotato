They had some much discussed [0] developments on that front, and if it did in fact force AWS to build their own implementation, that seems like a win for opensource, but not so much for serverless users.<p>Slightly off topic:<p>I have a side project that generates ~10 daily metrics for ~350 entities. Around 150k readings currently (the number of metrics gathered per entity per day has increased since I started).<p>I&#x27;m pretty interested in these timeseries databases, but I think my use case is still on the side of using MySQL&#x2F;Postgres out of the box. Not to mention that I can get by with archiving data &gt; 1 year old.<p>Does anyone have any quick checklist or metrics to make decisions like this? When does it make sense to evolve from a vanilla RDB to a timeseries one?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24579905" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24579905</a>')
