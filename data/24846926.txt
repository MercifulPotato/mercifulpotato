But you cannot move, you can barely move your eyes. I fought against it with my tongue and it was problematic so the nurses had to rush to sedate me a bit more, but you know that something is going on; you can hear some beeps and rushed steps around you. For a few short moments your brain is thinking about possibilities. You ask yourself if maybe you are in a comma, or in a vegetative state. And you get really sad. I remember crying while going back into sedation, terrified and in despair. And I was just 14 and 16 years old.<p>For me, having that ventilator -something that when you read about it, or you talk about it, doesn&#x27;t seem like much- was a traumatic experience that I will never forget.')
