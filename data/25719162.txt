A large number of rooms on matrix are public channels to begin with (eg bridged rooms from irc, open source collaboration channels, etc), so they have no need for e2e encryption. All this is really saying is that E2EE is optional, which you already said (and which I&#x27;d also argue is probably irrelevant, especially given that E2EE is on by default).')
