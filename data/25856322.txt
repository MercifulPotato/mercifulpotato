After TS 2.0 a decision was made that TS will align with standard EcmaScript and will not implement any* run-time features not part of the ES standard or ES proposals.<p>Because of this decision TypeScript cannot have a proper dedicated pattern matching syntax until JavaScript gets one. TypeScript does support some pattern matching using ifs and switch statements and other control flow structures, but that&#x27;s as good as it gets until JS improves as well.')
