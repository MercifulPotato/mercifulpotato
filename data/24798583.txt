I&#x27;ll take the risk.<p>There are 30 year periods where US stocks (spy 500 or a close proxy thereof) posted a negative total return. Are you prepared for that?<p>My larger point is that 12-15% return assumption is absurd.  There are very few long-term periods where that has ever been achieved in the US market, most (but not all) of which were followed by a deep and long-lasting correction.<p>The alternative is to assume a lower return like 5% and plan accordingly.')
