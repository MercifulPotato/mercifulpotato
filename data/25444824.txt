Item(by='cptskippy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608137702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439667, text='I feel like everything after FC2 has felt progressively less organic and more scripted.  I&#x27;m playing through New Dawn right now and it doesn&#x27;t feel like an open world anymore, it feels like a bunch of mini games stitched together and your control system is on training wheels.<p>The outpost capture system introduced in FC3 just feels formulaic and bland by FC:ND, you can choose to replay it at a harder difficulty and it just moves around alarms or adds higher level enemies.  The enemies all use the same AI and just have more hit points and better aim.  The Elite enemies are just tanks that can&#x27;t be tracked.<p>The controls are borked, there&#x27;s now a delay and short window to engage the wingsuit where as in FC4 you just belly flop yourself on the ground whenever.  This prevents you from using the wingsuit in a lot of scenarios that it was previously accessible and results in a lot of death falls until you just give up on using the wingsuit entirely.<p>Enemy repawn and reclaiming is ridiculous and kills immersion.  You can attack a machine gun nest kiling a squad then move less than 100 yards away and it will be repopulated when you turn your back with new elements.<p>Each new version feels less open world and more like a level of Super Mario Bros.')
