There was a huge decline in the 1900-1960 era, where kids would be punished at school for speaking Te Reo (the Māori language). It was headed towards being a dead language. There were then huge efforts by Iwi to promote and normalise Te Reo, through education and media such as Māori radio and TV.<p>Over the last decade or so, though, I feel there’s been a cultural shift in New Zealand where Te Reo is being embraced by New Zealanders in a new way: Māori words are being incorporated into our English dialect: “Do the Mahi (work)!” someone might say, or “let’s have a hui (get-together&#x2F;meeting)”.
