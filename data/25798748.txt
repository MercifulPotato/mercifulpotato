Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[25799162], score=None, time=1610758344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798456, text='&gt; “can be risky (see OP)” is vastly downplaying 1 in 10 odds of nominal success. Simply not failing doesn’t mean the bet paid off.<p>We know this, yadda yadda &quot;survivorship bias.&quot; It&#x27;s just boring to have the same people making the same points about every startup that made it. It&#x27;s like the old &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; trope you see repeated over and over again when someone links any dataset. We get it.<p>Again, my point is that this is not <i>insightful</i> -- and you&#x27;ve yet to demonstrate otherwise.')
