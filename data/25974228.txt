Our input is of course never needed - why would it, when America (both the government and the companies) can simply decide what&#x27;s good or not good for us instead?<p>In fairness, this is a deep-rooted bitterness that goes far beyond this one project. The sheer fact that an American company can just up and do things that impact the entire globe on a whim (and worse, the power the American government has to approve&#x2F;&quot;regulate&quot; such projects as though only their citizens are impacted) is unbelievably absurd to me (see also: Facebook, etc).')
