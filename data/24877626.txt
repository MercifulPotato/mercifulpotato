All my scripts are written in Python, which a thin shell script wrapper to launch it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen, and still see, plenty of Python scripts launched by a shell script.<p>9 out of 10 times, Python just causes more problems than it solves, and problems that are trivial to solve with plain old shell scripts.<p>The only reason Python &quot;won&quot; is because we see a constant inflow of rookie developers who so far did practically only used Python ever, and that&#x27;s pretty much the only thing they know and the only tool of their trade. They see all problems as nails, and thus insist in using their little hammer all the time without even looking at the current infrastructure or even the toolbox.<p>I have seen shell scripts launch Python scripts. I have seen powershell scripts launch Python scripts. I have seen npm launch Python scripts. Hell, I have seen Python scripts launch Python scripts by firing up a Python interpreter as a child process.<p>Python did not won. Python outnumbered. It did so because people who don&#x27;t know better happened to know Python.<p>Don&#x27;t let that be the reason why you make terrible technical decisions.')
