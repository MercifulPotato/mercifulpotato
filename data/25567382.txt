I used to do it on Slashdot before YC News was a thing. You&#x27;re not the only one, yet I feel this won&#x27;t ever change.<p>Nobody in the entire laptop industry cares or <i>even knows</i> about our complaints. There seems to be practically zero overlap between the professionals that use laptops -- such as <i>software</i> developers -- and the hardware engineers that design the laptops. As you&#x27;ve alluded, it&#x27;s an insular industry with mostly foreign players such as Clevo in Taiwan.<p>The market exists though. I suspect it would be profitable too! I regularly buy laptops for about AUD $5,000-$6,000, including the Clevo laptop I&#x27;m using now for work.<p>My requirements are much more mundane than yours, but will similarly never be met:<p>- Alternative keyboard layouts: Why must a $6K laptop for professionals (or gamers!) do idiotic things such as compress the arrow keys or hide the Ins&#x2F;Del&#x2F;PgUp&#x2F;PgDn keys? Why can&#x27;t I <i>choose</i> the keyboard layout?<p>- Wider keyboards: I can&#x27;t stand &quot;gapless&quot; keyboards that make touch typing the rarely used keys difficult. Most laptops reuse the 13-inch model&#x27;s keyboard on all larger sizes, which wastes enormous amounts of real estate. (My current laptop is wider than my full-size 101-key keyboard, not including the number pad.)<p>- Decent webcams and microphones: Is there some law that only mobile phones and tablets can have decent cameras?<p>- Narrow-bezel screens: This is starting to very very slowly become the norm, but is still hit and miss.<p>- Lightweight power supplies: Only Apple seems to have heard about Gallium Nitride power electronics, everyone else ships their more powerful laptop models with a power supply that is the size and weight of a brick. (My current laptop&#x27;s brick is 1.9 kg!!!)<p>- Integrated 5G: I&#x27;d like to have Internet connectivity without tethering, just like an iPad.<p>If anyone from Dell ever reads YC News: I very nearly bought the new Dell XPS 17, but then I saw the keyboard and I immediately cancelled the order: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.dell.com&#x2F;is&#x2F;image&#x2F;DellContent&#x2F;&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;global-site-design&#x2F;product_images&#x2F;dell_client_products&#x2F;notebooks&#x2F;xps_notebooks&#x2F;xps_17&#x2F;pdp&#x2F;notebooks_xps_17_laptop_pdp_image_mod5.jpg?fmt=jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.dell.com&#x2F;is&#x2F;image&#x2F;DellContent&#x2F;&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;global-...</a><p>Compare with a Clevo 17 inch laptop keyboard: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accessoriesales.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;1165_CLEVO.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accessoriesales.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;1165_...</a><p>They seem to have found the room for full-size up&#x2F;down keys, a number pad, as well as dedicated keys for ins&#x2F;del&#x2F;home. I <i>never</i> have to press the &quot;Fn&quot; key in normal usage!<p>Every few years I look at Dell&#x27;s top-of-the-line laptop, but decide against buying one because of at least one glaring flaw.')
