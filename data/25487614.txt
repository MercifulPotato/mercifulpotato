It agrees with what you’re saying. One of the key reasons why the end of suffering is good (even if it’s sad) is that the suffering person can’t really function as a human being anymore. If you’re no longer able to fulfill your role and your days are unbalanced with suffering, it’s considered sensible and honourable to die peacefully and intentionally. You were nothing for an eternity, you did your best to be a good person, now you’ll go back to that quiet nothing. It was fine that you didn’t exist, you existed, and it’ll be fine that you don’t exist.<p>Obviously this tidy philosophy doesn’t mesh with things like murder or other untimely deaths. It just encapsulates nicely why sometimes death is a good thing. And why we shouldn’t fear it.')
