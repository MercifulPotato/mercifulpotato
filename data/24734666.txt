Item(by='eptcyka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602279134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733256, text='Hyper only brings in a single-threaded runtime, so it&#x27;s not much of a runtime at all. That is to say, driving a future returned from Hyper in a blocking fashion and then dropping it is all that&#x27;s required. Once you drop the client, the runtime will be dropped too. I usually take issue with runtimes due to the added complexity and the lack of clarity about resource usage - I&#x27;m mostly worried about superfluous memory usage and some rogue threads going off and doing a quest and a half doing god knows what, hogging or otherwise interfering with my application&#x27;s threads. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible in this case. Do you know if there are any other concerns that I should be worried about when bringing in something that has a <i>runtime</i>?')
