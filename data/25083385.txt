It&#x27;s not reasonable for me to expect that _any_ job will allow me to live _any_ kind of lifestyle. I am firmly in the middle-class. I expect my job will allow me to pay my housing costs, but I don&#x27;t expect it to pay for a brand new car every year and especially not if I spend all of my discresionary income on... something else!<p>It is reasonable for me to expect that a full-time job should allow me to have a roof over my head, food to eat, etc. I should make a living wage. There are examples of independent organisations that calculate what a living wage is and what constitues a living wage. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livingwage.org.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livingwage.org.uk&#x2F;</a> in the UK for example) So I&#x27;m keen not to get in to an argument about what constitues a living wage, because people smarter than me have spent much longer than me considering it.<p>I am also not an expert. But I do know that europeans like myself look at the world of work in the US with abject horror, even when things here are not perfect.')
