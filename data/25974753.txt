IP also groups trademarks &amp; patents, which are unrelated to copyright.<p>He also explains how each part of the so-called IP laws used to have an escape hatch,  something that was useful to society at large even though the &quot;owner&quot; would prefer it didn&#x27;t exist. And how, given the trend towards concentration of money and consolidation of monopolistic actors, these escape hatches are being eroded.<p>&gt; Books do the same thing, do you find books abusive as well?<p>There&#x27;s copyright for books, sure. But nothing else applies. I can resell books. I can quote them (with some restrictions, such as not quoting the entire book). I can lend them to whomever I choose. I can read them upside down. I can cut them up, I can pick a page and analyze its chemical composition. I can do all sorts of things that, when books turn into digital goods, their publishers make an effort to prevent me from doing -- making it effectively and practically illegal to try to bypass their arbitrary restrictions.')
