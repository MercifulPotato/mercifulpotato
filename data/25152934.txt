Which means it is (should be) already preoptimized as much as needed&#x2F;wanted&#x2F;possible.<p>Cranelift still needs to do some optimizations, especially wrt. platform specific aspects like register allocations and similar.<p>In the end you don&#x27;t want long load times when using wasm (at least in the web browser maybe in other places too).<p>Through maybe in the future you might have some options to opt-in to some more time intensive optimizations for e.g. in browser gaming. But then rust could just not opt-in.')
