I&#x27;m saying that it <i>should</i> be no surprise that Remdesivir doesn&#x27;t work because it didn&#x27;t work in February, either. It makes you wonder why it was ever presented as a valid option. Perhaps the only reason why it got the publicity it did was to distract people from pursuing a treatment that the major pharmaceutical companies can&#x27;t make any money on.<p>These companies possess the means to influence the news media through their advertising spend, and the agencies through regulatory capture. The timeline also strongly suggests that this is what happened, as Remdesivir came into the spotlight exactly one day after the other protocol was announced.<p>No conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories allege some kind of criminal activity and there is no crime being alleged. All it takes is one person to send a press release.')
