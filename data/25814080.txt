But yeah, gamedev...<p>Experienced devs can get up to $5000-$6000 after taxes but I know of a few making even more. The thing is you can rent a studio for $300-$400 and food is dirt cheap compared to western countries (another $300 or so, but $200 will do). All in all I’m Warsaw you’re saving much more money than you’d in Berlin or Prague at the same position. So $700 might look really bad but that’s actually enough to get by.')
