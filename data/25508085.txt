You&#x27;re just providing more details than exists in the title, which is the purpose of the link, which does provide that information.<p>But more to the point, the most objectionable part of this isn&#x27;t the specific details of the streaming changes. It&#x27;s... what business does any of this have in a Coronavirus relief bill? It&#x27;s preposterous.<p>I feel like honest legislators should really start using this process against itself. The next time there is an omnibus bill like this, insert a line that says something like &quot;every part of the December 2020 Coronavirus relief act not directly related to Coronavirus relief is repealed&quot; and then let it sail through with that in the same way this did. Give them a disincentive to do things this way because they&#x27;ll just lose it again next year.')
