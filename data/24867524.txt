It would make it more difficult to output any non-HTML content type from a PHP script. It would require many new syntaxes (e.g. for outputting variable data in the attribute values of elements, selectively outputting elements or attributes, looping through them, etc). It would also mean the language is tied to specific HTML versions and it would not be able to be forgiving of HTML syntax errors, defeating much of its ease of use.<p>I am not sure it would have been practical to turn PHP into a strongly HTML aware template language like Thymeleaf for example, while still having it be useful as a general purpose programming language. IMO, the dream of PHP&#x2F;CFML&#x2F;JSP&#x2F;ASP mixing code with templates just isn&#x27;t realistically possible.')
