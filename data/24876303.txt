Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603504841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876142, text='&gt; would a &quot;derivative work&quot; ... be considered to have a different intent?<p>Probably not. If intent were to be demonstrated in court, a derivative work would almost certainly be tainted in turn unless those authors had a _really_ good justification for their actions. (IANAL though; I&#x27;m just guessing based on other copyright cases that came up in the media before.)<p>For example, imagine forking Napster back in the day, redoing the UI, and rewriting half of the internals. Do you really think a court would let that fly? Judges are hardly idiots.<p>That being said, why not just mirror the original to a host running as a tor hidden service and continue all development efforts there?')
