The link you mentioned shows how to delegate some sync work to a thread to make it play nicely, but you wouldn&#x27;t want to do it in each request for example. Twisted is its own world and either you&#x27;re in or you&#x27;re out. The async&#x2F;await markers are much more generic in this case.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no way to do something like this with async&#x2F;await, besides some hacky third-party attempts, as far as I know.<p>Spawn a thread, share a queue, send the sync call you want to do, await on a queue read. It&#x27;s effectively the same thing twisted is doing there.')
