They often had &quot;plans&quot; where you would get 100sms&#x2F;month or 250 sms&#x2F;month, or a-la-carte. If you got an SMS spam, that counted to your allotment. SMS was so expensive compared to GChat&#x2F;YahooMessenger&#x2F;ICQ&#x2F;etc that I didnt use it. But then you were on the &quot;a-la-carte&quot; plan of 10 or 25cents <i>per message</i> depending on your provider. Godforbid you sent an international SMS, those were 50cents a message and MMS (SMS with image) was 5o to 75 cents per message. My provider had no apparent way to <i>not</i> have the service, so you were essentially bullied into paying a-la-carte or bullied into a plan.<p>Friends would get angry at each other for sending a message, or breaking a sentence into two messages.<p>Again, I think it is <i>INSANE</i> that half the US legislature is trying to fault WhatsApp (100% no dollar cost) for being a &quot;monopoly&quot; given the situation that was fixed. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;judiciary.house.gov&#x2F;uploadedfiles&#x2F;competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;judiciary.house.gov&#x2F;uploadedfiles&#x2F;competition_in_dig...</a>')
