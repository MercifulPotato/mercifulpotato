Item(by='hedora', descendants=None, kids=[25722010], score=None, time=1610300821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25716014, text='Rather than soap, I use a pampered chef plastic scraper (It’s for stone ware; don’t know any other name for it), and a stainless steel scouring pad (not steel wool; instead it’s coils of flat stainless steel tape or something).  The scraper removes the bulk of stuff, keeping the scouring pad clean.<p>This is less effort than using soap, and more effective.  The stainless smooths out any imperfections that form in the seasoning over time, and cooking with oil continuously reseasons it.<p>I found that I had to re-season my pans every 5-10 years if I used soap, and that the seasoning was an inferior cooking surface (more food stuck to it).  With the technique I described above, I can cook eggs and they don’t stick. (be sure to preheat, use plenty of oil, and then don’t touch for a minute or two at the beginning of cooking)')
