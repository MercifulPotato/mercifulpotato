So &quot;Never&quot; becomes &quot;not for a while yet until we perfect this technology&quot;, which is a slightly shorter time-scale.<p>That said I think that there might almost be a (chicken&#x2F;egg) commercial demand for an actual lunar mining+fuel processing facility as is. Refueling of earth-orbit satellites could extend their useful lifetimes.<p>And for the foreseeable future, yes (much of the) equipment would still need to come from earth. You can still get a big delta-V savings if you only launch the equipment into LEO, and then transport it onward using fuel mined on the moon. You save the cost of the-fuel-to-launch-the-fuel.')
