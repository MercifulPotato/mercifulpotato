This is not home market (...)<p>You&#x27;re basing your argument on extreme and unrepresentative assumptions.<p>First of all, you do not need to fill a storage device to the brim to justify it&#x27;s use. You can use the exact same rationale to claim no one needs 500GB HDs even though they are pretty much standard these days.<p>Additionally, you falsely assume that your data storage needs start the very moment someone buys a drive, and up till then they have no data lying around. That&#x27;s not the case at all. People buy high-density storage devices because they already have the data lying around, and they don&#x27;t want to lose it. You&#x27;re ignoring that people already have piles of CDRs&#x2F;DVDs&#x2F;Blu-ray disks lying around.<p>Additionally, you are somehow assuming that people would buy storage devices for their density, ignoring their primary use case: long term data preservation.')
