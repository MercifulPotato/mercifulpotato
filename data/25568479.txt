And the 3DS has an ARM11 as the main processor with an ARM 9 used for crypto and other low level operating system functionality. When playing DS games they also run on the ARM9. Of course the ability to play DS games implies there&#x27;s also the ARM7, in fact you can (more or less) natively boot GBA games on it!')
