Candidly, I&#x27;m not interested in hair-splitting beyond that; my point is simply that Jones is closely aligned with the rioters, many of whom idolize him (as you can see on TDW). The idea that Jones is somehow in a radically different political cluster than the Q people and the Proud Boys people beggars belief; your evidence for that would have to be powerful, and would not be on &quot;banned.video&quot;.')
