Well, how about the number of changing variables involved?<p>Simulating and solving chess is very easy in comparison. You have only very limited and fixed variables.\nSimulating a physic sandbox game with advanced chemistry and even biology that is supposed to run in real time - seems impossible at this moment on the other hand. Too many connected details.')
