As much as you might hate FB using all your data for ads, that does actually mean that small businesses can hyper target their customers.<p>I personally don&#x27;t see any ads on FB for mass market products, like on TV (cards, detergent, back pain medicine etc). I see gadgets that are cool, clothes from small producers that are actually kind fo cool.<p>They do actually help small businesses. As much evil as they do, you can&#x27;t take this way from them.')
