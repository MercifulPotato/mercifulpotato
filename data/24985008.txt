Anywhere else in the world, having to rely on 250-year-old legal code for important present-day judicial decisions would be considered a deep failure of lawmaking.</i><p>The core idea behind originalism is that agreements should be interpreted as they were understood at the time, and if something is impractical in modern day, then it should be changed through the legislative process with amendments.<p>&quot;Living Constitution&quot; is far more speculative and magical. Somehow new meanings are discovered that no-one in the previous 250 years had seen in the text nor voted for. This undermines democracy.')
