This isn&#x27;t an exaggeration - basic graph heuristics (such as comparing in&#x2F;out degree of an individual relative to other parts of the social graph) can easily identify such individuals. Censoring those individuals can have an amplified effect on the graph structure as a whole.<p>For an example of how just a few individuals can make a big difference on graph structure, check out Watts &amp; Strogatz&#x27;s 1998 paper, <i>Collective dynamics of &#x27;small-world&#x27; networks</i> [0][1]. I&#x27;d highly recommend reading it - it&#x27;s very short and easy to understand.<p>Essentially, a small number of connectors connecting with random individuals can seriously reduce the average number of steps to connect any two individuals. If Facebook wanted to stop the spread of a narrative that they didn&#x27;t like, censoring just these few individuals would make it <i>much harder</i> for information to flow through the graph as a whole, and hardly anyone would notice (since Facebook&#x27;s only censoring a few people.)<p>Scary.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Watts–Strogatz_model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Watts–Strogatz_model</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;9623998&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;9623998&#x2F;</a>')
