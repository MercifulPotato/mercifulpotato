Item(by='mtlynch', descendants=None, kids=[25991873, 25991503], score=None, time=1612202083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25990792, text='Thanks for reading!<p>&gt;<i>what does materials mean? Is it the cost-of-materials-for-what-you-sold, or cost-of-everything-you-bought (including both sold items and inventory you&#x27;re still holding?)</i><p>It&#x27;s the latter, cost-of-everything-I-bought.<p>&gt;<i>The reason is that it&#x27;s usually more common to only count the former (cost of materials for what you sold) when tracking profit&#x2F;loss. Materials you used for inventory that are not yet sold are counted as assets on your balance sheet, since the expectation is that you&#x27;ll be able to turn that into cash at some point.</i><p>Thanks, this is helpful feedback! This is my first time managing an inventory, so I still have a lot to learn about bookkeeping for it.<p>I should mention that the numbers so far are preliminary based on my own bookkeeping, so I&#x27;ll talk to my accountant about how to better map the transactions to my balance sheet and income statement.<p>&gt;<i>You&#x27;ll start tracking &quot;turn&quot;, how quickly you sell out an existing batch, and can better plan for purchasing more to keep a healthy level that is in that Goldilocks-zone of enough-to-fulfill-orders-quickly, but less than holding too much that ties up cash.</i><p>That&#x27;s interesting. I&#x27;m curious to see how much this will affect the inventory I keep on hand.<p>Right now, each product consists of several components that have different properties, so when I choose how much to stock each item, it&#x27;s a function of:<p>* How many orders could conceivably happen during a sudden surge of interest?<p>* How long does it take to restock this item? (some items take 2 months to be manufactured overseas, others ship overnight)<p>* How much space does this item take up in my house? (easy to store 5000 ribbon cables, not so easy to store that many Raspberry Pis)<p>* How much does this item cost? (easier to err on the side of caution for cheap items)<p>* How confident am I that I&#x27;m going to keep using this component?')
