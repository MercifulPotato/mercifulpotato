But it has always been on the back of my mind as an approach worth following up on.<p>Now I decided to make it a bit more approachable through an interactive tool that lets you play with a polynomial that learns from incremental examples you provide. I also included some background on how the method works.<p>Incremental learning (in contrast to batch learning) poses a unique set of problems as the learning algorithm needs to adapt with just a single new example. Compared to the state of the art, IRMA does this through minimizing what it &quot;forgets&quot; about past learned data while adapting to the new example. I chose polynomials as an example as it doesn&#x27;t work well with the typically used gradient descent but can be learned with IRMA in a much more stable manner.<p>The same approach has a closed form solution for a variety of other models (that are linear in the parameters, i.e. LIP) and I&#x27;d be interested to try and apply it to more models (like neural networks) or other tasks (like classification) as well.<p>I&#x27;m excited about any questions or feedback!')
