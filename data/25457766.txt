He stated that two of the five people he arranged to set out bait packages (and were compensated for setting out bait packages) had acquaintances &quot;steal&quot; them.<p>He came out and revealed this, as well as cutting the questionable footage from his video. That seems to me like an honest mistake and not intentionally misleading.')
