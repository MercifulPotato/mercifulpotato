The compensation really is not poor, unless youâ€™re comparing it to say FAANG compensation, which is not really normal. They make as much, if not more, than current market rates.<p>I think there is a disconnect here. Public employees--people who are actually employed by the government--have fixed, low salaries (relative to the tech sector). Contractors for the public sector--people employed by private companies--actually have pretty decent salaries. These two sets of people are different categories, but a lot of people hear &quot;government&quot; and may be failing to realize the distinction between actual government employees versus contract employees.')
