I guess what I meant to ask is whether this works when eating food that doesn&#x27;t have as as much acid as a straight lemon. Sounds like the answer is yes.<p>Also, tangential, but I think the advice to brush your teeth right after is not right. Not a dentist, but IIUC, after exposing your teeth to acid, the enamel is in a weakend state and then the abrasion from brushing will do more damage. Rinsing with water would be helpful. Brushing before can also be helpful since the fluoride temporarily protects the enamel.')
