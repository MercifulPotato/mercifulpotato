If you were a sophisticated tech bro urbanite like me, you&#x27;d know that food comes from grocery stores, not farms.  The only thing farmers grow is inedible corn (probably just to spite the environment); they&#x27;re leeches on the teat of society who don&#x27;t deserve an ounce of protection!  If they weren&#x27;t so dumb they&#x27;d learn to code and do something productive, like code mobile apps and ad networks.  In the future we&#x27;ll all be eating computer chips anyway.  Stick around HN and maybe you&#x27;ll learn a few of these things.')
