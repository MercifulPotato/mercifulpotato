Did he really miss all that news coverage about his own disappearance? Occam&#x27;s razor might suggest there&#x27;s a reason why he didn&#x27;t.<p>My guess, applying this both ways, is that he&#x27;s been ill or having some treatment or been in hospital, and that perhaps if it was bad, the calculation came out that disappearance rumours were better than &quot;Jack Ma on his death bed&quot; stories.')
