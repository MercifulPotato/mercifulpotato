Usually the person advocating extraordinary action (&quot;at all costs&quot; were your words) should be able to articulate a supporting argument for their position.<p>But OK, lazy Internet person, I&#x27;ll go first. Targeted search results and advertisements are very valuable time savers in my life. I strong prefer local results, results in my language, results relevant to my age and marital status, results relevant to my past purchase and shopping habits, results related to my upcoming calendar appointments, and so forth. All of these are quite valuable to me. If Google were to target ads for me based on my resting heart rate and number of miles I run every week, that seems fine to me. God only knows what Garmin and Strava are already doing with that data.')
