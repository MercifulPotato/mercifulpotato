If you want to touch our economy in any way, you expose yourself to regulation.<p>You have a lot of claims there, do you have sources?<p>AML regulations do plenty, and they start with banks checking for sketchy transactions and not executing them. You can also look up several cases of very large penalties for breaking these laws.  The US crushed a couple of Swiss banks a few years back, the longest operating bank which had been going for hundreds of years was effectively shut down by money laundering judgements.<p>It seems you want to have small financial businesses not be responsible for people using their services to commit crimes... well too bad, I say.  You don&#x27;t get a free pass to aid and abet crime because you&#x27;re small.
