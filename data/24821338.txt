Marriage problem (aka Secretary, suitor, best choice): if you&#x27;re given options that you can compare but do not have an objective value of worth and you have a bound # of candidates, only look for the first 37% of options. Then pick the next that beats the best-so-far.<p>I like this one because it shows that for some problems there is no wins-all solution. Sometimes the suitors just get worst over time (real-life dating amirite?). Sometimes the options only get better (computer hardware? Cloud solutions?) but you have to pick at some point.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secretary_problem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secretary_problem</a><p>2. Deadlines make prioritization and scheduling nigh impossible. You can have your priorities all in line and think you can just work from most to least important, but if something is <i>due</i>, like Taxes or putting the trash bins out, those get jammed in.<p>This is partly why I loathe how deadlines are chosen in the corporate office. Management found that setting deadlines gets things done by a date, so they use it for everything, which throws prioritization of work completely out of wack. Missed deadlines are easy to track and punish and put what&#x27;s trackable over (potentially) what&#x27;s important.<p>3. If you want to know how much longer something will go on or last, and you have no way to estimate, you can assume you&#x27;re in the middle. Kind of like the law of averages. No one wants to think they&#x27;re average, but we most likely are (or at least within a std-dev or two.<p>I find this helps when deciding on, say, what language or framework to learn or which car to buy. It helps to fight against hype. Will X be around for 10 more years? Well, it&#x27;s only been around for 3, so probably not, but A has been around for 50 years, so...<p>It also helps to know that whatever latest trend or fad will likely be gone as quickly as it came.<p>4. I can&#x27;t recall the formula now, but I know that there&#x27;s a formula for how long you can expect to wait in a line. It also works for anything with a queue, a process time, and a capacity. It helps when people say &quot;Look how long the line is!&quot; Instead, take a minute and see if the line ever moves, not how long it is.<p>None of these algorithms completely fit real-life examples, but they just give small tools and tricks to think about things. They&#x27;re not meant to be used blindly, but just as a starting point to help when there seems to be no starting point or too many options. And hey, sometimes there&#x27;s just not a &quot;best&quot; and it sometimes helps knowing that too!')
