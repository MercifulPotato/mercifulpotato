The whole &quot;western world&quot; benefits from such cheap goods, even people working McJobs at home. That said, there&#x27;s a balance there, because after some point working&#x2F;middle class jobs also go abroad, and new ones replacing them domestically are either crappier lower-wage than before or not-created. The 10% will always benefit from cheaper goods though - and they will be those with high quality jobs that can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t yet be jobs outsourced.<p>Now, pro-market people would say that at least this guys the developing countries some jobs, they wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise, and low&#x2F;exploitative wages and conditions of work are better than no jobs at all.<p>(That&#x27;s debatable: often the developing folk are forced to go work in the cities&#x2F;factories because of policies devastating their rural communities, not because of some free choice to &quot;ascend&quot; themselves in the rat race).<p>IMHO, the alternative would require either some kind of universal raise of both salaries (to total global equality) and costs of living (to same), or trade and outsourcing restrictions (so to avoid the race to the bottom).')
