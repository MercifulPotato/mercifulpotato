I don&#x27;t think it was confusion or misunderstanding.<p>Understanding the value of &quot;nothing&quot; or &quot;the opposite of something&quot; is what separates us from most other brained-animals, correct?<p>I understand there are patterns that can be applied. However, I never once was misserved by that understanding, either through academics or physical life.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s more upsetting today to try to reset that thought process in my mind. So to me, zero is neither even or odd, and I&#x27;m happy with that.')
