WGS84 is pretty correct for almost everywhere but is not typically used for local applications like this because physical locations drift relative to it and the WGS84 geoid (shape of the earth) won&#x27;t give you a guaranteed locally flat surface that actually matches the elevation of the surface. It looks like they are just using ordinal levels relative to the the ground floor (defined as the lowest floor with level access to the outside) which is sensible but I wonder how they will use GPS signal to identify which floor a mobile user is on since GPS has poor vertical resolution and its not clear how much elevation data will be encoded in this format.')
