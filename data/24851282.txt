If all it takes to become a hate symbol is for a small segment of the internet to say &quot;what should we make the ADL freak out about today?&quot; how would that sort of &quot;anti-brigading&quot; work? If I see the letters HH together I assume Hulk Hogan, but others (such as the ADL or SLPC) see Heil Hitler. Not sure how this would be defended against, if any group became the de-facto standard arbiter of what constitutes bad.')
