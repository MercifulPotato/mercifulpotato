In a world where D votes against R because &quot;red team bad&quot; and R votes against D because &quot;blue team bad&quot;, it feels like we&#x27;re watching our entire democracy erode away.<p>One person shouldn&#x27;t be able to unilaterally decide what will and won&#x27;t be voted on, and shouldn&#x27;t be able to tell half of the senate how they&#x27;ll be voting if they want access to re-election funds.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, or who could implement one. But it&#x27;s really hard to look at the last decade or two and claim that the senate is working as intended.')
