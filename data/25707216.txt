I&#x27;d recommend the opposite, do mostly weights  and some cardio.  You don&#x27;t need to buy equipment, barbells etc., bodyweight exercises is weight&#x2F;strength training.<p>However, both should be done!  Cardio is good for your heart.  But it&#x27;s easy and healthy enough to maintain a good aerobic fitness just once a week.  Weight training keeps you burning calories and I think strength is more practical&#x2F;useful in our day to day lives, thus having a greater impact on your psyche.<p>Bottomline, something is better than nothing.  And if you love running... go for it.')
