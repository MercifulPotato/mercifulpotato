Most of the Starlink satellites from the first patch have already come down on their own as planned (as have the 2 tintin proto ones)<p>This applies for ISS even more (it is huge and thus a lot of drag) and thus it has one of the Progress spacecraft docked or the Russian service module use its engines to boost it back into proper orbit so that it wont crash down on earth.')
