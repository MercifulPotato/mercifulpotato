If your contract obligates you to let your employer know of other jobs you&#x27;d be in breech of contract. It&#x27;s not okay to just assume these people are in breech of contract just because you might be if you did the same.<p>As for future risk should a company be able to limit you from partying on a sunday simply because statistically you&#x27;d probably perform worse on monday? If that clause is not in the agreed employment contract then the company gets no say in what you do on sunday, right? It&#x27;s amazing to me that people feel so morally beholden to companies that would dispose of them the second it would be obviously profitable to do so. Companies feel no moral obligation to employees, they behave just as ethically as the workforce and consumers demand they behave. They do not volunteer extra consideration just because it might feel right. The idea that any employee should afford them extra consideration beyond their contract is arguably wrong and potentially unethical. If the workforce holds that employees owe companies more than they receive, would that workforce not be partially responsible for setting up unfair relationships and toxic work environments?')
