Long story short, It turns out I have a severe sleep apnea and it became more pronounced when my physical activity went down significantly (aka I was less tired). Few days later after i started using my CPAP machine my dreams came back. Make sure you don&#x27;t have sleep apnea, about 7-8% of people have it.')
