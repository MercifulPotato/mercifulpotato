The &quot;Deficit Reduction Act&quot; of 2005 (thanks Bush), requires a 5 year look-back period for transactions to family members. Meaning that if a resident spends down all their money and needs to go on medical assistance, the family members are on the hook to pay the equivalent of whatever property or money they received from the parent going back to 5 years before the application of medical assistance (yes, they look at taxes and all bank account records). This stuff is effectively a financial trap for middle class families that has caused immeasurable grief and hardship. Consulting with an lawyer who specializes in elder law is super important.<p>As for nursing homes, they are sometimes the only option left. It&#x27;s heartbreaking to put someone in a nursing home. I have done it but it was absolutely the right thing to do for my family. Everyone&#x27;s situation is different, every nursing home is different. While I am sure that there is no shortage of greedy people, it&#x27;s unfair to suggest that every person is equipped to give up their employment and take on 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365 nursing care for a loved one and that not doing so is somehow &quot;greedy&quot;.')
