Rust is going to yield a lot of result when it comes to security, memory saftely and maintainability and firing Rust devs was terribly short sighted.<p>Mozilla was tired of getting smoked by Chrome, which actually invested in browser development using what the tools they already had (&quot;engineering&quot;), as opposed to subsidizing PhDs on programming language theory.<p>Now it&#x27;s too little too late. They&#x27;ve passed the point where they could catch up on technical grounds, so they make appeals to morality to market their software. Yes, I agree it was bad leadership.')
