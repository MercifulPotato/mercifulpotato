The menu would show various emoji, but selecting one would sometimes use the Unicode version rather than the exact style that I selected.<p>For example, the laughing with tears emoji is in full color with an open mouth, but selecting it results in the outlined version without color and is showing teeth.<p>When the colored emoji do work, they will sometimes be cropped at the bottom or will leave some artifacts behind from a previous selection. These seem to disappear when switching to another tab and then coming back, though.<p>Some of the letters will extend beyond the boundaries of the image, too. For example, the left and right ends of the combinations &quot;me&quot; or &quot;ww&quot; get clipped off.<p>Despite those issues, this looks promising. I really like the interface and overall simplicity of the tool.')
