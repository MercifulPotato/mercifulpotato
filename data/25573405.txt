Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=[25573524, 25573483], score=None, time=1609268376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573320, text='If the cost of living in a place as people actually live is below what a federal poverty formula set in 1963 says it is, then the rate will overreport. If it is above that line, the rate will underreport. In both cases, a number based around the social assumptions of 1963 is not a perfect way to measure what life is actually like for actual people more than fifty years later. Things like household composition and non-cash income affect lived reality too.<p>I hope that answers your question! Personally, I found the report from the Census Bureau and BLS (as per my earlier comment) quite educational for exactly this sort of eminently reasonable concern. But your mileage may vary!')
