I have purged follows several times over the past few years, but I find that the same people that I learned new things from a few months ago changed and got more toxic over time. I recently realized that I would read Twitter for a half hour and at the end couldn&#x27;t think of a single useful thing I learned but my brain felt more chaotic and stressed. Every once in a while I find a new person to follow and learn a new perspective, but if you step back and ask how often that really happens, it is becoming more rare. It has just gotten too hard to filter the noise myself. Twitter inherently sends you superficial, inflammatory ideas faster than I can figure out if they are BS or not. People who I thought were reliable a few months ago change and become unreliable as they get recruited into some tribal war in their own information bubble.')
