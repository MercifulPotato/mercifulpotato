And even with doing I&#x2F;O through 3 PCIe root complexes (out of 4 connected to that CPU), I seem to be hitting some inter-CPU-core bandwidth limitation. The throughput differs depending on which specific CPU cores happen to run the processes doing I&#x2F;Os against different SSDs.<p>Planning to publish some blog entries about these I&#x2F;O tests but a teaser tweet is here (11M IOPS with a single-socket ThreadRipper workstation - it&#x27;s not even a NUMA server! :-)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TanelPoder&#x2F;status&#x2F;1352329243070504964" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TanelPoder&#x2F;status&#x2F;1352329243070504964</a>')
