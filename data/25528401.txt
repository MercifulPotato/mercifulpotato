When moving in, ask for a walkthrough with a landlord and note everything that is wrong, take pictures of everything (including a newspaper) and email it to them. Before moving out, ask the landlord what you will need to do to get your security deposit back. Get a cheap can of spackle and fill and smooth any minor holes you made (it&#x27;s not always required but it&#x27;s easy) but mainly don&#x27;t leave anything that isn&#x27;t considered wear and tear. Do a walk-through with the landlord when you leave, take pictures of everything, send it to them. Follow any steps required by law, such as returning the keys on time and providing a forwarding address. If the landlord tries to take your security deposit or charge you for damages or cleaning, reference the laws, pictures, and conversation, and ask them to reconsider. If you do everything right you may still have to go to court for some reason or another, but you will be well prepared and confident. You can also often have free 30 minute consultations with lawyers; ask your employer if they provide assistance.')
