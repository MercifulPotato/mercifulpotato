My state has only voted blue for obama the first time he ran. Other than that, since bush, it has been red. I&#x27;m assuming they are either polling white liberals in the major cities, or they just ignored the electoral college voting records. I really think they have a bias that a democrat governor got elected somehow means people don&#x27;t like trump here. No they just hated the republican governor who treaded on his own constituents and sold out a significant amount of our budget for the worthless foxxconn deal. People didn&#x27;t want change, they just wanted that bourgeoisie moron out.<p>I mean trump flipped an affluent blue white people electoral vote. I can assure you these aren&#x27;t the people unemployed due to covid and that they are still voting red which basically means trump will win my state again.')
