It wasn&#x27;t fat penguins or even fat tanuki.<p>It was Pokémon.<p>With a bit of alcohol to loosen the tongue, I found that I could start interesting conversations with Japanese people by using Pokémon as an opening topic. It was something everybody knew on my side of the pond and on theirs. As an added bonus they would help me when I fumbled my Japanese, the learning of which constituted ~50% of why I went to bars to strike up conversations with randos in the first place. (I am not a great conversationalist.)<p>So yeah, Pokémon was my Seinfeld, I guess.')
