But the place you are talking about is just the bit of western Fresno County that you can see from I-5, what informed people call Westlands. Before 1968, the Westlands was never green. Not even once. Its natural hydrology is that of absence.<p>&gt; Nobody else was affected.<p>Not sure what you could possibly be talking about with this sentence. The whole state was greatly affected by the drought.<p>You have bought into the propaganda of a Beverley Hills billionaire.
