This is not a typical supply and demand marketplace. The supply here is artificially constrained by existing regulations, and there&#x27;s a vicious relationship between land owners, elected officials, and demand pressure from folks with high paying jobs.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see how little things have progressed over the last few decades. For example, check this study [1] from <i>fourty</i> years ago.<p>TL;DR: &quot;<i>A recent survey of local land use policies in the Bay Area identified the important role that land-use controls play in limiting developments. The suburban land squeeze is not the exclusive result of immutable natural constraints. It is the outcome of the restrictive land use and development regulations imposed by many of the region&#x27;s 100 land governments. A new mood has emerged in the suburbs; land use controls now place severe limits on where, when and how the region can develop. Continued suburban land conversion is now viewed as undesirable, and efforts to limit residential development are well organized and effective.</i>&quot;<p>It&#x27;s certainly not an &quot;evil cabal of landlords in a dimly lit room&quot;, but it&#x27;d be naive to ignore the systemic forces at play.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escholarship.org&#x2F;uc&#x2F;item&#x2F;0ds0q9q4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escholarship.org&#x2F;uc&#x2F;item&#x2F;0ds0q9q4</a>')
