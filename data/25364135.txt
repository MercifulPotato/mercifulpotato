No right is absolute because we don&#x27;t live in a world of absolutes. Free speech, without any limits at all, becomes libel, harassment, hate speech, incitement to violence, sedition, etc.<p>Absolutism in rights is a thought-terminating clich√©, evidenced by the fact that there are literal lifetimes of scholarship in regards to when rights begin and when they end, and which right to prioritize when multiple people&#x27;s rights are conflicting with each other.<p>&gt; The democrats were claiming fraud 4 years go due to a supposed Russian influence.The evidence was tenuous and circumstantial at best. I dont remember seeing a similar cry for censorship.<p>There was a claim that ended up in a Special Counsel investigation in which _multiple_ people associated with the Trump 2016 campaign ended up going in prison for, including Michael Flynn.<p>Comparing claims of potential fraud, followed up by investigation and mostly finished when such investigation discovered some things and disproved others, is an eminently healthy level of questioning over the complete <i>insanity</i> of fraud claims.<p>The current claims of fraud are not of anyone with a sound mind. Do not conflate one thing with the other; they&#x27;re not anywhere near the same league.')
