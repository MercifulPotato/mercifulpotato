Living in Colombia is great for your mental health.  People don&#x27;t talk about Bitcoin, IPOs, or political turmoil.<p>Great neighborhood vibe.  Folks are really friendly.  Have a lot of friends that make the Colombian minimum wage ($300 a month) and they&#x27;re generally happier than my rich friends back home.  Took me a few years to understand the culture, but worth it cause it taught me a whole new way to look at life.')
