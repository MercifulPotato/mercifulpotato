I always thought the point of contention was exec()&#x27;ing executables not delivered through the store, which both of them can clearly do.<p>Update: It seems like UserLAnd just hasn&#x27;t been updated in a while, and the API level requirement is apparently not enforced for existing apps in the store.')
