Botocove is an extension of Amazon&#x27;s Boto3 library, using async.io and a decorator to allow functions to be easily run in every AWS account in an organization concurrently.<p>I found myself needing to interact with all of the 200+ accounts in our AWS organization and copying chunks of code around to do it. Botocove provides  a decorator that can run a Python function against every AWS account you aim it at, or every account in your organization, concurrently.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;botocove&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;botocove&#x2F;</a><p>I use it for most often for things like inspecting all accounts for security and audit checks, ad-hoc queries, or deployment of changes (such as updating IAM password policy, deploying a Cloudformation stack, and so on). By default it&#x27;s opinonated to use standard AWS Organizations setup and roles, and generate a list of every account within an organization; but everything is configurable.<p>Any feedback would be great, hope it&#x27;s helpful!')
