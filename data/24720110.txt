I see dozens of different issues listed in the post, on different endpoints, all of which presumably took time to find. When they said they had a team of multiple people work for months on this, I am unsure why you think they haven’t spent their time as efficiently as “a pentesting team”. Actually, I’ll be stronger: looking through the list of things they discovered, it seems like they were absolutely churning out vulnerabilities for the entire period. A real team would have certainly cost much more than what they’ve currently been paid.')
