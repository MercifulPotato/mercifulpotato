This time I did so by reducing the quantity progressively over a week, and I did not experience any headache at all.<p>I don&#x27;t feel especially better, but now I don&#x27;t have to drink coffee everyday. Before, I got headaches every weekend because I only drank it at the office, unless I also forced myself to have coffee on the weekend.\nI still get one sometimes, but I make sure to not do it everyday so I don&#x27;t relapse.')
