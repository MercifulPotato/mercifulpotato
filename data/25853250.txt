Support personnel is relatively cheap; if their services are priced correctly, they can easily become a stream of <i>recurring</i> income - and everybody knows that &quot;recurring income is best income&quot;.<p>However, this requires efficiency and creativity at the managerial level. It&#x27;s easier to see support as a burden and just work on shrinking its costs, instead of maximizing its revenues by formulating good price plans. The former is an internal effort that is fairly easy to implement in short timeframes and will easily win brownie points with direct superiors (who doesn&#x27;t like to cut costs?); the latter requires actual pricing skills and market knowledge, and might take a while to get results. The mediocre manager will always prefer the former.')
