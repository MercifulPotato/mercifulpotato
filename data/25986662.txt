Who uses C# in his day job.<p>For quite a long time F# simply wasn&#x27;t ready, and by the time it was C# had already become an industry behemoth.<p>But more critically, it&#x27;s not a language that&#x27;s officially supported by Unity. That&#x27;s enough for it not to be a wise choice to be betting a project on it where there are dozens of jobs on the line, and families that could be impacted.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that this concern isn&#x27;t simply isolated to Unity software development; where else has the decision been made to not use F# on account of it not enjoying as much industry support as C#?')
