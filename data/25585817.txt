The first lines of Defold code were written more than 10 years ago and at that time Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Proto and Flatbuffers didn&#x27;t exist. One could argue that we should change to a newer format, but for our purposes protobuf still works really well.<p>2. Defold uses LuaSockets to make TCP and UDP sockets available to developers through our Lua API. And we also make TCP sockets available to our C extension system.<p>3. The next big task which we will start the new year with is a full review of our texture compression formats. Basis Universal is on our list of formats to investigate.<p>4. While we do support import of basic 3D models our focus has been mainly on 2D content. We are currently negotiating funding for improved 3D support in a work package for 2021. If all goes well you can expect some major improvements in this area.<p>Feel free to ask more questions!')
