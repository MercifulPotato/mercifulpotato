Part of it is that I&#x27;m asking for so many of these <i>de novo</i> supports when coworkers are so much more independent. The fixes happen easily, but need comms and planning that mostly only brings marginal benefits to me. I mostly leaned on ambient energy and indirect attention of others -- e.g., my best &quot;need to be productive&quot; days came from sitting in a common area and making sure my screen faced out, so my sense of pleasing others kept me accountable. Other ways are possible, but it&#x27;s hard to reinvent your whole way of managing yourself, esp when it mostly feels like a solitary effort, I guess?<p>Anyhow, thanks for hearing me out. I know it might not sound like it makes tons of sense. It&#x27;s a layered failure of all my prior mechanisms for happiness and satisfaction in work')
