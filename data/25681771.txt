This is evidence that our <i>towns</i> can be human scale. A city is 10x to 100x that. I don’t think you can scale up the time that students spend walking by 10-100x and still be okay. You’re going to need some kind of wheeled transportation, and the layout might have to accommodate it in a way that a college campus with purely walkable trips doesn’t.')
