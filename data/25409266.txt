There&#x27;s a reason the US usually does this to countries far from its own borders, separated by oceans, or both, so that the blowback when popular support collapses and the ongoing cost in blood and treasure becomes intolerable is born by people that are remote from the US (in both the target country and it&#x27;s neighbors.)<p>Aside from those pragmatic concerns, the same considerations also have a moral dimension, though that&#x27;s less consistently reflected in policy decisions.')
