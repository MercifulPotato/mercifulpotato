Probably the easiest B2B API integration scenario I worked with in the past was XML + XML Schema validation. And I still think XML is more readable in many cases than JSON, because while verbose the hierarchical structure is very easy to grasp, sometimes I misread an entire JSON document at first because I missed a quick &quot;[&quot; or &quot;[{&quot; (yes I have also misread XML documents because of the sheer weight of text you are presented with, so I&#x27;ll call that one a wash).<p>I do agree with the XML criticisms around writability and complexity, though I think if you made a Venn diagram of the actual complexities inherent in managing a multi-client document-exchange system and the complexities of XML+Schema, you&#x27;d find that they&#x27;re similar--and that many people who start building such an exchange with JSON documents end up stumbling into the same amount of complexity except in an ad hoc fashion.<p>It&#x27;s funny, I wonder if other people have the same surreal experience: as the mass zeitgeist moved away from XML I was more or less like, okay, gotta go with it, as the driftwood goes with the currents. It&#x27;s interesting how the zeitgeist functions.  You can tell it&#x27;s happening when people look at your functional system and are like, &quot;Uhh, why aren&#x27;t you using X...?&quot; as though it&#x27;s self-evident that you should drop everything and rewrite.  Where X was, over the years (dating myself) {&quot;Java&quot;, &quot;PHP&quot;, &quot;Node&quot;, &quot;Rails&quot;, &quot;Jquery&quot;, &quot;REST&quot;, &quot;Angular&quot;, &quot;React&quot;, &quot;Thrift&quot;, &quot;NoSQL&quot;, &quot;Protobuf&quot;, &quot;Hadoop&quot;}.  Some of which I quite happily used, BTW, so the interesting part is the penetrative nature of the conversation, e.g. how the quite-functional-but-not-hot technology becomes the sick gazelle falling behind the herd, even as it is not empirically sick.')
