Open magit, press “s” on each hunk to stage it and magit moves to the next hunk, then “c c” to write a commit message, C-c C-c to commit, then “q” and I’m right back in the code. If you need to edit a hunk you press enter on it and it drops you into the file.<p>This is much much faster than doing it with the mouse, and keeps me more in “the flow”. In general Emacs becomes powerful because it’s full of little tricks that add up to much tighter feedback loops which is so helpful when coding, to keep your attention on the problem you’re trying to solve. And it is trivial to add your own “little tricks” to tighten the feedback loop for whatever you’re doing.')
