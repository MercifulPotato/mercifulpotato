Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding you, you seem to be ignoring decades worth of programming language research and the years of work put into designing individual languages (whether by BDFLs, communities, or ANSI committees).<p>I agree with you that perhaps jet engines weren&#x27;t the perfect metaphor. However, I think that that&#x27;s because jet engines have much more stringent external (physical) constraints than software or programming languages. The latter do allow for a certain amount of &quot;taste-judgment&quot;: it doesn&#x27;t matter too much which way you do it, but some people at some times prefer one way over another.<p>So a more apt metaphor might be architecture: We&#x27;ve known how to build houses for millenia, but we&#x27;re still improving our materials and techniques, while tradition and fashion continue to play a big role in what they end up looking like.')
