He was a little offended that I wasn&#x27;t going to use the new measurements but I pleaded with him enough that he relented.<p>One very interesting thing that convinced me to start doing this: if you get measurements taken at night (vs early in the day), your prescriptions will be stronger as your eyes are already tired.
