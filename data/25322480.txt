Item(by='tomhoward', descendants=None, kids=[25323227], score=None, time=1607249488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321770, text='Not meaning to suggest he &quot;asked for it&quot;, but there&#x27;s a reason hotels have safes and secure storage services.<p>Burglaries happen all the time. Even if all the windows are locked, burglaries can happen in all sorts of ways, particularly in free-standing houses. I don&#x27;t like leaving my laptop or other valuables in my own home. I keep my devices with me when I can, and avoid owning items that burglars would want to steal (watches, jewellery etc).<p>Another issue with electronic devices and insurance is fraud. Having worked in the travel industry for a long time, I&#x27;ve known of people working in the industry, casually making fraudulent claims on devices just because they felt like an upgrade. Fraud is easy to commit and hard to prove, so the insurers just can&#x27;t offer much cover, unless you&#x27;re willing to take out special top-level cover for your devices, which is expensive for just this reason.<p>It always sucks being robbed, and it&#x27;s natural to want to blame someone, but I&#x27;m not sure what more Airbnb is meant to do in cases like this.')
