Someone recently linked to an article that does a pretty good job of going over the massive infrastructure costs[1]. The U.S. also has relatively well funded education[2]. I think many of the comments here reflect one of the reasons we&#x27;re in the situation we are in - the inability to consider that we might be able to do things better, even when there are plenty of examples from other countries to look at. To quote from the first article:<p>&gt; The answer, I believe, has to do with American incuriosity. Incuriosity is not merely ignorance. Ignorance is a universal trait, people just differ in what they are ignorant about. But Americans are unique in not caring to learn from other countries even when those countries do things better.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of truth in that; look at how almost all the discussions about healthcare ignore the successful systems in other countries. It goes beyond that, though. We shouldn&#x27;t have to look at other countries to consider the possibility that we could be doing things better. But whenever it&#x27;s suggested that we could make things better, there seems to be a lot of hostility to the idea and push back against it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pedestrianobservations.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;03&#x2F;why-american-costs-are-so-high-work-in-progress&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pedestrianobservations.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;03&#x2F;why-american-c...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;eduresource&#x2F;education-spending.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;eduresource&#x2F;education-spending.htm</a>')
