Despite it&#x27;s name it was really just text adventures but with the occasional slowly-drawn static scene.<p>Also a big fan of Level 9 and Infocom, though the only one of theirs I ever completed was the Leather Goddesses of Phobos. Quirky, funny, and clever, but quite stereotypical in retrospect.')
