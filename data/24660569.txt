If there&#x27;s no direct profit, I can&#x27;t imagine talented people are going to waste that much time on it.<p>Wikipedia, reddit, HN, and stackoverflow would beg to differ. Reputation drives people to expend incredible amounts of effort. In 2002 I would have had the same intuition you do. But i&#x27;ve seen reputation systems and social credit build too many incredible things to feel that way anymore.<p>&gt; Reputation is also not that great of a proxy, it encourages strategies which push the risks into the tails. If it&#x27;s money, you have a much stronger incentive to reduce your own tail risk since your entire livelihood is at stake, rather than just your ability to play the local game.<p>I do think there&#x27;s a reasonable argument that the risk curves will be different, but I don&#x27;t really see how that cashes out in an inaccurate overall system. It seems to me that as long as reputation gets allocated to those who are consistently correct, the system should work pretty well.')
