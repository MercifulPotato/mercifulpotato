The evidence just doesn&#x27;t back up that enforcing petty crime in some way makes cities safer. Peaks of petty crime enforcement were in periods like the late 80s and 90s, which were when violent crime exploded.<p>&gt; there is an assault or a stabbing or shooting every day in Hollywood now.<p>b. Crime statistics also don&#x27;t back up the idea that violent crime is much worse now, especially when you consider the fact that we&#x27;re talking about a comment comparing with the 80s&#x2F;90s.<p>Do these things occur?
