Is it the lack of socialization when growing up?. &quot;Data is the new oil&quot; just means that it is an important economical and political asset, that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s the extend of the analogy.Nobody is thinking about API degrees, viscosity, sulfur content, etc. For the purpose intended the analogy works. I am pretty sure you could come up with  a better analogy (Data is a car, in true Slashdot style) but watch like not even 5 min later another guy will come up to pick your analogy apart with the most literal of interpretations.<p>In my special hell I am doomed to take literature classes with a bunch of programmers.')
