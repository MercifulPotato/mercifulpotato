But what about software design? Building architects (not software) study thousands of buildings in their training and career. Software developers, in contrast, only study a handful of other large software designs. This means we repeat mistakes that we would have been able to avoid, should we be able to learn from others. In the world where the majority of large real-world programs are closed-source, opening up our software design documentation is the least we can do to contribute back to the community, and we&#x27;d like to see more people opening theirs up!')
