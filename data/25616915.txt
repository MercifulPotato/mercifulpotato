All the talk about &quot;We are definitely working on generalized efforts to make &#x27;most&#x2F;all&#x2F;everything&#x27; faster&quot; is just that: talk. There&#x27;s exactly zero priority given to performance issues in lieu of flashy visual upgrades which only make the actual experience worse.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re trying to focus on frustrating pages&#x2F;experiences rather than number of network calls and such, because while the latter is correlated, the former (frustrating slow experiences) is really the bar and the higher priority.<p>Exactly: you aren&#x27;t even trying to understand what people are telling you. These metrics you ask for and then dismiss entirely <i>are the primary, core, systemic reason</i> for frustrating slow experiences that you pretend are &quot;high priority&quot;. No, frustrating slow experiences have not been a high priority for years (if ever).<p>If you need to do 200 requests and load  27.5 MB of data to display an empty page, <i>therein lies your problem</i>. You, and other PMs at Atlassian fail to understand these basic things, and yet we get platitudes like &quot;performance is our top priority&quot;. It is <i>not</i>. You&#x27;re good at hiding information and buttons behind multiple layers of clicks, each of which needs another 200 requests and 5-15 seconds to execute.<p>Oh. You&#x27;re also good at adding useless crap like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grumpy.website&#x2F;post&#x2F;0TcOcOFgL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grumpy.website&#x2F;post&#x2F;0TcOcOFgL</a> while making sure that your software is nigh unusable: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dmitriid&#x2F;status&#x2F;888415958821416960" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dmitriid&#x2F;status&#x2F;888415958821416960</a> I imagine all performance tickets get dismissed because no one can see the description even on a 5k monitor')
