As you found, a Tablespoon is an &quot;exact&quot; measurement and most don&#x27;t use their actual eating utensils for cooking - though I&#x27;m sure at one point they were used.<p>Often I&#x27;ve found with watching cooking shows (and some of my own experience) when hosts say something like &quot;add a ___ of blah&quot; and then proceed to just pour it out of the container without exact measurement the reason they are giving a measurement is to give a rough approximate of how much but the exact amount doesn&#x27;t really matter, though it never hurts to go towards the smaller for things like seasoning.<p>In terms of baking recipes (bread, cakes, cookies, etc) the exact amount matters more (chemistry or live things) but you can still be off by a bit and things will still work.')
