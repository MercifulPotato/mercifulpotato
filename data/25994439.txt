Learning to avoid spyware and viruses really does require practice, and when you haven&#x27;t spent the past decade visiting sketchy download sites, you really lose an eye for what&#x27;s what.<p>I still recoil at the thought of being told &quot;no, that&#x27;s a container, not a codec!&quot;<p>TBH, I&#x27;m still surprised at how awful some video stuff is. I&#x27;ve actually had about 5 false starts trying to make Plex work, and I&#x27;m trying it again (yeah, I never learn). Now the codecs and transcoding and stuff works on modern hardware, but it simply refuses to index content that you don&#x27;t rename to please the master. It&#x27;s absolutely insane. Software designed to make your life harder, not easier. There&#x27;s a reason I just point Kodi to a NAS share. (speaking of awful configs.... but at least it plays!)')
