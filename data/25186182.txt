I certainly don&#x27;t. If Apple deprecated 32-bit while introducing x64 then the writing would be on the wall but they kept supporting and updating 32-bit.<p>&gt; You figured 32-bit would be supported for what, 20 years? 30?<p>At least one hardware generation lifetime from moment of deprecation (5 years would be bad, 10 would be great). There were 32-bit AU plugins still being sold in 2018 and some of them never got an update. KORG never updated some of their synth control apps for synthesisers that are still on sale - they just updated docs and wrote that macOS is not supported anymore.')
