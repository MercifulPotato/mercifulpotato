The parts where the circle appears to be moving up&#x2F;down&#x2F;left&#x2F;right have one side set to the &#x27;outwards&#x27; motion, the opposite side set to the &#x27;inwards&#x27; motion, and the other sides in sync.<p>The human visual cortex has so, so many edge cases like this. It&#x27;s wonderful!')
