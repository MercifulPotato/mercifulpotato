What is sociopathy? Can we measure it or just categorize it under some label of symptoms that themselves will be interpreted with a wide spectrum of perspectives? Everybody is different, but I find these labels with negative connotations to not be terribly useful until they can be measured. What does society or any individual gain with the label? Some people I know who believe themselves to be a sociopath use it as a crutch or an excuse for their behavior in hopes no one will blame them for being born with a condition. They&#x27;re still capable of behaving in socially acceptable ways - the most deranged of sociopathic killers aren&#x27;t literally overcome with insatiable urges or else they wouldn&#x27;t make it to adulthood in society, right?<p>Bit of rambling, I know, but I just don&#x27;t get why we seem to celebrate the label. I&#x27;m aware that I don&#x27;t experience any other person emotions other than my own and that makes me very limited to the understanding of my own emotions, but my observations tell me that I could walk into a few pysch wards and have a diagnosis of sociopathy within a few weeks if I wanted. My observations also tell me that the main reason for desiring that label would be to feel unique, accomplished (by overcoming some obstacle) or to use that label as a &quot;get out of social judgement jail free&quot; card.')
