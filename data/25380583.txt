The GOP Senate sat on it (and did nothing else either) for the past 7 months.<p>Oh, except for a hearing pushing hydroxychloroquine in November, months after multiple studies had shown it ineffective, and a hearing promoting an anti-vaxer just last week. And I guess a bunch of hearings a few months ago wherein various GOP senators heaped ignorant abuse on public health officials.<p>If your favorite small business goes under, if your local hospital collapses, if your town goes bankrupt, etc., the institutional GOP and its donors are to blame.<p>We can all keep our fingers crossed for Georgia Senate runoffs, and for some real leadership come January.')
