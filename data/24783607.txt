If they applied conventional software engineering so far as it applies they would do a lot better.(e.g. use version controls but don&#x27;t check the database password in,  think carefully what configuration goes with the hardware,  the &quot;model&quot; in general,  a particular instance of the &quot;model&quot;,  etc.)<p>ML projects get you in trouble in other areas.<p>For one thing,  an ML project might involve a step that takes 24 hours or more to train a model.  This means you have to schedule in terms of calendar time (e.g. can&#x27;t start task A until task B is complete) as opposed to punch clock time,  story points, or whatever passes for reality in your flavor of agile.<p>Related to that is automated testing.  Normal software &quot;works or doesn&#x27;t work&quot; but ML software is expected to get it wrong a certain fraction of the time so the question of &quot;Is version x.y.z good to ship?&quot; is fundamentally different in nature with ordinary software.<p>It irks me particularly that he ends his circle with &quot;harvest insights&quot; when any real game theorist knows it is about taking actions based on information -- e.g. why winners at gambling and trading use the Kelly Criterion.')
