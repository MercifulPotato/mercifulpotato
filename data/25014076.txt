I used to ride cheap buses because I didn&#x27;t have much money, now (pre-corona) I still ride them even though I&#x27;m doing well. You meet people, hear fun stories, find yourself in interesting situations... There are &quot;filters&quot; on the population that rides airplanes or trains, but all of humanity rides the bus. And while the chance that a grandma unpacks her food and shares some with you on the plane is nil, I&#x27;ve had it happen to me multiple times on the bus, so there&#x27;s that :)')
