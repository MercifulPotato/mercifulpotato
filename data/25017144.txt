I don&#x27;t see what the use is in ensuring the hardware is running software from &quot;trustworthy&quot; persons, especially when the device&#x27;s owner is not usually considered to be part of that group. This feels like something we aught to question, why is it acceptable that even after buying some electronic device there&#x27;s a part of it that the owner isn&#x27;t allowed to touch? Embedded devices are just smaller and more focused versions of general-purpose desktop computers, and the latter has been operating just fine now allowing owners to run whatever code they want.')
