Advocates of housing reforms such as the ones you list are outright opposed to the fact that housing is market priceâ€“determined by supply and demand, the same as the price of apples or lumber or a barrel of oil. And it is for that reason, rather than the practical details, that the broader political movement of which the demand for it is the leading edge is ultimately doomed to failure: For the amorality of the market economy is part of its essence, and cannot be legislated away.<p>Rent control for instance causes a decrease in the supply of housing. People in Stockholm are on 12 year waiting lists for apartments because rent control has reduced the amount of housing available. Simply telling people it&#x27;s not a commodity will not make it cease to function like one.')
