Say I make an app for soccer moms with millions of users - do you think I would get significant Twitter support from my customer base if my app went away? Conversely, don&#x27;t you think I can get the radicalized 50 customers of my pro-genocide to scream very loud on Twitter for weeks?<p>This does not even touch on founders&#x2F;devs who want to stay anonymous for whatever reasons and a lot of other edge cases. It is a shitty system.')
