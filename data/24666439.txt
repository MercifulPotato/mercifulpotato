I have contemplated using something else many, many times.  I have even contemplated rolling my own solution.  But a CMS isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m really interested in building.  I&#x27;ve never edited a single line of PHP for my blog, so the fact that it is built with PHP does not concern me.  Sometimes people are surprised I choose to use WordPress instead of inventing something of my own in a programming language I&#x27;m passionate about.  I always point out that if I did that I would not have time for anything else with the programming languages I enjoy.')
