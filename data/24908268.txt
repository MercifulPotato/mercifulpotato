As you probably aware since you in hardware business, AWGs are probably one of most common equipment in any electronic and electrical labs or companies.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronicdesign.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;fpgas&#x2F;article&#x2F;21776739&#x2F;asiclike-fpga-methodology-saves-up-to-9925000-in-nre-costs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronicdesign.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;fpgas&#x2F;article&#x2F;...</a>')
