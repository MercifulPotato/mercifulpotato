This means that the generated control voltage might not match up to exactly to what it should be for the desired note and it&#x27;ll end up sounding out of tune. What&#x27;s worse is that even if you adjust for this you&#x27;ll need to re-adjust as the instrument gets warmer!<p>Instability ironically prized and cherished by synth enthusiasts who will claim it makes old synthesizers sound &quot;better&quot; than modern ones...')
