Coffee is supposed to be bitter.<p>I think part of the reason why â€“ my mother has always been very health-conscious (she is a doctor), and growing up she didn&#x27;t allow us to have sugar in tea or coffee. She would hide the sugar at the back of the pantry, she&#x27;d bring it out when guests came over but then it would disappear again as soon as they left. And she only ever bought reduced fat milk. So make me a coffee with full cream milk and sugar, and it just tastes wrong.')
