Item(by='aksss', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610384919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731108, text='&gt; does it really matter if electricity prices spike?<p>One of the reasons the electricity costs spike is because you’re maintaining two generation facilities in Germany and Spain. Solar takes massive investment but the coal plants still need to be maintained and fed for when the Sun is obscured. And I think I recall that in a place like Germany, electric demand actually goes up, not down, when the sun is obscured - more people indoors.<p>I would also like to add that it matters significantly on an individual&#x2F;family basis to productive capacity and well-being when electricity costs go up, whether manifested as blackouts or much steeper bills. Not everyone is wealthy enough to absorb that without noticeable pain. There’s a bit of a “let them eat cake” aspect to comments like this.')
