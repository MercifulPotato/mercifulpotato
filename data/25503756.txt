I was immediately suspicious of anyone who contacted me. I signed up for the forum with a password from my password manager (I like toying with attackers). I told him I signed up, and a few minutes later he said there was a problem with my account and asked if I used a password manager. I said yes. He said to sign up without it because the site doesn&#x27;t support it. I tried arguing with him that that makes no sense. But arguing with someone who&#x27;s lying and refuses to admit it is generally not productive, and the argument got nowhere.<p>His idea to make me sign up without a password manager was illogical anyways. If I use a password manager on his site, it should be obvious I use a password manager for my video game account, so me halting my password manager usage for his site wouldn&#x27;t help him get my video game account.')
