You have to pay for what you use. For some things, that&#x27;s a pricetag in dollars that you can look at on your balance sheet. For all software except that cast into the public domain, that&#x27;s an obligation to use it in the ways that the license requires.

If the price for software in usage rights is too high, you make the same decision.')
