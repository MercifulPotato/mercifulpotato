Compare that to how many people police kills in USA? There is pretty hard data that European police is drastically less violent overall.<p>It is possible that European police is more racist than US police, yes, but that wasn&#x27;t what we were talking about. I&#x27;m pretty sure that US police is more violent against white people than European police is against gypsies, meaning that even with the racism European police is still much better.')
