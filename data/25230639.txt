I still think there is a difference in degree between (A) reading a long, thoughtful article and responding with unkind speculations about the author, and (B) reading such speculation that has little content in it and responding in turn with unkind speculations about the comment&#x27;s author; but only a difference of degree, not of kind, I admit.<p>&gt; your comment would put a chilling effect on frankly discussing other people, as though the only way to do so is through irrationality and gossip.<p>The proverb I quoted would do that, sure, which is why it&#x27;s explicitly marked as only a decent (not excellent) heuristic. There are honest, thoughtful ways to go about discussing and criticizing people. Speculations and borderline conspiracy theories are not among them.')
