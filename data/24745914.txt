Its been a little while since I have done more than basic web stuff but you mentioned some good examples. Its just insane to me that HTML5 has not evolved the basic UI components more. Old browsers be damned, we can shim the stuff that we already hack into working I am sure.<p>Hell I am okay with some bits requiring specific JS callbacks for &quot;real handling&quot; as long as web UI OOTB improves a bit.')
