I use a lot of weird USB hardware, and debugging USB serial-port issues is impossible (even with a Beagle USB debugger, it only gets you half way, system logs on macos are not particularly helpful).<p>Why FreeBSD over Linux?<p>This is the most perplexing decision in the article. Why would OP do this? I have FreeBSD running on an old laptop, along side an Ubuntu laptop. There&#x27;s more software ported for Ubuntu than FreeBSD and I don&#x27;t want to rebuild everything for BSD, I have too much work to do. Nobody targets BSD but BSD devs.<p>I&#x27;d like to know though, OP aside, besides the BSD networking speed and extensions, why FreeBSD over Linux when the latter is more widely supported for GP dev?<p>I feel the author&#x27;s frustration, though. macOS is really diverging[1] from BSD and become even more obfuscated, and as a power user who spent over two decades working in Linux, it is very hard for me to treat macOS and Win10 seriously as development platforms (to my hireability&#x27;s detriment, I suppose) for anything other than Node&#x2F;Electron and playing around for my own projects.<p>&gt; I use Windows 10 on a PC I built and it&#x27;s fine.<p>Because you probably don&#x27;t use Win10 the way other people use it. If you&#x27;ve spent any time developing in Linux, Windows is a pathetic development system once you step outside Visual Studio. The Unix command line is one of the most insanely flexible tools every built, which is why the philosophy has changed so little in 40+ years. (Plus I don&#x27;t like ads popping up in the toolbar or start menu when I&#x27;m trying to work.)<p>[1] Case in point: I tried setting up iPerf on a new MBP today. port&#x2F;brew both failed to install correctly with lib dependencies broken. `iperf`? Seriously? &#x2F;smh&#x2F;<p>EDIT: I meant despite OP&#x27;s decision in Q above.')
