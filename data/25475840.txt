They even support admin deployed virtual backdrops.<p>Our intern (who I&#x27;m sure is in a shared &#x2F; crappy space) has a zoom background from their college they drop in - looks clean &#x2F; professional and they can participate.<p>I snapped a shut from my zoom camera at the office, and use it as the background if I&#x27;m at home (with bed behind me not always made up, boxes from our move still stacked up). It&#x27;s practically indistinguishable - I got rid of my green screen because the auto replace is that good on zoom.<p>I bill at $100&#x2F;hr+. Maybe low by silicon valley standards, but people have expectations in my non tech field.')
