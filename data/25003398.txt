And (sometimes) the debugger.<p>For some projects I have different language environments - like CLion and PyCharm - open simultaneously. With a browser in the background for checking docs and StackOverflow.<p>I suppose I could do all of that in Vim too, but I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;d want to.<p>There are things I&#x27;d improve about JetBrains, not least the ability to effortlessly open the same project on different machines.
