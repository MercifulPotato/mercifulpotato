Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601826938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677665, text='Most of the good spontaneous conversations I&#x27;ve had at work were previously on Slack anyway, for a couple of reasons:<p>- You&#x27;re not interrupting someone &#x2F; taking up their whole time. If you have a thought, they can wait until they&#x27;re free to reply, and if you&#x27;re both free at the same time you can have a good conversation. But you were still able to write out and communicate the thought.<p>- More people can join and provide input. I can always talk about things with a couple folks on my team, but it&#x27;s super valuable to have someone from another part of the company pipe up and say &quot;Hey, what about this&quot; without having to consciously think of inviting them (and interrupting them, see the above point - the way to do this in person is to have extremely large &quot;user group&quot; meetings that are low value for their opportunity cost for most of the attendees).<p>- I can easily find people in other parts of the company &#x2F; work across teams because teams tend to be in physically separate locations. It&#x27;s super easy for me to run something past someone who works in the other building; it would take about 10 minutes of my time total to go there and back, and then I&#x27;d have to hope they&#x27;re at their desk.<p>- This is something of a mixed blessing, but conversations are logged, so you can reference them later. To the example you give about chatting about things after a conference, I tend to write up what I&#x27;ve learned or ideas I&#x27;ve followed on and put them into Slack pretty quickly, with the expectation that we&#x27;ll have a conversation about them at some later point but not immediately.<p>What I&#x27;ve been trying to do is to expand all of this and drive even more conversations to Slack. (To be clear: have the conversations in existing public channels, not in DMs, and avoid tagging people in. Also, do not expect people to read any particular conversation. Slack has a pretty good search feature, so if they ask about something later, link them to the previous discussion. I&#x27;m not at all advocating that you take up people&#x27;s time with pings on Slack.) We do also have occasional video calls for higher-bandwidth conversations, but I&#x27;ve found they work best when they&#x27;re structured as accelerators to an async written conversation and not as discussion forums in their own right.')
