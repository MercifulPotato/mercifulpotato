You&#x27;re the best. I offer this all with a spirit of hope and love.<p>I had a nice little chat with another HN user, and I want to report back:<p>Both of us are on linux, and we tried to use:\na) voice call, did not work, autofail<p>b) voice messages - recording them has no audio levels or visual feedback if it&#x27;s working, and there&#x27;s no option to hear what you&#x27;ve recorded before sending it. We both sent audio messages and neither arrived, or even appeared in the chat log.<p>c) even the test chat has wonkiness - like awkward line&#x2F;word wrap.<p>d) Messages in the chat log have a greyed-out &#x27;undelivered&#x27; vibe, but the grayout remains after messages have been read and replied to. It doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.<p>I WANT to love Jami SO BADLY. I want to tell my friends we can use something open instead of Signal!<p>Please, if there are any Jami devs here, please speak up and ask for help. The community is paying attention right now, this is a golden opportunity to get developer eyes on Jami code!')
