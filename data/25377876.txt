I first thought it was a stylized treble clef but I think it&#x27;s more a stylized sixteenth note. Not sure if this was your intention but still great. You might even consider to add the five lines used in sheet music to make the music-part more clear.<p>Speaking of logos, I disliked that you use songbox there, but call your service SongBox. I would change it and maybe even fix it in the user stories.<p>Small suggestion for the image that shows the dashboard: To quote Matthew McC: &quot;You gotta pump those numbers up!&quot; It&#x27;s apparent that they are from a demo account you use, but perhaps you could make the numbers more appealing (don&#x27;t oversell it, though). If I would use your service, I would hope to have a better avg listening time for example.<p>Kudos for that Doctor Who easter egg, btw!')
