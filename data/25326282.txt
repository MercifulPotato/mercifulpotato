This is normally 10-70% of the going rate for a similar freehold property.<p>2) each year for the &quot;ground rent&quot; ie a &quot;pepper corn&quot; or nominal fee to the person who actually owns the building (this is nominally fixed at Â£1-100, but in some recent scams they are exponential)<p>3) &quot;reasonable&quot; maintenance. this is normally paid to either the council for a ex council house, or a management company. They may not be the same entity as the freeholder. You cannot be compelled to pay for &quot;improvements&quot; only reasonable upkeep.<p>Once you have a leasehold, it is tradeable like a freehold.')
