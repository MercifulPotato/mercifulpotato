Twitter doesn&#x27;t care if an ad impression is from a bot, they will get paid for it anyway - until the advertisers decide to pull out of course. I&#x27;m sure they are constantly trying to walk the line between too many and not enough bot activity.<p>I mean with email, spambots are always a net negative because the services that pass e-mails through do not get paid for them. But Twitter does. If you get a bot tweet on your feed, or a bot-promoted one, you engage with it and Twitter gets paid (in &#x27;engagement&#x27;, the magical currency).')
