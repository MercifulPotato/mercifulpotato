Alstavista was nice, but the directories were much more organized and I saw them as the future, so much that at one point I even maintained some categories at dmoz. When Google took off to the point that non-tech people I knew recognized it and dmoz closed down, I was pretty disappointed even though Google was clearly the future by then (And it was better at actually finding stuff back then. Nowadays it&#x27;s an echo chamber and worse, it just feeds you anything, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen a &quot;no results found&quot; page in a decade.).')
