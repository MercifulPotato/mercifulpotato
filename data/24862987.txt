I’m serious. I think it’s healthy not to get too attached to money and deleting $10 without getting anything in return seems good for the soul.<p>I haven’t thought about this a lot but it might actually be pretty hard to do. You can’t just burn cash — that’s illegal. I don’t want the money going to anyone else, so you can’t just buy something with my money and destroy it. Also, you’d need to figure out a way to prove that it has been deleted and that you’re not just pocketing it.<p>Figure out how to delete my money and I’ll gladly pay $10&#x2F;month.')
