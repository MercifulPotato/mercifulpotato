Every company plays with the same regulatory framework. People here want more regulation to force companies to go green but then relentlessly clown companies that play well within these regulation.<p>Tesla was well on its way to profitability, and would have easily been without Corona. They managed to make a little profit anyway because the used credit sales. Even without Credits they would have had impressive results given the global situation.<p>In Q3 Tesla will make a profit way beyond credits and then this &#x27;lets distract from reality&#x27; story-line can die too. And in Q4 people who made this argument will really start to look incredibly dumb.<p>Tesla is making money because they have really fantastic margin on their cars and have really good ROI but instead of talking about that everybody deflected and made fun of them that they made profit &#x27;only&#x27; because of credits.')
