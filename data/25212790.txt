Games where the referee blow the whistle a fraction before the ball hits the net (no goal).  When a goal is given you can celebrate, especially in a live match.  Now VAR robs something of the game. The second goal would not have happened with the first goal being ruled against. Not driven the next England side to  semi-final to almost avenge the 1st goal. VAR is terrible.  Football without VAR is like live - full of injustice, full of revenge, full off real emotions.')
