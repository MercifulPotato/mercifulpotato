This affects every aspect of your life. You are basing your emotional responses and behaviors and making life choices based off whatever ideas and values had currency among a small group of animators&#x2F;story writers&#x2F;producers&#x2F;etc that were active during your childhood.<p>I remember coming to this realization many years ago (I&#x27;m 28 now). I would sometimes catch myself actively conceptualizing a particular movie&#x2F;tv character in trying to understand how to behave or conceptualize a certain situation I was in.<p>Since then I have done a deep dive into the Western canon including history, philosophy, psychology, and religion. From engaging with all of that I have basically purged these contemporary archetypes and narratives and replaced them with traditional, more grounded ones (e.g. from Fresh Prince of Bel Air to Julius Caesar, from the History Channel to Herodotus).<p>It&#x27;s akin to replacing a life long diet of gas station junk food with fresh organic fruits, vegetables, and meats. Since then I have gained an immeasurable sense of equanimity and inner calm. Now when I call upon these archetypes to understand the world and how I should feel and respond to it, I am engaging with things which have roots that go very deep.')
