Any government that does this (however it is done), that government is also doing other things that are confounding factors.<p>The idea is simple: a government that does less costs less, so it needs to collect less taxes. That means people just over the edge could pay for their dental work instead of the government and all the overhead of having a third party involved.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help those completely unable to care for themselves, but  those who are close are no longer pushed over the edge.')
