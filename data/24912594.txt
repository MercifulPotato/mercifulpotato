After driving it for a while we began to notice how many other people drove the same model. Did other people start driving that type of car because of us? No, we just started paying attention to the frequency of our sighting that model, which led us to the conclusion that it was more popular than we realized.<p>The same can be true with advertisements.<p>In the last week this has happened to me twice: once, in a YouTube video being posted by someone that directly related to a conversation I had yet to have and a free flashlight offer appearing in an advertisement on the day I lost power from ice storms. Both were more likely coincidences than anything else.')
