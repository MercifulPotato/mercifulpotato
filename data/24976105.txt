What do we do to (1) get rid of the non-native species, and (2) capture lots of carbon in the process?<p>We’d like to make sure the redwoods survive.  They’re all under 100 years old, so some are big, but not massive, and we have lots of seedlings.<p>I’m worried if we cut all the pine down at once, it’ll ruin the microclimate.  It’s 10-20F cooler in the forest than in the field, with much more water from fog drip, etc.')
