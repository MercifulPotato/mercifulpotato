Learning QM consists of learning to silence your objections to the fact that none of the things you&#x27;re being asked to believe make any sense.<p>It gets somewhat more scrutable when you deal with relativistic QM, where, at least, the terms in Schrodinger equation start to make intuitive sense (it&#x27;s the first couple terms in the Taylor expansion of E psi = sqrt(p^2 + m^2) psi = m sqrt(p^2&#x2F;m^2 + 1) psi = (m + 1&#x2F;2 p^2&#x2F;m)psi ), but then spinors enter the picture and all intuition goes out the window again.')
