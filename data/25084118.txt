But when I wrote my original post, I was taking the fact that libawt_xawt (the awt implementation for X11) links against Cairo at face-value.  But looking a little closer at that, it only uses Cairo in its integration with GTK+ (as GTK+ uses Cairo).<p>Now, OpenJFX (which you could quibble about whether it&#x27;s &quot;part of&quot; Java) uses Cairo extensively in its implementation of using HTML&#x2F;CSS for Java UIs.')
