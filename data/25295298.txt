Perhaps Columbia is hoping it will change.<p>The U.S. is historically the actor with the desire and power to enforce this sort of thing on Latin America, with both carrot and stick. Other countries can decide they care and want to try to enforce it (although the U.S. is the powerful country that&#x27;s <i>closest</i> to Latin America). I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d expect them to try or not, really.<p>One example of what the U.S. has done is require toxic spraying of coca crop in Columbia, even though it causes health and pollution problems. In some cases it&#x27;s even U.S. planes doing it, whether Columbia likes it or not (how would anyone else like it if a foreign country insisted on their right to spray toxic chemicals without permission?) But googling for a cite for that... I see I was wrong about the Trump administration, they actually were trying to force Columbia to start doing the spraying again.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-colombia-drugs&#x2F;colombia-will-have-to-restart-aerial-spraying-to-destroy-coca-trump-idUSKBN20P2WT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-colombia-drugs&#x2F;colombia-w...</a>')
