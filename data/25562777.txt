In most people&#x27;s mind, homeless = bum living in a cardboard box.   What actually happens in reality is someone falls on hard times and they move in with a relative, or bum a room from a friend, or etc, etc.  That&#x27;s what keeps them out of the cardboard box, and keeps them fed.<p>And that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re shit scared to move.  Move, and all those friends and family can&#x27;t help you.  Even scarier, move, and you&#x27;re probably scared the whole friends-and-family ties might get weaker - most people are always paranoid about whether their friends&#x2F;lovers&#x2F;etc still care about them, so they stay close to make sure they&#x27;re &quot;tending the fire&quot; and keeping the friendship alive.  It&#x27;s human.')
