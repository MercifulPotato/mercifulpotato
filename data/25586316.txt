For example, if I offered 6mo subscriptions, people probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase a subscription if they were planning a trip to take in the next month, because you&#x27;re &quot;wasting&quot; 5mo.<p>Now, it could be that my prices are too high, but that was sort of my rationale--I thought it would be better to let people pay for what they need.<p>I think a freemium model could work, but at this point I don&#x27;t think I have any real features that would meaningfully distinguish the free version from the paid version. I did consider limiting like the number of days your trip can be for &quot;free&quot; users--I might revisit this in the future.<p>Really appreciate the feedback!')
