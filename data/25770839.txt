In terms of organization, picking names.  And there&#x27;s much more dedication to testing and documentation.  I think these software habits are very important for newcomers, and so if you are truly dedicated to the craft of software you probably should want them to learn Elixir even if the language is 25% more cumbersome in the small.  There is something about the terseness of erlang that I think carries over to a mentality of not writing tests and not documenting.  It doesn&#x27;t help that it is less of a part of the culture (probably since it&#x27;s an older language, Elixir is a post-&quot;software-testing-revolution&quot; language; Erlang is a pre-testing-revolution language).')
