It&#x27;s a non-periodic alteration to the definition of UTC.  Those niche applications that require second-accurate knowledge of Earth&#x27;s rotational accuracy don&#x27;t need to rely on leap second changes to UTC; they could get that information out of band, and will need to anyway when they need sub-second accuracy.  The 99.999% of other applications that don&#x27;t need to know Earth&#x27;s rotation orientation relative to the sun within a second -- but <i>do</i> have to calculate time differences between two UTC times -- would be much better off not having to deal with leap seconds.  Leap seconds were a terribly misguided idea.')
