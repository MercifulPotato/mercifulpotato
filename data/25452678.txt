Here is how I do, copied verbatim from a previous discussion on HN[1]<p>I don&#x27;t have strict rules, methods, or patterns. However, I follow common themes such as skimming (or speed-reading) boring&#x2F;mundane sections, change books and come back later, read multiple books at a time.<p>Personally, I feel something missing if I totally skip something, so I tend to or try to finish what I read. I was known to be that kid who read Newspapers top to bottom of all pages, so that is that.<p>My tricks;<p>- Don&#x27;t drive, get an Uber and read. I have finished so many books inside an Uber car. I&#x27;m in India and is cheap to get a private driver, the monthly cost pays off with the amount of things you can do in the back of your car, reading books is one.<p>- If I&#x27;m flying, I finish about 2 typical books per leg of the flight.<p>- Always have your Kindle or a Book with you. Read instead of looking at your phone. ;-)<p>- If you have kids, read (physical books) to show them that you read, they will follow.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25357932" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25357932</a>')
