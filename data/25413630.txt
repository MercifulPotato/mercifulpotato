Developing with security in mind will take longer and is literally the opposite of what companies ask for.<p>Police are credited with making arrests, but are almost never credited with treating people with respect.<p>By your logic, police should be encouraged to treat those they&#x27;re supposed to protect and serve with disrespect and err on the side of locking people up, rather than trying to create a safer, more prosperous community.<p>Doing the right thing for the right reasons is (or should be) a thing.  That it isn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t say much for those who ignore an important aspect of software design.<p>I&#x27;ve always striven to meet the ideal that &quot;if it&#x27;s worth doing, it&#x27;s worth doing properly.&quot;<p>I suppose that I shouldn&#x27;t hold others to the standards I set for myself, but sometimes I still do.<p>Feel free to be offended, but I stand by my original statement:<p>&quot;4. But the most egregious offenders are software developers, who often just bolt on weak security measures or just ignore security altogether, rather than design with security as a primary consideration.&quot;')
