Those efforts turned out to be so successful that they hoodwinked many of Mozilla Corporation&#x27;s own employeesâ€”who interpreted the statements to mean that there was no financial incentive, just as it was intended to be interpreted by the general public.  Then those employees began showing up on places like HN and started saying explicitly that there was no money changing hands, even though that&#x27;s not what the PR statements ever said and reality actually differed.')
