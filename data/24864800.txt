Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[24865022], score=None, time=1603412114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864608, text='&gt; You&#x27;re still not getting the point - which is you&#x27;re not the customer Apple is trying to sell to<p>Funny how they keep sending me marketing emails though.<p>This is kind of a weird notion, that Apple doesn&#x27;t want me as a customer, as I&#x27;ve spent more $ on Apple products in my life than the majority of people.<p>&gt; This is your opinion.<p>Does this really need to be said? Of course it is! Why would I state someone else&#x27;s opinion?<p>&gt; Steve Jobs himself never wanted to sell &quot;computers which only nerds could use&quot;.<p>This is a straw man argument. I already mentioned that I preferred Apple under Steve Jobs to Apple under Tim Cook. They&#x27;re not the same. Jobs said, &quot;the computer is the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.&quot; For Tim Cook, though, computers seem more like a bike lock for the mind.<p>&gt; Super customizability that you want was never their product!<p>Again, I&#x27;m comparing Macs today to Macs literally only 10 years ago. Those products existed. It&#x27;s historical revisionism to claim that current Apple is exactly the same as past Apple. It&#x27;s not. Not at all.<p>The strangest thing about the argument &quot;this is the way Apple has always been&quot; is that the linked article of this HN post is talking about a new change that hasn&#x27;t even shipped yet but exists in the Big Sur beta. It&#x27;s a completely novel macOS behavior, not the way the Mac has ever behaved, so it&#x27;s just bizarre to argue in this case &quot;that&#x27;s just the way Apple has always been&quot;. Apple is changing... for the worse IMO.')
