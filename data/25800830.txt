The ball bounces back and forth without ever touching the ground. My movements are productive, and value-adding, just like my partner&#x27;s.<p>Back to producing units of work, only half a story point left (sike! no such thing as half a story point, and no such thing as &quot;left&quot;, as it&#x27;s a measure of effort, not time. Almost got you there!).<p>Git push! Automatic CI gains consciousness and validates that my work unit has no chance of causing a user to break our software. It gives me a thumbs up and discards its human shell to fade back into the ones and zeros. A QA engineer cries out in the distance.<p>A metric of my productivity is logged to the OKR database.<p>Nothing breaks, and nothing unexpected happens, as the universe is completely predictable.')
