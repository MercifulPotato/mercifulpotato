There are entire webs of institutions and mechanisms that make sure people do not defraud each other.<p>Some keywords - look into Letters of Credit, Bills of Lading, Certificates of Origin, INCOTERMS, and the requirements to make these work (such as inspection certificates from independent third-party organisations like SGS or CIQ). Bulk commodities can be sampled, tested and certified as many as 4-8 times in between buyer and seller, on a dozen different criteria.<p>Bulk commodity trading happens in an intrinsically low trust environment - it is frequently arms-length, cross-border, multiparty, for millions of dollars per transaction, and with a crazy number of different risks that have to be mitigated. The incentives to defect and come away millions richer are huge. And much of the system was developed for a time before the Internet.<p>While this is a noble sentiment, the structure and transaction costs are absolutely essential for the whole thing to work.')
