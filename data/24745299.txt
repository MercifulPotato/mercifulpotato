Item(by='mmm_grayons', descendants=None, kids=[24745548], score=None, time=1602418893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745171, text='I&#x27;d argue a fairer metric would probably be to compare gun deaths to car deaths; nearly twice as many people died to cars in 2019 [0] [1].<p>I definitely don&#x27;t think Trump will be &quot;Hitler 2.0&quot;.  He probably won&#x27;t even be in office after this election.<p>Again, however, my primary argument is normative and values-based.  I&#x27;m not arguing that we only have gun rights because they don&#x27;t kill x number of people.  Even if a hundred thousand people were killed by mass shootings I wouldn&#x27;t support gun restrictions.  We don&#x27;t restrict people&#x27;s liberties because others break the law.  The thing most gun grabbers miss and that most gun rights proponents won&#x27;t say is that our primary value is liberty not saving more lives.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thetrace.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;gun-deaths-2019-increase&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thetrace.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;gun-deaths-2019-increase&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsc.org&#x2F;road-safety&#x2F;safety-topics&#x2F;fatality-estimates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsc.org&#x2F;road-safety&#x2F;safety-topics&#x2F;fatality-estim...</a>')
