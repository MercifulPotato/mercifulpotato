Who does that leave?  Well there&#x27;s no white collar industry to speak of so it leaves the trademen who fix the plumbing in the Kennedy compound, the service industry and a few business owners.  So the county winds up looking dirt poor on paper despite the fact that there&#x27;s a ton of money sloshing around (and it shows when you look at how the tradesmen and small business owners live).<p>This is an extreme example but you can see how more minor differences when applied across an entire county or state could pollute a comparison when you&#x27;re trying to  compare very precise things, like how well off a median plumber in Reno is vs the median plumber in Chicago.')
