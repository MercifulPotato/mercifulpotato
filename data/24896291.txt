Item(by='dsaavy', descendants=None, kids=[24898348], score=None, time=1603721274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892419, text='I think you&#x27;re misreading my statement, it&#x27;s a 10% swing in the direction of Trump, not a 10% overall preference for Trump. From 82% favoring Hillary to 71% favoring Biden for black voters. That&#x27;s a 10% change towards Trump&#x27;s direction. If 16 million black voters participated in 2016 then that&#x27;s around 13.1 million votes for Hillary and 2.9 million for Trump. If polling is correct this year and we see around similar turnout (not even an increase), then it&#x27;ll be around 11.3 million votes for Biden and 4.7 million for Trump. So a 1.8 million vote swing in the black vote.<p>That&#x27;s just a really rough calculation and doesn&#x27;t account for the Hispanic vote either in that article.')
