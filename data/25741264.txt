In this sense it differs dramatically from most of the important issues before us as a society. But it&#x27;s precisely because of this that it gets raised as one end of a spectrum:\nwhat does&#x2F;should journalism do when there&#x27;s a clear demonstrable truth but &quot;some people&quot; dispute it?<p>That doesn&#x27;t provide a guide for how to handle cases where the truth is not clear, where there is obviously legitimate grounds for disagreement.<p>But it&#x27;s supposed to mark one of the spectrum. Many people would say that journalism has failed badly at the end of the spectrum, by taking things that are clearly true (&quot;it&#x27;s raining&quot;) and behaving as if the skeptics deserve to be heard.<p>Obviously, the skeptics feel otherwise, but is that relevant and if so, how much attention should we pay it?')
