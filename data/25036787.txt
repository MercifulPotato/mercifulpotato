There&#x27;s a lot of projects here that must have taken a <i>lot</i> of work - and look really good - but the MRR is just dismal. There&#x27;s one there that&#x27;s pretty close to a side project of mine - not even a grand. Somewhat offputting.<p>Does this mean that many of these projects could stand to put a <i>lot</i> more effort into sales? Would that make a reliable difference? Or is it really just this hard? Or a bit of both?<p>I feel like for some of these, giving the best salesperson you know a huge commission, just getting the ball rolling, could make quite a big difference.')
