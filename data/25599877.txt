If there is a general tax agreement between your country and the EU, no VAT becomes due at the country of origin (of goods and&#x2F;or services), but you are supposed to declare the purchase locally and pay local VAT, if applicable. There&#x27;s also usually a marginal sum, below wich goods and services are free of charge (the sum of it, which includes any postage), about EUR 20.<p>(Mind that this mechanism requires tax or VAT IDs on both sides of the transactions, which are to be declared.)')
