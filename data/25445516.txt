Furthermore, I remember reading that this attack is to some extent not solvable. I need to find a link.

It&#x27;s been 5 years since Lightning was first suggested and it&#x27;s still only at Alpha stage.<p>And if the scalability problems are never overcome, will Bitcoin still maintain whatever value it has now?')
