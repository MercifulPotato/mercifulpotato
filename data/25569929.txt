The most significant barriers to V6 adoption are, in this order:<p>1. It’s an entirely new network. IPv4 only hosts are not reachable on the IPv6 net. It replaces rather than extends IP, and I can’t figure out why they did that.<p>2. The addresses are too long to remember and easily type, and the encoding with its shortening rules is non-canonical and annoying to visually parse.<p>Extending V4 to 64 bits on top of the V4 space would have been a much better idea for multiple reasons. Every V4 becomes a &#x2F;32 in a full &#x2F;64. Using something like base32 addresses could have been kept to just barely type-able length.<p>People always push back on #2 with “use DNS.” I always wonder if these people have ever done IT or devops. You constantly type IPs in the real world and long V6 addresses are a huge annoyance.')
