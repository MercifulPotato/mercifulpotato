It&#x27;s always possible to do &quot;better&quot; by tuning something toward the data set. Finding something that is <i>always</i> better is hard.<p>One thing I have done is a double binary search.<p>Store prefixes and suffixes seperately.  A binary search of the prefixes identifies the suffix clump to search with a binary search.  This involves a slight increase in storage --- each prefix needs a suffix pointer.<p>But maybe I will now do an interpolation search on the suffixes.')
