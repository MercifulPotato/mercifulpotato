Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25947345], score=None, time=1611856942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945738, text='&gt; The art of dictatorship is strange, and requires much better understanding than just &quot;evil takes over private ownership&quot;.<p>Also, dictators have no need to own <i>anything</i> (at least domestically).  They already have the power, so what do they gain by &quot;owning&quot; something they already control?  IMHO, private property&#x2F;ownership is really only a useful concept when you have to allocate control among legally-equal(ish) peers.<p>I think a lot of people really only understand their own place in their own society, and a lot of time they end up just projecting that onto some other situation when it doesn&#x27;t really apply.')
