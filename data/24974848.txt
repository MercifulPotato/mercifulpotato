Item(by='jodrellblank', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604361080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972686, text='You have an objection to the content, instead of an ad-hom attack on me?<p>&quot;<i>Having a flatscreen TV is a very high priority for poor people in the US</i>&quot;.<p>1) TV is comparatively cheap entertainment.<p>2) Flatscreens are the only kind of TV produced in years.<p>3) Is that objectively &quot;a very high priority&quot; for &quot;poor people&quot;? Citation needed.<p>4) Being poor sucks, and things which make life more pleasant would be a completely understandable high priority.<p>5) Obtaining things which make life better is a very high priority in <i>all</i> stratas of American life.<p>And yet the comment &quot;&quot;<i>Having a flatscreen TV is a very high priority for poor people in the US</i>&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound filled with empathy, understanding, approval, celebration that even poor people can afford material goods in America, does it?<p>Instead, somehow, it sounds judgemental, critical, accusatory. In the middle of a thread about a Raspberry Pi which was designed and made to be cheap so that poor kids have a chance of computing access, with the context &quot;even poor people have TVs&quot; who would throw in that comment and why?<p>From an opinion piece[1]: &quot;<i>The language of GOP racial politics is heavy on euphemisms that allow the speaker to deny any responsibility for the racial content of his message. [...] Regardless of how they were intended, poor people and minorities sense that with those comments Gingrich is winking — some call it “dog whistling” — at certain white audiences by intimating that black people are lazy, happy to live off the government and lacking any intellect.</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s obviously what happened here. The comment &quot;<i>Having a flatscreen TV is a very high priority for poor people in the US</i>&quot; does not say &quot;poor people value education and it&#x27;s a good thing even poor people have access to a TV where they could plug in a Raspberry Pi&quot;, it says &quot;of course poor people will have a TV, they&#x27;re lazy and watch TV all day and feel entitled to the luxury of a flatscreen, right guys?&quot; <i>wink wink</i>, allowing the poster to deny any responsibility because &quot;many poor people own televisions&quot;.<p>The Center for American Progress paper &quot;Moving away from Racial Stereotypes&quot;[2] says &quot;<i>The notion that poor people, particularly poor people of color, are lazy is the most significant and persistent stereotype affecting efforts to address poverty in our country.</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>It’s notable that labels suggesting laziness or lack of effort that have been used to describe African Americans are also applied to poor people more generally.</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Getting tough on poor people is a way to try to win votes during elections, derail legislation, or distract attention from positions that would otherwise be unpopular. Given modern-day sensibilities, however, very few single out groups directly—instead of using words like “black” or “Hispanic,” they raise stereotypes and employ code words that let audiences know exactly which groups they are actually\ntalking about without actually saying so</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Over the years, progressives have contributed to the continued association of African Americans and Hispanics with poverty</i>&quot;<p>That is, there&#x27;s a certain demographic characterised roughly by older, white, 1950s, Republican, Fox-News watching, to whom &quot;poor&quot; means &quot;black&quot; and &quot;TV&quot; means &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;flatscreen&quot; means &quot;entitled luxury&quot; and &quot;high priority TV&quot; means &quot;irresponsible&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;, and the whole sentence is completely innocently deniable because everyone has a TV so it&#x27;s just plain fact and completely innocent.<p>The only hint is that if it were a completely innocent observation, there would be no need to say it at all, no need to single out the poor, no need to mention &quot;high priority&quot;, no need to mention &quot;flatscreen&quot;. You&#x27;d just say &quot;people who can afford a Raspberry Pi 400 probably have a TV, which is nice&quot;. And that was already said one comment before in the chain.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;columnists&#x2F;juan-williams&#x2F;207295-2012-racial-code-words-obscure-real-issue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;columnists&#x2F;juan-williams&#x2F;207295-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;race_stereotypes.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2...</a>')
