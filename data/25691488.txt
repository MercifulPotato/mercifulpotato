Intel think of themselves as a manufacturing company whose designs drive demand for their fab. But in truth, most of their value comes from x86 which could be produced by any fab. To stay competitive, their high end designs need to be on the absolute bleedge edge process. Which up until now has been Intel fabs.<p>But it&#x27;s not giving up on Intel fabs to get their stuff produced by TSMC. They need to do both - they need to make money by producing the best designs in the market no matter what the process in the high end space, as wl as sinking investment into their fabrication side to make sure that in 5 years time they&#x27;re the leading fab. At which point they can turn around and say F-U to all those TSMC customers, produce only Intel chips and use that to capture market share.')
