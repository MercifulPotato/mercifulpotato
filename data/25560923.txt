And in SF, they rely on payroll taxes from high income earners.<p>And in SF, the &quot;dig once&quot; policy means that anytime something substantial is done, nearly everything is redone, which is why Van Ness has been under construction for sooooo long: utilities.<p>The property wealth in SF appreciates at absolutely massive rates, but they rely on poorer new entrants to fund everything.
