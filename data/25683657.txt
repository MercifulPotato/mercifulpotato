The 7 bit is mostly Latin, and uppercase Greek (using latin characters when identical). There are also some 7 bit shift-tables for some languages, including some Arabic for Urdu (would this cover other Arabic using languages?), but I&#x27;m not sure if anything use these tables instead of just going for Unicode as soon as it leaves the basic set.<p>I guess there might be input issues as well, do cheap feature phones have an Arabic input mode?<p>[1] Yes, UCS2 accord to the specs. I suspect modern systems ignore this bit of the standard and use UTF16.')
