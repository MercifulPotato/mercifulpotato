It&#x27;s an equal time investment between myself and the company, working on something pertinent to what I would be doing, in a realistic environment.<p>Contrast to whiteboard interviews where I&#x27;ve been assessed on how to calculate the number of moves of a knight on a chessboard given position X to position Y on a whiteboard in front of three people as a front-end developer.
