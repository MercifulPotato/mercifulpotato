Yes, other people can see you, and yes, you have limited expectations of privacy. No, it&#x27;s not problematic that you have police keeping an eye on things. If you have a problem with that, and you never go outside without your &quot;disguise&quot; aka VPN, you are operating outside of social norms (and it&#x27;s probably not helping anyway).<p>This is not a valid judgement on any way.
