As an American I&#x27;ve tried to figure out how to break into the African startup scene (mostly West Africa) but I&#x27;d feel bad about taking a job there that could be done by a local. However, if there were opportunities to volunteer as an advisor or just to help out a bit that could let me get more involved, I&#x27;d be quite keen to learn about those sorts of opportunities.<p>Also curious why someone would choose your platform over angellist (other than their UI just being shitty)?')
