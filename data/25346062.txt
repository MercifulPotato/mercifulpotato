Within weeks of the genetic sequence of the virus being sequenced, several existing techniques (inactivated whole virion, mRNA, adenovirus vector, to name a few) were rapidly applied to develop vaccine candidates. These techniques range from extremely old-fashioned (inactivated whole virion) to brand new (mRNA).<p>The thing that was sped up was the entire clinical trial schedule (not the &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; part). Clinical trials are costly, so private companies would normally proceed cautiously. They would take longer on the pre-clinical trials (e.g., animal trials), and take longer to evaluate the results before beginning Phase-I trials. They would wait for Phase-I trials to finish before deciding whether to proceed to Phase-II trials. They would again wait before proceeding to Phase-III trials. But this time, various governments were providing guarantees and financial backstops, so companies could begin Phase-II and Phase-III trials before Phase-I trials were complete.<p>Just to illustrate this, Moderna&#x27;s Phase-I trial is still not complete, and will not be finished until November 2021.[1] Yet Moderna began its Phase-III trial in July 2020,[2] as soon as it had enough safety data from Phase-I and II trials to do so.<p>Long story short, the main speed-up came from removing all financial considerations from development, not from Sci-Fi advances in vaccine development (though Moderna and Biontech&#x27;s vaccines are using new techniques).<p>In some sense, we were lucky that SARS-CoV-2 is not particularly difficult to develop vaccines against. A wide range of techniques now appear to have decent results. Influenza is a much more difficult virus to develop vaccines against, because of some of its special properties (reassortment of the 8 sections of its genome, much faster mutation rate).<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04283461" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04283461</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04470427" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04470427</a>')
