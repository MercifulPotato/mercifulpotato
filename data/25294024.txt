It&#x27;s already <i>not done</i> for suspension bridges[0], I don&#x27;t think it could be done here.<p>And the risk would obviously have been gigantic as two cables had already snapped in the same place, so the remaining cables would be under insane and completely out of spec tensions, meaning they could fail at any point during the tentative transfer work.<p>[0] you either splay open the main cables and replace strands, or you need to jack the entire bridge from below to take down and replace the main cables at once')
