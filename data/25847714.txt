You always wanted to be independent. Your cooperate job sucked. So you started your amazing side project. It took off.<p>What was previously fun requires now serious decisions. Your life. Should you resign from you boring job, although it makes now somehow a bit fun. Should you hire people. Should you change anything at all.<p>But maybe the most urgent decision would be:\n1) Staying where you are. Paying 45% Tax rate. With rather bad regulatory conditions\n2) Moving to a business friendly and tax friendly country like Switzerland. Paying 10% Tax.<p>What would you do?<p>PS: Some of my own thoughts. I never would go away to Swiss for a raise from 100k -&gt; 200k. But it is somehow more difficult when we are talking about millions. Especially when I have the feeling that my government doesn&#x27;t spend the taxes well.\nNot sure yet what I would do with one million more, but guess something like starting a new company or helping parents and so on. To be honest kind ofparalyzed regarding this since there seem to be no rational solution. Moving to a new Country could really suck. Especially since friends and family would be somewhere else. On the other hand. Just doing it for  a year would result in multiple millions of net worth. It could also be a nice experience - but not sure about it. So really struggling.')
