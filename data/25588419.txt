It was on servers and mobile, which now have more users than desktops or laptops (edit: servers via the web).<p>Technology gets its warts fixed when it grows along an explosive new market, especially if the market ends up being larger than the last.<p>Python is currently riding the data science wave, and that wave is growing.
