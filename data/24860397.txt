Maybe it&#x27;c suz I&#x27;m tall, maybe cuz I have tight hamstrings and fragile lower-back. I donno. I&#x27;m really itching to get an hybrid&#x2F;electric SUV, but for hybrid it&#x27;s hard to swallow spending 10k more for like &lt;10mpg more. The only exception being the new rav4 which would be like 20mpg more AFAICT.<p>I recently started paying my utility company extra for green energy enough to offset my entire carbon footprint, including car and it&#x27;s like $15 a month, so that&#x27;s a lot of years of ICE before $10k delta difference is overcome...<p>I never really thought of it until I did this but converting cars seems like a pretty inefficient (per dollar) way of reducing carbon.')
