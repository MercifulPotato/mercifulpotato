Corporations have rights, because the owners have rights.<p>This is simply not true. All of the rights that corporations have stem from a public-interest grant by the state. If the rights of corporations came from the owners, we 1) could jail stockholders for the crimes of the corporation, and 2) wouldn&#x27;t need corporations, because all they are is liability shields.<p>Corporations aren&#x27;t actual people, they&#x27;re statutory people. Little branches of the government.')
