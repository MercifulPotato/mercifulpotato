Drivers are expected to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel at all times.<p>If tesla rolls out a product where you have to pay close attention and be ready to take over and calls it full self driving, that seems like a massive case of fraud. I&#x27;d be pissed if I&#x27;d bought the FSD package.')
