It&#x27;s like speaking with a 400ms or so echo of yourself being played back. Hugely distracting.<p>When writing longer things on either, I find myself firing up vim to copy paste afterwards, just because it&#x27;s impossible to get into any kind of flow in these apps.<p>VS code also falls into this category by the way, albeit less severe.<p>For notion specifically, the total lack of keyboard navigation within a page (PgUp&#x2F;PgDown, Space, Shift+Space, nothing works!) as well as the fact that <i>wherever</i> I click I will make immediate changes to the document (even if I just want to deselect some text or so) just makes the editing hugely frustrating, slow, and anxiety-inducing.<p>Seriously, if one day I wake up and write my boss that I&#x27;m outta here, notion and slack (and asana...) are way up there on the list of reasons.')
