When you handle payments or trading systems, having 1% of transaction disappearing doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>It&#x27;s the environment around critical systems. When shit hits the fan, it&#x27;s really bad and there&#x27;s a feedback loop to developers&#x2F;managers&#x2F;companies.<p>Software is ironed out over time. Bugs are removed and things are very stable in finance.<p>Software that really doesn&#x27;t work (and can&#x27;t be fixed) might be killed or never see the light of day.
