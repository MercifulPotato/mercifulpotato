It doesn&#x27;t mean that you should rely only on their interpretation, but it does mean that you can do things like trust the numbers they give.<p>This way, you don&#x27;t get reports that, &quot;x helps you be healthier!&quot; when the study is really just showing that x culture has better marks on something OR a mouse study was showing promise, without reminding folks that most mouse studies don&#x27;t work for humans (or that some mice are bred to make studies easier). I suppose the more damaging rhetoric would be presenting information that makes immigrants seem like criminals, when really, the crime rate is lower and the examples were isolated incidents.<p>I&#x27;d extend this to places that people expect as much truth as is reasonable - for example, vitamins and supplements. We know that &quot;supports...&quot; or &quot;may reduce...&quot; is taken as fact.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d get your news from more than one source and if one source is almost always different from the others, you&#x27;d no longer use it as fact - but people aren&#x27;t going to go through this process all that often if at all.')
