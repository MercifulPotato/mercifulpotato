Doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t make an educated guess.<p>The OP is only trying to figure out whom to contact first about the IP. The worst that can happen is that a company replies it&#x27;s not with them.<p>A merging&#x2F;acquisition will transfer all IP to the (new) parent company. A contracting company will grant a license to make one game, not reassign all its IP to the game studio.')
