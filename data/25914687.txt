I&#x27;d expect to see also some drops in the walls due to splash out and dew, but the walls of the bottle are too clean.<p>They never say it, but implicitly it looks like a fuel collection tank, it&#x27;s too much. Also, this would produce mostly methane that is not a liquid in usual conditions, and it&#x27;s not clear why it would be collected on the top.<p>And as a comment noted, after three days the leftover in the floor are not cleaned and they are still green. Also, the illumination of the three days is too even.<p>Three days is too few time.')
