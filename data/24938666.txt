The ABC is a government-funded but  independent media organisation, but has been subject to budget cuts and unprecedented pressure from the current Government since it came to power in 2013 under Tony Abbott.<p>Coincidentally or otherwise, the current Australian Government is known to have a cosy relationship with News Corp, who frequently bash the ABC for, ironically, biased reporting.<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emma_Alberici" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emma_Alberici</a><p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-02-14&#x2F;why-many-big-companies-dont-pay-corporate-tax&#x2F;9443840" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-02-14&#x2F;why-many-big-companie...</a><p>[2]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-02-22&#x2F;more-to-jobs-and-growth-than-a-corporate-tax-cut&#x2F;9471856" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-02-22&#x2F;more-to-jobs-and-grow...</a>')
