Proof: For Python or Ruby, there are dozens of books explaining how to write web applications in them. But there&#x27;s not a single good book for Racket (not just for web programming, but for anything).<p>Racket&#x27;s authors use racket for their academic jerk-offs, but don&#x27;t fog our eyes and tell us it&#x27;s a practical language for real programmers, when it isn&#x27;t.')
