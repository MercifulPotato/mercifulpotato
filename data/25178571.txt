I&#x27;m curious about the specifics of the behavior of S3 in this case. Do you have any more detailed information from the AWS support you could share by any chance? If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;d be also grateful if you could drop some answers to the questions below.<p>Do you use S3 replication (CRR&#x2F;SRR)?<p>Before uploading, do you make any request to the object key? If yes, what kind of request?<p>For downloading, do you use pre-signed URLs or is the S3 bucket public?<p>What&#x27;s the error the 0,01% of users encounter? Is it a NoSuchKey error?')
