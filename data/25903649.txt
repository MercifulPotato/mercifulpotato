Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611585905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903259, text='I go through new submissions a few times a week. A couple things that make it undesirable:<p>1. No way to limit to certain topics&#x2F;tags. That means I&#x27;m seeing philosophy, politics, news, etc.<p>2. No way to see a summary without clicking the link and waiting for the page to load. Reasons this is bad: Title length is limited (for good reason) so titles on HN are routinely uninformative. There&#x27;s more likely to be annoying ads&#x2F;paywalls&#x2F;etc. inside these posts. That&#x27;s a lot of overhead to devote to a single potential vote for a probably-not-good post. As a result, I just skip over most links, and that&#x27;s the same as not visiting the New Links page.')
