The exploitation billionaires create isn&#x27;t direct.  The problem is that Billionaires amass this wealth while people beneath them struggle.<p>Jeff Bezos shouldn&#x27;t be making 12-figure gains while his warehouse workers are on welfare.  Those warehouse workers shouldn&#x27;t be paying a higher tax rate than he does on their income.<p>That IS an unquestionably exploitive relationship between a CEO and his employees, even if he isn&#x27;t personally being an exploitive monster he isn&#x27;t doing anything about the systemic exploitation he lead the way in creating.<p>This is pretty much true of any billionaire, regardless of their personality or views.<p>The existence of billionaires is a economic luxury that should only be afforded once society as a whole has taken care of its people.  The co-existence of billionaires and homelessness is an economic failure, especially when some billionaires possess more capital individually than the entire homeless population of this country.')
