This isn&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t be about trying to get one over on the other side, the UK and the EU are not in a zero sum game, clearly levels of trade integration require harmonization of regulation, some countries are going to be happy with that in particular areas, some aren&#x27;t, and to decline to integrate has economic consequences within that local context. And similarly just because the UK doesn&#x27;t want to be part of the EU political union, that&#x27;s not some calculated insult, it&#x27;s just something we aren&#x27;t happy to do. Not every partner of the EU needs to be part of the EU.')
