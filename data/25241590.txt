I would come home from school, have something to eat and then get back to programming one of my dozens of game ideas that usually went nowhere near being completed.<p>I remember how I spent one Christmas plotting a Christmas Tree scene with the gifts and everything on millimeter paper and then transferring and animating all that to QB in SCREEN 11 (640x480) graphics mode.
