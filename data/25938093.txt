Most certainly so.<p>However I think you&#x27;re overestimating the &#x27;math IQ&#x27; of STEM (under)grads especially considering the large discrepancy among its different subfields. Engineering students (EE&#x2F;ME&#x2F;Civil) are systematically &#x27;dumber&#x27; maths-wise compared to their science (Maths [duh] or Physics) counterparts. Still, it&#x27;s quite likely that you do not have to be a genius to be successful at landing a highly-paid, mentally-challenging related job.<p>About parenting, smart math kids may not have had their egos boosted however their parents almost certainly exposed them to science from an early age. This holds true especially for  children coming from &#x27;STEM families&#x27;.')
