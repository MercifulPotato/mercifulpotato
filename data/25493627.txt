(i.e. with FDM printing it&#x27;s pretty trivial to use 2..N print heads to get an increase of 2..N in part production)<p>Also, this happens with virtually every new technology.  See AI, blockchain etc.  In every company that a given technology potentially impacts&#x2F;applies to, at some point there is an Executive asking &#x27;what is our strategy for X?&#x27; which results in one or more projects related to X being spun up.  Eventually most of these efforts will fizzle&#x2F;fade but there will be a subset of use cases where there will be a (possibly surprising) benefit that offsets the slow speed &#x2F; limited resolution &#x2F; whatever that makes 3D printing worth using in real production environments.  There are also some instances where 3D printing (whether FDM, SLA, SLS etc) can produce a <i>better</i> result than existing alternatives like injection molding.  It&#x27;s just another tool in the toolbox.')
