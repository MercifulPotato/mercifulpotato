It&#x27;s so easy to check.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-editors-showing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-edito...</a><p>&quot;It would be unfortunate and detrimental to The Intercept for this story to be published elsewhere.&quot; --Betsy Reed<p>So that is stating very clearly: No we won&#x27;t publish it. No you can&#x27;t publish it elsewhere.<p>Now the rest is kind of separate but relevant.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth now that the election is done, nobody actually disputes the content of those emails and that they are genuine. Do they? I&#x27;ve missed that if so. I don&#x27;t think the Bidens ever suggested they were forged, which would have killed the story pretty quick. But that is an &#x2F;entirely&#x2F; separate discussion. Hatchet job? Well that&#x27;s an opinion and I don&#x27;t think so at all. I think Hunter Biden&#x27;s conduct was always going to be an issue for Joe and that it will be again. There&#x27;s not a lot of doubt in &#x2F;my&#x2F; mind that Hunter Biden has been paid large sums for something that isn&#x27;t the honest, fair value work he has done. Maybe he took the money that was paid for the sake of that appearance and that&#x27;s all he did? If his last name was Johnson and his father was a moderately successful professional he&#x27;s not getting those jobs and that money. It STINKS. And you can hate trump and still have that stench penetrate your preference for &quot;not Trump.&quot;<p>Make of the story Greenwald wrote what you will. There&#x27;s been plenty of opportunity to falsify it and discredit it. Maybe that&#x27;s still coming? I want to see it if so. It&#x27;s certainly something we should know about if so. Something is not right there.<p>The idea that it should not be published is, well, not something I&#x27;d agree with any more than I&#x27;d agree that the NYT should not have published Trump&#x27;s tax returns.<p>In my view Glenn has integrity. That means something. I don&#x27;t doubt he would have written a similar story if the facts related to any powerful politician. Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, anyone. Do you?')
