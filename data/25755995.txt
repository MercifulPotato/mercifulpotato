The same peers connected to the address will transparently receive the update and seed that as well.<p>And yes, it&#x27;s totally separate from IPFS, but is built from many of the same ideas. Dat started back in like, 2011 or so? This is a good high-level overview of how protocol works: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercore-protocol.org&#x2F;protocol&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercore-protocol.org&#x2F;protocol&#x2F;</a> - the fundamental unit of storage is hypercore, the append-only log. IPFS&#x27;s structure, the raw merkle tree, requires another layer on top to provide mutability, like IPNS or DNSLink, but I do not believe that these provide the same guarantees of &quot;auto-propagate updates without loss of older version.&quot;<p>Hyper*&#x2F;Beaker also provides mechanisms to use centralized authority like DNS to provide human-readable resources, that simply point from the DNS entry to the hyper URL.')
