Intermediaries handling currency transactions are subject to &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; laws, and need to get various identifying information from the parties whose currency they&#x27;re transmitting. Lightning network nodes don&#x27;t collect such information. Therefore, the Lightning network node operators are in violation of US law.<p>I&#x27;m no expert though, there may be other SEC rules that are more relevant.')
