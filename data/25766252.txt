It maps way too nicely to human concepts. This is what every amateur putting together an &quot;alien challenge&quot; without attempting to be scientific about it ends up doing, and it&#x27;s easy to tell. That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re doing it for fun, but it&#x27;s obviously not real.<p>And that is confirmed:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;space&#x2F;a19257&#x2F;nsa-key-to-extraterrestrial-messages&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;space&#x2F;a19257&#x2F;nsa-key-to-ext...</a><p>I&#x27;ve been here solved that. ACM tried to run an challenge about an &quot;alien computer&quot; that was obviously not alien, but ended up being very real. I was part of the team that reverse engineered it first, but the whole contest collapsed and all interest waned after we ended up finding the very-much-not-alien chip involved by accident. We did cover the initial process, but unfortunately never got around to writing the follow-up posts.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fail0verflow.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;unprogramming-intro&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fail0verflow.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;unprogramming-intro&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160304030848&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;queue.acm.org&#x2F;unprogramming.cfm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160304030848&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;queue.acm....</a>')
