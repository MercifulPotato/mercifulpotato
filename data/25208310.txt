The idea behind using Tau is that it makes equations more easily relatable to Circles and highlights rotation where the concept exists. One of the cases for these emojis is to more easily highlight function of variables and to highlight the equation. Both of these are also along the same lines as coloured equations [1].<p>Something I strongly disagree with in both the Tau manifesto and this Emoji manifesto, is the notion that Tau and Emoji should be encorporated into the official literature. Pi is &#x27;wrong&#x27; - always use Tau. Einstein&#x27;s papers would be easier to understand if you used the fire emoji instead of E.<p>Of course not. But in the other hand, the responses to these arguments attack that aspect of the claim rather than the intent behind them. &quot;You can&#x27;t use Tau because all textbooks use Pi. You would need to reprint all textbooks in the world&quot;. &quot;You can&#x27;t use emoji because the support is bad, you can&#x27;t draw them and you can&#x27;t pronounce them.&quot;<p>What we&#x27;re missing, and where all of these belong, is in a formal explanation format. Most attempts to break down and make concepts more palatable tend to be blogs, YouTube or even broadcast media. We don&#x27;t see anything in between &#x27;formal paper or textbook&#x27; and &#x27;colourful diagram aimed at beginners&#x27;. Where are the colourful diagrams for your latest paper on Flat Chains in Banach spaces?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tauday.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tauday.com</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterexplained.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;colorized-math-equations&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterexplained.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;colorized-math-equation...</a>')
