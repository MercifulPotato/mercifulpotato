Deplatforming a sitting president on his way out of office is minor compared to the precedent that is being established on this day. I&#x27;m convinced that the people who are pushing for Donald Trump to be deplatformed are doing so not only because they detest the man, but because they want to prevent his presidency from ever happening again. Deplatforming will become a legitimate tool to stop populist Republican politicians.')
