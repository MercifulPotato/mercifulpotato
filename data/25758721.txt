That&#x27;s just asinine. By choosing not to business with Parler they&#x27;re exercising their freedom of assembly. They can&#x27;t be compelled to do business with Parler. This has nothing at all to do with editorial anything. AWS is just infrastructure you pay to use and have to agree to their terms of service.<p>No part of AWS or Twilio fall under common carrier regulations. They can choose with whom they do business. They would and <i>do</i> cancel service for clients doing illegal things or against their TOS.<p>Amazon doesn&#x27;t owe Parler a viable business. Parler made themselves into a toxic environment that drove third parties to abandon them.')
