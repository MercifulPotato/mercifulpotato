But it still won&#x27;t wake up from sleeping sometimes, maybe once a month.<p>Had a Dell XPS before that, it was way worse on the same issue. With MacBooks, I didn&#x27;t have that issue as much with personal machines, but I mostly used them for travel. I&#x27;ve had pretty bad issues with work MacBooks.<p>Love my System 76, but there&#x27;s still work to be done there.')
