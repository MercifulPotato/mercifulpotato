Git needs the &quot;rebase&quot; command to stitch independent histories together; Darcs doesn&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s the part I don&#x27;t get from your argument. Git has rebase. It works. So where exactly do you see the value added by Darcs? I mean, it&#x27;s not as if users can only merge or rebase if they use Darcs, right?<p>&gt; As for workflows that &quot;require any of those properties&quot;: There&#x27;s wide agreement that Git is overly complex (...)<p>No, there isn&#x27;t. In fact, that statement is patently false. git is the simplest and most straight-forward version control system I ever used. Things just work out of the box, they work well, and they work exceptionally fast. Branching is free, merging is free, tagging is free, it&#x27;s trivial to checkout, it&#x27;s trivial to setup a shared remote repository, and it&#x27;s even trivial to setup a remote repo on a USB pen. You don&#x27;t need to install servers to get it to work locally or remotely, you don&#x27;t need to bother with extensions to get basic functionality working, and you don&#x27;t need to use absurd ad-hoc patterns to get basic features such as branching.<p>So is there actually any objective point that can be made in favour of Darcs? I mean, being fast and usable surely is not it. So, what real-world value does Darcs offer?')
