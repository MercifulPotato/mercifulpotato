Labor is not the sole cause of profit. Imagine a company that spent billions to automate every process requiring only a single human to push a button every 10 minutes to produce its output. This company would be making &quot;billions per employee&quot;, but it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to pay that employee billions for that job.')
