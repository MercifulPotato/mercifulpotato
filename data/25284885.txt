Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=[25289309], score=None, time=1606965074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282311, text='&gt; The science of nutrition is still in its infancy, with very basic questions still unanswered, and we&#x27;re very, very far from having catalogued all the nutrients in meat and vegetables and understanding their effects on our body.<p>Even calling those compounds &quot;nutrients&quot; in the first place is a bit circular. If something hasn&#x27;t had enough of an effect on any of our observations to warrant further investigation, or else if all the evidence points to it being largely inert, then it probably isn&#x27;t much of a nutrient. We&#x27;ve almost certainly missed a thing or two here or there, but pointing to a list of compounds in meat that aren&#x27;t in a nutrition book and assuming those must be nutrients of some kind doesn&#x27;t seem like a productive activity.<p>&gt; I mean, even with macro nutrients, just look at the flip-flopping and debates over the past few decades on saturated fats, trans fats, carbs vs fats, etc. Then when you get to micronutrients, we don&#x27;t even know what we don&#x27;t know.<p>The implication seems to be that macronutrients should be easier to reason about, so if we don&#x27;t know much about them then we can&#x27;t know much about micronutrients. In practice though, macronutrient composition doesn&#x27;t matter much and doesn&#x27;t have strong effects, whereas many micronutrients are easily testable. The flip-flopping hasn&#x27;t been one of a vast scientific consensus, but rather small amounts of scientific research and a vast marketing machine.<p>&gt; You can see the other comment I made on how, for example, we know chicken soup helps fight colds, but don&#x27;t have the slightest idea what compound is responsible. Will lab-grown chicken do the same?<p>That seems like a moving goalpost (or a misunderstanding on my part as to what your position is). Is &quot;a reasonable understanding of nutrition&quot; a large enough body of knowledge to tailor a body composition to one&#x27;s favourite activities and keep it healthy for its normal lifespan barring medical events (aging, cancer, colds, loss of limb), or is it a perfect understanding of every interaction things we can consume might have with our body or any other organisms we&#x27;re hosting?<p>Mildly off-topic: We know that chicken soup probably eases cold <i>symptoms</i>, and so do hot water and hot tea. Even assuming a compound is medicinally responsible in the first place doesn&#x27;t seem like a great starting point.')
