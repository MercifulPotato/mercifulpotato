It&#x27;s a market economy of platforms.<p>&gt;they&#x27;re censoring politically and control what people see, shaping public opinion in large ways.<p>Companies are allowed to choose what they say and project outward.<p>The problem here is a lack of interoperability between platforms, institutional silos.
