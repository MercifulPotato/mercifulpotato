Sure. Compared to Ruby? Maybe in the way that a lockfile isn&#x27;t automatically generated when using pip.<p>Hating on Python&#x27;s dependency management is a meme at this point. You could do a lot worse than the current pip + venv, and upgrading to something like poetry or pipenv is pretty painless. I&#x27;m pretty sure 99% of problems occur because people don&#x27;t pin stuff.')
