Very funny and I got a kick out of it. As a relatively new part time vim user (about a year), I felt portions of this. I still use VSCode for a handful of tasks, but Vim has taken over more and more.<p>This past semester I had to SSH into our CS servers for my OS class, and the way my group would work was usually me sharing my screen and us peer programming. There were multiple occasions my group partners would stop me and ask how dude something like remove a full line, put it in a register, and pasted it at the bottom of the file so fast.<p>ddgp<p>I love the reactions to it, because people get excited and I encourage them to try him themselves.<p>I&#x27;m also very much an amateur when it comes to vim. I love seeing vim masters in action, it&#x27;s so interesting. I think I&#x27;ll forever remain the right eyed character who asks &quot;how did you do that?&quot;, and it&#x27;s that sense of wonder that makes me love vim.')
