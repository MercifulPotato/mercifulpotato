As short as maybe 5 years ago &gt;10MW turbines were thought of as unlikely in the near time, and look where we are now. And we still haven&#x27;t hit any hard limits, meaning there is still room to grow! And as the turbines grow, so do the foundations. Most turbines are installed on a single steel tube that is driven into the ground, a monopile. A single one can be 100m long, 10m in diameter and weigh 2000 tons!')
