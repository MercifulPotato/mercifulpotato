I’ve been doing DSP professionally since the 80’s and have written my share of demods, filters, equalizers, on DSP chips, PCs, main frames, single board computers in half a dozen or more languages. This is one of the finest one-stop descriptions of DSP I have ever seen. This covers nearly everything I studied for my BSEE and MSEE degrees. If anyone is itching to learn DSP, you can’t go wrong here if you really study this material.')
