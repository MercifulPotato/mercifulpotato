If they so decide, all members of that union will, when visiting the page during the time-period of the boycott, see a message explaining the reasons for the boycott instead of the site.<p>(Or the union can decide to display a banner with a message at the bottom of the page, if a full boycott is too strong.)<p>Eventually the idea is to allow for a more integrated discussion about websites _on the website itself_ (i.e., forums with threads for pages&#x2F;sites, accessible from that page via the extension, so that starting or participating in the discussion becomes easy).<p>I think a lot of the difficulties we have in collective organization in the realm of the internet can be ameliorated with a tool of this nature. Think of what it would take to effectively signal something to facebook. How would you find people who might have similar demands as you to organize a boycott? How would they find you? How would you remember about the boycott? How would Facebook know what the &quot;canonical&quot; set of demands are?<p>The work so far is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;izens.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;izens.net&#x2F;</a> (and on github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;izens-net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;izens-net</a>). There&#x27;s still a lot to do, but a basic version of the browser extension already works.<p>(Other people were involved too, and some did in fact more work than me, in case the tone above suggests it&#x27;s entirely me work.)')
