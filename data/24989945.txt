My worry is this will attract an influx of people with addiction problems and a list of unintended consequences that could come with legalizing all drugs. I remember reading&#x2F;hearing(NPR maybe), that when Florida took a harder stance against Doctors prescribing Oxycontin making it more difficult for people to  acquire and abuse, there was an exodus of people to states that had more relaxed laws. These folks basically moved to a different state where they could support their addiction.<p>People don&#x27;t become addicts because it&#x27;s fun, something typically leads them down that road and perhaps the best strategy is to help them with their mental health issues and heavily prosecute the enablers&#x2F;dealers&#x2F;suppliers whether it&#x27;s some guy down the street or a country like China.')
