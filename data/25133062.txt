It would be truly impressive if the M1 at that power level was competitive with desktop processors on multi-threaded workloads where they actually use their full TDP, but it isn&#x27;t even close.<p>&gt; The 16-inch MacBook Pro ($2,799.00) comes with a 2.3GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.8GHz and for an additional $200, you can get it with a 2.4GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor, Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz.<p>Which are old slower Intel CPUs. Intel&#x27;s latest is 10th-generation and even those are slower than Ryzen, much less the older 9th-generation ones. And even those older Intel mobile CPUs defeat the M1 on multi-threaded workloads like Cinebench.<p>Core i9-9880H scores 8311 compared to 7833 for the M1 (native):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpu-monkey.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;cpu-intel_core_i9_9880h-958" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpu-monkey.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;cpu-intel_core_i9_9880h-958</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>')
