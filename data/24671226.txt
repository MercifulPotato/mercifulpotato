E.g. projects aiming at non-&#x2F;not-so-technical users often have problems with it, especially if they at the same time are in areas where regular breakage is to be expected (e.g. software to scrape&#x2F;download from popular websites, 3D printing tools would be my guess for good examples). Some projects with corporate users but no corporate backing can run into the same. But at the same time for other projects it might never happen.')
