But, like with a lot of randomly generated video games, it&#x27;s easy to make them suck. I think something maybe more like A robot named fight&#x27;s approach to procedural generation may be better for music, random generation based on pre-assembled parts, or maybe random generation to create variation for pre written parts.<p>A lot of arpeggiators already do something similar.<p>Though, i do agree with the general premise of that and think any randomly generated parts should be hand touched up by someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing and should be used as any other tool in a musician&#x27;s arsenal and not as a way to just generate songs wholesale.<p>There is a potential for random generation to be used creatively in music, it just shouldn&#x27;t be used as a crutch to cover lack of skill or as the sole means by which a song is created.')
