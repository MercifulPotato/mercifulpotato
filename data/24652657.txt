I never use a GPS to navigate, and I&#x27;ve gotten plenty lost. Six months ago, while aimlessly exploring westward on my motorcycle to get some air at the beginning of quarantine I went down a road I was familiar with a different segment of. I did not realize the road went through some strange twists (with no exit) where I got on it this time, and by the time I was able to get off of it, I was completely disoriented. My attempts to correct got me even more disoriented, to the point where I was relying on the sun so I would at least know the cardinal direction I was heading in. My original thinking that getting my bearings would be trivial caused me to make quick decisions that left me so confused that I couldn&#x27;t even retrace my route back to the road that originally discombobulated me. I didn&#x27;t want to ask for directions because I was afraid of the virus. I ended up pulling into a hardware store&#x27;s parking lot, and <i>calling my  mother who lives in a different state</i> asking her to google map the hardware store by name so she could point me back in the direction of the city where I live. I had managed to get over an hour away from my house, meaning that almost every decision I made was wrong.<p>I can&#x27;t say it wasn&#x27;t a nice ride, though. But my point is that people are not homing pigeons. I&#x27;m very good at navigating generally, but a couple of bad decisions can compound. That&#x27;s how people get lost in the woods. If your commute is complicated, the way you actually end up memorizing it is by screwing it up a bunch of times.')
