If the current price is north of $300, and holding costs on a short for a month aren&#x27;t too bad, there&#x27;s like $200+ of movement there to capture. Pump and dump is going to dump at some point. The market can stay irrational for a long time etc, but I suspect that&#x27;s less true when everyone knows it&#x27;s being irrational.<p>I&#x27;ll just leave everything in my three-fund portfolio though, cause boring is the right fit for me.')
