After moving abroad from Ankara, I can say lack of stray cats&#x2F;dogs on streets was very noticeable.<p>I agree it doesn&#x27;t have much to do with religion, IMO main two reasons are:<p>1) there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any on-going effort to keep number of strays under control by the city.<p>2) many people feed strays as it&#x27;s considered animal friendliness, often there will be at least one person in your neighbourhood who leaves food &amp; water for animals.<p>You might think it&#x27;s nice to see a cat or two in the streets, though it can get a bit crazy when you see 5-6 big and aggressive dogs appear in your street every day because someone feeds them, yet complaining about this would be considered heartless, and it&#x27;s very likely the local government won&#x27;t do anything about it either.<p>So, getting well fed and without any predators in a generally forgiving climate, strays easily get to survive and breed, and since neutering them all would be expensive and requires some level of organization from the state (which doesn&#x27;t seem to happen) their numbers get to ever increase.')
