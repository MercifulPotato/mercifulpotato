There&#x27;s also the context of the parent, that senior jobs are typically available right out of university. I do not know the field the parent is in, though. In my experience of the biomedical field, this isn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;m a postdoc at a good medical school in the US, and most of the postdocs I&#x27;ve interacted with would happily take an industry job if they could manage it - there just aren&#x27;t enough jobs to go around. The prospects for fresh Phds are even more grim.')
