That&#x27;s remarkable, but it&#x27;s the same magnitude as the second on the list, Nissan Leaf, which has 500k shipped.<p>There&#x27;s also more to electric than battery EVs. It was obvious from the start the transition to electric is real but that real scale will start out with hybrid electric for the first decade or two. Any manufacturer serious about scale would want to start in that end because in order to be good, models needs to be designed from the ground up. In comparison, Toyota has shifted 15M Priuses. That&#x27;s scale.')
