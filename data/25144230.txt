But to me the biggest issue is not being able to connect to your kid. I have a 4yo and he loves to play on his tablet, and he even plays some videogames with me. But I try super hard to do other things with him as well, and try hard to enjoy them as much as I can. We play (non-digital) games he wants to play. We build legos. We also started playing some tabletop RPGs that are super simple for kids and he loves them. He asks me at least once a week to play (we actually always play the same scenario and he doesn&#x27;t care, he still has tons of fun).<p>The parent in this article is struggling with too many things at the same time: kid becoming a teenager, tech, and lack of connection with your kid. Having kids and growing them to healthy human beings is super hard. I wouldn&#x27;t blame the daughter&#x27;s behavior to any single thing, it looks more like a combination of multiple issues. Hopefully they both can find a good path moving forward.')
