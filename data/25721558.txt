Item(by='chris11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610321327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720611, text='&gt; The article uses JIRA is a touchstone that seems to equate to no autonomy.<p>Technically I don&#x27;t think JIRA by itself means no autonomy, it&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s used. But JIRA can expose a ton of metrics to upper management. And I think that management influencing how JIRA is used probably indicates lower autonomy.<p>For instance, story points and velocity being tracked by management might be problematic. Is the team tracking everything with story points? Otherwise certain types of work could be hidden, and slow down velocity. Is management using those metrics for team or individual performance reviews?')
