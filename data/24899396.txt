I was on a train, and I didn&#x27;t want to miss my stop if I got distracted (as had happened before). Since I had my headphones on, I tried getting Google assistant to notify me when I arrived at my destination. It could not do it, the devs hadn&#x27;t made a template for this scenario at the time.<p>Nowadays it might work via a location-based reminder, but I can&#x27;t trust that to work within the 15 second window I have to get off the train.')
