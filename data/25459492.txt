Page 5:<p>&gt; Group 2 items are rarely consumed in the absence of group 1 foods. Examples are salt mined or from seawater; sugar and molasses obtained from cane or beet;honey extracted from combs and syrup from maple trees; vegetable oils crushed from olives or seeds; butter and lard obtained from milk and pork; and starches extracted from corn and other plants<p>Group 2 foods are apparently NOT processed. For some reason, I didn&#x27;t make this designation, I just make fun of it on the internet.<p>Group 3 foods are &quot;processed&quot;, and Group 4 foods are &quot;ultraprocessed&quot;. This designation is completely and utterly meaningless in regards to health.<p>----------<p>That&#x27;s why something like LOL Lumpia + Stir Fry dinners is at worst... &quot;Group 2&quot;, unprocessed by this designation (Both Oil and Flour are just Group2 designations, the most processed items in Lumpia). But if you eat a low-fat cereal + yogurt + applesauce, you&#x27;re eating ultraprocessed stuff.<p>I bet you that &quot;Group 4 Ultraprocessed&quot; Low-fat fortified cereal + yogurt + applesauce meals are healthier than &quot;Group 2 Unprocessed&quot; Lumpia + Stir Fry dinners with fresh Lechon + Rice.')
