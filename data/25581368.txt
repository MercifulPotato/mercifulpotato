You get access to a 12-lesson course with tutorials and tactics I’ve used to land three FT remote jobs in my career.<p>The upsell was group coaching. Some people got excited about this. Only a few people paid.<p>I learned that unemployed people are not usually willing to pay for a service (especially if there are no video testimonials).<p>I’m confident that if I persevered this could have become something but I lost interest.
