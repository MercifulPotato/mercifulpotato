It was really difficult to get a straightforward explanation of how to set things up. For example, I had (as mentioned above) dynamic DNS set to update from my home router with port forwarding setup to a home Linux server (Rpi actually).<p>This isn&#x27;t as easy as A &lt;=&gt; B, but it is probably a common enough use-case. It was really hard to figure out what I needed to put in my wg.conf files. But once I got it, it was really solid.<p>Is there something like &quot;WireGuard in anger&quot; or even something like the GitHub introduction to Git for WireGuard? It seems like it would be very helpful.')
