I&#x27;d pay to have those stores stocked. Ideally it would have a 90s-era movie theatre in it, too. But otherwise it would be empty.<p>Why? So that I can live every day like I&#x27;m the last surviving human. Dawn of the Dead, minus the flesh eaters.<p>(Alternative plan: buy up a ghost town. Same plan, otherwise.)')
