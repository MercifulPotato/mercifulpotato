You can&#x27;t just slide your finger around the spacebar, you have to long press on the keyboard and hope you don&#x27;t trigger the alternate character popup instead. Then while you&#x27;re moving the cursor around, half the time it will just start selecting text. Moving the cursor sucks on iOS.')
