The people who are pushing affirmative action are doing it on purpose because of their political ideology.  These people think that if they have more women, LGBTQ, and minorities in the company, those people will support them politically and they will have more power.  There is no way you can train away that.  Second, you can&#x27;t remove employees when their bias is in support of the managers and the company board members.  Managers are selectively choosing interviewers because of their racial bias.  At a previous job managers would have new hire LGBTQ or minority junior employees conduct interviews instead of senior employees who had been at the company for years.  Activist board members set CEO bonus goals that scale with race and gender quotas as well.  Resume doesn&#x27;t matter because they recruit through special minority, women, or LGBTQ invite only recruiting events where SWM&#x27;s are not even allowed in.')
