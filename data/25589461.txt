When you&#x27;re dealing with people who are familiar with your subject, you can&#x27;t fake it until you make it - you&#x27;re 22 and they have a pretty good idea of how little a 22 year old is going to know.<p>The good news is that also means they have reasonable expectations of you - be helpful and thoughtful, and they&#x27;ll appreciate it. Bullshit like you know everything, and they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re a dumbass.')
