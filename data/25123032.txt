The Qing dynasty covers a period of about 300 years. Sometimes they were very strong. Sometimes they were weak. But even that is kind of a shallow view of things.<p>They enforced a law that all Chinese males had to wear the Manchu hairstyle. This was incredibly unpopular, but it stuck.<p>They also banned the binding of women&#x27;s feet. That ban had no effect at all.<p>Where do those two positions belong on a scale of &quot;government strength&quot;? They look objectively similar to me.')
