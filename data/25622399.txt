Something becomes cost prohibitive and we switch from getting it from people to getting it from machines. I used to argue what people called the thought experiment of the Turing Test, that determined whether people could be fooled by a machine - was really not about being fooled at all, but the representation of an Indifference Curve from economics, where what the machine produced was sufficient for the observer to be indifferent to whether they were being served by a person, or a machine, and they switch their choices accordingly.<p>The philosophical woo of Turing tests has been a multi-decade distraction from the clearer economic explanation that would have probably included more people in the discussion of what we should use machines to do, and the ethical responsibilities of the people who operate them.<p>The uncanny valley is just a threshold below the slope of indifference curve. It&#x27;s interesting, but the preciousness of art often prevents us from looking at it as an expression of incentives.')
