Item(by='lukey_q', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611724492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922975, text='I don&#x27;t think there are stupid questions or even poorly worded questions. Even &quot;bad&quot; questions like &quot;It&#x27;s not working, help!&quot; are a learning and a teaching opportunity, which I think is mostly up to how the more senior developer responds and works with the more junior one. It&#x27;s true that &quot;it&#x27;s not working, help&quot; is not all that actionable by itself, but I assume we all had moments like that when we were learning to write code. I certainly did. (and still do sometimes lol).<p>I think the tweet thread&#x27;s thesis is &quot;allow messing up,&quot; which I&#x27;d couple with the senior developer&#x27;s responsibility to be nice and friendly and supportive. Anyone&#x27;s first dev job is going to be a formative experience and if they ask &quot;stupid&quot; questions and are met with kindness it&#x27;s going to echo through their entire career, the same way being met with rudeness would also have a lasting effect. I don&#x27;t really have any hard or fast rules about how juniors should ask questions, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re really necessary as long as you make them feel supported and comfortable in a general sense.')
