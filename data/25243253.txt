While this is more of the journey to get to the point where you can retire, it would probably make sense to follow some of the advice above from a longer-term perspective, as you are aware you cannot retire off of the amount you currently have. The key to stretching it is reducing your living expenses obviously, and after taking a break finding some form of income to supplement what you already have.  Moving somewhere cheaper tends to be top of the list, and could go well hand-in-hand with the taking a break bit.')
