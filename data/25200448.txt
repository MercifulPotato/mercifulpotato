Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606237868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198268, text='&gt; Comcast says customers will be notified as they approach their monthly data limit, but the ISP currently doesn’t give its customers a way to independently verify meter readings.<p>You can check your usage on their website or in their &quot;My Account&quot; mobile app. The app is particularly easy...open app, hit &quot;internet&quot;, and scroll down a little.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s not &quot;independently verified&quot;, and I&#x27;ve seen occasional complaints that it is wrong, but:<p>• Those complaints are always that the Comcast number is too high, not too low, and since it is the Comcast number that will be used to determine if you&#x27;ve gone over, that&#x27;s the one you want to use.<p>• In most cases I&#x27;ve seen, the Comcast numbers turned out to be more accurate. The person claiming they were too high did something like fail to account for upload traffic, or their monitoring didn&#x27;t include IPv6 traffic, or only covered wired traffic.<p>You might think IPv6 would not be significant, but Disney+ definitely can stream IPv6 and Amazon Fire TV devices will use it when available. I watched several 4K UHD movies that way and according to the traffic stats on my TP-Link Archer A7 router the traffic to the Fire TV Stick was under a gig total. Next movie I used tcpdump while watching to verify that the stream was indeed IPv6, and reported not counting IPv6 as a bug to TP-Link. I&#x27;m pretty sure I also saw some of the apps on my Samsung TV using IPv6 streaming.')
