I agree, $10&#x2F;mo would be too much, but the ability to do more advanced scripting intrigued me enough to give it a try.<p>My only issue is that most services do not have enough triggers or abilities to prove useful for the workflows I currently want. For instance, I would like to append to a Dropbox Paper document when I star a github repo, possibly filtered by some logic. Guess what? Even though both APIs would allow this, IFTTT has neither the trigger nor the action I need. This is just one example, but I frequently run across this problem, which is a major inhibitor to me using it more. I don&#x27;t have a ton of &quot;smart home&quot; devices which is where IFTTT shines the most IMO.<p>I&#x27;m staying on for now to see if I get enough value at $2&#x2F;mo with the triggers and actions currently available. If I&#x27;m not getting much out of it a year from now I&#x27;ll probably switch fully over to a more programmable solution.')
