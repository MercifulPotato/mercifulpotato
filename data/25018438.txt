It&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t like the approach of allowing arbitrary queries from clients you cannot control. If this use case has a lot of demand I don&#x27;t think I wouldn&#x27;t support it. I&#x27;d just rather implement a seamless developer experience for code generation so you don&#x27;t really want to not use it and lose the benefits.')
