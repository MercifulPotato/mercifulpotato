Not having it in there leaves it in a gray enough area that I would be hesitant to rely on it for something where the licensing was important. Very possible the metadata being there and indicating the unique(?) license identifier of “MIT” would be enough to convince a court in the event of Problems, but I also am not a lawyer and like my usage rights to be unambiguous.')
