I get that execution is important, but can we also agree that the idea is important too? I get that good ideas are easier to come by than good execution, but I kind of feel like completely discounting the idea also missed the point.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I have a hard time coming up with a super successful company based on a bad idea.<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not discounting execution at all, it&#x27;s obviously incredibly important. All I&#x27;m saying is that it bugs me when people always discount ideas as unimportant.')
