It&#x27;s a way of thinking. A very formal and precise way of thinking, which is what you need to have to be able to make a computer do what you want, and not do the things you don&#x27;t want it to do.<p>To build complex things with &quot;no code&quot; tools, you need to adopt the coding mindset anyway. You end up discovering concepts like modularization, abstraction, you end up internalizing what the &quot;no code&quot; building blocks actually do, vs. what they advertise to be doing. But by then, what you&#x27;re doing is just writing code in an extremely inefficient, unergonomic and probably visual way, and you&#x27;d be better off having learned a programming language.')
