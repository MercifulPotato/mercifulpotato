Where my usage pattern is pretty much a single dump for everything and just quickly scrolling through the 100-200 updates&#x2F;day, scanning some, reading others, postponing some by opening them in browser tabs (I still habitually check &quot;loadDivertedInBackground&quot; in Firefox&#x27; config, even years after google reader ceasing to exist). I don&#x27;t even categorize the feeds.<p>But for a comprehensive, all sources in one app, I&#x27;d want even more than categorization. I&#x27;d want different reading modes (concatenate tweets, leave other articles alone), maybe an expose-like overview to quickly filter, some intelligent ranking etc.<p>rsshub seems interesting though. Can it do hackernews user&#x27;s posts?')
