Her topics are newsworthy because she is covering them, and adjacent un-covered topics happen to become not-newsworthy because she is ignoring them.<p>Who&#x27;s logic is circular here? ..or do you mean that reality follows a circular logic?<p>I totally agree that <i>some</i> news is &quot;media generated&quot; and newsworthiness becomes circular. Celebrity news, a lot of political news, some hard news cause celebre. Plenty of room for gray area and disagreement about which news issue qualifies as &quot;media generated.&quot;<p>OTOH, reality still exists. Not everything is media generated. The moon landing was objectively newsworthy at the highest level. A national election is objectively newsworthy. So is the rise of ISIS, the successful recruitment of so many volunteers from so many places. Practices within their territory. The scale, impact, etc of the &quot;caliphate&quot; story make it totally newsworthy. More than any other terrorism&#x2F;radicalism&#x2F;insurgency&#x2F;cult story of the decade by a long mile.<p>That&#x27;s the topic of Caliphate. &quot;Abu Huzafya&quot; is not the story. He is a (false) character in the story. A detail. He wouldn&#x27;t have been newsworthy in his own right even if he had been real. ISIS was the story.<p>There was a &quot;media generated&quot; local, side narrative about &quot;why is this guy free?&quot; Canadian police couldn&#x27;t clear it up straight away, because the investigation was still going. Unfortunate, technically &quot;media generated.... but ultimately irrelevant to any big picture.')
