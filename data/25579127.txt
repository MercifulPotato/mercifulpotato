The rule is <i>use original title</i>, most of the time it&#x27;s indeed an anti-clickbait rule (although some false negatives are unavoidable).<p>&gt; <i>Please don&#x27;t do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It&#x27;s implicit in submitting something that you think it&#x27;s important.</i><p>&gt; <i>[...] Please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don&#x27;t editorialize.</i><p>My personal observation, there are three types of bad titles.<p>1. Clickbait titles editorialized by a submitter to make everyone know how great&#x2F;important the article is.<p>2. Clickbait titles from the source.<p>3. Non-descriptive title from the source.<p>60% of the bad titles are Type-1 title from the submitters (as everyone who ever browsed Reddit would know). To prevent such behaviors, the &quot;use original title&quot; rule is implemented on Hacker News.<p>30% of the titles are Type-2 title. On Hacker News, if many readers loudly criticize that the original title is misleading, eventually a moderator will correct it manually.<p>10% of the titles are Type-3 title, non-descriptive title that contain little information, but it&#x27;s neither misleading or clickbait. On Hacker News, usually, nothing happens. This article is one of them. Also, any attempt to change the title could be seen as Type-1 title editorialization, so the original title remains. So sometimes, even after the title has been changed by the submitter to be more descriptive, it could be reverted back to the original, non-descriptive one.<p>&gt; <i>This site doesn&#x27;t allow comments without substance, but for some reason link titles don&#x27;t have the same standards.</i><p>Whenever people compliant that Hacker News allows non-descriptive titles, please consider the fact that &quot;use the original title&quot; does more good than harm in general with a false negative rate of only 10%, which is a small price to pay.')
