I have a checkup once a year that includes a really thorough cleaning procedure and x-rays.  That costs about 120 USD.  If I need a filling that will probably add about 100 USD at the most and the two crowns (milled ceramic done on site, on demand) that I have cost about 500 USD each so over the last thirty years I have spent about 6000 USD on dentistry, so an average of 200 USD per year.')
