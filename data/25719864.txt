I don&#x27;t remember the sources, but I remember reading that DDG started relying more on their own indexing and less on Bing about a year ago. And from some testing I did some time ago, it was the case that only 50-60% of the search results on DDG were similar to Bing - meaning it&#x27;s still a significant source, but not so much as to say DDG is just proxying requests.')
