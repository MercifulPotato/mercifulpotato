As a result of Python&#x27;s mass adoption, uncountable thousands of hours of developer time have been wasted hunting down  bugs that would have been caught by tooling in any statically-typed language.<p>Unless Python can fix this, by adopting static typing, it&#x27;s not entirely fit for purpose in the ecosystem niche it has come to dominate. Replacing Python with a better language would be a net productivity boon for developers and scientists almost everywhere.')
