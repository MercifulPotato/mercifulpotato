I agree. In fact this blog post only exists because a blog post on analyzing the various bottleneck around connection scalability in postgres was getting too long, so I split it out... That post has numbers showing the slowdowns:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcommunity.microsoft.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;azure-database-for-postgresql&#x2F;analyzing-the-limits-of-connection-scalability-in-postgres&#x2F;ba-p&#x2F;1757266#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcommunity.microsoft.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;azure-database-for-po...</a><p>There&#x27;s a significant amount of improvements in Postgres&#x27; development branch addressing the - in my opinion - major source for the performance impact of lots of idle connections.<p>&gt; b) Opening a new connection takes way longer than connecting through pgBouncer running on a differnt(!) box.<p>Hm. How long is way longer? And how high is shared buffers on that instance? In tests it&#x27;s pretty easy to reach a few thousand connection establishments&#x2F;second. That&#x27;s not great, but also not terrible.<p>If the instance is otherwise very busy (e.g. due to the above issue), it can make connecting very slow, due to contention on very important locks.')
