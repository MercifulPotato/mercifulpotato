With additional arguments, it provides the function with access to itself.<p>This could be used &quot;under the hood&quot; in an implementation to bootstrap the ability of named local functions to have themselves in scope, which is useful for writing ordinary recursion.<p>Compilers and interpreters can achieve such a thing without any such jig like a Y combinator, because interpreters and compilers work with environments that are re-ified as objects. They are free to manipulate environments and evaluate&#x2F;compile any piece of code in any environment they see fit.')
