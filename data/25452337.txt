Item(by='theamk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608178048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449802, text='Eh, &quot;remove empty page&quot; is not &quot;live text editing&quot;. I have seen tools struggle with seemingly simple operations, like &quot;take page 1,4 from A and pages 4,6 from B, scale to fit paper size and combine into one file&quot;. And those are not some exotic requirements, those are one of the most basic operations people want to do with multi-page documents.<p>Also, did you want to say JPEG isn&#x27;t suitable for collaborative image work (because it&#x27;s lossy?). As PNG is a pretty fine exchange format if two people, who prefer different graphical editors, want to work on the same document.')
