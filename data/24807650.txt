Item(by='posterboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602912501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806215, text='&gt; Caring about and understanding the structure of<p>&gt; knowledge is philosophy.<p>I disagree. At least, I expected the sentence to continue differently, because the study of philosophy is to a significant degree concerned with a survey of the historic development of certain traditions of thought, and ideas.<p>But beyond that, it&#x27;s only rarely about the structure of knowledge. That&#x27;s predominantly done in information science, informatics, what English call computer science for short. Of cohrse, <i>caring about</i> can be done in both disciplines, but also in any other field, pretty much by the definition of &quot;study&quot;.<p>Except, philosophy eventually will do it with blanket terms to the point of being meaningless. Point in case: your comment.<p>Really though, it depends entirely on the philosophy under study.')
