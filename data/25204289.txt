Item(by='comfydragon', descendants=None, kids=[25204457], score=None, time=1606260916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200939, text='Messaging in Zigbee (i.e. sending data back and forth) is all about two things: addressing (endpoint, profile and cluster... kind of like port + URI for HTTP, where endpoint=port and profile+cluster=URI), and the payload itself. The Zigbee specification defines a variety of standard profiles that devices may choose to implement. Things like device temperature, on&#x2F;off switch, metering, time,  lighting, etc.<p>But nothing says that any given device, say a Zigbee light controller (on&#x2F;off) from manufacturer X, MUST implement the standard on&#x2F;off cluster for that. They could have their own manufacturer-specific profile+cluster for controlling the light, where a payload of 0x11 turns it on, 0x22 turns it off, and 0xF7 toggles the light. Or maybe you send the ASCII string &quot;on&quot;.<p>Suppose that HA has implemented the functionality needed to interact with the standard on&#x2F;off cluster. That functionality would work with devices that implement the standard cluster, but not with manufacturer X&#x27;s device that needs the string &quot;on&quot;. But then, HA could be updated to recognize such devices and implement the required functionality.<p>Assuming you&#x27;re familiar with HTTP: just because two services both consume and produce JSON, doesn&#x27;t mean the message bodies are interchangeable.')
