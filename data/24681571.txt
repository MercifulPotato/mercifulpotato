He spent a few weeks writing a parallelized solver, learned to use MPI, and distributed the computation over our school’s cluster, got the results he needed and moved on with his life. When I had encountered the same problem later after studying SDEs in a bit more detail, I found that I could reduce the problem into something I could solve on my laptop in about 10 minutes.<p>We can argue about how much time he and I put into the problem from ground zero. The thing I’m arguing is that one can spend a lot of time misusing the building blocks if one doesn’t understand them. Existence and uniqueness seem hoity toity until you try to numerically solve an equation over a domain for which a solution doesn’t exist, or you try to solve it and you get one of many solutions and think you’re done.<p>It’s hard to measure the value of knowing the fundamentals... especially 10 years out when it seems like you’re reusing the same tiny subset of your toolset over and over again. The fundamentals though exist as a little voice in the back of your head reminding you not to do something that won’t work.')
