I couldn&#x27;t send &quot;my car broke down&quot; on Signal because it&#x27;s one service was down for reasons entirely unrelated to my use.<p>One can use email and have an address at Google and one at work, and know these data points for a friend. One can use a phone and have multiple service providers (in some countries multiple sims for costs, in others legacy landlines.) One can use WhatsApp, Signal or Slack and then you need to synchronize on an entirely different backup service. None of them have the POTS guarantee and for the most part we (at least in my age demographic) don&#x27;t even trust the POTS service with non-redundant numbers.')
