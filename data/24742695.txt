Item(by='vanusa', descendants=None, kids=[24742952], score=None, time=1602372637, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24742141, text='<i>Compliance training is about legal requirement.</i><p>That&#x27;s the thing -- oftentimes your Boss <i>thinks</i> that X is a &quot;legal requirement&quot;.  When really it&#x27;s &quot;so-and-so is bugging me to cram this down your throats saying something about &#x27;legal&#x27; and I&#x27;m too busy to even bother googling to find out whether it&#x27;s really so.  Plus even if I did some basic research I might have to actually <i>think</i> about it for a minute or two - and you know how much I hate that.  So to save myself time, I think I&#x27;ll just cram it down your throats.&quot;<p>My favorite X in this category: drug testing.  (Contrary to popular belief, it&#x27;s almost <i>never</i> an actual legal requirement - even if your company is getting state or federal funds.)')
