In facebook&#x27;s case, they have a dating app so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not into that.<p>Facebook doesn&#x27;t give you much actionable feedback. Here&#x27;s the routine I went through _several times_ publishing my ad there.<p>1. submit app<p>2. app gets rejected, and my account gets banned. get a generic message saying dating apps need to adhere to special, strict guidelines, and I need to sign up as a Dating service with Facebook&#x27;s customer service team.<p>3. I try to sign up for it, and they tell me I don&#x27;t qualify as a dating service (cause my app is not a dating service, it&#x27;s an augmentation on it - getsmartswipe.com). So back to square one after this contradictory mess.<p>4. I submit repeal to unban me.<p>5. They unban me.<p>6. I change some wording hoping maybe that&#x27;s the change they wanted.<p>7. go to (1)<p>reddit, similar. I&#x27;m sure they made it confusing on purpose but in Reddit&#x27;s case they took a week to reject it and said I needed to commit a minimum of 30k to advertise dating apps and work directly with them. Made no sense, so I didn&#x27;t bother retrying with Reddit.')
