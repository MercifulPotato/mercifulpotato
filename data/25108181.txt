Now 10 years later, I hardly ever have any pain at all.<p>Lots of research link gout to different makeups of gut bacteria:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep20602" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep20602</a><p>And I certainly changed my diet over the past 10 years, and my gut bacteria has become more diverse and presumably more healthy as a result. I&#x27;ve verified this through various stool tests and 3rd party microbiome trackers over the years (uBiome, Thryve)<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into pseudoscience or offer anyone advice, but I can tell you that my experience with increasing specific bacteria that increase butyric acid within the gut has seemed to work for me.
