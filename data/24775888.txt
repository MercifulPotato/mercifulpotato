I guess people are right, the standards here have dropped significantly over the past few years.<p>The evidence &#x27;backed by US intelligence&#x27;?  WTF are you talking about?  Did you not even read the articles you provided as your &#x27;evidence&#x27;?  None of them reference US intelligence sources.  One is a trade rag describing a single data point without context and the other is a  mid-level conservative paper that used random twitter pull quotes to tart up a minor story being passed around the wire services.<p>Truly weak sauce.')
