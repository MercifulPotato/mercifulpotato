We have a new genetic manipulation technology that has already revolutionized molecular biology just a few years after it was discovered, and is already being investigated in clinical trials.  Anyone who looks at this and says &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot; has a vastly distorted idea of what is actually possible in biomedical science, or any other line of work that requires actual humans to carry it out.')
