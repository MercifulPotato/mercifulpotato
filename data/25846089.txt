Look at sports reporting, for example (basketball, football). When they say something happened &quot;in the 6th minute&quot;, it happened between 05:00 and 05:59. The difficulty isn&#x27;t solely with programming.<p>You can use the same mechanism (minutes:seconds) to explain the half-open ranges: does a range(0,30) mean from 0:00 to 30:00 or from 0:00 to 30:59? If the second half of the match starts at 30:00, does the first half really end at 30:00 or is it really 29:59:99...9?<p>For most basic concepts, there&#x27;s always real-world examples to use so that the teaching doesn&#x27;t have to be abstract.')
