Therefore log(inf) = e. Ruby is probably rounding up e&#x2F;2.<p>Proof: the infinite series 1 + 1&#x2F;2 +1&#x2F;3! +... is known to converge to e. Now arrange in binomials: (1+1&#x2F;2)^e + (1&#x2F;3!)^e + ... this is known to be larger than (1+1&#x2F;2)^2 + ... = 1 + 1&#x2F;2 + 1&#x2F;4 + 1 + 2&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;9 + .....  But this infinite series contains the series that sums to 2 (1 + 1&#x2F;2 + 1&#x2F;4 +...) and so the series that sums to 3, etc. Then it is equal to the sum of all positive integers which is infinite.<p>(This is a joke.)')
