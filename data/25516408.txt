They cannot have margins or paddings like block boxes.<p>Inline-block boxes flow with other inline content like inline boxes, but can be styled like block boxes.<p>Never have different types of boxes directly as siblings. Instead, create block wrappers for any inline content. This alone saves a lot of headache.')
