When asked why, they simply say &quot;I don&#x27;t know. It works, it feels right&quot;.<p>Even the younger users (who already had experience with web applications, big tech&#x27;s stuff etc when they joined the company) prefer the text based ones.<p>I&#x27;m not at all implying that every software should be text based. But I think there are some very important lessons to be learned here. Things we developers used to know, intuitively.<p>I think UX designers should listen more to those users and less to theories and to Google and its MDC trying to make the internet look like their own products')
