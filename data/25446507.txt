Generally I have found the shell in emacs on Windows to be very finicky and difficult to use.<p>It has always been a minor pain point and I’ve had trouble finding reliable info. Ideally we could just use Powershell but I understand this is quite tricky.  Powershell.el[1] didn’t actually work for me (beyond the editing mode) when I last tried it but I do see there’s a somewhat recent update.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jschaf&#x2F;powershell.el" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jschaf&#x2F;powershell.el</a>')
