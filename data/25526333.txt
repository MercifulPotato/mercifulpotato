These must be files and make works by comparing their modification timestamps to see if a recipe has to be (re-)executed.<p>Now what is the prerequisite for your virtual environment?<p>What is the output? venv&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python ? What if you need to pip install some stuff (maybe only for testing)? What happens when the installation of a single package fails?<p>I think having a script (or a phony target for people with strange tastes ;) ) makes at least clear that there is no half-assed dependency tracking ongoing.<p>I <i>think</i> one way to figure this out would be to have a test script that runs inside the venv and outputs some kind of checksum.')
