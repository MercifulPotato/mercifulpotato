Might be helpful to also add that link to the &quot;website&quot; field of the GitHub?<p>2. I get it. I never had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of being an academic, but got the chance to be a software engineer working alongside grad students for a couple of years and it felt like I imagine what taking a tour of a sweatshop factory floor would be like. (a huge exaggeration, but I saw a lot of low pay and lots of time on pdfs and not enough on code)<p>3. Yeah, I get it, but maybe allowing everyone to run it on their own VM would be better (and providing a one click &quot;click here to get your own droplet on digital ocean running kyrix&quot; sort of thing). I&#x27;ve found that Docker suffers from the XKCD problem (10 different environments to supportâ€”what if there was just 1....11 different environments to support!). I&#x27;ve almost never had a pleasant experience using Docker (and anything that requires downloading a 1GB+ image I don&#x27;t consider pleasant). But again, I&#x27;m probably just being a grump and the other grads I worked with all seems to like it. Another idea is could use do this with SQLite? Have a more slimmed down version that didn&#x27;t require Docker + those dependencies<p>Thanks for the answers! Very cool stuff and it&#x27;s a very interesting problem.')
