But they do harm innovation, because often the cost to become compliant with such new regulations is fixed. So the cost for a large corporation to be compliant is roughly similar to the cost of a startup to be compliant. This makes it comparatively harder for startups to get going and thereby gives large companies an unfair advantage. This stifles competition and innovation.<p>We are seeing this first-hand with our startup in the EU investment space. The costs to be compliant with the various regulations (MiFID, AML, etc...) are mostly fixed, so they&#x27;re a lot harder for small firms to implement such as ourselves than for large firms. That&#x27;s also why a lot of smaller firms are merging into larger firms.<p>As a solution, there should be relaxed regulations for startups. They would have to be fully compliant only once they reach a certain scale.')
