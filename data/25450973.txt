I was raised in a family of five and my parents had a minivan because nothing smaller would have been practical.  Even if you can technically squeeze 3 kids into the back of a sedan, good luck going more than 30 minutes away without fights breaking out.  And even if your kids are particularly well mannered, they still won&#x27;t be comfortable. If you&#x27;re driving a few hours to visit family, do you want to have a headache from fighting kids when you get there?  Or kids in sour moods because their sibling wouldn&#x27;t stop elbowing them?')
