It is against the law to refuse service on the basis of protected classes (i.e. race, sex, sexual orientation).  These classes are thought to be immutable.<p>More and more evidence shows that political beliefs are inheritable[1].  Should that be protected?  What about height?  We know that shorter men earn less than taller men.  Should short people be protected from short jokes?  Should the government ensure short and tall people have the same salary?  What about attractiveness?  Again uglier people are less successful and have less sex.  Should they be protected?  Should the government put their finger on the scale to ensure ugly people have the same amount of sex?<p>Either, I should be able to discriminate on any basis, or I can&#x27;t.  The problem at the moment is we have it both ways, in ways that asymmetrically attack one particular group of people.<p>Nobody really things through any of these inconsistencies though because it doesn&#x27;t impact most people.  As the values in Silicon Valley have significantly diverged from large parts of the US, more and more people are being impacted by these policies.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;study-on-twins-suggests-our-political-beliefs-may-be-hard-wired&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;study-on-tw...</a>')
