The pattern matching needs to either change syntax or go away, and all the List.Foo() calls need to change to Array.Foo&#x27;s or whatever -- or I have to use Seq.Foo() everywhere to get extensibility even I don&#x27;t want to pay for lazy evaluation.\nLong time F# fan here! -- but still some sore points.')
