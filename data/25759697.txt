Or more specifically it&#x27;s now Silicon Valley&#x27;s problem because when these firms make identical decisions within 24 hours of each other nobody in politics is going to treat them all as unique and special snowflakes. The left have seen that they can apply pressure to get <i>anything</i> that isn&#x27;t controlled by leftists erased from the internet, so they&#x27;re going to amp up the volume 10,000% now. And the right have been complaining for years that tech firms have been captured by the censoring left - how will anyone ever convince them otherwise now? Claiming that Parler was full of Nazis? It&#x27;s a tired strategy, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore, the left describe anyone who isn&#x27;t the left as Nazis and fascists. It won&#x27;t convince anyone.')
