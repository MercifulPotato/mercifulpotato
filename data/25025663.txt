This model goes contrary to the needs of propriety software, to lock you into a whole system you can charge for.<p>(And FWIW, I don&#x27;t have the vendetta against proprietary software like a lot of HN seems to, so I&#x27;m sympathetic here about breaking the incentives for production of software that legitimately needs paid devs and can&#x27;t get enough via donations. But if Open Source teams can make it work, I&#x27;m all for that!)<p>OTOH, as a general model ... I can see why it has failed to pick up, at least with typical devs and prevailing software practices. It requires a level of care about interfaces and interoperability that is not very common.<p>More often, you see APIs broken willy-nilly with no functional need to. Stable standards for exchange of data require a lot of work and are the exception -- even when you have them, there will be the warts that reveal abstraction leakage. (Another comment mentions how HTML was quickly broken.[0]) The no-app approach with basically be that fight, but for every external touch point, of every module.<p>I do <i>hope</i> the dev world can make that work ... but also: understand what you&#x27;re fighting against.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25021180" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25021180</a>')
