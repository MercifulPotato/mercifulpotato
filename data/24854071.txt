Item(by='xamuel', descendants=None, kids=[24857603], score=None, time=1603330106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851260, text='&gt;Humans don&#x27;t receive infinite rewards because any &quot;reward system&quot; in our brain is implemented by receiving a finite amount of electrochemical pleasure signals over a finite amount of time.<p>This is like saying computers can&#x27;t represent infinity because they have only finitely many bytes.<p>Suppose the treasury rewarded you a &quot;superdollar&quot;, which is a special object that allows you to create any number of dollars that you want, on demand, as many times as you want. How many dollars would you say this superdollar is worth? Obviously, no finite number of dollars would be worth that one superdollar. The human mind can certainly understand the relative value of a superdollar vs. any number of dollars. That the human mind is implemented through finite electrochemical processes is irrelevant.')
