Basically, make a better product than Amazon in order to win, people don&#x27;t usually care about the organizational structure of the company.<p>---<p>I am reminded of OpenHunt, an open source version of Product Hunt that was made. The only value proposition was that it was open source, but it shut down precisely because users didn&#x27;t care about that, they cared whether it had enough cool products (as a consumer) and enough traffic (as a submitter).<p>Here&#x27;s one post-mortem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10940729" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10940729</a><p>&gt; OpenHunt tried solving a problem for the content makers without providing any additional benefit to the content consumers.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a nice, heart-warming mission. But in the end of the day, content is king, that&#x27;s what consumers want.<p>&gt; There have been many examples of people rallying around a &quot;free and open&quot; version of a service. They fail to realize that the end consumer barely cares. Look at voat (Reddit), app.net (Twitter), Diaspora (Facebook), even ycreject.com (Y Combinator) tried to be a thing for a while.<p>&gt; If someone is able to make it &quot;free and open&quot; while also making it a better experience than the alternative, then it&#x27;ll be a big success. But so far everyone gets that wrong.')
