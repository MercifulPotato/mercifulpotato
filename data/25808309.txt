This is why by Canon law, not that it&#x27;s always followed, politicians who support abortion should not be given communion: they are manifestly in a state of mortal sin and giving them communion is desecrating the Eucharist and causing scandal[2]. Because of this, well catechized Catholics will oppose abortion. That said, it&#x27;s unproductive to be a jerk about it and the correct response for those who don&#x27;t have pastoral responsibility for the individuals in question is just to pray that they realize their error and repent.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consciencelaws.org&#x2F;religion&#x2F;religion002.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consciencelaws.org&#x2F;religion&#x2F;religion002.aspx</a><p>[2] In this context, by scandal Catholics mean action that invites others to sin.')
