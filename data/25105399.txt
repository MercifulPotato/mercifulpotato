With out it, all is lost, even your mental health.  It&#x27;s hard to predict how life will be when your gamble starts coming up short. \n It&#x27;s hard to keep focus when your dealing with your girlfriend&#x27;s anxiety, or when your running out of money without any backup plan.    I have felt the author&#x27;s pain, but from the pain comes a set of lessons you can&#x27;t understand from reading a book.  I hope that after he picks up his pieces he eventually executes again with a new game plan: to manage his downside, to have customer&#x27;s chomping at the bit, to find proper financial backing, to establish a team of fellow believers, to sell into a well established network through a partner, or whatever lessons he has learned.')
