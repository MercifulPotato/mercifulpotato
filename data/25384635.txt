Sure, style plays a role, but even the stylistic trappings have strong political undercurrents. There&#x27;s a reason &#x27;punk&#x27; is part of the name.<p>One could create &#x27;high fantasy&#x27; games, movies, books, and infuse it with any number of political views. But with cyberpunk the most common themes are highly political (and I&#x27;d say relevant to our time).<p>That said, I don&#x27;t believe it always has to neatly fit into a &#x27;left-wing&#x27; perspective. If anything, I&#x27;d say one of the defining characteristics is libertarianism, perhaps with leftist tendencies, but not necessarily so.')
