A has 1X$ and B has 10X$, then an exchange occurs where 1X$ moves from B to A, now it&#x27;s 2X$ and 9X$, but the change in happiness for A could be log(2&#x2F;1)~=.30 while B log(9&#x2F;10) ~=-.04<p>This is just one utility vs wealth model that would argue wealth transfers improve net utility in some contexts.')
