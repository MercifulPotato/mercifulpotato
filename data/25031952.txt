I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call that a &quot;strict walled garden&quot; comparable to the iOS App Store; if anything, I wish Gatekeeper existed on iOS the way it does on the Mac. (A few years ago I was half-expecting that to happen, as naive as it might sound: it seemed like it was a great solution to allowing sideloading while still letting Apple maintain some level of control, but it&#x27;s become clear Apple still looks at iOS devices as more like game consoles than general purpose computers. It&#x27;s possible it might yet happen to stave off antitrust concerns, I suppose.)')
