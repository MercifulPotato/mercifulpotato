Back when they had 10% marketshare with macs in the ‘90s or even with 70% marketshare with iPods in the ‘00s.<p>The forcing function, for all the attributes you listed, over the last 10 years has been the iPhone.<p>Even the headway’s in 3rd app support that the Mac will get now, is funnily because of the iPhone.
