Still, I could be quite wrong.<p>Yes, I do have some concerns regarding long term effects of mRNA based vaccines. As you said, I would also like to see some deeper thinking about this. I feel that other delivery vectors may be better known and have an existing track record.<p>I also understand that mRNA treatments have had some excellent outcomes in cancer patients.

Therefore, I also wonder about the general medium and longer term effectiveness of mRNA for coronavirus vaccination.<p>I&#x27;m in no way an anti-vaxer. I&#x27;m completely vaccinated for all the common things (MMR etc). As is my child. No problems with something that&#x27;s been around for a long time and is well known.<p>I would just like to make my own choice regarding which brand new, accelerated testing regime, vaccine I decide to inject.')
