This is incredible - look at the life of the professional football player Ozil who was effectively forced to leave Arsenal for his comments on this very  subject.<p>Criticizing China should NOT be censored. (There&#x27;s another country that also invites this type of cancel culture trolls whenever someone objects the policies of that country. You can guess.)')
