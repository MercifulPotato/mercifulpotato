Every block includes its own hash algorithm source code.  Every node decides for itself whether to accept the hash algorithm and how much to value it.   If people suspect an algorithm is getting ASIC&#x27;d, they can devalue it (if they want -- maybe the majority of nodes want ASICs for some reason, and that&#x27;s fine too).  The point is to let the users to choose the algorithm, not a core group of developers.')
