Item(by='davidgay', descendants=None, kids=[25854320], score=None, time=1611193124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25854203, text='Not Bay-Area rent-control, but: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ch.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;rent-tenant-rights-obligations&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ch.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;rent-tenant-rights-obligations&#x2F;</a>. In particular, rents are expected to follow interest rate changes (both up and down). You can request a rent reduction when interest rates go down, or if &quot;you are paying significantly more than the previous tenants&quot;. And rent increases have to be justified (by improvements, interest rate changes, market changes, etc). And there&#x27;s a &quot;conciliation authority&quot; to resolve disputes. Seems fairly controlled to me.')
