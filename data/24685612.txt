Can&#x27;t say anything about reliability yet, but at least the ink is not outrageously expensive (just normal expensive...).<p>Installing the thing requires you to connect with an app that (thanks iOS 14) asks for much more permissions than it should (especially GPS location). It transmits your wifi password to the printer even if you&#x27;ve got a network cable plugged in! (it even has the nerve to ask you to remove the cable). Printer will not boot before completing this process, just hang on a &#x27;connect with app&#x27; display.\nI&#x27;m not sure it even is legal to sell such a product here (Europe), but it sure is annoying they ship a product that requires an IT degree to use without giving up your privacy.')
