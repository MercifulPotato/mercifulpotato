Coordinating a collective buy to effect a short squeeze is clear market manipulation.  Enticing a horde of gullible forum users to buy the same ballooned stock based on ideas like &quot;stick it to the man&quot; and &quot;turn their tricks back on them&quot; is an even clearer pump and dump scheme.<p>This doesn&#x27;t end well for anyone (except Gamestop&#x27;s pre-existing shareholders I guess).  The hedge fund got fleeced, the gullible WSB users are going to lose a ton, Robinhood flushed their brand down the toilet trying to avoid being an accomplice to all of this, and the only folks who made money on the deal are more likely than not in the SEC crosshairs now.')
