From what I heard they had to make changes.  A big problem is the largest services like S3.  If part of S3 were to use DynamoDB and DynamoDB used S3, then if one goes down, they might never restart either service.  There is strong manager incentive at Amazon to build on other services as a way to ingratiate with other managers and VP&#x27;s in the company.  Unfortunately it leads to circular dependencies.')
