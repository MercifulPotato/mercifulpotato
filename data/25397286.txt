If someone has been reinfected with the same strain then it is hard to distinguish that from an infection that wasn&#x27;t fully cleared originally. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that immunity is strain-specific.<p>(I don&#x27;t know why you were downvoted; your comment seems reasonable to me!)')
