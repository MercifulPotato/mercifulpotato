Perhaps our calculations look different.<p>These plans includes: unlimited voice calling, texting, long distance, voicemail, call display, 5 hours of <i>unlimited</i> data per month (great for using a hotspot) <i>and</i> that amount of data.<p>The basic phone plan is about $30, so you&#x27;re actually paying  about $3 per GB.  Overage is an admittedly ridiculous $15&#x2F;GB.<p>This is Fido, owned by Rogers, obviously a major carrier.  The standard plans aren&#x27;t quite as good ($75 for 10GB), but there&#x27;s always some kind of promotion going on.  It&#x27;s not wonderful when you see what some other countries are paying, but we&#x27;re in a far better place than even a few years ago.')
