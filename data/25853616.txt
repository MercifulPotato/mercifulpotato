Because you do need that, but without that wouldn&#x27;t even be able to define uncountability. After that, you can define the reals using Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences, which was known at the time (I believe Cantor actually worked on the Cauchy sequence construction). But there&#x27;s an even simpler uncountable set: the power set of the natural numbers. Super easy to define, and the diagonalization argument falls right out.')
