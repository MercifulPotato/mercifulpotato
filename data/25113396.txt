If GitHub were fighting for the developer they would have funded the attorney, right? Though from their blog post it does look like they are taking steps to fund defense in the future as well as other steps to improve the situation.<p>Reading EFFs claim is pretty interesting, they state that saving a copy of a video is only one function of youtube-dl. I think the biggest problem is the name is called &quot;youtube download&quot;, it is sort of difficult to downplay that saving a copy is only one function when the name implies it is the main purpose of the program.')
