I remember slinging AOpen (Another Acer spinoff) motherboards and shortly after Acer spun off Wistron, AOpen started offering laptops from Wistron. Dell shortly thereafter offered same&#x2F;similar models.<p>They weren&#x27;t very good; while thankfully my laptop was not a victim of the capacitor plague, they had some really bad design around the power port; over time just normal insert cycles would cause the connector to get loose and short in various ways. At one point I would have to &#x27;shim&#x27; the plug in with paper to make sure that the contacts were well connected. The problem surfaced after a year, and after a factory repair, I got another year before the problem came back.<p>Thankfully the real fix was to use a better &#x27;plug&#x27;, one that had a threaded base (i.e. a threaded hole goes through the plastic, a &#x27;cap&#x27; holds it in place).')
