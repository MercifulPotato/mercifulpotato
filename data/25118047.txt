They even posted a profit last quarter.  I&#x27;ve gotta say, the S1 looks appealing considering how few profitable silicon valley companies there are these days.  On the other hand, I have a hard time interpreting whether this is truly a profitable company since the numbers are all over the place.<p>It also looks like Q3 tends to be their best quarter by far.  Is that because of summer vacations?')
