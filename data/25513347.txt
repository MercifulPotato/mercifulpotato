But anyway. I think the presented thingy is fundamentally wrong.<p>It&#x27;s just another attempt to put the square peg in a round hole.<p>The point is: &quot;The web&quot; is not, and never was, a framework for application development! It&#x27;s the wrong tool. No matter how hard you try.<p>You want to build applications? Use tools that where build from the ground up to support application development.<p>On mobile people realized mostly by now that &quot;native&quot; is the way to go. Because native apps are superior along any dimension compared to &quot;web-apps&quot;. The same is <i>of course</i> true on the desktop.<p>Mature and full featured technology to build &quot;native&quot; cross desktop applications exists since forever. Just have a look at great tools like IntelliJ IDEA or Bitwig Studio for example.<p>Hotwire on the other hand is just another try to misuse &quot;the web&quot; as an application development platform. It&#x27;s closer to what the web actually is (namely HTML pages) but it&#x27;s still wrong on the fundamental level (as it tries to build an app framework on top of something that was meant to be <i>only a hyper-text system</i>).<p>Let&#x27;s see how long it&#x27;ll take until people realize this truth - and we&#x27;re really full circle.')
