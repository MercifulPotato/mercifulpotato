It also has to be a medium of exchange and a standard of value. Bitcoin&#x27;s value changes so wildly that it cannot be a standard (right now) and no one uses it to buy things.<p>Everyone is investing in bitcoin on the promise that its going to be so much more useful than dollars, in the hopes that they will make a lot of... dollars? Do you see the contradiction? If they think it&#x27;s going to be so much better than dollars what are they going to do with their long term investment dollars if, in the long run, bitcoin surpasses them?<p>Don&#x27;t use economics terms to explain the usefulness of bitcoin when economics itself disagrees.')
