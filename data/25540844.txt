I know weather underground bombings tried to choose times for their bombings when buildings would not be inhabited, not always successfully.<p>Just wanted to point out that dressing things up as &quot;political violence&quot; is a disservice; violence performed in the commision of promoting an ideology is terrorism.<p>edit: I expected this to spark conversation; I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that people would rather downvote than respond.')
