Your question implies that you&#x27;re 100% right and the opposition is 100% wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve seen compelling evidence on 4chan to make me believe that there was some shadiness going on in this election, perhaps moreso than normal. However, even I can admit that it does not appear to rise to the level of systemic voter fraud that I would need to call this election a &quot;sham&quot;, nor does it appear systemic by any measure.<p>Can you see the difference between &quot;everyone I don&#x27;t agree with is 100% incorrect and racist&quot; and my statement? Can you see how claiming intelligent working people are &quot;in another reality&quot; might be divisive to the people you&#x27;re (falsely) claiming to want to meet halfway?<p>It goes both ways too - the right still won&#x27;t admit that climate change is a thing to be combated even though that it is facially obvious to anyone that climate change has at least <i>some</i> negative effects.')
