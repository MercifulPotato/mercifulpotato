Having to get a billion dollar emergency bail out is not the sign of a sinister plot, it&#x27;s the sign of a colossal fuck up.<p>&gt; I refuse to believe that such a massive entity with so much resources at it&#x27;s disposal has a think-tank consisting of two interns and a comatose member of middle-management.<p>There are a fair number of signs that Robinhood is a mess. This isn&#x27;t the first time the company has run afoul of their own success and wound up screwing over investors.<p>&gt; Entity X faces no real repercussions.<p>I didn&#x27;t say they shouldn&#x27;t be responsible for the consequences of their mistake. My point was that it&#x27;s more likely this is a screw up than some sinister plan on their part.<p>We&#x27;re on the same page as far as this last bit goes for sure. Regardless of whether it was a screw up or malice, they should be the ones paying the price (though sadly I suspect we both know they won&#x27;t).')
