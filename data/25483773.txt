Frequency is around 9,7GHz which is the upper limit of ground and wall penetrating radar systems. Of course you cannot look through metal or conductive structures, but why not thin plastic tents or thin walls? For this we need to know the sensors sensitivity. Of course imaging gets a bit messier, since the imageing algorithm is based on the assumption that you only get an entry reflex (so basically it is 2D or lets call it  2,5D imaging). For full 3D you also need to scan&#x2F;move orthogonal to the first satelite direction.')
