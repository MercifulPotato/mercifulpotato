Item(by='e12e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609898913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650537, text='&gt; The presupposition is that Apple is inherently motivated to actively lock things down, because that&#x27;s what they do with the iPhone. This glosses over that Apple has no reason to actually do so, only has reasons not to do it on the Mac, and has gone on record saying they won&#x27;t treat the Mac as the iPhone.<p>What is the difference between an iPad pro and a MacBook? If Apple can get away with a 30% tax on all commercial software, and arbitrarily manage which applications are &quot;allowed&quot; - why would they not want to extend that to their laptops? If they still get people to buy and developers to develop?')
