Item(by='scottlocklin', descendants=None, kids=[25151438, 25151298], score=None, time=1605793967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136148, text='&gt;The underlying reason that I believe electric aircraft can break the sound barrier is that electric motors can deliver far higher power-to-weight ratios than piston engines, jets, or turbines.<p>That&#x27;s a completely worthless figure of merit (I assume he means thrust to weight; because electric helicopters have abysmal power to weight ratio -shit like this matters) and no reason to believe in this nonsense. By the same reasoning, one could build a piston engined supersonic aircraft because there are piston engined helicopters. Another thing that has a high thrust to weight ratio; those water rockets I used to play with as a kid.[0] Pretty sure you can&#x27;t go supersonic with those either unless you fire them out of a howitzer.<p>Electric airplanes are a terrible idea without battery technology comparable to hydrocarbon power to weight ratios. Even then, they&#x27;re a terrible idea unless the motivating technology is lighter than a jet engine and tanks for reasons that should be obvious to anyone with high school physics educations.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Water_rocket" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Water_rocket</a>')
