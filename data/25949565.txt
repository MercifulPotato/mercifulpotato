I&#x27;m not being snarky, I genuinely can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re defending the open discussion about stock trading or the people that came in and called them names and got them shut down.<p>I am all for a discussion focused group having rules and expecting participants to adhere to them and booting them out if they don&#x27;t. What I am opposed to is businesses that market themselves as places to freely discuss, wait til they have market control, then change their terms and kick people out based on tenuous accusations, in this case for the apparent reason of protecting hedge funds from the market. It is egregious what Discord did.')
