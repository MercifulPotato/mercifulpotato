The Constitution, however, did not declare Hindi as the national language or any other language.<p>Hindi does not have any special privilege than any other state languages like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Oriya etc.<p>Hindi is not even oldest language in India. It&#x27;s Tamil.<p>The politics behind promoting Hindi is a religious one. It makes convenient to promote the varna system(modern caste system). This is the reason the religious party and organizations(BJP, RSS) promotes Hindi and forces in to the education of all non-hindi speaking states too.<p>Another misconception is all north indian states government administrative language is Hindi, which is not the case.')
