I view it as building foundations in good and scalable ways. At the beginning when the map is empty (analogous to a green field project with no files yet) it may seem like micromanaging. But if you do it right, you quickly grow out of that phase and start operating at a scale the new order of magnitude up. This cycle repeats a few times and before you know it (because you accidentally stayed up all night playing the game) you&#x27;re copy-pasting massive factories around and having armies of robots build it for you. You no longer care about minor details and micro-optimizations, you care about the next order of magnitude.')
