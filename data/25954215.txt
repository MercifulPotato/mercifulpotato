Some of those radio protocols you listed (Bluetooth&#x2F;WiFi&#x2F;ZigBee) typically use &quot;ISM&quot; radio bands, where the rules are less stringent (but there are still rules), some of the protocols you mention (EDGE&#x2F;EVDO&#x2F;LTE) will very quickly get you found&#x2F;shutdown&#x2F;fined if you start transmitting on them.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t question that certain types of radio transmissions may offend one or more people; and&#x2F;or one or more &quot;powers-that-be&quot;...<p>But, let&#x27;s clearly, and I mean <i>super-clearly</i> understand the exact specifics of what those are, because you see, there is room, there is a lot of room for experimentation -- outside of those parameters.<p>You see, what someone can or can&#x27;t do, radiowise, is largely determined by a matrix of different factors -- think of this as a giant Excel spreadsheet -- but with multiple factors determining whether something in radio can be done or can&#x27;t.<p>So let&#x27;s talk about some of those factors.<p>One of them is the distance to other people.  If I live in a cornfield in Nebraska, and my next door neighbor is 35 miles away, unless my radio transmission goes for more than 35 miles, it probably isn&#x27;t going to piss off anyone.<p>Conversely, if I live in a tightly packed city, like New York where my next door neighboor lives in an apartment 20 feet away -- then 20 feet might be the largest practical distance that my radio transmission might be able to go before it pisses someone off.<p>So that&#x27;s one aspect of this &#x27;matrix&#x27;.<p>Another aspect is, what country do I live in?<p>Because different countries have different rules.<p>On the ocean, at 200+ nautical miles from the coast of the nearest country, or on the North Pole, or South Pole, or in Outer Space (if I can get there) -- I can probably get away with a longer broadcast -- without pissing anyone off.<p>But those are only some of the parameters of this matrix.<p>Another parameter is frequency, another parameter is power relative to that frequency, another parameter is the directionality of the transmission (for example, am I using a directional radio beam formed by a cone-shaped transmitter, and how does that beam spread out, and how far does it go, and who is in its path?).<p>Then, there are what are called &quot;Caduceus Coils&quot; -- they&#x27;re a special coil&#x2F;broadcast antenna -- which if it designed correctly, acts like the &quot;laser beam&quot; equivalent, except for rf; the radio transmission.<p>If that tightly focused radio beam is about the size of a dime, and travels directly, over air, to its target location (which is some other guy agreeing beforehand to receive that transmission, to become a &quot;node&quot; on the network&quot;), then that radio transmission will not interfere wtih any other radios (receiving or transmitting) outside of that laser-thin line; in other words, it should interfere with no-one, it should not piss any person or power-that-be, off...<p>You see, to quote William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;:<p><i>&quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t mean to offend you by saying that; but you see, there&#x27;s always another angle; another possibility that may have gone unthought-of (until someone points it out).<p>In other words, &quot;Don&#x27;t assume&quot;, or phrased another way &quot;Assume Nothing&quot; (Mike Abrash).<p>Yes, people would probably get offended if you connected with a cell phone tower on one of their frequencies using one of their protocols without their permission -- but I am not proposing that that be done!<p>Instead, I&#x27;m saying -- <i>look at the possibilities</i>.<p>The multi-page spreadsheet&#x2F;matrix of factors must be created and then consulted to see where the empty spaces are (empty space = opportunity for experimentation!).<p>Anything that is not prohibited -- is, and must be by default, permitted! (You know, that old Grace Hopper &quot;permission vs. forgiveness&quot; debate!).<p>&gt;&quot;you&#x27;ll be complying with all the regulations&quot;<p>My question is this: Do the regulators even <i>understand</i> what they are regulating?<p>I understand both Law <i>and</i> Radio technology.<p>I could do their job; they probably couldn&#x27;t do mine...<p>&gt;&quot;it&#x27;s not really a sensible path to go down if your goal is widely usable decentralised non-internet connected messaging.&quot;<p>Yes, but my goal <i>isn&#x27;t</i> to go down this path -- it&#x27;s to think about what to do about greater shitstorms (greater amounts of shit hitting the fan than it does already) <i>if and when they happen</i>!<p>I hate to dumb it down to this level, but proverbially speaking, in this matter &quot;I&#x27;m the good guys&quot; (er, guy, singular, as the case may be... &lt;g&gt;)...')
