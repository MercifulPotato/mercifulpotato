The knowledge map options are fun to tinker with even if a bit of a black box.<p>As for the xml - when you download the xml that&#x27;s intended to be your starting point for an engine, it doesn&#x27;t include parts of the definition of the CSE like sites you&#x27;ve listed to exclude. So that functionality seems to be a little broken, but I&#x27;ve confirmed you can add and remove elements of the knowledge graph at least via the xml file.')
