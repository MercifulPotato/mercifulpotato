I mean look at this deal right on Normandy Isle:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;1340-Marseille-Dr-Miami-Beach-FL-33141&#x2F;43878007_zpid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;1340-Marseille-Dr-Miami-B...</a><p>That place is $1m cheaper than the same number of bedrooms and similar square footage in LA, where you have at least 30 minutes of traffic separating you from the waterfront:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;1633-S-Shenandoah-St-Los-Angeles-CA-90035&#x2F;20491742_zpid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;1633-S-Shenandoah-St-Los-...</a><p>Maybe if your perspective is other parts of Florida or the South, then yeah there is some sticker shock, but compared to CA, miami is a steal for how lively of a city and truly connected to the water it is imo. When we would visit my friends we would spend so much time hanging out at sand bars, riding the jetskis to restaurants, seeing so much wildlife and nature along the way. So many people just have a boat or some jetskis docked near their property. It&#x27;s night and day different than how the waterfront is managed anywhere in CA, where inlets are used for storm water alone rather than recreation and the beach might be separated from the city by a highway (in the case of malibu or santa monica), or proximal to a refinery or some other piece of heavy industry (like in Manhattan beach where people pay millions to have a waterfront view of the shit plant in el segundo).')
