Then, in full view of the public, someone opens the envelopes, and you add up the numbers and take the result mod N.<p>If even one of the parties submits a fairly chosen random number, and manages to conceal it from the others until they&#x27;ve submitted their numbers, then the result will be a fairly chosen random number.  Then no one involved will have standing to complain that the result wasn&#x27;t chosen fairly enough.')
