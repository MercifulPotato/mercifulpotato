Item(by='theBobBob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605535106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108178, text='In Ireland there is a charity called Blood Bikes (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloodbikes.ie&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloodbikes.ie&#x2F;</a>) where people volunteer to quickly transport somewhat urgent medical supplies including blood (hence the name), test samples, medication, medical files etc. They don&#x27;t do organ transport though. I presume that is still generally done by the ambulance service.')
