Of course not. We&#x27;re having a nerdy discussion on IPC. It doesn&#x27;t really matter either way.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re right and these chips won&#x27;t &quot;improve evenly&quot; across all benchmarks, but then again nobody has &quot;even&quot; workloads. Rocket-Lake-S has some machine learning acceleration that&#x27;s going to be useless for many people, valuable for others. It has a GPU onboard, which can come in handy. I&#x27;m personally interested in AVX-512. No, I don&#x27;t need to know why you think AVX-512 sucks.')
