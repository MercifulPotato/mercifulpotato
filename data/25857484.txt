And it makes life easier!&quot;</i><p>But plenty choose to do something morally wrong because &quot;I have to put bread on my table, and I&#x27;m about to go out of business because I can&#x27;t compete with everyone else doing the immoral thing&quot;. This is the mechanism by which the market eliminates ethics from our lives, step by step. If doing something slightly wrong gives you a competitive advantage, you&#x27;ll take it or you&#x27;ll get outcompeted by everyone else who do.')
