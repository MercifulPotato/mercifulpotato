Looking up the answers in one&#x27;s books or phone? Talking to your fellow students? That sort of artificial difficulty shouldn&#x27;t even be part of the rules in the first place. If your tests are so easy they can be solved via Google, they&#x27;re pointless and it doesn&#x27;t really matter if someone is cheating in the first place.<p>Honestly the problem is this mass education model where professors have hundreds of students to assess. Tests are necessary in this environment because they scale to any number of students. If people want an honest appraisal of their skills, a mentor who focuses on a single student exclusively is much better positioned to provide it.')
