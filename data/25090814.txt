What supposedly happens is that when you get exposed to sunlight, some of the cholesterol in your blood gets converted to Vitamin D. What part of sunlight, you might wonder. Is it the visible spectrum? No, it&#x27;s infrared, you know the thing that you get from your radiator.<p>So, two factors determine how much vitamin D you&#x27;re going to get:<p>- cholesterol levels in your blood<p>- how much heat you&#x27;re exposed to (i.e. how warm your room is)<p>I&#x27;m sure we need sunlight for other things... like our sleep cycles or whatever... but we definitely don&#x27;t need it for vitamin D.')
