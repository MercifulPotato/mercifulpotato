Could you please share what you think didn&#x27;t work so well with OpenWRT? I&#x27;m currently running a Turris Omnia with their custom OpenWRT that I know how to use and it&#x27;s been working quite well. What&#x27;s missing is a better CPU to run Wireguard encryption full speed through our fast internet connection.<p>I&#x27;m seriously thinking about pfSense or Opnsense, but FreeBSD still misses native Wireguard support, leaving the encryption to the go implementation, which is subpar for our use cases. But, I&#x27;d be happy to run Opnsense, with jails and all those goodies from FreeBSD.')
