But this means the user will try to game it, so the creator would prefer to keep it secret. The big question is: can we make a transparent algorithm that can&#x27;t be gamed (spam, SEO, etc.)? As cryptography demonstrates, this is definitely possible, but requires a lot of research, smart design and may not be cheap to implement.')
