With &quot;echo&quot;, I am probably stuck in the past. I recall encountering systems where &quot;printf&quot; (the command) didn&#x27;t exist. Maybe this is no longer a concern.<p>I&#x27;m less sure whether the quoting is technically necessary. It&#x27;s probably better style to quote anyway, so this is mostly academic, but I&#x27;ll ask anyway.<p>Does word splitting, etc. occur when assigning a command substitution to a variable? I know there are times when it does occur:<p><pre><code>    $ for i in $(echo a b c)\n    &gt; do\n    &gt;   echo &quot;$i&quot;\n    &gt; done\n    a\n    b\n    c\n</code></pre>\nBut then, empirically, when assigning to a variable, anything I throw at it seems to come through unscathed even without quotes:<p><pre><code>    $ x=$(echo &quot; * &quot; b c&quot;&#x27;&quot;; echo d;)\n    $ echo &quot;$x&quot;\n     *  b c&#x27;\n    d\n    $ \n</code></pre>\nNo wildcards were expanded, spaces and quotes weren&#x27;t stripped, etc.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find in the standards doc (that you linked) anything that addresses this either way.')
