It doesn&#x27;t help that software development is so archaic right now. I would like to express just what is necessary for a certain problem, and not address the irrelevant aspects. For example, if I want to express an embarrassingly parallel algorithm, which does something embarrassingly simple, why do I have to drop down to C++11 to get it to run fast on iOS &#x2F; Apple Metal? Something is needed that is a superset of Mathematica and Isabelle to remove clutter. It is that clutter that makes parallel programming a mess.')
