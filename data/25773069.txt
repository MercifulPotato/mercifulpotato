I&#x27;ve heard two reasons for this; that was the flag used in the early 1900&#x27;s (the period where Main Street USA is set) and because it&#x27;s not an American Flag they do not need to be illuminated or taken down at night. That last part contradicts what was said above. While this fact comes up a lot, I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone spontaneously noticing or object to how they&#x27;re treated.<p>It may be a subtle political statement used by some, but I&#x27;m sure someone had done it with the 48-star flag. That&#x27;s more noticeable because the stars were laid out in a grid instead of a checkerboard.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.militarydisneytips.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;patriotic-disney&#x2F;walt-disney-theme-parks-american-flags&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.militarydisneytips.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;patriotic-disney&#x2F;wal...</a>')
