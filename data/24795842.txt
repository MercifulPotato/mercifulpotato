An open-source, modifiable, freely available, experimental OS that can run on both old and new &quot;smartphone&quot; computers.  With larger form factor computers the tradeoff has generally been less hardware support on the very newest ones.  Over time however the support for newer hardware generally increases as contributors have the chance to tinker with it.  Instead of losing performance from the same hardware, users generally gain performance over time.  Whatever one may think of this dynamic, it does allow for the longest possible use of hardware.<p>Tech companies should be shamed for the &quot;disposable&quot; computer culture they have put so much effort into creating.  It is possible to improve software without requiring new hardware. \nWith the prices Apple charges for hardware, there should not be any forced obsolescence.')
