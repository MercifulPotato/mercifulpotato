Item(by='rlpb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611754549, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927931, text='&gt; But don&#x27;t you want something more substantial and created with more craft?<p>No. My furniture is...part of the furniture. I care about it being practical. I don&#x27;t care about its heritage. IKEA quality is perfectly adequate for me, so I&#x27;m not inclined to pay for any more.<p>I also appreciate light furniture that can be moved easily. Furniture that is more &quot;substantial&quot; and made from real wood[1], for example, is far more of a pain for me.<p>[1] As opposed to chipboard; I don&#x27;t mean to imply that IKEA aren&#x27;t using trees.')
