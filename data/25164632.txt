Apple’s device lifetimes are much greater than <i>any</i> of their competitors.<p>I personally strongly value software freedom, and <i>do not think we can afford to let the current situation persist for all time</i>, but it pains me to see things like right to repair be tied in with the problems of the software ecology.  One seems like Luddism, and the other seems like a bedrock of a sane digital future, two things that don’t mix well.<p>One step which would seem to serve both of these goals, would be to require all devices that fit some general category of ‘general purpose computer’ to permit alternative operating systems to be installed.<p>But that has absolutely zero to do with breaking up Apple.  If we need rights, let’s actually say what they are.<p>Breaking companies up doesn’t create rights.<p>The null hypothesis for what would happen if you break up Apple is that Android would simply dominate, with no improvements over its current locked down state, which is admittedly <i>slightly</i> more free than Apple, but in no way resembles the utopia you describe.<p>We’d probably get Facebook and Amazon forks of Android gaining more traction this time around, but offering none of what you and I want in terms of freedom.')
