The higher the share price, the more interest they have to pay. Not just that, the harder the shares are to borrow, the more interest they have to pay. This creates a ticking clock. During the initial BYND squeeze, some people were being charged 100% APY.<p>Then of course as it goes up and they bump up against their personal (or their brokers&#x27; personal) risk tolerance, they&#x27;re forced by <i>them</i> to buy.')
