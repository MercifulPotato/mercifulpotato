See for example Arieh Kovler, 21 December 2020:<p><i>&quot;On January 6, armed Trumpist militias will be rallying in DC, at Trump&#x27;s orders. It&#x27;s highly likely that they&#x27;ll try to storm the Capitol after it certifies Joe Biden&#x27;s win. I don&#x27;t think this has sunk in yet.[...]\nTo be clear here, I don&#x27;t think the 3%ers, Proud Boys, Oathkeepers or boogaloo types are going to seize the Capitol. But some of them are going try. And people will die.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ariehkovler&#x2F;status&#x2F;1341016471795843080?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ariehkovler&#x2F;status&#x2F;1341016471795843080?s...</a><p>Don&#x27;t spin this into some borderline gas-lightning argument about letting more of these people run rampart on platforms, this is a result of not taking far-right extremism seriously. If these people faced the full force of the law and state like ISIS-propagandists do you would not see them try to storm (and succeed) to occupy a federal building.')
