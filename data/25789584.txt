Please be specific or we can&#x27;t have a meaningful discussion.<p>I use Bash a fair amount and I don&#x27;t consider it overly complicated as a shell. There are some rough edges in Unix, like handling spaces in directories, and I&#x27;m no fan of Bash as a scripting language, but I wouldn&#x27;t say the basic model of the Unix command-line interface is overly complicated.')
