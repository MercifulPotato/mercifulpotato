Item(by='wcarss', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603087005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822714, text='&gt; doesn&#x27;t Telegram have a satisfactory push-to-talk button that sends audio clips asynchronously?<p>Telegram does let you send audio! When I first started building heysync I was quite surprised to find out that WhatsApp&#x2F;Signal&#x2F;Telegram&#x2F;iMessage <i>all</i> support basic audio messages decently, but I didn&#x27;t know anyone who used them.<p>Heysync is a little different in that it sends automatic transcriptions alongside its audio snippets, to let you either read or listen at your leisure, and it puts audio messages right out in front in the app.<p>As rektide mentioned, most of those apps miss key features, like not being able to preview a message if you want to, and then they also mentioned that using &#x27;personal&#x27; communication tech with coworkers isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. Heysync is work oriented by being roughly IRC or slack-alike shaped in its features, i.e. channels, DMs, markdown+syntax highlighting, and so on.<p>I hope this isn&#x27;t excessively self-promotional! I&#x27;m pretty excited about this whole area. (Also, the downvote&#x27;s not me; I thought your suggestion and question were quite fair.)')
