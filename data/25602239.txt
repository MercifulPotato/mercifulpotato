Economically it would be fine: England is by far the biggest economy in the UK. There would be some losses: about 10 percent of the UK GDP, Scottish military bases, natural gas and oil resources, about 5 million people.<p>But Scotland produces only about 6 percent of the UK&#x27;s total exports. The vast majority of what it produces is &quot;exported&quot; to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (about £50 billion to the UK compared to £15 billion to the EU and £17 billion to the rest of the world). It also has a fiscal deficit that&#x27;s largely offset by the English taxpayer. Scotland is much more economically dependent on the UK than the UK is on Scotland.<p>Outside of the UK, Scotland may be a credible middle-ranking small country comparable to Czechia. It certainly could not afford to maintain its current level of public services. Without Scotland, the rest of the UK would remain one of the largest economies in the world.<p>(btw, Scotland was never an Imperial possession of British Empire. The Union with Scotland was peaceful, and largely in the interests of the Scots, who had succeeded in destroying their economy through mismanagement, unwise allegiances with the French, and unsuccessful attempts to build their own empire).')
