As you point out, more personalised UI, buttons, etc. can be more ergonomic and presumably productive. But then the problem with learning, teaching, and sharing arises.<p>I also see another problem: lock-in and loss of productivity in other environments. For this reason I prefer to stick to everything as vanilla as possible: so that I can use another computer or keyboard and it &quot;just works&quot; because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to anyway.')
