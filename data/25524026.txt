Item(by='webmobdev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608770585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521710, text='Just a feedback - As a developer, you are only encouraging Apple to gauge more money from developers like you by selling on App store, instead of boycotting it. Don&#x27;t add value to the app store by making your app available on it. I never buy anything from the App Store. I prefer to buy directly from the seller. If you are selling exclusively only through the Apple app store, you are not only going to lose customers but also sabotaging yourself.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly shortsighted.<p>I don&#x27;t know why anyone even bothers with the app store on the macOS (or other platforms). We have been doing fine without it on the desktop for decades now, and suddenly every developer is supposed to drink the kool-aid that PAYING corporates for the privilege of adding value to that platform by developing and distributing your wares on that platform is supposed to be a GREAT thing?')
