Rather it&#x27;s just an easy way to remember the characters. I have no idea of the history of those characters but it is funny that 王 means king and 玉 means ball and just happens to look like king with a mark on the lower half suggesting the kings balls and that &quot;ball under roof&quot; 宝 means treasure.')
