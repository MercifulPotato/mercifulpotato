It&#x27;s been known for a while that family and even their pets share a similar biome.[1]  There is enough oral-fecal contamination among family members that they all end up seeding each other (yes, yucky).<p>Do we really need to feed newborns their mother&#x27;s feces?  I mean, how much feces would a newborn be exposed to during a vagina birth?  They certainly aren&#x27;t ingesting grams of fecal material.<p>And the only thing this seemed to prove is that you can match the baby&#x27;s biome.  The biggest question is &quot;does that matter?&quot;.  Sure, there have been some studies showing a <i>correlation</i> in biome and various diseases, but not hard, conclusive data.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3628085&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3628085&#x2F;</a>')
