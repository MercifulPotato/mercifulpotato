Hell, the travel time Google is showing from Squaw <i>right now</i> is 3 hours and 9 minutes.<p>I do agree that&#x27;s atypical.  But... so what?  &quot;Correct&quot; the parent&#x27;s statement to &quot;4 hours&quot; and the argument is just as valid.  Seems like you&#x27;re nitpicking and missing the forest for the trees.')
