The Dell XPS Developer Edition is the same hardware as the Windows version, just with Ubuntu preinstalled. And Dell has upstreamed the drivers. Similar with Lenovo hardware, except  IIUC they haven’t started shipping Linux preinstalled yet, you just buy a normal Thinkpad and install your distro of choice.
