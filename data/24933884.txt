But we can&#x27;t.&quot; So Mueller has admitted that Trump obstructed his investigation, and several members in Trump&#x27;s circle have gone to jail for _lying to the FBI_.<p>Not to mention the fact that Mueller&#x27;s investigation clearly found that Trump&#x27;s campaign was in contact with Russian agents, knew they favored Trump&#x27;s campaign, and &quot;welcomed&quot; their help (i.e., foreign interference). This is what the public understands as &quot;collusion&quot;. However, &quot;collusion&quot; is not a legal term, &quot;conspiracy&quot; is and has a higher bar of proof. So yes, Trump colluded with Russia, we just couldn&#x27;t prove that they explicitly conspired since Trump&#x27;s circle lied for him.')
