Item(by='frederikvs', descendants=None, kids=[25556568], score=None, time=1609098282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552884, text='Regarding the two towers : if you look at the E-ship 1 [0] you&#x27;ll see 4 towers - 2 in the front, 2 in the rear. There are no towers in the middle, probably because that area is intended for cargo.<p>I presume there is also a minimum distance they need to be separated - if you look at some of the illustrations of the Magnus effect [1], you&#x27;ll see a turbulent region downwind of the tower. Another tower in this turbulent region won&#x27;t work as intended.<p>This is pure speculation on my part, but perhaps most ships simply aren&#x27;t wide enough to have two towers side by side (the E-ship 1 being an exception). That, and wanting to use most of the ship for cargo, explains why most ships only have 2 towers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;E-Ship_1#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Bateau_enercon_P9240983_part.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;E-Ship_1#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Bateau_en...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magnus_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magnus_effect</a>')
