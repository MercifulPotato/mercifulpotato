Apple has supported some OSS projects via hardware donations, I&#x27;m not sure if Go benefitted, but Docker has.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think the M1 is any more closed than Intel. It&#x27;s a CPU core owned by a corporation. You can&#x27;t license either design for personal or commercial use. If you are using x86 you are lining Intel&#x27;s pockets (and likely Microsoft&#x27;s). If you are using M1, you are lining Apple&#x27;s pockets.')
