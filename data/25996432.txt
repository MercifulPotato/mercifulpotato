They promote unkindness by rewarding conflict and hostility, distribute disinformation rapidly, and algorithmically promote polarization. The only way to solve this problem is to make something better.<p>Telepath is founded by a team that brings together decades of experience building social products. This isn’t another boring SaaS startup — we’re making a consumer internet product that people really love. Expect to work with a tight-knit team, to love your job, and to have the opportunity to earn a significant equity stake in an exciting early stage company. You won’t be a cog in a machine — you’ll own your own projects and be able to make meaningful contributions as a part of a highly creative and inclusive process.<p>We’re committed to diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our product and company and especially in our hiring.<p>---------------------------------<p>Roles:<p>- Software Engineer: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2MIA51S" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2MIA51S</a><p>- Software Engineer, iOS: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;.bit.ly&#x2F;39DVX7B" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;.bit.ly&#x2F;39DVX7B</a><p>- Software Engineer, Android: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;.bit.ly&#x2F;3recfdq" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;.bit.ly&#x2F;3recfdq</a><p>- QA Associate: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;.bit.ly&#x2F;3rdVVJu" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;.bit.ly&#x2F;3rdVVJu</a><p>If interested, send your resume to careers@telepath.com and mention this thread.')
