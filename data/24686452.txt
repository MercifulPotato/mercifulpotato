I don&#x27;t know much about the religious issue at hand either, but the possibility of getting fined 500â‚¬ for accusing people of paedophilia if your claim does not hold does not strike me as such horrendous. Isn&#x27;t this slander in the US and illegal as well?<p>How is Germany on par with the countries you listed? You may not disturb public peace with speech and not insult people. Example is a dude who printed &quot;The Holy Quran&quot; on toilet paper. Nothing wrong with enforcing human decency via the law. Such insults is also literally what Nazis did in the first stage of the holocaust. Looking at the countries this is supposed to be on par with: Yemen uses blasphemy laws to imprison establishment enemies. Oman is not even on the list. Turkey is extra ironic because there was a comedian who made a parody of the Turkish government and Germany had a diplomatic crisis because Germany <i>refused</i> to do something against it (obv. totally on par). Myanmar put a guy in jail for wearing Buddha headphones. Indonesia&#x27;s mention is so brief I guess you could say the law sounds similar.<p>Still not seeing the slope, sorry...')
