We don&#x27;t have civil discourse anymore...people just yell and call people names.  You don&#x27;t like what the other person says they are a &quot;libtard&quot;...or a &quot;racist&quot;.  You don&#x27;t like what they are doing online, get them kicked off or dox them to your friends.  Justify online bullying like it&#x27;s a sport.
