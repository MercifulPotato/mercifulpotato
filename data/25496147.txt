But shooting manual on a DSLR is not the panacea. You only need manual mode in certain situations. Heck, I read pros like David Alan Harvey uses full auto setting on his camera sometimes (probably a lot of other pros too).  On my iPhone 12, I have exposure compensation on the main camera app. And that is good enough as well.')
