Also, you have an inclusion of the scalars, which is x ⇒ (x, 0, 0, 0). And yeah, G^2 can&#x27;t be projected back onto R^2 without losing a lot of information.<p>&gt; what does a vector in G^2 actually represent?<p>If you can write a multivector x as the wedge product of k independent vectors (or equivalently, the geometric product of k orthogonal vectors), then x is called a k-blade. In this case, x has a very clear geometric interpretation:<p>* the magnitude of x is the volume of the parallelotope spanned by the vectors.<p>* the &quot;direction&quot; of x corresponds to the space spanned by the vectors — in concrete terms, that space is the set of vectors in R^2 that the map (v ⇒ v ∧ x) takes to zero.<p>* the &quot;direction&quot; also gives an orientation of the subspace. Orientations are defined indirectly: if you have two blades representing the same space, then they must be scalar multiples of one another. If that scaling factor is <i>positive</i>, then they have the same orientation, and if it is <i>negative</i>, then they have opposing orientations.<p>These three pieces of information are enough to uniquely identify x. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure how to go from there to interpreting other multivectors, which are sums of blades.<p>&gt; If so, then in R^3 xy, xz any yz represent rotations in the respective planes?<p>Yes, xy represents rotation on the xy plane, as long as you apply it as described in the article.<p>&gt; Which leaves a bonus puzzle: what does (multiplying with) xyz represent?<p>This one should be fairly easy to prove: it represents a kind of dualization, in which the space represented by mi = mxyz is the orthogonal complement of the space represented by m.')
