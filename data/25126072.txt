To give you an anecdote - I got a ThinkPad T430s and it made my work feel 10x faster(Java EE development in 2012). I got my next ThinPad P51s in 2017 - an it was just one huge disappointment. It felt like Intel was stepping back. I now have ThinkPad P1 and computing power is still just OK, though still better than the U class i7 in P51s.<p>I&#x27;ll be happy to knock Apple for marketing BS(&quot;3 times faster&quot;, etc). But Intel has shown that they just need to crumble. I hope that my next laptop is not using Intel&#x27;s ISA or cores.')
