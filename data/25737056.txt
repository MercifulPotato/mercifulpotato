Together they publish 1-2 articles each day, because that&#x27;s how much news there is. There&#x27;s really no reason to have the local dailies like the SF Chronicle, the only major-city newspaper to my knowledge to have been openly mocked in a famous movie, or the SJ Mercury News and the other papers of the Bay Area News Group, a Denver company that hasn&#x27;t printed anything worth reading in the past decade.')
