The first was replaced under warranty (and the trackpad was also replaced as it had been slightly bent).<p>The laptop is now out of warranty, so I contacted Dell to see about a replacement battery.  &quot;Sorry, we don&#x27;t support laptops more than 4 years old&quot; was the response.  The support person suggested I source a replacement battery on Ebay and find a local laptop repair place to do the swap.<p>I deliberately chose to purchase a high spec (for the time), expensive laptop so it would have good longevity and previously I have had good support from Dell.  Seriously disappointed by Dell&#x27;s response this time.<p>Will be giving careful consideration to repair-ability and long term support before making another laptop purchase.')
