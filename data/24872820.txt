I see criticism of the culture that focuses on stealing, copying, and fine tuning over macro innovations.  This is not based in race or genetics, but in the choice by the people how they wish to behave.  This is tied in with the atrocious human rights abuse, which makes it seem the problem is undervaluing of the individual human mind, in favor of achieving national objectives at the expense of individuals.  Some say this is just part of the national character, but historically it is not.  There is a broad range of thought in Chinese history, and while the collectivism has become dominant, it is by no means the only nor most effective Chinese worldview.')
