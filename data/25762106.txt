Let me see if there&#x27;s a solid source for that... OK, here&#x27;s the American College of Surgeons fact sheet - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facs.org&#x2F;~&#x2F;media&#x2F;files&#x2F;education&#x2F;patient%20ed&#x2F;colonoscopy.ashx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facs.org&#x2F;~&#x2F;media&#x2F;files&#x2F;education&#x2F;patient%20ed&#x2F;co...</a><p>Unambiguously stating that up to 90% of polyps or the tumors they grow into can be detected and removed. Also that lifetime risk of these cancers is 4.5%, versus a low risk of complications from the procedure. Compare to much lower detection rates for non-invasive procedures, and note that a positive from a FIT or FOBT will get you a referral for... a colonoscopy.<p>I don&#x27;t have any expertise here, only marginal interest, and hoping like hell that it always stays that way. But it&#x27;s not comforting to read that the odds of a serious horror show are higher than flipping a coin and getting heads 5 times in a row. Seems unlikely but do you want to bet your life on it?<p>Also not comforting to see the low rate of detection for the lab tests. FOBT misses 2 to 4 out of 10. FIT misses 97% of advanced cancer? That must be a typo. Checking... &quot;FIT has been extensively evaluated for screening, with sensitivity estimates of a single low-threshold FIT for CRC approaching 90%.&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gut.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;68&#x2F;9&#x2F;1642" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gut.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;68&#x2F;9&#x2F;1642</a>) But of course, that&#x27;s once you have something that bleeds. The scope finds those earlier.<p>All very unnerving. A lot depends on the goal: catch your own cancer early, which suggests getting a scope early, or increase detection broadly among a population, which suggests focusing on easy-to-take tests that more people complete.')
