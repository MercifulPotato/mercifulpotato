Item(by='astrobe_', descendants=None, kids=[25014778], score=None, time=1604743205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012747, text='&gt; This is exactly it - it&#x27;s just genre bickering<p>Not always. Genres and categories are useful to describe what <i>it is like</i> without sharing precise knowledge (i.e. finding an example that the person you talk with also knows).<p>I don&#x27;t know what the sub-categorization argument is, but I kind of understand that people want to be a bit more precise. For instance, in the &quot;object-oriented&quot; category it is useful to distinguish &quot;class-based&quot; from &quot;prototype-based&quot;.<p>To me, the lack of a commonly accepted definition of &quot;roguelike&quot; is a bit annoying because the definition of the term tends to become more and more fuzzy over time, to the point that the term will eventually become useless as a communication medium. So in my opinion, a little bit of gatekeeping is good.')
