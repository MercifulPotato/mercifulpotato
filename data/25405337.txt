More importantly, if you don&#x27;t keep up a good pace on a clear country road with good visibility where the speed limit is 60mph, they won&#x27;t have confidence in your riding at higher speeds, and they know - as all bikers know - that you will almost certainly spend a good chunk of your riding career at higher speeds on country roads.')
