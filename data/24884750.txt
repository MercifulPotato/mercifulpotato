As I understand, the big idea is that tests can only show a program is faulty, not that it’s correct. On the other hand mathematical proofs can actually prove your program is correct.<p>That said I’ve never used it myself but I know a close-knit community of extremely smart mathematicians&#x2F;programmers using it. It’s certainly a language with huge potential. I plan to play with it &#x2F; learn it some day.')
