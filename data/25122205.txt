One in every 200 people dying would mean most of us have a close connection to a couple of victims.<p>And there&#x27;s already more dead from covid-19 in the US than casualties during the Vietnam War. Granted, more elderly people than young, but it&#x27;s still a bit difficult to accept that it&#x27;s insignificant.<p>Add to this what could happen with an exponential surge, with icus being over-run - and a) you&#x27;d end up being more likely to die from other causes, like a traffic accident - and b) many of the current covid-19 survivors would end up as casualties.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5843349&#x2F;coronavirus-death-toll-100000&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5843349&#x2F;coronavirus-death-toll-100000&#x2F;</a>')
