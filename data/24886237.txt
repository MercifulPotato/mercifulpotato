I&#x27;ve also recently ditched my arch+awesome wm box for a mac.<p>I&#x27;m blown away by the features, speed of code completion, tooling, and great built-in terminals. These&#x27;s were all the features I&#x27;ve wanted for a while but always seemed kind of clunky in vim plugins (I didn&#x27;t look too hard :)). I&#x27;m still not a fan of the memory footprint but I have plenty of it.<p>I&#x27;m not an embedded guy, but Makefiles are super versatile, I still use them to automate everything from building large latex docs to trivial git commits. I consider Make one of the greatest pieces of free software developed.')
