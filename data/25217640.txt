All of the changes in the Quillette article were similarly announced by the NYT at the time they were made, though as smaller changes didn&#x27;t get their own frontpage articles.<p>As the 1619 project was itself described as an &quot;ongoing&quot; project it&#x27;s bizarre and unusual for people to complain about it being corrected. That&#x27;s the writing process: draft, and re-draft as necessary based on feedback re grammar, language, factual errors, etc.<p>In fact your complaint seems to be that the NYT corrects its articles on its website, <i>which is a good thing.</i> If you want archival copies of the incorrect versions, you can access those through other means, such as through databases like Lexis Nexis or through hard copies of the paper.')
