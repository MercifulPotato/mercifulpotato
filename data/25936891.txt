The Obama story was the same: Hope and Change Populism.<p>Trump is business establishment through and through and has managed to wake a populist movement for his own enrichment.<p>He (and his sycophantic cronies) were (and continue to be) very much part of the “I got mine” greed establishment.<p>Instead of answering to the Population, it seems that Trump and his crew care only for self-enrichment. How he managed to capture the imagination of a Populist movement is indication of the total lack of alternatives.')
