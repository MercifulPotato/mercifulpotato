Mainly just members of the RIAA.<p>Now - I have some sympathy for that view - I&#x27;d also like to get paid, and while I think the RIAA has little real value in the world, some of it&#x27;s members certainly are working on the marketing and promotion front.<p>That said, I use many of these downloading services to save conference talks from youtube.  So they&#x27;re attacking a service I use legally for a useful purpose.  At some point, ethically, I start to lose ANY sympathy for them as an organization.<p>Basically - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZNS7IqmZBbA&amp;has_verified=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZNS7IqmZBbA&amp;has_verified=1</a>')
