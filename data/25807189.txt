It is such a better experience. If any device started taking over it&#x27;s DNS in a way I couldn&#x27;t override, and I had reason to care, I would stop using it. PiHole is already a meh solution.<p>My two primary apps on my Shield are SmartTubeTV and Kodi. I won&#x27;t pay for YouTube when they force bundle it with other services I don&#x27;t want. The alternative of ads has gotten to ridiculous levels, and then the ads in the video from them on top. SponsorBlock is another game changer. Sadly it isn&#x27;t in an AndroidTV app yet.<p>On my phone it is Vanced all the way for YouTube, and it does have SponsorBlock.')
