If you only test your system in as close to production state as possible, you are never going to encounter stress states that would only very rarely appear in production. Seeing how your components independently deal with less ideal components in the system can tell you a lot about how they might handle rare but bad cases in production, and allow you to over engineer them a bit more to avoid that.<p>&gt; which makes it even more likely that introducing never-used-in-production behaviour unexpectedly perturbs the system.<p>Isn’t that a good thing? Isn’t the goal to deal with the unexpected in the first case?')
