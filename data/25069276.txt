Think Angular 9 was when templates got real type checking, but reading the documents it&#x27;s still not clear to me what&#x27;s enabled by default. Whereas with my react projects, if I use TypeScript and use the right file extensions, then everything is type checked, end of story.<p>I also didn&#x27;t like using observables with Angular to fetch&#x2F;send data to API&#x27;s. Not everything is an event stream, why can&#x27;t we use the right tool for the job?')
