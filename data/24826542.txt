I don&#x27;t know when (if) the curve runs out on that process, but we have a planet&#x27;s worth of resources to bring to bear on the problem, as long as someone&#x27;s willing to keep paying to upgrade the transceivers (and it&#x27;s work that pays some nice side dividends in terms of being a convenient toy problem for testing new radio tech).<p>Since we know exactly what we&#x27;re looking for and exactly where it should be, we have all kinds of neat radio tools to bring to bear on sampling a faint signal from interstellar noise.')
