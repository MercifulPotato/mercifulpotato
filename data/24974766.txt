You should install SmartLook, FullStory, or similar to watch users. Qualitative feedback beats quantitative b&#x2F;c your raw numbers are too low to be useful.<p>2. Identify key points in the customer journey when you want to collect feedback.  For B2B SaaS I ask for feedback via email at these stages:<p>- When a customer signs up for a trial<p>- When a customer converts to a paying sub<p>- When a customer doesn&#x27;t convert<p>- After 1-2 months of paying<p>- When a customer churns<p>First I&#x27;ll make sure that I get system-generated emails when these events happen so I can send them manually.<p>I&#x27;ll eventually automate sending these emails once volume gets too high.  I&#x27;ll automate them by sending from our app or from a tool like UserList or Intercom.<p>And when I get feedback I centralize in the tool I&#x27;m building (www.savio.io) and use it to prioritize what to build next.')
