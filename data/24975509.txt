Now, every part of the split up monolith has it&#x27;s own self contained data store tailored to what is appropriate for that particular thing. (some use MariaDB, others Redis etc etc)<p>* developing, building, testing and deploying took ages. Eg if I only needed to capture some new detail about a business partner user (eg their mfa preference app vs sms) I would still have to do deal with the unwieldy monolith. Now, I can do it in the dedicated business partner user service, which is much easier and faster.<p>* the whole monolith, including business partner facing operations, could go down because of issues to do with completely unrelated, non critical things like eg internal staff vacation hours.<p>I could go on.<p>As for the different services I described, if most of the callers did need both pieces of data it would have made sense to combine them into a single service. But, overwhelmingly, callers are interested in one piece of data or the other, and the load profile, tolerance for staleness in caching etc etc for each of the two services are vastly, vastly different. This is why we chose to split the two into different services.<p>The few callers that do need to obtain both pieces of data just make concurrent calls to both and them zip them into a single result.')
