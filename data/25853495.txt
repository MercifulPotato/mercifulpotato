I&#x27;ve been implementing the Event Stream architecture recently in Go and dealing within unwinding errors is a pain in the arse. Do I just repeat the event and hope it works next time? Is there something wrong with the event that means it&#x27;ll never work? Do I restart the database server because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong?<p>There&#x27;s this saying that the AA has: &quot;wherever you go, there you are&quot;. It&#x27;s about &quot;doing a geographic&quot; - thinking that moving city&#x2F;country&#x2F;continent will change your circumstances and therefore change you. It&#x27;s false, because no matter where we move we&#x27;re still the same person so we&#x27;ll still face the same problems. Wherever we go, there we are.<p>I think programmers have the same dynamic - if I change my language, I won&#x27;t make the same errors as I&#x27;m making here. Somehow this new language will make me a better programmer because x or y.<p>I find this difficult to resist. But I also realise its falsehood - I will not be a better programmer in Rust or Lisp than I am in Go. In fact, I have a much better chance of being a better programmer if I drill down in Go and unlearn some problems and relearn some patterns and generally stop learning syntax and start learning deep shit.<p>Go has a convention on error handling. It may not be ideal. But it&#x27;s there for a reason, and while we can argue with the reason, it&#x27;s a valid reason. As a Go programmer, I can fight it and basically reject the language, or I can adopt it and get deeper. I choose that.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t dream of how much better my life would be if I chose Rust or LISP instead. And yes, I know that all languages have their problems, and a year after learning LISP I wouldn&#x27;t be writing some infuriated blog post on how EMACS does this weird shit that takes 30s to resolve on a remote server. But don&#x27;t we all dream of that promised land?')
