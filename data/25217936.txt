Item(by='klibertp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606377964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207104, text='&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen many websites that match the depth and completeness of books yet.<p>Give it time. We&#x27;re not even one generation into web as a viable knowledge distribution platform. Authors who wrote books for their entire lives are not going to learn to create good presentations overnight, if at all. That&#x27;s ok, the following generations, native to interactive, engaging, immersive ways of presenting knowledge, will fill that gap with time.<p>The potential of the medium, however, is incredible and easily visible today. Better Explained is one of the greatest examples (in my experience). It will only get better from now on. Flat text won&#x27;t ever disappear, I hope, as there are many subjects where text <i>is</i> the most suitable way of presenting knowledge, like in liberal arts. Most of science, however, will move to interactive presentations, simply because the time&#x2F;knowledge gained ratio is much better in this case.')
