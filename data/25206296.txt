I think picking up a now last gen Mac Mini as a HTPC would be sweet. Upgraded RAM could make it a home server beast. I don&#x27;t see Apple abandoning the Intel support until at least Q1 2023, and even then, the types of stuff I would use it for in a HTPC setup would still be compatible well past then (unless some new video codec or something comes out that isn&#x27;t compatible? Idk how those work).')
