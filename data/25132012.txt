PHP-based, but has a good plugin system and does some pre-processing prior to sending in a way that improves deliverability.<p>It&#x27;s not a speed demon out of the box with default settings, but there&#x27;s a lot of documentation on how to improve performance. Touble-free API integration with most of the big API-driven services like SES, Mailgun, etc., and works well with self-hosted SMTP too.<p>It&#x27;s available on (sigh) Code Canyon.<p>(Disclaimer: I own a few licenses and use Mailwizz to send about 1-1.5 million emails a month, but I don&#x27;t get anything for saying I like the product.)')
