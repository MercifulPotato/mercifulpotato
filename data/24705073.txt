Keyboard typing actually involves more backspacing over mistakes than Dragon does. Dragon makes 120-200+ wpm effortless whereas 100+ wpm on keyboard requires concentration and is fatiguing. Dragon alas only runs on Windows but it works great inside a VirtualBox VM on Linux and Mac. (The VM setup is a major time commitment though.)')
