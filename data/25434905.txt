Most started studying (or working on) ML before the Deep Learning craze took off. All in all, these guys have at least a decade of solid experience - but in return, know a metric ton of classic ML &#x2F; stats &#x2F; grad. level math &#x2F; etc. by heart.<p>Obviously, in probably most cases, one can&#x27;t compress 10 years of hard work experience into 1-2 years, even though that&#x27;s what a lot of these &quot;roadmaps&quot; seem to promise.<p>Makes me wonder if the internet-world of deep learning is filled with savants that are able to catch up with decades of research and best-practices in only couple of years, or if these are people that are really, really specialized in some niche application of DL.')
