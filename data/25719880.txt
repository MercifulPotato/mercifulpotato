Item(by='kuzimoto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610312997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708157, text='&gt; That’s a very subjective chart<p>Can you explain? On the site:<p>&gt; The AllSides Media Bias Chart is more comprehensive in its methodology than any other media bias chart on the Web. While other media bias charts show you the subjective opinion of the one person who made it, our ratings are based based on multipartisan, scientific analysis.<p>&gt; and by their own admission doesn’t even try to compare for honesty or credibility<p>I don&#x27;t think this matters in the context of the point I was making.<p>&gt; Most of the two R columns routinely run fake or highly selective coverage<p>Hmm, so this further reduces the number of quality right-leaning sources. Seems to further prove my point. Remember, the chart shows sites with the most traffic.<p>&gt; There is an enormous difference between an outlet like the New Yorker, which is definitely liberal but also fiercely committed to fact checking, and outlets like Newsmax or The American Conservative which are proudly movement conservatives first and journalists second, if at all.<p>Maybe, but it doesn&#x27;t matter in the context of my point. Also, if they are clear about their biases it shouldn&#x27;t matter, unless presenting outright lies. Many left-leaning sources try to come off like they are objective. Also:<p>&gt; A leading New Yorker writer omits crucial facts to run interference for Joe Biden against serious allegations of corruption in Ukraine, writes Joe Lauria. [0]<p>Many left-leaning sources were also guilty of this (twitter going so far as take down the tweet from the NY Post as &quot;hacked information&quot; even though there was zero evidence this was the case, and Facebook de-prioritizing shared link of the same).<p>This is my opinion and based around some examples I&#x27;ve seen, but I believe that conservative sources have a tougher time making money, because people will attack their ad-partners for supporting those companies. I&#x27;d like to see where this happens to left-leaning sources.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consortiumnews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;the-new-yorkers-partisan-attempt-to-refute-its-claim-of-partisan-disinformation-on-biden-and-ukraine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consortiumnews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;the-new-yorkers-partis...</a>')
