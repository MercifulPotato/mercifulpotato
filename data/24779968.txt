And that one wasn&#x27;t even a burst of power it was a continuous current (admittedly one with enough to power a small city).<p>Of course anything with that much energy is possibly violent, but at least a flywheel is easy to control. I haven&#x27;t the faintest idea what that amount of electromagnetic energy would do, I&#x27;m not sure I want to find out.<p>At the very least I suspect you&#x27;ll find that electromagnetic current also has angular momentum at those scales.')
