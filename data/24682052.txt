From their programming of new AND old films, to their special events, to their creativity in presentation.<p>There’s a lot of little touches that really make a difference. As you wait in the theater for the show to start they play purpose-made 30 minute pre-rolls that relate to the film you’re about to watch. These can include videos that flesh-out or explain the lore of the story you’re about to watch, funny Youtube clips of home-made skits based around the film’s IP, or bizarre film-nerd deep cuts that you would never see unless you know the type of person who collects them (Turkish Spiderman comes to mind).<p>All of this replaces the teeth-grindingly irritating commercial reels that play in most theaters while you wait. The kind with shitty purpose-made “Hollywood Insider” trivia clips, or “unscramble the celebrity name” quizzes. The difference that it makes to not have to endure these while you wait for the movie is significantly more enjoyable.')
