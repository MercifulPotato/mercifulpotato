When used right it is a very personalized practice tool that can help with quite high-level ideas.<p>I wouldn’t fx. make flashcards for an entire API — instead I would focus on the concepts and features that are important for what I am doing. You can make it about “exactly” what you want to practice and remember.<p>Think of it more as a collection of personal notes with build in recall practice, rather than remembering scores of “random” facts.')
