This dangerous position that it&#x27;s OK or even virtuous to be racist towards white people keeps popping up in places it shouldn&#x27;t, and they keep getting what they want. Yes, we can simply treat the entire academic liberal arts as fundamentally toxic and poisoned by this kind of racial hatred, but that won&#x27;t stop it spreading short of shutting down their funding completely. Even then they&#x27;d just get hired by places culturally allied to them.<p>This sort of story has happened many times before, it&#x27;s just an unusually clear example. Senti Sojwal could easily be prosecuted for this, as there are laws against racism and she openly admits that she is discriminating against white women, but of course she won&#x27;t be. The only serious way to put a lid on this would be for Trump to win and then to start systematically prosecuting academics and companies who ban white people from things, under racism laws. Once a bunch of them have lost a lot of money or worse, the actual legal definition of racism might start being respected again.')
