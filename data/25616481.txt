It&#x27;s blazing fast (Google Maps aren&#x27;t), and the color scheme is very clear. When I want to explore some random place on Earth (that uses a writing system I can actually read) I always use OSM.<p>Google Maps (or its local competitors) are great for spatial searches (ATMs in the area, shops in the area) and routing.<p>Finally, Wikimapia is great for virtual urban exploration. If you saw an abandoned building or warehouse, or found a suspicious bald spot in the middle of the forest when using OSM or Google Maps, the best place to learn about it is Wikimapia.')
