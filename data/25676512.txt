This leaves open the possibility that private firms can legally &quot;censor&quot; people, while also restricting Congress&#x27;s ability to write legislation that restricts speech.<p>I am not sure how relevant it is that a service is &quot;paid,&quot; or &quot;unpaid.&quot; What really matters is whether all parties are dealing with each other voluntarily and not under any form of coercion. As far as I know, by making your Facebook account, you agree to have your speech moderated under their discretion. You do not <i>have</i> to make a Facebook account, after all, and since Facebook is not the only game in town, I do not really see how it can be called a utility. This also disqualifies it from being an example of a public square.')
