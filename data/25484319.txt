So unsure if it&#x27;s a good place for discussion here. It would be nice if articles like the submitted one were moderated better. Feels like HN takes a stance of ignoring these gender topics or flagging them and while being more defensive of other non-gender topics that are controversial.<p>Puberty blockers are used for other medical issues and aren&#x27;t considered dangerous or life damaging. Anyway this topic is somewhat meaningful to me because I really don&#x27;t think people know how truly valuable it can be for someone to stall puberty when they desire to.<p>I find it appalling that cis society is quick to make sure no confused cis kid is harmed while ignoring trans kids that end up permanently disfigured by their voice &amp; appearance from the wrong puberty. It&#x27;s basically comparable to a cis kid having the wrong hormones damaging their body through puberty like a boy growing breasts and people just shrug their shoulders when it&#x27;s a trans kid.<p>For context I went through the wrong puberty (I&#x27;m only 30 years old) and recently have been diagnosed with cancer. I&#x27;m choosing not to get treatment for the cancer and so I can get Medical Assistance in Dying because Gender Dysphoria sucks while all surgeries to possibly fix voice or appearance is like putting a downpayment for a house. Also was disowned by parents and struggled through university years because of constant bullying. Anyway I really hope people can take the time to consider that some kids truly know they&#x27;re trans and it&#x27;s not a fad to them.')
