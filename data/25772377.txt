Item(by='xyzelement', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610601176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766884, text='This is a pretty simple topic if you have a good understanding of what enabled developers to pull in large comps, and what kinds of employers pay such comps. I comment on comp threads on HN frequently and don&#x27;t want to rehash my entire advice, but I can illustrate one example that can be generalized to Europe and America.<p>Consider two hypothetical employers:<p>Employer 1:\n- We want to hire only the best.\n- We expect people to care about the company and act like owners.\n- We expect people to flex in and out of different roles.\n- We fire underperformers.<p>Employer 2:\n- We state exact technical qualifications for our roles.\n- We hire anyone who adequately meets the qualifications.\n- We don&#x27;t expect people to do anything not in the job description.\n- We don&#x27;t expect people to care about the company, it&#x27;s just a job.\n- We never fire anyone.<p>I hope it&#x27;s clear that you can make a lot more money at #1 than #2. #1 may be a FAANG and #2 may be your state&#x27;s Motor Vehicles department. I also hope it&#x27;s clear that #2 sounds very mainstream European in its attitude towards work while #1 oozes American exceptionalism.<p>In short, there&#x27;s no way to raise comp without employers competing for talent but that would basically mean a complete change in employer&#x2F;employee expectations.<p>So what happens to European developers who are good&#x2F;aggressive enough to work for a place like #1? They find it in London and New York.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I am a dual EU&#x2F;US citizen living in NYC, and my previous job took me a lot to our London office which was primarily staffed with European developers who left Europe exactly for the reasons I described.')
