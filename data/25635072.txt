It&#x27;s the same network effect that protects Microsoft or Google or Facebook or even Nike: changing peoples&#x27; behavior is <i>hard</i>, and in general beyond the resources of new entrants unless the incumbent <i>really</i> screws up.<p>(Arguably, Bitcoin&#x27;s rise is precisely because of the incumbent really screwing up.  If someone created a new currency in the 1970s or 1990s - and people did - folks would laugh at them.  It&#x27;s only because trust in the government and mainstream financial system is so low - and the Fed continues to print trillions of dollars to paper that over - that Bitcoin has gained a foothold.)<p>&quot;If we collectively wanted to...&quot; is never an answer.  People don&#x27;t make collective decisions, they make individual ones.  Adoption requires convincing lots of people, individually, that your new solution is better.  You can get a boost from peer pressure, but you have to start the flywheel going yourself.')
