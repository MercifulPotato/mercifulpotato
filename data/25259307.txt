This means that each register, cache, decode unit, etc. is more effective per unit area &amp; time. Presumably, this is how the x86 chips have been keeping up with fewer elements in terms of absolute # of instructions optimized for. The obvious trade-off being the decode complexity and all the extra area that requires. One may argue that this is a worthwhile trade-off, considering the aggregate die layout (i.e. one big complicated area vs thousands of distributed &amp; semi-complicated areas) and economics of semiconductor manufacturing (defect density wrt aggregate die size).')
