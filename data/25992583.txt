This is a golden opportunity for them to reset their platform and change their brand in the world.<p>Large businesses don&#x27;t get these kind of opportunities often and this is something, I thought, they will seize. I really thought they will build security&#x2F;privacy into their platform and weed things out. They could have gone to a paid model in some cases and doubled down on privacy in others. They would have lost revenue in the short term but would be great in the long term.<p>However, they are doubling down on the catering to fear mongering, cult marketing type things and kicking and screaming without much to show.')
