Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605504417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106409, text='&gt; Basically everything uses an ARM CPU these days, not just tablets and phones, but microwaves, TVs, projectors, refrigerators, ovens, 3D printers...<p>Most of these things are not on bleeding edge 5nm or 7nm process, though.  Most microcontrollers are more like 90nm (e.g. STM32 up to F7 is 90nm; STM32H7 is 40nm... many smaller micros of the M0 variety are even 180nm...)<p>Basically, if you&#x27;re not video processing, or a real computing device, or something power sensitive, 90nm is still a pretty sweet place to be-- ~$300k for a mask set, easy to have 5V tolerant I&#x2F;O if that&#x27;s something you need, high likelihood of common I&#x2F;O and core voltage, &amp;c.')
