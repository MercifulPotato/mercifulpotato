You don&#x27;t see reporters attempt to extrapolate dollar returns from percentage ones when percentage ones are all that are available; even if dollar returns might make a better headline like you claim. A headline with an extrapolated percentage return would have to be phrased in an awkward manner like &quot;could be down as much as&quot; and an editor is not going to greenlight that. This isn&#x27;t even broaching the subject of gross vs net percentage returns which isn&#x27;t possible to succinctly address in a mere headline.')
