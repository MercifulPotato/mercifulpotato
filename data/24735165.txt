Item(by='sharkweek', descendants=None, kids=[24736146, 24735243], score=None, time=1602283446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735025, text='A few fun side notes about bank robberies.<p>I used to be a bank teller and we were instructed under no uncertain terms to hand over whatever we had and enjoy a week of paid vacation to recover from any potential trauma suffered.<p>The bank I worked for had a corporate security team who wouldn’t even stop their lunch break to review one isolated robbery, instead they’d look for serial cases, or occasionally assess how likely it was that it had any “inside job” elements if the robbery didn’t fall within standard profiles.<p>The actual “vault” in most branches is barely bigger than a high school locker inside the room behind the big metal door. Most everything else kept behind that huge metal door is administrative or customer related documents (arguably worth more than the cash itself!).<p>Lastly, about once a week, I was tasked with filling the ATMs for a branch that was in a downtown office building lobby. The ATMs were in a wall and had a little secret door that I’d access to audit the machines and count the money I’d refill them with. Each machine could hold 200k or so and there were two of them but there was no real clear way to get the $400,000 from our secured vault to the machines without armed security or something. In order to avoid having to order an escort every time, we’d just load the cash into a printer paper box and stealthily walk it across the lobby like I was just carrying actual printer paper (insert your federal reserve jokes here).<p>It’d take 2-3 hours to audit and refill the machines, meaning I would have had a nice head start if I had the guts and gray morality to make a run for it.')
