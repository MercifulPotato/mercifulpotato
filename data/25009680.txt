(I would be inclined to say that mothers, even scientist mothers, should be given sufficient parental leave, and that this should be adjusted for in all hiring processes.)<p>But I did frequently wear both our babies in a sling during lots of other activities. Hiking, cross country skiing, strolling around town, doing small projects around the house, or just sitting down to read a book, are all really nice activities to do while wearing baby. All parents should try it. It&#x27;s a closeness to your baby that is hard to convey if you haven&#x27;t experienced it.')
