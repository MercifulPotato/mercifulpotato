If I may piggyback, one of the things that’s been important in my own development (personal, social, professional) is to recognize where my lack of confidence is inhibiting actions or improvements I want to pursue, and try to get closer to risking failure without hesitating. Mistakes can be embarrassing or even tragic, but they can still be a source of growth. And they can reveal that some anxieties are partly or wholly unwarranted, either because I have more strength in whatever area than I expected or because... it’s really not so bad when I reveal that I don’t.')
