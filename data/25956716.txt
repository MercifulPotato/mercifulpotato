I don&#x27;t have concrete examples, but I needed to read the entire book twice to have enough context for info at the beginning to make any sense.  In a lot of ways, this is because of the thing that makes the game great (deeply interlocked systems) also makes it hard to find a point to insert the read pointer for the explanation.')
