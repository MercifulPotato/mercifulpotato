As upstream computational design and downstream processing and manufacture are standardized, custom work will mostly involve optimizing specific mRNA constructs to express efficiently in cells of interest.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to me when we shorten feedback loops like this. For example, could this significantly improve flu vaccines by allowing them to be more up-to-date? How much more quickly can we squash the next pandemic? Could we respond rapidly enough to help with common colds?')
