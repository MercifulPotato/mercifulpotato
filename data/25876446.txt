Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611350086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874956, text='&gt; And lazy-loaded routings? Yes please.<p>All the React routers I know of support lazy-loading well.<p>I&#x27;d argue far better than Angular handles it. React components tree shake extremely well out of the box and I&#x27;ve rarely had to worry about bundle size when lazy-loading in React. Whereas Angular&#x27;s dependency injection framework and its &quot;modules&quot;, in addition to being irritating busy work as soon as you realize you can&#x27;t trust the CLI&#x27;s scaffolding, do nothing but get in the way of proper tree-shaking and good webpack chunks&#x2F;bundles.')
