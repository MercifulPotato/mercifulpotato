The part about scanning the whole internet is useful if you want to do larger scale research (like how many % of the internet run telnet).<p>In addition massscan is really interesting from a software engineering persepective. They do kernel bypass to talk to network drivers directly, have a custom TCP stack, custom mutexes, etc. All of that to be able to reach ~1.5M packets per second (from the README), allowing someone to scan the whole IPv4 range in 6 minutes. Really impressive work.')
