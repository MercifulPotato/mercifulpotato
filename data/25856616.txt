From a freedom perspective, there&#x27;s no difference between a) firmware permanently burned into the device ROM during manufacturing b) updateable firmware stored in flash on the device c) firmware stored somewhere else and uploaded to the device by the driver upon initialization.<p>Taking the stance that it would be even nicer if we had the source for the firmware, and thus option (c) above is evil whereas (a) and (b) are fine, is just inconsistent.<p>And if one takes the stance that all of (a), (b), and (c) are evil, where do you then draw the line? Should we demand free Verilog (or whatever) sources for all the chips in the system?')
