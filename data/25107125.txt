What benefit do you actually get from that?<p>Edit upon further reflection: I’m doing something very similar. I have one bad mesh right now with lots of repeaters to transit my ridiculously long house.<p>The house is a barbell with the “house” part on one end and an office on the other, separated by a garage, with a detached shed in the back yard. My plan is to put a zwave stick + raspberry pi running zwave2mqtt in every “building envelope”, so four total. Those will all talk to an mqtt broker colocated with my singular HA instance.')
