I am going to push back on this: So, you believe that african-americans, working class women, LGBT+ and homelessness has improved over the past 20 years? I know that culturally all of these things have changed. There is no socially acceptable forum to be sexist, homophobic, racist (8ken, redpillsubreddits aside). But - has any actual change happened for anyone outside the 20% of us in the, from Peter Sloterdijk&#x27;s &#x27;spherology, cupoloa of privilege? Or are we imagining an outside of improvement from inside our safety? Thinking of the work of Moten&#x2F;Harney&#x2F;Agamben here and destituent power. How do we, in here, know these things work? Or do these stories circulate to buy our peace at night? Like buying products from black-owned stores or RT Rose McGowan or put up rainbow flags.')
