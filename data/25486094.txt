Even if we do this we still have a rank order from which we can select the N best and give them a scalable platform through which they can reach large numbers, and be better off than under the archaic approach of a bijective mapping from random  teacher X to Y students (Y less than 200), where the quality of X is probably dominated in a Pareto sense by any single teacher in the top N.<p>Caveat here that I&#x27;m no expert in pedagogy, but I would also say that this fits well with the part of the teaching process that can be scaled with no downsides, eg lectures. But TA sessions etc can&#x27;t be scaled as well and such an approach wouldn&#x27;t fit.')
