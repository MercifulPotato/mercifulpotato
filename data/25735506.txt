The fix for the last time this happened was to mask the offending CPU IDs in the kernel&#x27;s RNG from using RDRAND. systemd did have a temporary hack in place for their direct RDRAND implementation, but this current bug isn&#x27;t the same (not just emitting 0 like last time, but eventually emitting duplicate values in pairs).')
