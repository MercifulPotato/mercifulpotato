There are entire classes of enterprise apps with sophisticated functionality. I used mine with on-phone AR, which involves computer vision, on the edge. Further, my app (and many others) have multiple user roles (in my case: Patient, Hospital Staff, Admin).<p>When I&#x27;m using 32gb RAM for an app, i&#x27;m not actually running the entire app in 32GB RAM. The breakdown is usually:<p>- 8gb: XCode&#x2F;AndroidStudio, chrome, slack<p>- 4-8gb: Virtualized App VM in profile 1 (Hospital Staff)<p>- 4-8gb: Virtualized App VM in profile 2 (Patient)<p>- 4-8gb: Virtualized App VM in profile 3 (Admin)<p>Interactions in one VM affect the other. You typically debug and test UX across all at the same time. Hopefully much of it is already tested with REST API layer testing, but not all, and definitely not QA&#x2F;UAT. Is this not how it is done? How do other people do it?<p>I have a friend doing something similar for a ride hailing app, he has a customer app, and a driver app. He constantly runs both side by side while developing. I have another friend doing a food delivery app -- again, he has three profile VMs running side by side: customer, restaurant, admin.<p>So, yes, it seems M1 MBPs are not limiting, correct, at this time. They probably will be in 2025 after a dozen OS and XCode updates, and I imagine i&#x27;ll need another laptop then. If none of us did, we&#x27;d still be on the 2008 iMac with 4GB RAM and we wouldnt be speaking about the M1 at all.')
