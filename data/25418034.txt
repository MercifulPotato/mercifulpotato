When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it \ndifferent. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that at the 75K they started at, this person was already far beyond what most earners make.<p>Good on this person for making use of their skills and turning it into a lot of money. But this story just doesn&#x27;t sit well given the year most people have had. My bubble includes people who are truly struggling this year and it pains me so much to see it.')
