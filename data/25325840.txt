Item(by='giovannibonetti', descendants=None, kids=[25330380, 25327105], score=None, time=1607282186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25324692, text='&gt; In the UK, I have low-cost, fast, reliable, accessible money transfers. Basic bank accounts are free, and come with reliable free instant transfers to any other UK bank. That may not be reality in all countries, but it is in many.<p>It is also a reality in Brazil. Last month the government and the banks released a standard money transfer protocol (PIX) which superseeds the other protocols (similar to ACH in USA). Cheap, instant payments 24h a day regardless of the bank are a reality here today.<p>Hence I don&#x27;t see FB having much success in Brazil with this product.')
