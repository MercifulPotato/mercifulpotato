If bacteria has a soul we are in trouble.<p>As for the comprehensiveness of the Bible yeah what your saying is logically correct, but seems a bit disingenuous. Why not include the Quran and Book of Mormon in the holy scriptures as well if the Bible isn&#x27;t the &quot;end-all&quot;? For God to only be concerned with terrestrial matters in the Bible is very strange if ET Intelligent life exists. Any religion that acknowledges ET life prior to their discovery would seem to be more plausible... though obviously that seems kind of ridiculous in practice.')
