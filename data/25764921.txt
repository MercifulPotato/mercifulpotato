I honestly can&#x27;t see anyway that you have any idea what I think, from my comments in this thread, without just completely making up a projection out of whole cloth.<p>&gt; <i>Now you want to know if Twitter has an active account with AWS. I could answer that. But does it matter?</i><p>It does seem to matter, when the question is &quot;should AWS stop hosting Twitter because of the way in which they moderate their content?&quot;. AWS can&#x27;t do that if Twitter is not hosted on AWS... So I fail to see how it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>To answer what I think your original question was, filling in assumptions for my (still unanswered...) questions: if Twitter is hosted on AWS, and if AWS notifies them of content they are hosting with AWS that violates the AWS terms, and Twitter refuses to remove that content, then yes, I believe AWS is within their rights to suspend Twitter&#x27;s account.')
