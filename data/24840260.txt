But the one thing I hate about Retool is that anything that a developer does on Retool is tech debt.<p>You want to do a quick form to manage an app ? Let&#x27;s build it on Retool, you will lose control of everything, you can&#x27;t improve the form, you don&#x27;t run the form, you can&#x27;t apply the usual code review, ...<p>Visual coding is great for people who don&#x27;t know how to code, but for developer that should be the thing to avoid at all cost. I have seen a company that instead of improving their coding environment they started progressively doing everything on Retool, what is going to happen the day Retool is down ? or increase their price ? or they bring a breaking change ? or ?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the product is amazing, but it requires huge discipline, and this is never a good idea to depend on the discipline of people')
