Bill Burr has ALWAYS complained about sensitivity (kind of a Denis Leary sibling), Lewis Black’s shtick is angry ranting... it’s an entire genre.<p>Comedians previously ran for much longer on much less material, at least as far as I can tell... and yeah sometimes if they had bad days they’d rant for their entire set... you just didn’t see it.')
