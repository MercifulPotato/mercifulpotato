There are far more factors governing &quot;market wages&quot;, which you are describing, including labor supply at a given skill level, automation, political representation of laborers vs employers, and how that representation manifests as power in the local and global economic contexts.<p>The &quot;minimum wage&quot; specifically is a policy designed to put a floor under the standard of living of people whose market wages in the economy would provide a standard of living below what the society considers humane.  Some societies have no such humanity based floor.')
