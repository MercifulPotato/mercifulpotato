There&#x27;s been a power shift in Washington, and they are trying to signal to the new people in power &quot;We&#x27;re on your side, we&#x27;ll listen!  No need to regulate us!&quot;<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> the real problem here - there&#x27;s more to this than a private company deciding who is on their platform, which is their prerogative.  There is implicit (and explicit) <i>political</i> pressure to do so.  That&#x27;s what is scary and, in my opinion, wrong.  And it isn&#x27;t a left-right thing.  I&#x27;m sure the Republicans are looking at this and getting the same message, and would be just as happy to use the same tools.')
