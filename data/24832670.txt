The world is mostly just a few powerful actors playing games with each other, using the not-so-powerful as pawns.  The powerless occasionally get angry about that, but it&#x27;s not like they can do anything about it, because <i>that&#x27;s what it means to be powerless</i>.  Understand that it&#x27;s not personal, though - big companies and governments are not specifically targeting <i>you</i> when they do something that harms you, they just don&#x27;t know (or care) that you exist.  You&#x27;re just collateral damage in the games between the big players.<p>Embrace that and you actually have a chance of real freedom.  Being invisible is both a boon and a detriment; you occasionally get stomped on for no apparent reason, but it also means that the big players are unlikely to know (or care about) the moves that you do make.')
