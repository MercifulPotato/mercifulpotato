Item(by='karolkozub', descendants=None, kids=[25227392, 25227333], score=None, time=1606472390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226941, text='<p><pre><code>  The following values were inspected:\n  1\n  2\n  4\n  8\n  16\n  32\n  64\n  32\n  48\n  40\n  44\n  42\n  43\n</code></pre>\nThe most surprising part for me is that in the integer search 32 is inspected twice. From my brief testing it seems to only happen with infinite ranges. Is that a bug in bsearch or am I missing something?')
