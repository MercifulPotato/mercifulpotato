What is being talking about are units that vent out a chimney&#x2F;flue, but take the air for combustion from the house itself. This is not what you want for health or efficiency reasons.<p>What you want is to take air from the outside, have it combust the fuel, and then be vented outside:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.napoleon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;ca&#x2F;fireplaces&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-direct-vent-fireplaces-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.napoleon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;ca&#x2F;fireplaces&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-direct-ve...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.northcountryfire.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;news&#x2F;what-is-a-direct-vent-gas-fireplace" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.northcountryfire.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;news&#x2F;what-is-a-direct...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AKCwg8jwHd8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AKCwg8jwHd8</a><p>The only thing that should enter the living space is radiant heat.<p>Also: if the smoke exiting your fireplace&#x2F;stoke is dark, then you have an inefficient unit. The exhaust air should be clear, as that means &#x27;everything&#x27; has been burned. In the US, the now-mandated EPA BurnWise standard has stoves being between 60-80% efficient:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;burnwise&#x2F;frequent-questions-about-wood-burning-appliances" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;burnwise&#x2F;frequent-questions-about-wood-b...</a><p>You can find people saying that they use one-half or even one-third of the wood that they used to after upgrading.<p>Also a useful hint: if you&#x27;re going to use one in a domicile where you live for long periods of time, it may be worth looking at soapstone designs, as they retain heat more (though warm up is longer). For shorter periods, e.g., in a cabin&#x2F;cottage, then iron could be better as it heats&#x2F;cools quicker, so that may be fine for a (long) weekend stay.<p>For best results, regardless of heating method, make sure you make your domicile more airtight to reduce drafts, and increase insulation.')
