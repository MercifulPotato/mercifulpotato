Basically, a skinny SE (Apple doesn&#x27;t even have an iPod simulator -you&#x27;re supposed to use an SE sim).<p>My regular daily phone is an Excess Max (XSMax). I&#x27;m sick to death of it. I don&#x27;t have much use for all that screen real estate, and it&#x27;s a big honkin&#x27; monster.<p>Every time I use my Touch, it makes me envious.<p>I&#x27;ll be placing an order for a Mini, tomorrow.')
