Now that I&#x27;m supposed to be working on my thesis in my &quot;free time&quot; when there&#x27;s little diversity in the proper free time, it&#x27;s been weighing on me. I can barely focus, the hours when I&#x27;m doing my job are actually the most pleasant because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the pressure from the project. Lots of problems going to sleep as well because I keep worrying I&#x27;ll fail the masters.<p>While there&#x27;s no proper pain involved (maybe a bit of anxiety from time to time), my productivity has taken a huge dip and it&#x27;s really frustrating.')
