FreeBSD&#x27;s Linux emulator isn&#x27;t complete enough to run systemd at this time (chiefly missing things like cgroups and namespaces).  It is theoretically possible we could eventually emulate enough of Linux to run systemd.<p>As far as things that depend on systemd â€” sort of.  Sure, you won&#x27;t be able to manage servers with systemctl and that sort of thing; systemd as pid 1.  Smaller pieces under the systemd umbrella, of which there are several, may work well enough.')
