Item(by='absolutelyrad', descendants=6, kids=[25504855, 25504784, 25504692], score=17, time=1608630638, title='Discuss HN: The Last 10 Years', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='From my observation, I feel like the last 10 years of progress in internet companies have mostly had a net negative impact on societies&#x2F;relationships&#x2F;mental health.<p>This is unlike the decade of 2000&#x27;s where it was a mostly positive thing for the good. Perhaps the rise of &quot;smart phone&quot; has contributed to such a thing, including OS&#x27;s that are very limited to prevent anti-harm technologies from taking off.<p>Here are areas of improvement I can foresee in mobile tech:<p>1. Modern devices have insufficient parental controls. Parents cannot observe what their young child does, and correct them if they&#x27;re making a mistake. They require you to trust the company to decide what is best for your child. Eg: YouTube etc where kids spend a lot of their time.<p>2. Modern technologies enable a sort of prisoners dilemma in relationships. Yes you should trust your partner, but there&#x27;s the phrase &quot;trust but verify&quot;. I could foresee a company marketing a phone for couples, where you see where both of you are, and what you&#x27;re doing on your devices 24&#x2F;7. Instead of buying rings, to signify your love, you decide to share everything with each other, no secrets.<p>I was lucky that my parent&#x27;s allowed me to access to all the technology that I wanted from a very young age, however I feel like it had a net negative impact on me. And I wouldn&#x27;t let my kids have access to the same thing. Due to odd circumstance, including having the leisure to introspect myself which most people will not have the luxury of doing to themselves. (busy, work etc)<p>All in all, I feel like internet companies leaves a lot to be desired.')
