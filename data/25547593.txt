Item(by='freshbob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609028345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544591, text='&gt; Rather than booking the replacement flight directly the author should have had easyjet rebook him.<p>Lol! I had experiences similar to OPs two or three times. Agents will actively refuse to rebook, if you can get a hold of them at all.\nThey will tell you all kinds of stories: &quot;you booked through a third party, so your contract is with them and they need to rebook&quot;, or &quot;I&#x27;m not allowed to rebook&quot;, or (another classic) &quot;cannot be rebooked and you forfeit your compensation if you rebook yourself&quot;.<p>Honestly, at this point, I consider people suggesting rebooking through an agent as people who rarely or never fly and therefore are very naive about what actually happens in these types of situations.')
