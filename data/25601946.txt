This year, I read Michelle McNamara&#x27;s book &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman&#x27;s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer&quot;.  Highly recommended!<p>As I understand, it is relatively easy to cross-contaminate samples.  How is this risk reduced?  Or do all people who handled the biological evidence also get DNA tested to <i>exclude</i> themselves?<p>And do all US states and federal level courts treat DNA equally.  More interesting to me: Might we see a case where a criminal can be tied to the crime by biological evidence, but there is a court system &quot;gotcha&quot; that allows them to remain free?')
