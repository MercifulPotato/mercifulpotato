Item(by='1_2__4', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610586070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749015, text='One of the things I find fascinating about lasers is their history is an excellent instructional tool for how science copes with things it doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>When lasers were invented, we didn&#x27;t know how they worked. A lot of laypersons don&#x27;t even understand this as a concept. We knew how to build lasers, we knew they worked (what they did), but we didn&#x27;t know the mechanism by which they did it. Their adoption as a part of our world came, for awhile, in tandem with our learning about how they function.<p>This has all sorts of fascinating implications for people who have never been exposed to it before. I think intuitively a lot of people think discovery and adoption goes understanding -&gt; invention -&gt; application, but sometimes it&#x27;s invention -&gt; application -&gt; understanding. We, as humans, are capable of making use of things we don&#x27;t fully understand the inner workings of, and we can even build our knowledge on top of what at first glance appears to be a base of ignorance.<p>I read a book awhile ago that described this approach thusly: Imagine there are aliens who visit earth who can&#x27;t see objects with white&#x2F;black patterns on them. Now imagine them at a soccer game: they can easily tell something organized is going on, that there seems to be some object of focus for the players, etc. You could go so far as to figure out many of the rules of the game, all without ever actually being able to see the ball. (the thought exercise is used in the book to also demonstrate the theoretical physics and the scientific method, and concludes with one of the aliens eventually saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s presume, for a moment, that there&#x27;s a ball down there they&#x27;re all chasing...&quot; and trying to prove that hypothesis).')
