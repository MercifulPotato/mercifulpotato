And find me a franchise that will give me enough profit to buy a house with cash after only two years. And find me a franchise that I can buy with a few months of savings. None of these exist in 2020 and virtually anyone in 2020 would consider this series of events akin to winning the lottery. It&#x27;s unheard of and preposterous.')
