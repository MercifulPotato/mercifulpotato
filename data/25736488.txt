It is unfinished in noticeable ways, it doesn&#x27;t match some of the expectations set by CDPR, and the company took active steps to ensure customers wouldn&#x27;t know how poorly the game performed on certain hardware.  Once again, I don&#x27;t know if that rises to a criminal level, but this is much more serious than someone not liking a game they preordered.')
