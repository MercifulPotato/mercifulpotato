It&#x27;s especially visible in GTK apps which perform noticeably better on the Librem 5. Compilation times on L5 are also much shorter. GPU is another factor, but obviously that matters only in GPU-heavy workflows, like games (or at least should, there are still some optimizations in phoc to be done ;)).<p>From obvious things that matter a lot in regular usage I&#x27;d also mention that L5 supports 5GHz WiFi that PP doesn&#x27;t (and I&#x27;ve already seen some places with 5GHz-only WiFi), and its screen is much prettier (colors and blacks - I don&#x27;t have many objective measures, but the difference is obvious in person).')
