Isn&#x27;t it at least possible that people could be committing suicide due to reasons that are directly causally connected to COVID - whether that is fear of illness&#x2F;death, a sense of the world ending, death&#x2F;serious illness of a close relative or friend and&#x2F;or having been sick with COVID themselves?<p>The last possibility seems particularly unnerving given how many people have had COVID and the fact that there do seem to be a good number of &#x27;long-haulers&#x27; (some of whom report psychological effects).<p>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a good way of quantifying this, but the idea that every suicide during COVID is 100% casually connected to lockdown measures (or the knock-on consequences of lockdown, such as job losses) seems like an article of faith.')
