It&#x27;s likely those developers read these comments. Having babies be called ugly by your peers is rough, actively trying to be more respectful on the internet leads to a nicer industry.<p>EDIT:  Just to clarify - I&#x27;m not saying your intention was disrespectful. I&#x27;ve written many comments similar to this, and continue to do so, but I&#x27;ve started to try and curb it because I imagine it&#x27;s what YouTubers feel like reading their comments section.. But this is by our own peers in our industry.')
