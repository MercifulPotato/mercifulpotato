Which most people are. This whole thing does not stem from the desire to help others but from the strict ideological position that any regulation that _seems_ to favor the worker must indeed favor the worker.<p>There is a reason Europe moved past min-wage laws, but Americans seem to be hell bent on not listening. Like most children, they have to make the same mistake on their own in order to learn from the consequences. I have personally given up on trying to reason with people about this.')
