The device was a computer that had a broken Ethernet card. It wasn&#x27;t able to send packets but could jam the other cards connected to the Ethernet segment (coax Ethernet - all cards in the local network were galvanically connected to the same wire).<p>So he wrote a piece of code to transmit bits via the &quot;jammed&quot; and &quot;unjammed&quot; states. This was on DOS, so it was easier due to all the hardware being directly available without OS getting in the way.')
