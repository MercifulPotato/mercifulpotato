Let&#x27;s just assign them a route to follow to see how it looks, we&#x27;ll worry about real AI later.<p>Police AI?  Just give them gang member AI  (shot on site, aggressive when looking at them) until we can do a better pass.<p>Wanted System?  Just spawn in mobs to something happens when the player gets a wanted star.  We&#x27;ll sort the real system when Driver AI and Police AI is finished.<p>Etc. Etc.')
