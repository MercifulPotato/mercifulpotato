I think a few rooms, with proper tooling to signal activity and a way to preview (listen in before you decide to join, or better yet have it play a recent utterance from its beginning) would work wonders. Maybe the system could prompt participants to move to a separate room on sufficient activity, and remind participants to set a text subject once in a while during periods of activity.<p>Spatialization gives you little, as it&#x27;s still impossible to listen to multiple conversations at once, and discovering the mapping of location-to-topic is a problem. If you&#x27;re setting up specific locations for specific topics in advance, what I want to know is who is there and how active they are, not where on a 2D canvas the admin has chosen to position it.')
