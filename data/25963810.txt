The issue I have is with how they are <i>deployed</i> as tools to correct societies behavior. The way the USA uses them, it doesn&#x27;t work and only serves to suppress a group of minorities from becoming participants nor leaders in society.<p>Jail is supposed to be for those who did wrong and need a &quot;timeout&quot; so to speak. A wake up call or reality check on their behavior. Prison is more longer term rehabilitation. Problem is, our society&#x27;s tolerance of crime and sentences for said crimes lands people in jail more often than not. Difference being jail sentences are up to a year, prison year+.<p>Not to mention the absurd bias towards minorities in how we police, how we judge, etc. to fill said jails and prisons which are increasingly becoming <i>For-Profit</i> by leasing prison workforce labor out at 1890s labor costs of $0.27&#x2F;day. It&#x27;s legalized slavery.')
