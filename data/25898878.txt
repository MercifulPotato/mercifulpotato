It is not &quot;anything where the distance is not the Euclidean distance&quot; or &quot;anything other than the Euclidean space&quot; or &quot;anything not related to Euclid&#x27;s proof that there are infinitely many primes&quot;. Such a concept would not be useful, because it would be so broad that nothing interesting could be said about it (as you said, it would include Doom levels because of the teleports).<p>So a cylinder or a flat torus or a space being infinitely repeated are not non-Euclidean geometry. Monument Valley also has no relation to non-Euclidean geometry.')
