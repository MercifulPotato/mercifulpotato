Item(by='necovek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603511430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870376, text='The OP author seems to be conflating multiple things under the &quot;time zone&quot; term too.<p>Localities (countries, cities, areas) have <i>official standard time</i> that, to interpret, depends on the point in history (calendar adjustments, DST, leap seconds...).  Finding official standard time for any given person anywhere in the world and at any point in history is a hard problem.  But it seems they are not trying to solve that general problem.<p>Time zones, specifically, usually refer to a relatively straightforward concept: &quot;zones&quot; where time matches, usually given using a time offset (most commonly hourly) from the UTC+0000 (closely related to GMT). &quot;Eastern Standard Time&quot; is a localised (to the USA) name for a time zone that would sound totally foreign to anyone not regularly setting up meetings with Americans.  Most people would probably think &quot;what time is in the USA right now?&quot; is a non-ambiguous question.<p>But that ambiguity is exactly what OP wants to solve.  It&#x27;s more of a NLP problem where the context is simply missing (&quot;what&#x27;s Colorado Springs time?&quot; is a perfectly valid question to ask, just like time zone monikers would be translated everywhere English is not a native language: majority of the world).  Even if there were any better standards than IANA, they would not help with implementing a better algorithm, since there is no real need for everyone to learn any official timezone names, and they&#x27;d still refer to them using whatever local name there is.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember what the goal of &quot;time zones&quot; is. It is to simplify time keeping and cross-referencing between people who come in <i>regular contact.</i> The only true time is astronomical time, but if a person 20mi&#x2F;30km away was up to 1 minute off (depending on the direction), it would make any coordination very hard.  Sure, we&#x27;re seeing changes in how often people come into regular contact across timezones, but I don&#x27;t think we are at a tipping point where everyone needs to adjust just yet.<p>Developing tools for those who do is sure welcome, so I invite the author to get their terminology (and goal) a bit clarified :)')
