I&#x27;ve also worked here for most of my working life - so I&#x27;ve grown up with having virtual meetings and I&#x27;d say even when in the office 90% of my meetings would involve someone from another office, country or company. So it does actually feel very normal to me, in a way it almost feels more strange _not_ being on a call.<p>Wonder how the younger generations opinions on this differ to the older generation?')
