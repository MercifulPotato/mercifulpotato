Like those who would paint social forms of &quot;anarchism&quot; as being without rules, a black and white conflation of a nuanced topic relating to social&#x2F;progressive politics with a concept like totalitarianism. Not that there aren&#x27;t dark pattern social dynamics relating to the topic that are worth talking about, but there really is no attempt to engage here, just an apparent horseshoe attempt to psychologically pin negative sentiments to some keywords.')
