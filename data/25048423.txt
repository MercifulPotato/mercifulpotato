It clearly says “shipping information received”. Not “product has been picked up by ups”<p>Also ups does not notify you so don’t expect communication from them they will tell you to call your shipper.  If the shipper doesn’t respond to you well... that has nothing to do with the UPS shipping process now does it.<p>I just realized the drop ship company printed labels early so it didn’t look like they were the slow ones.  The idea is someone looks at the label sees “shipping something received” and then hounds ups for status updates and not the seller.')
