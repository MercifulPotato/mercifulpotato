Your last tape wasn&#x27;t such hot stuff!<p>Seriously, sure, this isn&#x27;t like a maths problem. But we can have reasoned opinions about art, just as we can have reasoned opinions about whether, say, a piece of software is well or badly written, given that it does what it&#x27;s technically supposed to. I&#x27;m not just saying it&#x27;s bad because it gave me a nasty feeling in my tummy.<p>In particular, poetry and art contain ideas. They express ideas powerfully and viscerally. It matters whether we have good or bad ideas, thinking or hot air, new understanding or stale clich√©s. In this sense, art isn&#x27;t just like a bag of cheetos. It has consequences. That&#x27;s why dictatorships have often censored good art, and supported bad art. Good art can express new thoughts. I think the US will need a lot of new thoughts in the next four years.')
