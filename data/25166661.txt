The reason why the first few seasons of Game of Thrones was compelling was because the world they lived in didn&#x27;t have any modern sensibilities in it. The more they threw in modern sensibilities the worse the show got (thought the action scenes for the most part got better).<p>There was some show recently where Black slaves in the USA had taken power over the whites and a white KKK member from another dimension somehow got transported there. Some decried the show and wanted it banned. I thought it sounded excellent, because it was soooo divorced from reality. Same with the &quot;Man from the High Castle&quot;. The setting in which the enemy won WWII was compelling.<p>Secondly just randomly pushing people into roles for the sake of representation ends up cheapening any genuine effort. The Wire was brilliant because the huge number of black people being in the show made sense. At the time I didn&#x27;t actually notice that most of the cast was black.<p>You know what the end result is. It made me notice skin colour when I didn&#x27;t used to and made me start to resent any effort (no matter how genuine) because I know there is probably some quota involved somewhere to pander to a demographic.<p>&gt; Historically, &quot;rich white people&quot; have been in control of the media, so it&#x27;s great to see this group becoming more self aware.<p>It isn&#x27;t self awareness though. <i>They are projecting their prejudices onto the rest of us.</i> This includes places where it just isn&#x27;t relevant and makes almost no sense.<p>How dare they project their prejudices onto me in an effort to absolve themselves of guilt, then have the gall to tell me that I am the one with the problem when I object to it. Fuck them!<p>I clearly remember when I decided I wouldn&#x27;t watch anymore broadcast television (this was about 8 years ago now).<p>There was a show hosted by Scottish Comedian Frankie Boyle that was infamous for his offensive comedy. On that show there was a rich Canadian woman on the TV telling people in the audience that all men had done through the centuries was raping and beating women.<p>Then there was a black musician called &quot;Akala&quot; telling me the British Empire institutions were guilty of perpetuating racism. He seemed to be obilvious to the fact that he was on a British Institution being broadcasted to every home in the country.<p>Other the gross oversimplification of history. I had nothing to do with it (nor did my family as they were all very poor). It would be like blaming today&#x27;s Germans for what Hitler did. It is absolutely disgusting.<p>You know what the end result of this is? It made me hugely suspicious of any claim of sexual misconduct or racism. It is the classic story of the boy that cried wolf.<p>&gt; We should let people with compelling stories tell their stories! Now that streaming is the norm, there&#x27;s room for everyone, now that we&#x27;re not limited to only the stories which are marketable for primetime.<p>Maybe I am getting old but I remember a lot of this already happening. I am not saying it was perfect and I don&#x27;t disagree with it in principle.<p>Recently &quot;Black Panther&quot; was released. &quot;The first black super hero&quot; they said. People seemed to forget Wesley Snipes played Blade for 3 movies (starting in 1997) and they were the first Marvel Movies and made the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe viable as it showed that a comic book property could be successful.<p>Before that we had the &quot;There are no female action heroes&quot; they said. Forgetting all thrillers in the past with heroines, a whole movie franchise called Aliens, Cherry 2000, Nikita, Tank Girl, Buffy and a bunch of other movies I have probably forgotten about where the woman had taken charge of the situation and won the day.<p>People increasingly think that the world before they were born didn&#x27;t exist.')
