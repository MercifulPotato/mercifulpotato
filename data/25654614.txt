There is sprawl, spread, and desolation in every state. Crazy drivers exist everywhere, and to think they don&#x27;t is naive. Sure, they have a weird thing in FL about breaking before signaling a turn, but I&#x27;d take the roads in FL over the interstates in Chicago or Atlanta. It just sounds like you&#x27;re bitter about where you live now. I live in one of the large cities in Florida, and while the transit isn&#x27;t world-class, the quality of life certainly is.')
