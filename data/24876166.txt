As I understand it, the XOR of two secure hashes should be at least as strong as each one. Of course you can find ways to deliberately come up with a broken scheme if you really want to do something <i>spectacularly</i> dumb (like XORing a variation of the same algorithm with itself...), at which point the problem isn&#x27;t really XOR, but assuming you&#x27;re being reasonable and showing some sense in the process, the likelihood of someone somehow finding an exploitable correlation between them without breaking either one should be <i>astronomically</i> small to not even warrant a second thought.')
