The rest of the world wasn&#x27;t happy about it and used everything in their power to keep certain people in power, certain people who they can control... and some domestic interests came together to make it a reality.<p>As a non-American, a Trump defeat is good for me, at least in the short term. However, ideologically, I&#x27;m opposed to any foreign interference, whether what is being done to the U.S. now or what the U.S. has been doing to almost every country for several decades... so I would have liked Trump to win because he represents actual American interests.<p>The opposition plan is to slow down the U.S. energy independence and value the energy sources China has control of (solar panels and wind). Europe and Middle East are aligned with the in that mostly because their oil will still be competitive for a few more decades and it will buy them time.')
