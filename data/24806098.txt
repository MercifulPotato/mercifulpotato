Each team has a different owner.<p>&gt; So for example the San Francisco 49ers have very little to do with San Francisco, except for the name&#x27;\nIn many geographical regions, you grow up watching the team that is closest in proximity. e.g. I grew up in rural western New York State and I grew up watching the Buffalo Bills because they were the closest franchise despite being 100 miles away.<p>The name is just a semantic. Would you be happier if the 49ers were called the &quot;Northern California 49ers&quot;?')
