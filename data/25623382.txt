The debugger also lets you see everything in the stack, modify definitions, etc.<p>MATLAB and R both have options to drop you into a debugger if there is an error. Not sure if Python&#x27;s debugger can do this, but other than that, this style of programming is perfectly doable outside of Lisp and Smalltalk.')
