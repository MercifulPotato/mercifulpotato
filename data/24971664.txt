I have my browser set to clear all cookies on close, but that also deletes my &quot;I accept&quot; clicks, so every time I start a new browser session, and this is multiple times per day, my cookies reset. Result before: my cookies would all reset multiple times per day, all nice. Result after: I have to click stupid banners about cookies that I&#x27;m deleting soon thereafter anyways.')
