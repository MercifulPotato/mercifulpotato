It&#x27;s always uncomfortable when we end up in a disagreement when we&#x27;re just trying to contribute to the discussion. As a dispassionate third party it&#x27;s easier for me to chalk it up to where things could have gone better than to pass out fault and assign you both goals and motives I can&#x27;t actually know.<p>When I was in school they tried to teach us self-esteem and all that, and that nobody else could make us feel any certain way. Water off a duck&#x27;s back and all that. There&#x27;s a little truth to that, but it&#x27;s largely bullshit. The real truth they didn&#x27;t so much teach is that conversation is not happenstance and although such a thing as talent for it may be real, it&#x27;s mostly a skillset. It can be practiced and learned. It can even be trained.<p>One of you said something that wasn&#x27;t quite unambiguously clear, which is an opportunity to improve. The other took one of those possible meanings and ran with it, offering a different valid interpretation of the phrasing and a correction based on that point of view. That&#x27;s another opportunity to improve. Getting to the shared understanding first rather than after the fact would have been nice, but we&#x27;re all human (or at least passed this instance of the Turing test) here.<p>Thanks for not being a dick about it, and I for one happily accept your apology.')
