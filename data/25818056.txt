Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610943372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808475, text='I&#x27;m not sure what is counted as &quot;sites&quot; - i.e. if Google closes foo.bar&#x2F;baz123 and the same server gets assigned bar.foo&#x2F;zab345 and continues to serve malware, is it 2 separate sites? Did Google really achieve this much by forcing the changing of the URL? Sure, bunch of people that got the phish link in the mail that was sent before switch but then shut down won&#x27;t be phished, but I have no idea how much that changes the picture - I&#x27;m sure phishers are well aware that their domains are short-lived and already adapted for that, otherwise they&#x27;d be extinct. However, I&#x27;d be glad to read some field-validated data about how much closing those 2M sites, whatever is meant by &quot;sites&quot;, actually helps against phishing.<p>I mean <i>if</i> we could trust Google (or anybody else of that kind) to have blacklist strictly limited to reasonable definition of malware and phishing, and knew that usage of such list if strictly voluntary under control of the user, it would be an acceptable, if decidedly imperfect, remedy. But we know we can&#x27;t trust any of this, even if whoever works on this at Google right now are sincerely ironclad committed to never any mission creep and abuse happen, once the means exist, these people can always be replaced with others that would use it to fight &quot;misinformation&quot;, or &quot;incitement&quot;, or &quot;blasphemy&quot;, or whatever it is in fashion to fight this week. There&#x27;s no mechanism that ensures it won&#x27;t be abused, and abuse is very easy once the system is deployed.<p>Moreover, we (as, people not in control of Google&#x27;s decisions) have absolutely no means to prevent any abuse of this, since Google owns the whole setup and we have no voice in their decision making process. Given that, it seems to be prudent to make all effort to reject it while we still can. Otherwise next time you&#x27;d want to make a site questioning Google&#x27;s decisions about the malware list, nobody would be able to read it because it&#x27;d be marked as a malware site.')
