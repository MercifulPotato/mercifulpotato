For instance, if I may want to express what I find sexy, a picture is worth well more than a thousand words. Sometimes, I may opt for a (pornographic) thousand words. There is immense complexity in at least <i>some</i> pornography, and some feminist philosophers would contend that porn is the best medium (on a variety of metrics) to convey the idea that women should be subordinated. I don&#x27;t agree with that reading, but there a many points of view.<p>&gt;So can the kind of murders committed therein.<p>The idea is that porn also expresses ideas and opinions, not that porn is pure and good by light of doing just that.
