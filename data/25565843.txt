I&#x27;ve used a couple hosting providers, but to be honest, I&#x27;m not certain how they&#x27;ve handled my mail in terms of privacy. It never seemed &quot;non-optimal&quot; to own the domain. I still think using gmail or other free services is a bad idea, but i don&#x27;t generally say it out loud much anymore. People react negatively because they don&#x27;t want to consider whether the services they depend on are misusing their personal information.')
