I agree that old.reddit.com is the only way to use Reddit. Let&#x27;s hope it lasts.<p>2. They have made some high-profile mistakes, like banning &#x2F;r&#x2F;gendercritial. However, they are legally allowed to remove subreddits that they find don&#x27;t align with their values (or their advertisers&#x27; values).<p>3. I don&#x27;t think that routine opposition to extremism viewpoints is &quot;leftist&quot;. The defining qualities of the post-Trump Republican are gullibility, anti-intellectualism, and immorality; these are not really political viewpoints. Outside of the Trump bubble, who respects these values? If there were a political party that housed all the rapists, it would not be a political statement to deny their voice on your internet forum.<p>Again, it is important to understand the lack of symmetry between so-called &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; viewpoints. Trumpists are 20-30% of the country and are largely insular. People opposed to Trump and his takeover the party are a clear majority of the country, even if a huge number of those are moderates or even right-leaning.<p>In other words, mainstream platforms that discriminate against extremist&#x2F;immoral views are not echo chambers. Echo chambers are echo chambers.')
