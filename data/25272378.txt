It also doesn&#x27;t require type information to be specified in many places.<p>How does this translator get around that?<p>For example, if I have this bit of unoptimized T-Sql:<p><pre><code>   declare @m int\n   select @m=[MeterID] from EnergyMeters where MeterLocation=&#x27;&#x2F;a&#x2F;b&#x2F;c&#x27;;\n\n   select sum([Value]) from EnergyData where [MeterID]=@m;\n\n</code></pre>\nHow would this get translated to pgsql? (Yes,  you can combine this specific statement into a single query - this is a trivial example to highlight the point)')
