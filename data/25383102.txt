And the meme that &quot;the rich have too much money&quot; is a popular one. It helps that it has a kernel of truth: it is much harder to make your first million than it is the second, even if for the simple reason that you can afford a competent secretary, accountant and lawyer. So in this respect I do get the appeal.<p>I disagree with blaming the rich and looking at taxing them for a whole host of other reasons that don&#x27;t really have much to do with fairness:<p>- best way to distribute resources in a society is to give more to those that have proven they can use them best. And &quot;who has more money&quot; is a decent heuristic for &quot;who can make more with the money he has&quot;. It&#x27;s not perfect, of course, and it&#x27;s trivial to think of exceptions, but it&#x27;s very handy compared to any alternatives.<p>- &quot;raising the tax&quot; and &quot;collecting more tax&quot; are not the same thing, especially when you deal with people that have competent accountants and can move their wealth around.<p>- I&#x27;d much rather hear talk of lowering the for work, than raising the tax for the rich. It would directly encourage creating jobs and getting money in the pockets of the people.<p>- I&#x27;d also (and this is my old pet peeve) rather have higher tax for things which are valuable because of commons. Land, for example: a piece of land in Manhattan is 90% valuable because of its location, and 10% because of what&#x27;s built on it. And its location is valuable because of New York city in aggregate. This would be a very common sense thing to tax, up until the point where cities actually spread to avoid higher taxes. But I&#x27;d also try to legislate this wider, to other things where commons create most of the value. Think how much value Facebook gets due to the actual software, and how much due to many people using it.')
