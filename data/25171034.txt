Item(by='thomastjeffery', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605979417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25170706, text='I would expect nothing less from Murdoch press.<p>&gt; Think about it this way: If you only have $1.5 trillion to spend, what policy would help the most people actually struggling right now? I donâ€™t think canceling student loans would rank in the top 20.<p>Do these people even have a top 20? What does it include apart from lowering the corporate tax rate in hopes that money will &quot;trickle down&quot; to the poor?<p>Meanwhile outside the right-wing echo chamber, cancelling student loan debt is very appealing to millions of average people who got into unrecoverable debt by simply trying to better themselves because they believed in the promise of better wages for better education. These people are in debt, making them literally not &quot;the elite&quot;.<p>So what elite are we talking about? Universities? OK, well what other options do we have? Leave students and alumni in unrecoverable debt so that those damn &quot;elites&quot; lose money? Is there a way to eliminate that debt without paying Universities what they are owed? I&#x27;m all ears.<p>And what is our long term solution? Are we going to stop telling children they will make millions more on average by simply having a bachelors degree? Are we going to make it clear to every prospective student today that going into student loan debt is an unwise risk and not a strong investment?<p>Right-wing conservatives are happy to tell people they deserve the debt they got into, but are too chicken to confront their original motivations. People are desperate to get higher wages, but on the whole, wages have been stagnant since the 70&#x27;s. The source of this problem is clear when you look at the big picture: billionaires are getting the overwhelming majority of new wealth while the rest of us are left to fight over anything that &quot;trickles down&quot;.')
