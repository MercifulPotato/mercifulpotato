In the best case, short-sellers are the jackals&#x2F;vultures that cull the weak and free up capital for new ventures. To the extent that shorts engage in reverse pump-and-dump, that is likely, too, to be inefficient.<p>It is my expectation that in the long term, both nefarious shorts and WSBers will lose to those working to create real value. It is simply unfortunate and perhaps unnecessary that the war between the chaos monkeys involves collateral damage.  Such an environment adds reasons for successful companies to stay privately-traded, which is probably a net-negative for humanity.')
