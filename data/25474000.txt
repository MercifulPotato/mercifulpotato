Your comment feels like the most important one here. I know I’m kind of self-diagnosing in a folksy way by finding a diet that works for me, and that’s probably not a good idea if I do have celiac’s. I’m gonna see if I can find a doctor that can give me a test. It might take a minute because I live in Asia and it’s a very rare disease here.')
