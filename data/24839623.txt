Feels weird to humanize companies in that way. If you trust a company, isn&#x27;t it really that you trust the humans working at that company? So you should really say &quot;I trust person X who happens to work at X today&quot;, as as soon as they leave, the trust went with them.<p>Companies are not people and cannot be trusted to act in any interest but profits. Any trust you feel towards a company is towards humans in the company, but let&#x27;s not anthropomorphise companies (yet, until we have better AI at least).')
