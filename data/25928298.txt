And the only benefit of irrational beliefs is to have a calculated social good impression.<p>I think ethics do not need to be &#x27;truthy&#x27;. Sometimes science is used for an ethical argument, but often it is just a weapon to make a certain impression.\nPeople care about other people not because they believe they we&#x27;ll be rewarded for it. My great-grandmother was saved when Nazis occupied the city she lived in by her friend, who risked her life to do so. Was it because of &quot;true&quot; belief? Of course not. Or was it &#x27;good impressions&#x27; - well nobody predicted at the time that the Nazis will lose. People have agency which stems from their life experience.<p>For example author worked at Palantir for seven years. Was it &#x27;rational&#x27; to do so? Probably, such companies may be a great place to work and compensation would be nice. Would it be  &#x27;irrational&#x27; to decline job offer from such company on ethical grounds?<p>My point is that social reality is a fiction, point well-understood in certain traditions, but that fiction is what really our lives are, something as quite real as outcomes of scientific experiments. The absence of Truth as a bedrock of our experience may be problematic but it really opens up a horizon for change.')
