This doesn&#x27;t sound like money to &quot;start Zip2&quot; as you claim.<p>Also, note that Elon had to shower at a YMCA while starting up Zip2 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;how-elon-musk-founded-zip2-with-his-brother-kimbal.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;how-elon-musk-founded-zip2-w...</a>). Does that really sound like a &quot;trust fund baby&quot; to you?  I feel like a lot of the myths trying to tear down Elon Musk&#x27;s successes are all sourced from Ashlee Vance&#x27;s book, which in turn are based on, as I understand it, interviews of Errol Musk himself (the father).')
