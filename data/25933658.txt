Every tech company, every Hollywood studio, every academic institution are vibrating with energy to find and fight racism; overflowing with programs and policies about race. Hell, even the Oscars can&#x27;t be won by white guys making movies about white guys any more - it&#x27;s in the rules!<p>Here&#x27;s the evidence <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;the-nytimes-is-woke.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;th...</a><p>To say it&#x27;s the poor whites who are &quot;thinking in terms of race&quot; too much is utterly absurd. Where&#x27;s the evidence that they&#x27;re thinking in terms of race more than the academics or NYT? You&#x27;ll hear way more about race in a random sample of discussions at the NYT than you possibly could at a NASCAR event.<p>The people thinking too much in terms of race are the upper-class whites, and they do this to justify their superiority over the lower whites by borrowing morality points from the (in this narrative) victimized non-whites.')
