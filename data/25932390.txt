Plenty of time to have someone make you a latte, or a burrito, heck maybe get a quick massage.  It&#x27;s probably too soon to know which sorts of services will best complement electric charging stations, but I think there&#x27;s a good chance it&#x27;ll end up looking somewhat different from the typical current gas station convenience store, even once EVs are more mainstream.')
