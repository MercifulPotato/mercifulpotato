I was making the point that trade barriers help bring greater regional diversity and more locally produced agricultural products. This was in response to the parent comment complaining about trade barriers, which might make it somewhat harder for them to expand into the UK but, on the other hand, might make it <i>easier</i> for a UK based supplier to get started in their own market. Thus you end up with <i>two</i> businesses (one in the UK, one in Germany), rather than one.<p>But if you <i>do</i> want me to speak about the EU then yes, I would argue that a neoliberal project such as the EU helps bring consolidiation and makes for big winners (both corporations and countries) at the expense of smaller entities (again, corporations and countries). We have seen this with the EU, with Germany and its industrial corporations winning at the expense of Spain, Portugal, Greece, etc and their industrial corporations losing.')
