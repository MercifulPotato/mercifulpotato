You should aspire to amorality, just as they have done. It&#x27;s not about revenge, it&#x27;s about winning, and doing what it takes to win.<p>Half of the people in America look at foreign policy through the lens of naive capitalism and the other half look at foreign policy through the lens of naive morality. Both are incredibly foolish, as China has taught us.<p>To be clear, the current administration has matched rhetoric about &quot;winning&quot; with some very stupid moves. I&#x27;m not a fan of stupid moves, but I see people object to both smart and stupid moves on the basis that they aren&#x27;t good, or right, or fair -- and I object to <i>that</i>. Politics is amoral.')
