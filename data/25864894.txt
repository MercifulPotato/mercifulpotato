Ignoring the <i>very</i> next paragraph that says AWS can terminate with no notice. Their own response to that point in the reply brief was pitiful.<p>Actually, their response was so pitiful they tried a second reply brief (that&#x27;s the &quot;supplemental authority&quot; brief) where they instead changed their argument to &quot;this is our reading of the contract, and you have to endorse it because it&#x27;s a contract of adhesion.&quot; Which instead comes across as &quot;we totally missed that part in the contract, and now we&#x27;re trying to legal fu our way out of not reading a contract.&quot; Changing your argument on the fly doesn&#x27;t tend to go very well in the courts.<p>The quality of their legal briefs is not impressive, and when you&#x27;re going up a large corporation with deep pockets and competent legal attorneys to defend themselves, you&#x27;re going to have a very rough time of it.')
