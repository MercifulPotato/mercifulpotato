The internet is a big scene, and on this scene we have companies and their products, political parties, ad agencies and regular users. Everyone is fighting for attention, clicks. Google has control over a ranking and filtering system that covers most searches on the internet. FB and Twitter hold another ranking&#x2F;filtering sweet spot for social networks.<p>The problem is that we have no say in ranking and filtering. I think it should be customisable both on a personal and community level. We need a way to filter out the crap and surface the good parts on all these sites. I am sure Google wouldn&#x27;t like to lose control of ranking and filtering, but we can&#x27;t trust a single company with such an essential function of our society, and we can&#x27;t force a single editorial view on everyone.<p>As we have many newspapers, each with its own editorial views, we need multiple search engine curators as well.')
