I&#x27;d argue Pokemon falls into this category somewhat, but that&#x27;s definitely eye of the beholder. The flat UIs feel congruent enough with the world to me.<p>The second place you&#x27;ll see flatter UIs sometimes is in the sort of &quot;hub&quot; UIs that many multiplayer games. They usually have a lot of functionality, are very much &quot;out of game,&quot; and are incidentally normally built on web tech.<p>But for regular, in-game UIs? Not really IMO, not like it has been for apps.')
