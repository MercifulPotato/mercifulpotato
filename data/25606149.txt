We write these papers because the administration incentivizes us to get the highest profile publications with the lowest effort possible. In relatively creative fields (i.e., much of computer science), this can even mean to make friends in the community and co-author papers with them without being the one who does any of the hard work. (In other sciences, it means being the one who pulls in the money, as far as I understand.)<p>A related problem I see is that we treat all papers the same: position (opinion) papers, reviews &amp; surveys, and &quot;hard&quot; results (relevant proofs, strong empirical results, software artifacts that are deployed at scale in practice etc.). As the blog post somewhat suggests, the administration should primarily ask us to summarize these results when assessing whether we are worthy of funding and faculty positions; sure, it takes more effort, but I think it is possible.')
