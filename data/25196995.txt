The crazy epoxy stuff he writes about is not specified in the FIPS requirements but rather a lazy hack some people do when they want to run non-FIPS certified consumer hardware.<p>Remarkably he even hypothesizes the solution that they almost certainly are using here, without realizing how trivial it is:<p>&gt; Guess: maybe there are tiny wires in the casing and an &quot;intrusion detection&quot; chip with its own battery that is never powered off so that it can monitor for breakage of the wires and trigger a wipe?<p>This is very likely what they are doing. And it&#x27;s both simple and cheap to manufacture and implement at scale. Basically the inner-side of the metal casing is conductive and etched to be a big wire looping around the device, forming a circuit. Any attempt to drill or decase it will break the circuit and trigger a wipe. The wipe itself is done by a small 16-bit microcontroller powered off a watch battery or large capacitor. All the parts cost less than a dollar, and the case etching machine is something a company like Kingston would have on hand for other purposes.<p>At my last job we had to roll our own physical security solution for protecting keys because the off-the-shelf FIPS level 3 stuff was so brain-dead stupid and easy to defeat that it didn&#x27;t meat our security needs.')
