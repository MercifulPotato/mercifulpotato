Building material, channel congestion, network load, AP placement, other sources of RFI, etc all cause issues.<p>Your best bet is look for APs that support 802.11r or v (also check that clients support it though most modern cards do) which allows seamless roaming between APs then replace the existing AP with 2 or 3 APs. If you want a cheaper solution you can try for a DIY site survey to try to find the best placement and channel for the existing AP.')
