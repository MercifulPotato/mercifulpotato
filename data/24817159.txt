Item(by='rcxdude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603021819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806131, text='Bitbake is a bit further than &#x27;recursive makefile&#x27;, it&#x27;s much more along the lines of a package manager like nix or portage (though it&#x27;s less well designed in most aspects, the build file syntax is insane and debugging it is a nightmare. I think it&#x27;s grown the necessary features instead of stepping back and understanding the problem). And it&#x27;s important to realise it&#x27;s mostly focused on building packages like a linux distribution, even if the systems are rarely managed by installing&#x2F;uninstalling packages. This is where the whole idea of taking an upstream tar or repo and patching it together comes from, and it makes perfect sense when 90% of your workflow is &#x27;take someone else&#x27;s code and modify it slightly to integrate into your system&#x27;, especially when that code gets updated (it&#x27;s still not painless, but you have some hope of doing it). When you&#x27;re google and can afford to rewrite huge parts of the system and have no need for compatibility then you can make a more nicely integrated system, but most embedded applications cannot afford this.')
