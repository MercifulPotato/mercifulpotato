Although I&#x27;d have to reconsider if an incoming Biden administration would punish me in any upcoming anti-trust case, as cowardly as that may seem.<p>But I also think the rights of the services providers have to considered as well. Should Nintendo be forced to publish porn apps in their Switch online store for example? Should HN be prevented from moderating comments here? Should thedonald.win be prevented from deleting anti-Trump comments? No is my answer to those rhetorical questions.<p>At the same time I don&#x27;t think that electricity, water, and internet service providers should be allowed to cut off Westboro Baptist Church either. Likewise for their domain name provider.<p>I think things like AWS and payment services are more like electric and water suppliers then they are like app stores and web forums. So I suppose that I&#x27;m in favour of drawing a line in a reasonable place, it&#x27;s just not clear to me yet exactly where that line should be.')
