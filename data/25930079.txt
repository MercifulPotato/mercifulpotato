Too bad.<p>I think this gets to the major concern with Academia today, as it becomes somewhat of a self-reinforcing feedback loop.  Curry citations with political savvy, get awarded grants due to citations and political savvy, show that you are productive due to citations, grants, and political savvy - earning yet more political capital.<p>This will probably become my go to explanation for why Academic CS research has largely become decoupled from industrial application and industrial research. While political savvy is important in a large corporation, eventually you need to produce results.')
