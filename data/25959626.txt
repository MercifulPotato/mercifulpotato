Stating that there were good, well-meaning people in a crowd of hateful rascists after a woman was killed by a radical maniac is not a helpful statement, and it provides cover for what was, by most decent people&#x27;s assessment, a despicable display of bigotry and hatred.<p>Do you know what I find most frustrating about the abortion arguments between the left and the right?<p>If you truly truly believe life begins at conception, of course you believe it&#x27;s immoral to murder the baby.<p>if you truly truly believe life does NOT begin at conception, of course you believe it&#x27;s immoral to force a woman to deal with an unwanted pregnancy.<p>IOW, there are well-intentioned people on both sides.  Does this make it ok for someone to bomb an abortion clinic?  No, absolutely not, and the vast majority of pro-life people don&#x27;t agree with that action, and should not be universally condemned for the actions of a few.<p>But lets look closer at what you said.<p>&gt; Stating that there were good, well-meaning people in a group of __assholes who think they should be able to tell women what to do with their body__.<p>---<p>It is absolutely __FRUSTRATING__ watching people like you dive headfirst into contributing to the problems this country currently has.<p>It feels as if I have a super power for being able to converse with people from the left and the right equally.  The opinions I see from the left about what the right is thinking, as if they would know when they can&#x27;t even bring themselves to _SPEAK_ to the right.<p>What I&#x27;m saying here is that YOU are a part of the problem.')
