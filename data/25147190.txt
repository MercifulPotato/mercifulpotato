I find it strange that the USA has such a low score (in the 80&#x27;s), though I do note that the censorship in the USA isn&#x27;t really as much state-driven, as it is corporate. I also noted that Iceland has a lower score than Norway, which seems odd to me, as it&#x27;s for instance known to fervently support the integrity of servers stationed there.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that part of the reason Norway has less censorship than other countries, is because it&#x27;s outside the EU (despite being a de-facto member). In several instances of using a VPN, things that were censored in the EU (I remember checking several EU countries) weren&#x27;t cencored in either Norway or the USA.')
