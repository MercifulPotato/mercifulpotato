Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=[25766475, 25767478, 25766920], score=None, time=1610563714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765716, text='&gt; Dropbox and Evernote, for me are two very similar companies.<p>I was also going to comment on their similarities. It&#x27;s not mentioned as often, but Evernote&#x27;s biggest selling point in the beginning was that they figured out how to make multidevice sync work. The product was good, but not unique. In the early days there were no competitors that could offer the comfort of Evernote&#x27;s sync.<p>Unfortunately both companies still have a 2010 mindset, at least when it comes to setting price. Neither seems to understand that their pricing is insane in 2021. $120&#x2F;year is just too much for Dropbox (and nobody&#x27;s going to fall for the 2 TB thing). Neither has a competitive free offering, so they&#x27;re dropping off the radar for anyone looking for a free plan. Anyone working at either company that&#x27;s not looking for a job should be.')
