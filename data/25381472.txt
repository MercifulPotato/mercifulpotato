There are frequent email updates from hospital leadership on the state of the ICU. In our area doctors are being asked to give up their time off and work unlimited hours (as long as the avg is 80 per week each month). We&#x27;ve had 1 hospital provided N-95 since the beginning of the pandemic. It&#x27;s filthy and probably ineffective at this point. The last update said there were something like 13 beds remaining.')
