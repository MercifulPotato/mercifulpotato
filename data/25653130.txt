If the user does not grant access to a file through a dialog, the app couldn&#x27;t read it. Same for folder access, which would grant an application access to an entire folder or perhaps an entire hierarchy.<p>Obviously this would break some things, but real change may require some of that. How much, I don&#x27;t know.')
