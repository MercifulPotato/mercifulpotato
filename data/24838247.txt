The army at that time was around a million.<p>Even accounting for losses in evacuation, (around 70k) There was still the Indian armies, the African armies and the various other imperial armies. More concerning was the loss of equipment.<p>Even so, you seem to forget that the worlds biggest navy owned the channel. (the stuff that was patrolling the north sea wasn&#x27;t even most of the navy)<p>Then you forget that the british ports were well mined and defended. (just like the ports in normandy, hence the mulberry temporary ports to ship ammo, fuel and armour in, without which the effort would have failed, like market garden)<p>&gt; no food<p>Again no, the blockade was later. Compared to the dutch, Belgians and the germans later on, england had loads of food.<p>&gt; and no air force.<p>again, if the UK had no airforce, they wouldn&#x27;t have had air superiority. Which meant that the german airforce could have dominated the channel and harassed the British navy.<p>To tackle your point about sealion<p>Without logistics it would have been very difficult for the germans to establish a beach head. First they would have tried to take a port. Ports that are well defended (they&#x27;ve had 200 years at this point to build defences against the french....)<p>Second, should they take a port, they have to keep it stocked up with fuel, ammo and arms. All of which is very difficult when you being bombarded from sea, air and land.<p>d-day only worked because they had complete control of the air, and almost complete control of the sea. Sealion was nowhere near close to any of those.')
