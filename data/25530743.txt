Item(by='tomc1985', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608839008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25530388, text='This sort of thing is why people need to stop thinking that the digital world is analogous to our analog one.<p>In digital, information wants to be free and many kinds of resources are effectively unlimited. There is no material scarcity. Therefore, theft, in the digital world, can&#x27;t be the same as it is in our analog world.<p>To be fair, this also applies to copyright and peoples&#x27; foolish notion that they can protect data without a great amount of preventing otherwise normal &quot;physiological&quot; processes. (Ironically, rather than having a wake-up moment where people realize their folly, we&#x27;ve institutionalized these resource-scarcity regimes into resource-abundant versions in the digital world)<p>To summarize, info wants to be free, and since theft requires <i>extra</i> effort to deprive someone of what you stole, does that definition of theft really apply here? Or does it need to change given the context? And, as a secondary point, people like to think they can protect data but their brains are stuck in our analog, resource-scarce world')
