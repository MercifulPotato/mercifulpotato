Hopefully, the president elect will follow through on some vague campaign promises made related to this, but I can&#x27;t give credit until it actually happens.<p>On top of that, there are also other drugs involved in the war on drugs and facets of the war on drugs that are not moving at all (i.e. sentencing differences even after the &quot;fair sentencing act&quot; was passed, treating those caught up in the opioid pandemic as criminals rather than people with a disease, etc.).')
