Item(by='wzdd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608823281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527579, text='It&#x27;s fine to object to the increasing size, but the comment claimed that a BMW designer said that the big grilles are because Chinese customers want the driver in front &quot;to feel intimidated, as if the car and driver behind wanted to eat them&quot;.<p>Without a source, this comes across as racist. So far I haven&#x27;t been able to find such a source. The closest I&#x27;ve found is a quote from the lead designer saying that in Europe people want to blend in, but in the rest of the world they want to stand out, and the design follows that. The China connection seems to be extrapolation by journalists and bloggers (because cars with big grilles are popular in China), and the bit about intimidation seems to be fabricated entirely.')
