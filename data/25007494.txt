In Go it&#x27;s easy to pull in libraries to work with other services. Everything from pushing Route 53 changes to making automated changes to HTML documents in a web server. Build pipelines that require orchestrating other processes. Development servers.<p>I sometimes reach for Rust when there&#x27;s some more intense central algorithm or data structure I want to work with. This could be something like image manipulation or writing a compiler or parser. Writing a parser in Rust is a joy.<p>I&#x27;m going to make an unfair generalization: Go is more likely to get the job done, Rust is more likely to do the job well. Just my feelings on the matter.<p>As an illustration... if you are spawning a process, you don&#x27;t really care about how efficient you are constructing the strings for the argument list. If you are writing a compiler, you <i>do</i> care about how efficient your string manipulation is.')
