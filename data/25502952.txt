We definitely need more manufacturers. But just based on the incremental engineering  expertise Tesla has acquired over the years in manufacturing - especially now with the diecast, the data the hundreds and thousands of Tesla cars are capturing everyday, the increasingly vertical integration of their process, a decision maker like Musk, and most importantly, Apple&#x27;s history with Project Titan (which I happen to know something about), I&#x27;m not too optimistic of much happening in this direction. There is still nothing out there to indicate  Apple can handle it when the rubber hits the road at 80 mph. One area where I am slightly optimistic about Apple doing something potentially significant is in the battery space, in which case, it would compete with the likes of QuantumScape, and not Tesla, per se.')
