Even the official Pi foundation data sheet describes CM4 as for &quot;deeply embedded applications&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasheets.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;cm4&#x2F;cm4-datasheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasheets.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;cm4&#x2F;cm4-datasheet.pdf</a><p>I would also recommend to carefully examine low-cost x86 options, they often do come out ahead given they usually include all the stuff the Pi Foundation don&#x27;t supply you - a boot volume, case, power supply etc.')
