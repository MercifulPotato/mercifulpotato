I tried printing out a blank week chart and highlighting different periods of my own life. It needs work, but it&#x27;s a great form of visualization.<p>I remember when I was only 60% as old as I am now that I thought I would do a &quot;method of loci&quot; project about the years of my life mapped to numbered streets in San Francisco, photographing different objects representing different life events on street corners corresponding to the ages that they happened at. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get around to it at the time, and of course now it&#x27;s harder (to remember earlier parts of my life, and also to find high enough street numbers in the City!).')
