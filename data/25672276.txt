I was never very efficient at making bibliographies or sifting through academic papers, so I felt a perverse incentive to cite as few sources as possible.<p>the one exception was my teacher for a public policy elective. he considered any reasonable newspaper to be an acceptable source, and accepted a simple footnote with a link as a citation. the catch was that he would actually follow the links and dock points if we had misinterpreted the source or failed to address the source&#x27;s bias. I recall that students actually wrote some good papers in that class...')
