But too many people are not aware how much is crap and are pretty naive about using libraries. I don&#x27;t think it is an accident, that e.g. the Java universe has uncountable numbers of libraries and Java projects have unbelievable many dependencies and e.g. Lisp has a percived lack of libraries. There are many reasons for that, but also, that Lisp programmers tend to rely on libraries less.')
