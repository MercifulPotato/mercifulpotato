We were trying to expose an internal ECS Service to other services via an NLB. Things worked great, as long as the sending and receiving services didn&#x27;t end up on the same EC2 instance. Unfortunately this occurred fairly often, since the ECS scheduler wasn&#x27;t aware of that bizarre constraint (maybe we could have made it aware, but, that seems like a pretty brittle way to fix things).<p>Our resolution was to just fall back to an ELB. A bummer in that it didn&#x27;t support dynamic port registration (the service could only be on a single EC2 instance at a time, since it has a static port), but joyful in that we didn&#x27;t have spurious failures as an artifact of task packing.')
