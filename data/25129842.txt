Sure, it&#x27;s 42*F out, but that&#x27;s still heat energy that can be moved. This process is more efficient than converting electricity into heat because you get more heat energy in the room than the electric energy you put into the device.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Joule_heating#Heating_efficiency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Joule_heating#Heating_efficien...</a> explains it even better than I did.')
