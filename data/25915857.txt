I don&#x27;t agree on your definition of personal data. Phone numbers and email addresses of my contacts are personal information that don&#x27;t belong to me, I have merely unwritten consent to use them (but not to give them to every spammer).<p>But none of that seemed to be relevant to the Grindr fine. And one thing I should have probably mentioned before - I don&#x27;t know Grindr and how the subscription works there, but my opinion on paying(subscription) vs giving data away would also depend if there were additional features granted in the subscription (now thinking about it probably yes) or not. This would in my opinion qualify as forcing user into paying even for thing he might not necessarily want to just to protect own privacy.')
