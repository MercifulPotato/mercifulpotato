There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re asking me a question!  And curiosity about what their question is typically snipes my attention and disrupts my flow <i>more</i> than if they&#x27;d simply asked their question.  If they want to show consideration for my flow, I&#x27;d <i>much</i> rather have either have something in my email queue instead of a chat ping, or - if they must chat - a query along the lines of:<p>&gt; When you&#x27;re free - [some kind of question or request]?  No rush.<p>Or:<p>&gt; Do you happen to know off of the top of your head where to find XYZ?<p>I&#x27;ll leave chat pings unread for a minute if I&#x27;m in the middle of a thought.  Once I do read chat, it&#x27;s often easier for me to quickly answer (or redirect to a better resource), than it is to remember to ping them later, or wait for a second&#x2F;third&#x2F;fourth interruption later when I ask them to ping me after lunch&#x2F;a meeting&#x2F;dinner&#x2F;??? if I haven&#x27;t gotten back to them before then.')
