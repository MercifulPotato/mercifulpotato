It’s bad advice if you don’t want to learn C.<p>Why would you want to learn C? To better understand the machine at a fairly low level. I think there’s still a lot of value in that. I’ve found that programmers who never learned C often don’t fully understand how memory management works, for example (not that that necessarily makes them bad programmers!)<p>Most other non-garbage-collected languages would do the trick, like Rust or C++. But C arguably still has special value in that it’s a lot simpler than either of those -- no higher-level constructs or abstractions to distract you. Maybe Zig will be able to take over that role.')
