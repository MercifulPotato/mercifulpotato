You could use it I two modes: (1) One disc with additional out of band reed-solomon ECC. Create an iso that are smaller by a certain percentage than the medium you want to burn it to. Dvdisaster will create a new ISO that uses the full capacity of the medium and fill the remaining space with parity-information that protects the whole file system and all user files. (2) Put your parity information on the next disc you burn. A parity file is crated for the first disc you burn, this is later added to the file system of the second disc you burn. Repeat indefinitely. You always have the last yet-to-be-burned parity file on your computer and can thus recover bit-errors in every disc you have burned.')
