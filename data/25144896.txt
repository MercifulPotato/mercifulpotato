E.g. nuclear kamikaze UUVs&#x2F;smart torpedos, stealth cruise missiles, short range&#x2F;quick reaction strikes etc.<p>I think non-parity relationships are somewhat alien to us today, whereas the 50s and 60s were full of &quot;someone could nuke someone else with impunity&quot; periods.<p>And I guess I look at it as: MAD is preferable to a Pandora&#x27;s Box future where sides are continually researching, developing, and deploying new weapons and reevaluating their relative advantage. Advantage in an arms race being especially troubling because it&#x27;s use-it-or-lose-it -- e.g. the internal calls for the US to use nukes against China before they developed their own during the Korean War.<p>&gt; Would you argue that we would be better off if we fought conventional wars without body armor of any kind?<p>It&#x27;s absolutely a related question.<p>To some degree, yes. Or a corollary in whether it&#x27;s just to fight wars in which one side uses drones&#x2F;UVs and the other side uses people.<p>Modern wars end when one side&#x27;s will to continue it ceases.
