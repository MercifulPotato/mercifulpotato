I&#x27;d love to rediscover the joy of reading quality periodicals so I&#x27;ll read other comments here and try anything that looks good.<p>As for my experiences lately...<p>I subscribed to The Atlantic after reading it online.<p>The print edition is disappointing for the quality of its typography and illustrations.
