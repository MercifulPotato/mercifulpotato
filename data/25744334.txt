In fact, the existence of very crazy people on the platform shouldn&#x27;t be a platform problem, you can always let know authorities about any danger, report and ban users. If we apply the same rules for everyone, Amazon and Apple should be banning Twitter too, because you can see dozens of messages everyday of people death threatening others, in fact, you can still read old messages of politics inciting rioting, reporters doxxing other reporters, etc. and nothing happened since.')
