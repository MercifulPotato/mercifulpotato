It conjures visions of people running screaming in the street tearing their clothes off. I suppose the nearest we&#x27;ve had so far were panics such as mass buying of toilet paper and cleaning products.<p>We&#x27;ve had serious problems with mass delusions such as ant-vax,  chem trails and pizza-gate propagating through social media since long before Covid. Of course now there are similar memetic contagions that are Covid related such as the 5G conspiracy theories, but crazies have got to crazy.
