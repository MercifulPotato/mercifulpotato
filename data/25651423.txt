If the banks can borrow at negative interest rates they are strictly better borrowing the money and not lending it out compared to a 0% loan. Any profitable plan with a 0% loan in it would in theory be more profitable without the loan.<p>In econ-101 it doesn&#x27;t matter what the spread is, it isn&#x27;t in itself rational to lend at 0%. That is taking on risk with no gain.<p>There must be some strange contortions in place to make this work. Whatever a &quot;loan&quot; is these days is going to be a totally regulatory construct with little connection to what they used to be way back when.')
