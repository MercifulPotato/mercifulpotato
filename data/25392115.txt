I&#x27;m not an expert on plastic formulations, but the variety used for these products is not pleasant to touch, shows fingerprints like crazy, scratches easily, and breaks easily on top of sounding hollow.<p>The plastics used for electronics in the 90s didn&#x27;t exhibit these problems as much, generally being thicker with a nice matte textured finish. Perhaps the key to winning the public mind back over to plastic would be to mimic those 90s plastics.')
