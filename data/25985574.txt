Shortcuts always win. Like not just one given level we might try to look at, like our mental heuristics, but at EVERY level.<p>At its core, it&#x27;s basically saying &quot;truth&quot; is not energetically favoured in systems.<p>This gives me tons of pause for thought, in that I wonder how a truism like this might play out at the cultural level of organization, where evolution remains a force at play. I feel aware of the power of stories and lies to create simple narratives at all levels -- is this a manifestation of this sort of information energetics playing out? For e.g., the overton window being a constrained version of truth that [previously] created stability. Or the fact that democracy doesn&#x27;t appear to actually function according to the folk theory we all tell ourselves, but maybe the simple (fake) story of democracy is what makes it work.[1] Or how we deceive about our own internal state in order to keep social homeostasis with others. Or that truth maybe doesn&#x27;t have enough benefit to survive unless it has the cover of larger lies&#x2F;deceptions to offset its penalty...? So what lies allowed the dominance of science to operate up til now, and how might we be shifting that balance within our new digital landscape?<p>I dunno, I have some background in this stuff, but haven&#x27;t been in academia for a bit, so it&#x27;s a bit armchairy :)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Democracy-Realists-Elections-Responsive-Government&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0691178240" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Democracy-Realists-Elections-Responsiv...</a>')
