I was also an admin for a short period. Having been so immersed in the forums for so long, it blows my mind to think that so much internet culture originated on SA. They basically invented the now hugely popular meme format, though they were called image macros then. “tl;dr” and “pro tip” originated there. 4chan was a spin-off forum from their anime forum. I’m sure there’s more I’ve missed.<p>The allegations in the article against Lowtax are disturbing to say the least.')
