That&#x27;s why I think while this change is OK as a default, it&#x27;s problematic to not be overridable -- and even if it was just a default it should be communicated clearly as a change, so those affected (e.g. people relying on VPN under some regime) know about them.<p>Those people are not the typical user case, but it&#x27;s an important consideration still.<p>&gt;<i>An example of this is iphone vs android store policy, by default on Android you can not install untrusted APK&#x27;s or other stores, however inside the phone there is a simply way to disable this block. This is an example of a passive secure default. Where on iPhone it is simply impossible to disable this block</i><p>One problem with this duality is that people will disable the block, and then complain plus have their info&#x2F;data and those of others compromised etc, when they install malware at the first BS prompt that tells them to do so (to get some cool new game or some pirated stuff).<p>That is, it&#x27;s not just those &quot;knowing what they do&quot; that will bypass those kind of defaults....<p>Apple chose to go with the &quot;Most people don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, and if we allow it they will do it anyway&quot;, which is a defensible position. You use their OS knowing that they do that.<p>But this change now, was not the same kind or communicated as well.<p>&gt;<i>it is clear that apple intends to bring this type of Active Ownership control to the Mac ARM platform, this is just the first step, a warning shot if you will, of what is to come</i><p>If &quot;what is to come&quot; is a machine that &quot;just works&quot;, has no malware, but has to get its software from the App Store and&#x2F;or notarized by Apple, I&#x27;m fine with it. And hundreds of millions will probably also be.<p>Apple was never about tinkerers and customizations, they were always about cohesive, all-in-one, curated -- and that&#x27;s ever since the Apple II.<p>It&#x27;s not their fault that people who don&#x27;t like this model feel like they have to still stay with Apple.<p>It&#x27;s not 1999 anymore. Those days if they broke into your computer or if you got a virus you would lose some useless files and a few hours&#x2F;day to reinstall your Windows. Nowadays you can lose a lot, and with working from home etc becoming more the norm, even more so...')
