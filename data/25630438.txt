How do you with a finite amount of dollars to spend on advertising know if you are getting your money&#x27;s worth when you cannot connect a dollar spent on ad with incoming revenue?<p>The problem with attribution is that it&#x27;s entirely flawed. Just compare what Google Analytics reports for a campaign vs what Facebook is reporting for the same thing. They&#x27;ll give you different results and in most cases you probably shouldn&#x27;t trust either.<p>BUT, what they do is provide an easily accessible number that you can show your boss to show  you had results. This is massively flawed but most marketers don&#x27;t understand the mechanics of advertising or tracking well enough to understand why they&#x27;re reporting garbage data.')
