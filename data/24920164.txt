Whatever they are doing to parse&#x2F;steal other websites data to show as snippets is only complicated because there is no schema. Look what Amazon did, they made people implement &quot;skill&quot; so it&#x27;s all API now.<p>All that was solved for majority of use cases and leaped ahead by Amazon in under 5 years with Alexa, deployed as tiny hardware.<p>Remove click tracking and top 1000 sites from Google and it will be shit, no amount of ML&#x2F;AI dance will solve that. Apple can just do top 1000 sites from each country with click tracking (to track which result users are preferring) and significantly cut traffic sent to Google. They already try to do this with Siri.<p>Bing was chicken(user) and egg problem (click tracking to optimize results).')
