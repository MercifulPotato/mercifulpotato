What are important considerations &#x2F; differences relative to the small convection oven I already have?<p>If air frying is a fundamentally new cooking technique, then I may not be able to apply a wealth of cooking knowledge &amp; intuition when using it, other than basic food chemistry. If it&#x27;s a rebranded convection oven, then I can decide if a different form factor is worth it for things I already know how to do.<p>Does that make sense?')
