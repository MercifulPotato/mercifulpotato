Suppose you are building a ML decider which can stop a production line if it sees defective products. If you are choosing between a decision tree and a neural net, one of the things to consider is that with a DT you can look at the tree the model comes up with a d say, okay if the mass of the widget is low, we reject.<p>With a NN, you can&#x27;t see why things are rejected in the same way.<p>Some tasks benefit from having more explainable models, some it doesn&#x27;t matter.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just a buzzword or trying to enforce political control.')
