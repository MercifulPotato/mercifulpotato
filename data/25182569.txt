Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[25183370], score=None, time=1606093304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181627, text='&gt; <i>The contrast between &#x27;black&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; is still extreme relative to what people normally have around them.</i><p>It&#x27;s actually the opposite. The truth is, our eyes are able to easily register extreme levels of contrast -- clearly taking in a bright sunlit day through the window next to a dark but still clearly visible interior.<p>Computer screens (and film and camera sensors) don&#x27;t achieve <i>anything</i> close to the level of contrast our eyes can take in, which is why things like exposure and blowout require so much careful attention -- why you simply can&#x27;t take a photo of a bright landscape in the window of a dark room without artificial-looking HDR.<p>If you stand in an office and look around, it&#x27;s not like computer screens stand out as blazing white with inky black figures on them. To the contrary — they fit in rather harmoniously in terms of brightness. (And in dark rooms, we tend to reduce brightness in order to keep the harmony.) The idea that computer screens have extreme levels of contrast in comparison with the surroundings is simply not true — it&#x27;s <i>entirely</i> the opposite.')
