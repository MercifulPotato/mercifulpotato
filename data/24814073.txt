Basically you can get a dell for $1000 and it will fall apart or you can buy the same machine for $1400 and it wont, and if it does, they show up the next day and fix it or replace it. I sometimes wonder if they actually do quality binning or have a different production line. But basically a Dell costs $400 more than you think. And they are fantastic, in my experience.<p>I was in the UK on business when my keyboard broke, and the next day a chap showed up with a UK keyboard. When I pointed out it was a US keyboard. Didn&#x27;t bat an eye, just walked back out to his van and came back with a US one.')
