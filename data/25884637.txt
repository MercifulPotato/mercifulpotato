I went through their automated account recovery process and tried to get in touch with a human to the best of my ability, but no luck after hours of effort.<p>It really sucks, I wish there was I way I could&#x27;ve paid $50 to them so that a real human could review my case, I&#x27;d be happy to make the payment given that it&#x27;s a free service and I realize that mistakes like this can happen. But I guess they&#x27;d be criticized if they were to implement something like this, not to mention the incentive to start blocking many more accounts.<p>As it stands, the $ value of each customer is less than the cost associated with manually reviewing cases, so a financial decision is being made. But I wonder if it&#x27;s a bit short-sighted given the PR and goodwill that could come from doing it properly. Given their monopoly status it probably doesn&#x27;t factor much into their decision making, though.')
