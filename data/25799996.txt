There&#x27;s definitely too much to list at this point, but in short, Windows has significantly ramped up their user-hostile surveillance and privacy-invasive functions, pushes many features that no one wants such as excessive advertising and tracking, constantly forces what Microsoft wants onto the user (e.g. constantly &#x27;asking&#x27; users to use Microsoft Edge, Onedrive, many others), has many annoying patterns such as forcing updates+reboots excessively often, and in my opinion also has terrible UI&#x2F;UX. Some of these points are a little subjective, but I think that the general pattern of changes over the last decade has been very clear.')
