That being said, we’re early in our journey and still have a ways to go.<p>As mentioned in the original post here, at the core of Opstrace is Cortex (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cortexproject.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cortexproject.io</a>). We know that Cortex scales well to hundreds of millions of unique active metrics, so depending on the exact characteristics of your workload, the fundamentals should be there.<p>However, Cortex is a serious service to run and if you were to DIY it would require operations work that you currently don’t have with Wavefront. This is the problem we’re trying to solve—making these great OSS solutions easier to use for people like you.<p>Opstrace is made to be exposed on the internet (which is optional of course), so you can easily run it in an isolated account to keep it safe from all other operations. And in fact, this is the configuration we recommend for production use.<p>Regarding “100s of AWS accounts and 10s of payers”... does that include any form of multi-tenant isolation? We support multi-tenancy out of the box to enable controlling rate limits and authorization limits for different groups. We’d need to talk in more detail about that. If you’d like to do that privately, please shoot me at chris@opstrace.com. We’re of course happy to continue the discussion here with you as well.')
