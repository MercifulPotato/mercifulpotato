You say that a civil defamation lawsuit by Dominion is suppressing dissent, and that Giuliani should be <i>criminally</i> prosecuted for unspecified crimes. You do realize that the latter has a much larger chilling effect, right? It&#x27;s not consistent to argue against a civil case for being too chilling, and then argue for a criminal case over the same conduct.')
