At the very least your nihilistic zero-sum America-first attitude is morally indistinguishable from Trumpism, even if in your head it sounds more noble and strategic.<p>First of all, China has the largest population in the world. They <i>should</i> be the biggest economy in the world, regardless of how evil their government is.<p>Second of all, if you were truly motivated by a noble desire to stop global fascism, you should be glad that South Korea has this technology instead of the US! The point should be that <i>democratic</i> countries counter China’s power, not that it should be US v. China. In particular, not only is South Korea more directly threatened by Chinese authoritarianism, but their government is far more stable and democratic than the US. The US has only been a democracy since 1965 and, unlike South Korea, our democracy is rapidly decaying.<p>But it seems that your nativism is leading you to greedily assert the US should be the most powerful country in the world because something something China fascists, despite the fact that we just saw an attempted fascist takeover of Congress by US citizens. It’s deeply hypocritical and indefensible.')
