One had 16-bit char and 24-bit pointer, the other 8 and 32 bits. Of course, the struct padding, bit field packing, char signedness, etc were also different. By the way, their compilers were very good at two things: optimizing shifts and masks into bit access operations and sticking to the standard where it is the least intuitive. C was originally intended to be a high level systems programming language and this stuff would have been written in assembly, and it shows.')
