The social norm for most transaction commerce seems to be, that if the fees are paid and the services isn&#x27;t &quot;abused&quot; (in a criminal sense) then the private beliefs of the purchaser don&#x27;t matter. The grocer should still sell lettuce to heinous racists.<p>But we are starting to break that norm, beginning with the natural wedges: commerce where the service or product _IS_ enabling the purchasing in a direct way. The question is if we can stop at _direct_ enablement or whether it will continue to indirect forms.<p>A scary example would be for Square to start refusing to process payments for ideological reasons.')
