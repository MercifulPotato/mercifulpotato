Black people are very few and far between, so there isn&#x27;t much pronounced racism against them. There&#x27;s a lot of racism against Albanians, Pakistanis, Syrians, etc, though.<p>Interestingly, black people here don&#x27;t tend to commit much crime. It might be because they&#x27;re too few to be in the media, but I&#x27;m realizing I&#x27;ve never heard of a crime here being committed by a black person.')
