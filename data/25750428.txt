So they boldly refuse to continue misrepresenting him as a co-founder on their <i>about</i> page.<p>If so, I would like to nominate Reddit for the Silicon Valley Courage Award. (However, I think Facebook is the clear front-runner for clamping down on &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; disinformation now that both houses of Congress and the presidency are under Democratic control.)')
