Pretty much every week is statistically Very Unlikely.<p>But it is 20% higher than the background rate. Quitting a job as a day labourer and going into roofing is something like a 400% death rate. People voluntarily subject themselves to some pretty outsized risks.<p>&gt; Wikipedia says that the U.S. had 291,557 combat deaths during WWII...<p>That is about a decade worth of car accidents. So on the one hand, horrific. On other other hand, the raw number of deaths is not the biggest issue at play. It didn&#x27;t stop Americans marching over to the other side of the world to fight people.')
