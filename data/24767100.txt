Ofc people from Sichuan and Shanghai love to preserve their dialect. Plus you got the cantos and hokkien&#x2F;teochew&#x2F;hakka and even changsharen.<p>In any case, my recommendation would be to stay with Mandarin and go deep on it. Learning a dialect afterwards is quite straightforward and you can be 80-90% proficient esp with understanding by just developing a sound mapping of each character from dialect-&gt;mandarin.<p>The common idioms you&#x27;ll pick up with enough exposure.<p>You&#x27;ll never regret learning Mandarin first - you&#x27;ll be able to read&#x2F;listen to the news and your relatives will understand you. Whereas if you try to learn dialect first you&#x27;ll find it harder due to the less set of materials AND less people to talk to.<p>A lot of chinese people joke that they learned their 2nd&#x2F;3rd... dialect by doing KTV and there&#x27;s definitely some truth in that')
