Despite the calls to violence, its clear that we hate each other&#x27;s countries, but not each other&#x27;s peoples.<p>Well... by and large anyway. I&#x27;m sure there are assholes who actually wish death personally on both sides. But there&#x27;s an understanding of the global political stage. There&#x27;s still a way to communicate. I think there&#x27;s a path forward for diplomacy even in these tense times.<p>----------<p>Knowing these things really helps put ideas into context. Ex: Iranians got really pissed off at the movie 300 for example (after all: Iranians see themselves as the Persians. So seeing a bunch of Persians get slaughtered by the &quot;Western-world Greeks&quot; on a big Hollywood movie is not exactly nice to them either...)<p>These sorts of things are just accepted. Iranians know that the Persians are by-and-large demonized by the history books that our culture teaches, and we know the same for their side. These conflicts and tensions have been around for literally centuries and millennia.')
