Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24805298], score=None, time=1602883631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804487, text='&gt; Some people, including both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, have called for a complete repeal of Section 230 at various times in the last year<p>AFAICT, that characterization of Biden&#x27;s position is based entirely on a single oral interview response, which quite arguably was not saying that the law should be repeated but that, on the facts of Facebook&#x27;s specific conduct, and that of some unspecified other platforms, their conduct should be excluded from Section 230 protections because they were knowingly engaging in misinformation.<p>Note that Section 230 protections in case law are broader than what is provided on the face of the statute; in addition to the &quot;publisher or speaker&quot; protection in Section 230(c)(1); courts have extended it to also prevent liability as a distributor for content, IIRC by synthesizing 230(c)(1) and the good-faith blocking rule in Section 230(c)(2) and some legislative history to add the not-express-in-statute rule that sites are also not liable even as a distributor for the material they don&#x27;t block, with some exceptions. Biden&#x27;s statement is consist with restricting Section 230 to what is says on the face, which would be <i>only</i> removing publisher&#x2F;speaker liability, not distributor liability (which comes about when the distributor has knowledge or legal notice of the legal problem with the content.)')
