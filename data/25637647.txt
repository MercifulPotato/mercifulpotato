Good thing restaurants don&#x27;t count on alcohol sales to stay afloat.&quot;<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the take-away alcohol itself, the problem is what people do with it.<p>We routinely get people around our area (East London) who buy take-away beer - stand two meters away from the pub - and drink it with their friends. It promotes people spreading COVID.<p>The UK government aren&#x27;t confident enough to actually curtail people&#x27;s behaviour (eg mask wearing in public, fining people etc) that they stop the things that people inherently do.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great policy, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.<p>The science itself is all in the messaging and tone.. but they make it easy to get out of with &quot;valid reasons&quot;.
