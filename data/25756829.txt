Is it all of the compiler diagnostics and semantic analysis, or just unoptimized code? WIP to find out.<p>(I literally just went over a perf record of a linux kernel build with a teammate that&#x27;s going to look into this more; I organized the LLVM miniconf at plumbers which is the video linked in the phoronix article in the grand parent post; my summer intern did the initial profiling work).<p>ToT LLVM, linux-next x86_64 defconfig: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;hNwwy2K1Gh7Uc2D67" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;hNwwy2K1Gh7Uc2D67</a> (yes, I know about disabling kptr_restrict)<p>Our next big project is to look into lazy parsing.')
