E.g. for Hanoi:<p><pre><code>    max = 1 &lt;&lt; no_of_discs;\n    for (x = 1; x &lt; max; x++)\n        printf(&quot;move a disc from %d to %d\\n&quot;, (x&amp;x-1)%3, ((x|x-1)+1)%3);\n</code></pre>\nIn the case of fibonacci, the iterative solution is exponentially faster as well.<p>Perhaps quicksort is a better example that cannot be easily expressed with iteration.')
