They run ECC memory, but it&#x27;s hard to tell if it is running in ECC mode. Even some of the tools that identify ECC is running will say it is, even when it isn&#x27;t, because the motherboard will report it is, even when it isn&#x27;t. ECC isn&#x27;t a qualified metric on the consumer boards, hence all the confusion.')
