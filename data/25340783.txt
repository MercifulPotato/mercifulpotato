Item(by='Seb-C', descendants=None, kids=[25343924], score=None, time=1607393389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334641, text='I agree with automating it, but I also have seen automated styles going too far, more often than not.<p>Automated styling should be kept minimal, like checking names and indentation. Absolute rules does not work because then you cannot deviate from it even if it is appropriate in the right situation.<p>The standard JavaScript checkers nowadays are ridiculously strict and forces me to spend time writing a less readable code. For example yesterday my code was invalid because I did not write properties of an object alphabetically. So I had to convert this:<p><pre><code>    {\n        host: ,\n        port: ,\n\n        key: ,\n\n        username: ,\n        password: ,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nInto this mess:<p><pre><code>    {\n        host: ,\n        key: ,\n        password: ,\n        port: ,\n        username: ,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWith tslint I cannot even execute my code if the formatting is invalid. So if I write a console.log or forget to add a space between the slash and the code I commented, the compilation crashes.')
