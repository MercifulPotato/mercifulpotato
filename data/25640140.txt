All you guys trying to find excuses to keep on going as normal because “the economy” are engaged in myopic, short-termist  thinking. If the health service is smashed and nobody can do anything because the rate of infection is out of control then <i>that</i> ultimately destroys the economy. You have to see <i>the big picture</i>. How long will it be and how much evidence do we have to see before you will just <i>pipe down</i> and get with the program.
