RIAA is arguing YouTube-dl is a tool designed to download copywritten material from YouTube because YouTube-dl included test cases in their own code for downloading copywritten material from YouTube.  The existence of other streaming sites or other functionality of youtube-dl is completely irrelevant.  YouTube does not need to be a party to this, the RIAA is just connecting the dots to make their own case.  Their claim is that YouTube-dl is a tool for downloading copywritten material from YouTube because the creators of YouTube-dl <i>literally tested for that in the codebase</i>.<p>It’s a pretty easy case to make.  Any other use of the tool is again, completely and totally irrelevant.<p>To be even more clear I’m sure YouTube-dl is a useful tool and I think such things should exist.  However, this is an important lesson when making and owning these tools.  Don’t do the RIAAs work for them.')
