You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s not always easy, but you can get a LOT further with 1) well-defined channels 2) good use of pinning 3) good use of &quot;saving&quot; messages for yourself.<p>It helps that Slack&#x27;s search is actually pretty good imo, and usually quite fast.<p>But yeah -- it can&#x27;t be your only tool. If you don&#x27;t have a better system for long-form documentation, you&#x27;re gonna lose a lot of important stuff.')
