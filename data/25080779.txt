Item(by='jb1991', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605261564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079634, text='&gt; The only relevant math I need is that humans have done fine with animal fats for thousands of years.<p>That&#x27;s true, however, humans have been spending days mostly inside, both living and working, for much, much less time than that, which dramatically affects how much natural D they are getting from the sun.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some research on the overall exposure to sunlight, on average, a person has received over the last century. My guess is that in very recent decades, especially the last couple, as working remotely and not needing to leave the house even to commute, sunlight exposure has plummeted.<p>Also, the risks of sun exposure have been widely reported over recent decades and advances in powerful sunblock have made even those who do spend time outdoors less likely to absorb the sun&#x27;s rays.<p>So to place it in the context of how humans have lived for thousands of years ignores the realities of modern times.')
