I think the last time I touched anyone was when I hugged my mom when she visited me 3 months ago, and before that I don&#x27;t think I touched anyone for the 6 months since I broke up with my gf.<p>After finishing college I moved to basically the middle of nowhere for my tech job without knowing anyone in the area. Wasn&#x27;t proactive enough making friends, and because of my gf at the time I didn&#x27;t seek out any women. We broke up right as the pandemic started, which may have been the worst possible time.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s been so long that I touched anyone, but I don&#x27;t get touch deprived as often as I would have expected. Sure there are times occasionally where I feel really lonely, but so far it&#x27;s been pretty easy to brush that off. However, taking care of my mental health has been nearly a full time job. I make sure to exercise daily, I picked up guitar and mountain biking, and I blocked all social media I see as toxic (reddit, youtube, facebook. HN is okay in moderation). I my sleep schedule in check with targeted melatonin and bluelight filters. Keeping up with old friends and family is also essential.<p>My running theory is that touch is certainly a positive, but it isn&#x27;t essential if the other parts of your life are kept in shape. Although shortening that list of mental health tasks to something more manageable does sound enticing. I&#x27;ve never been good at dating though, and with the double whammy of it being quarantine and not having a local friend group I&#x27;m not really sure how to solve that problem. Dating advice might be a bit off topic for HN though, considering temporarily unblocking reddit.')
