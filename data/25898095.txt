Don Hopkins did a writeup: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@donhopkins&#x2F;the-story-of-sun-microsystems-pizzatool-2a7992b4c797" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@donhopkins&#x2F;the-story-of-sun-microsystems...</a><p>(One question: that writeup says Solaris 2, but I think I might&#x27;ve used PizzaTool under OpenWindows 2.0 on SunOS 4.1.1 on sun4c.)<p>Inspired by PizzaTool at the time, but my employer having a gazillion dollars of workstations and servers, yet none with a fax card (and my group having daily ad hoc lunch outings), I wrote LunchTool for the Suns.  It was a GUI with a database of local lunch places, which someone could choose to decide on a lunch location and time and such, then print a fancy announcement sign to hang where everyone would see it.  (Not everyone checked email, and I liked typesetting and programming PostScript anyway.)  I was most proud of the bitmap burger icon.<p>When Google first solicited third-party apps for Android (it might&#x27;ve been a contest?), I almost stole the idea of PizzaTool, since it still seemed like a fun idea, as a gimmick or experience.  Not that one really needed to see composited pineapple bits, to know whether they wanted it on their real-world pizza, but I thought the visual made adding toppings fun, and not a bad early demo for Android.')
