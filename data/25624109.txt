It is a push to throw common human sensibilities about aesthetics, symmetry, and natural forms out in favour of ugly monstrosities that viscerally remind one of Communism. It discards all ergonomics, any allusion to sacred geometry, and any hope of timelessness.<p>It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s ugly, it weather badly and leaks water all over, and shows stains no matter how much you pressure-wash it. None of this trash is going to exist in a thousand years because nobody is going to want to maintain it for any longer than is necessary.<p>The only way to make it look good is to cover it with trees and gardens, but that same effort applied to an underlying building that actually looks good would have 10x the benefit, so it&#x27;s not really a saving grace at all. I&#x27;ve spent significant time in what you might call some of the very best examples of brutalism, and it&#x27;s only palatable on a perfectly sunny day; but on a typically grey day that exemplifies the kinds of places this sort of thing is built in, it is a reflection of the ennui and despair that pervades the soul on a dark winter&#x27;s day.<p>Destroy this trash and build something that reflects the human who needs to look at it day in and day out.')
