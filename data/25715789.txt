Is it not fair to allow companies to choose _not_ to support hate groups?  Regardless of whether they have been successfully prosecuted in a cour of law or not.<p>Should we not have the freedom of choosing with whom we would like to associate?<p>Is it not hypocritical to expect companies to provide resources to hate groups on the grounds of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; when those same groups have shown, by their actions, that they themselves oppose freedom of expression and expel anyone who voices disagreement?<p>You appear to be confusing the government and private companies here.  Government must follow a far more stringent set of rules in which certain determinations have to be done by courts.  Private companies are under no such obligations when it comes to enabling speech.<p>You are arguing that one should be able to compel people to promote hate speech.  May may not intend to argue that case, but by what is presumably thoughtlessness, that is what you appear to be doing.')
