Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610365073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726539, text='&gt; you had software-problems with iOS<p>I didn&#x27;t have any probs with sofrware while using iPhones. I was jailbreaking them, installing a similar firewall and had my mind at ease. I would go to Apple in a heartbeat if they stopped lying and allowed rooted&#x2F;jailbroken phones.<p>It is nice to see that on a comment 95% on Android people still downvote me for (justifiably) trashing Apple. They got caught cheating. Then they got caught lying. Then they were found guilty. Apple fanboys are having a party downvoting. \nFun fact: &quot;HN karma&quot; is virtual, while the $1k that they pay Apple every year is a REAL number. Keep rocking folks. I guess when someone spits on your coffee you downvote the commenter and keep going back to the same coffee place, right?

A friend suggested the 7min workout by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Nice app, free, has these simple 7mins workouts, also has warm-up&#x2F;cool-down if you want the extra 7-8mins.. very nice. Loving it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need internet connection to fully operate (workouts). I don&#x27;t need it to &quot;back up my progress in their cloud&quot;. So it stays offline (forever). It takes 1min when I install that new&#x2F;extra app to bolt it down and have it behave just as I want (and does not disrupt me with notifications or leak data or kill my battery).')
