This blog post is appalling. I completely disagree with it.<p>Consider this excerpt from the blog post:<p>&gt; But DKIM authenticity is great! Don’t we want to be able to authenticate politicians’ leaked emails?<p>&gt; Modern DKIM deployments are problematic because they incentivize a specific kind of crime: theft of private emails for use in public blackmail and extortion campaigns. An accident of the past few years is that this feature has been used primarily by political actors working in a manner that many people find agreeable — either because it suits a partisan preference, or because the people who got “caught” sort of deserved it.<p>&gt; But bad things happen to good people too. If you build a mechanism that incentivizes crime, sooner or later you will get crimed on.<p>The author seems to be arguing that if after a certain point it becomes impossible to verify whether an email was genuine or not, that would somehow be a good thing.<p>This reasoning seems harmful to me. It&#x27;s incredible that the author treats this moral argument as self evident. Let me state my objections clearly.<p>1. The truthfulness and reliability of the historical record is important. The fact that politicians are protected from blackmail when they write incriminating emails is utterly insignificant by comparison. Is the principle being defended that protecting politicians from blackmail is stronger than a public interest in having a historical record?<p>2. Making historical emails impossible to authenticate after a certain period of time makes it more difficult to prosecute crimes. It helps criminals, the very thing the author claims to be trying to avoid. If a politician, or anyone for that matter, sends an incriminating email which is evidence of the intent to commit a crime, why on earth would you want to make it easier to cover your tracks?<p>Seriously, can someone present a moral argument for why this should be adopted? It seems only harmful to me.')
