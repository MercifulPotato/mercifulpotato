Item(by='LukeShu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608758897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521937, text='What you call &quot;seamless-editable-by-default&quot; is my <i>biggest</i> frustration with notion; I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as &quot;seamless-editable&quot; though, I&#x27;d characterize it as &quot;accidental edits&quot;.  Like the OP, my org has taken to locks&#x2F;unlocks all the time.  (And this is extra frustrating, because the load on &quot;unlock&quot; is often worse than the actual page load!)<p>Several months ago, I got so fed up with edit-by-default that I started a chat in the feedback thing in the lower-right.  What I learned from that chat is that other people weren&#x27;t using Notion the same way we are.  We use it largely as a wiki &amp; knowledge base; it hadn&#x27;t occurred to me that other people aren&#x27;t using it as a knowledge base, which is almost by definition read-heavy.<p>But I also want to point out that editable-by-default is exacerbated because other aspects of the UI have trained me to have behaviors that result in accidental edits.<p>----<p>Me:<p><i>&gt; I&#x27;m sick of making accidental edits.</i><p><i>&gt; 9 times out of 10, when I go to page it&#x27;s to read it not to edit it. Editing is rare enough that when I want to do it I&#x27;m 100% down with having to click an &quot;edit&quot; button or something to explicitly switch to an editing mode.</i><p><i>&gt; This isn&#x27;t a permissions thing. I should be allowed to edit all of these pages. It&#x27;s a UI thing that it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally edit.</i><p><i>&gt; This is an account-scoped problem. It shouldn&#x27;t be broader; other people in the org shouldn&#x27;t be affected by my preferences. It shouldn&#x27;t be narrower; I don&#x27;t want to have to configure this for each page.</i><p><i>&gt; Many parts of the UI seem to be designed to cause accidental edits. Positioning the cursor at just the right spot can introduce an empty line. It&#x27;s easy to accidentally drag something when highlighting text to copy. Clicking a link to another Notion page opens in the same tab normally, so I get in the habit of middle-clicking them to open in a new tab. But if it&#x27;s an external link, then for some moronic reason middle-click doesn&#x27;t open it (just use damn `&lt;a&gt;` elements! stop breaking the web!), and then I get middle-click paste (because X11) and I end up accidentally pasting some garbage in to the page-- _because of a behavior that other parts of the UI trained me to do_.</i><p><i>&gt; I&#x27;m sorry for the rant, but it seems like such a basic thing, and it&#x27;s been so frustrating.</i><p><i>&gt; Like, my ideal resolution is you point out a setting on a page that I missed and I say &quot;nevermind, cheers&quot;.</i><p>Gerard:<p><i>&gt; (a lengthy reply explaining how to use page locks and database locks)</i><p>Me:<p><i>&gt; Re: Page lock: That&#x27;s not a solution, for a bunch of reasons that I&#x27;d tried to express in the original message:</i><p><i>&gt; - I don&#x27;t want to manage this for individual pages, that is error-prone and tedious; if there&#x27;s a page that doesn&#x27;t have it set, I won&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s not set and risk making accidental edits. I don&#x27;t want to have to remember to turn it back on after making an edit.</i><p><i>&gt; - I don&#x27;t want prevent others from editing it, just myself</i><p><i>&gt; - I don&#x27;t want others turning off the page lock to affect me. I don&#x27;t want to have to train everyone to always set it after editing a page.</i><p><i>&gt; Re: Database lock: I&#x27;m not sure about other parts of the org, but I don&#x27;t really use database pages, so that&#x27;s not of interest to me.</i><p>Winnie:<p><i>&gt; Hello Luke,</i><p><i>&gt; Winnie here, jumping in for Gerard. Thanks for sharing your thoughtful feedback!</i><p><i>&gt; We don&#x27;t currently have page setting that lets you be on a viewing mode and have some sort of prompt if you want to edit a page. Itâ€™s a legit use case, though, and definitely something we want to support in the future.</i><p><i>&gt; This would totally help those that are creating wikis or knowledgebase, so I&#x27;ve passed this to our product team to take to heart for further improvements.</i>')
