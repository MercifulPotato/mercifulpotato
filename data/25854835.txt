Why would an anti-virus product accidentally flagging their Universal Binary block them from releasing a native Apple Silicon version? Of all the Macs in use, I&#x27;d have to imagine that only a small percentage are using that specific anti-virus software much less any anti-virus software at all. It might cause them some headaches with specific people who are using that software but why extend that all the way to blocking the release indefinitely?')
