They usually have access to MP-only phone numbers to sort out regular snafus (often immigration related). But if you’ve been caught in a systematic issue that the government created, and your MP belongs to that party, your MP is unlikely to take any action whatsoever.<p>You can also email the prime minister and sometimes they’ll forward it to the Minister responsible and then they <i>have</i> to reply. Just make sure to phrase it as a non-systemic issue when it was a systemic issue they created ;)')
