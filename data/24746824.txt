Even the name was a stupid marketing tack-on.<p>Yet it stuck and kept going even when people became sick of it. It has reinvented itself several times over, and in spite of the emergence of multiple superior technologies that were specifically targeted at web-development, it still stands at the top of hill.<p>I guess it would be properly ironic that something designed for mathematics would take down javascript for web-dev, but I doubt it. It would be amusing though.')
