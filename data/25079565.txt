No need to download a separate desktop app or CLI tool, just add the chrome extension and add a button to youtube.<p>I decided to add the Sia SkyNet&#x2F;SkyDB integration as part of their ongoing hackathon. It adds a nice storage mechanism to save the converted files to make downloading faster in the future (for all users). In the event the Sia service is unavialable the extension will continue to work.')
