All I really wanted was a basic place to live, enough food on the table, and a reasonable expectation that that&#x27;d continue into the future.  My job was already doing what I would do for fun beforehand.<p>&quot;Would your experienced well-being in 2020 be lower if you were making $100K&#x2F;yr?&quot;<p>Yes, because those things - food &amp; housing security - are increasingly precarious on $100K&#x2F;year now.  You can still live on $100K&#x2F;year in the Bay Area, but you&#x27;re a couple years of rent increases from being priced out, and forget homeownership.')
