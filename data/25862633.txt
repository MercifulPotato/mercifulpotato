I abused my body by basically not moving throughout my 20s, and even once I got in shape I was prone to various injuries. The PT got me through a lower back injury, a hip injury, a shoulder injury, and a leg injury. These were not caused (except for the back) by traumas (in the case of the back, trauma exacerbated an existing issue), but mostly by some combination of weak muscles, poor form, poor flexibility, or overuse (overuse <i>for me</i>, a person in even marginally better shape wouldn&#x27;t have had issues at my activity level). I kept up a lot of the things I did&#x2F;learned there and, other than the back which will be a perennial issue, have not had any recurrence.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of benefit to finding someone that teaches you both <i>what</i> to do and <i>how</i> to do it, and is also better informed and more competent than most fitness trainers. The good ones will also walk you through a basic physiology course so you can understand the <i>why</i> of it all (why did I become injured, why does this prevent or reduce the risk of a future injury).')
