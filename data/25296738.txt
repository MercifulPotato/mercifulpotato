It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve seen one, but the card looks a bit larger than the original. More recent PCI network cards had gotten down to one main chip, plus just enough board to plug it in and fit the riser slot.<p>I do wonder a bit about the utility of cloning something made in the millions or at hundreds of thousands. Is there more to this project than a drop-in replacement?')
