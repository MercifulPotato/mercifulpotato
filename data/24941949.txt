I have a slightly more positive impression than you.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s true that his thing is meta-journalism with dollops of amusingly worded outrage - &quot;the first pebbles from the towering Matterhorn of bullshit that was the Steele dossier&quot; was an enjoyable sentence in a recent article.<p>But it isn&#x27;t just opinion. He backs up his statements with references, facts, summaries of what&#x27;s going on and generally puts what&#x27;s happening in context, which is exactly what a journalist is meant to do. I can&#x27;t possibly follow the whirlwind of immediately forgotten &quot;scandals&quot; that typify American political news, nor can I or do I want to spend all my time watching CNN or obsessively following other US news outlets. I&#x27;m not even in the US. But the summarisation of what&#x27;s happening Taibbi does is useful to me because the meta-story of what&#x27;s happening with the distribution of news is interesting and relevant. For instance, I learned about how the US media were ignoring the Hunter Biden story via Taibbi. I&#x27;m not interested in Hunter Biden but I am interested in the descent of the US media landscape into being an arm of the Democrats. That&#x27;s what Taibbi (and Greenwald) are currently providing, and it&#x27;s worth paying for.')
