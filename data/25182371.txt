Blade Runner didn&#x27;t open with &quot;Yes, Rachel is a replicant&quot;.<p>You were confused after 5 seconds _because_ of the way he chose to write his story. It&#x27;s proof that it was &quot;readable&quot; and well written because you reacted like that. Like you, I spent the first 2&#x2F;3rds of the post wondering what &quot;gone&quot; meant. When I got to the bit where he came out and said &quot;dead&quot;, the whole of the previous ambiguity and confusion resolved in a quite powerful way, almost as though I&#x27;d been internally hoping &quot;gone&quot; just meant &quot;they drifted apart after stopping working so closely together&quot;. It hit me like a slap when the truth was revealed, which made the feeling of compassion for Ryan&#x27;s loss and sorry even more bittersweet. I totally appreciated this style. _My_ &quot;personal take&quot; is that your personal take is based on a misunderstanding of the medium you&#x27;re reading and the authors intentions. (Perhaps not a totally unexpected misunderstanding, given the site we&#x27;re on and the more usual type of articles HN links to. But I doubt you have too much difficulty getting your head into &quot;API documentation&quot; or &quot;political opinion&quot; mode in the first few sentences if an article, I just don&#x27;t quite understand why you (and a few other comments) didn&#x27;t work out &quot;Oh, a personal story piece&quot; and either read it in that mindset or click back if they&#x27;re not your thing.)<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ve never read many murder mysteries? Or watched many crime or medical tv series? Or played Cluedo(&#x2F;Clue)? Do you think each round of that game should open with &quot;So Professor Plumb did it in the library with the candlestick. Right, you start.&quot; Should CSI open with &quot;So we convicted him on DNA evidence found in the back seat of the Uber we linked to his credit card&quot;?')
