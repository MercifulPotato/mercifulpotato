I understand they are comparing single threaded speed.<p>FWIW, the 100W i9-10900k isn&#x27;t even Intel&#x27;s fastest single-threaded chip: that&#x27;s the i7-1165G7 (a 28W part). Intel&#x27;s desktop stuff is ancient: they&#x27;re effectively still just Skylake (2015) derivatives; for single-threaded stuff the more modern designs they&#x27;re shipping on mobile (Ice Lake and later) beat the desktop parts because their IPC is that much faster.<p>Power doesn&#x27;t really help single-threaded performance, aside from wide vector units, nowadays.')
