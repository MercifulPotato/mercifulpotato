Sure, they could add a Debian mode. But you&#x27;d also need a Red Hat mode, Apple mode (and I don&#x27;t know - do you need a homebrew mode that&#x27;s different from the default mode?), Windows mode, etc. I think it&#x27;s equally fair to say that the ecosystems just haven&#x27;t solved the dependency management problem flexibly enough for everyone. Not everyone needs to or wants to support things for 10 years in order to have a Red Hat mode unless Red Hat is picking up that burden for them or paying them.')
