They&#x27;d make the decision once, hopefully follow best Docker practices (unprivileged user, multi-stage builds, etc.), and have documentation available for how to integrate the setup with IDEs, work with volumes, etc.<p>Once this initial adoption hurdle is overcome, IME the productivity gains are greater than the issues of dealing with Docker. It becomes trivial to setup CI&#x2F;CD, onboard new developers and integrate the app into other workflows.<p>Docker and containers in general have become mature enough to prove their use case and benefits, so the cargo cult argument doesn&#x27;t hold weight for me.')
