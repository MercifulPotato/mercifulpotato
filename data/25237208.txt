But that won&#x27;t find places where the function is passed as value. Nor places where devs were inconsistent and wrote &#x2F; didn&#x27;t write a space between the name and the opening brace, like &quot;.foo (&quot; (this is a common style for Gnome or Glib code). Not to mention if the language is C++ and then you have to distinguish between &quot;.foo&quot;, &quot;-&gt;foo&quot;, and &quot;::foo&quot;.<p>In conclusion, regex might be OK to have a superficial look at some code, but never as a reliable source of information, unless a lot of work and ironing out of corner cases has been invested in the regex itself, effectively considering them part of the code, with unit tests and all the fuss that it entails.')
