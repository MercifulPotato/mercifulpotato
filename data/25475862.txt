Then one of two things are likely to happen...&quot;.<p>That sounds great in theory, but how long is your evolution time and do you keep track of the changes in practice? I would assume a good evolution time is 3 to 6 month. I would say half the time I work on a story i face that decision. If you close 1 to 3 tickets a week you have to track a lot these decisions [1]. Now add that you work on a team of 5 and you have 5 engineering teams overall.. it seems to me that this approach does not scale.<p>[1] granted not all tickets will be new decisions in new places of the coffee base and you do come across some of your old changes and do the actual evolution.')
