Item(by='sacred_numbers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602348498, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739958, text='According to this source[1] an endurance horse riding 100 miles per day requires 78,800 KCal of energy, which translates to about 329 MJ or 91 KWh of energy. That&#x27;s equivalent to 2.55 gallons of gasoline, so about 39 mpg. The world record for Teslas using hypermiling techniques and a similar amount of energy is about 700 miles, so it&#x27;s close to an order of magnitude better for electric cars. With multiple passengers in the car the energy efficiency per passenger increases. Trains are also quite efficient on a per passenger basis, with the ability to carry a passenger about 2000 miles for the same amount of energy as a horse traveling 100 miles. Aircraft can go about 80 mpg per passenger, so they are about 2x as efficient as a horse.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehorse.com&#x2F;16472&#x2F;feeding-the-endurance-horse&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehorse.com&#x2F;16472&#x2F;feeding-the-endurance-horse&#x2F;</a>')
