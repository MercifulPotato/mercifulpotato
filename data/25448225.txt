There are a few tricky issues on macOS and Windows, but when I&#x27;ve spoken to people with large cross-platform code bases built on Qt, it seems no better or worse than the case there.<p>We would like to move away from all desktop toolkits in theory (GTK and Qt as the prime examples) because they really don&#x27;t offer us a lot. Unfortunately, they do offer:<p><pre><code>  1. Treeviews\n  2. File Selector\n  3. Text Entry\n  4. Menus\n</code></pre>\nand we have no wish to reimplement these (TreeViews in GTK involve basically the entire toolkit). We slowly move towards a future vision based just on GDK (the lowest levels of GTK) but I doubt we will ever fully be able to drop the higher levels entirely.<p>(0) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ardour.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ardour.org&#x2F;</a>')
