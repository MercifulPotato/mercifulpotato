Let’s not. Let’s build carefully and methodically. Teach others how to build quality software. Stop regurgitating what you watch on YouTube 4 hour course. I’ve seen horrific, I mean absolutely bottom of the barrel code being taught to others. Especially in JS community - yes, I’m picking at you guys again.<p>When teaching goes to shit, you’re breeding and propagating, institutionalizing horrible ways to do something - amplified 100x because YouTubers are chasing viewership. That code camp 8 hour course is better replaced by reading good books and docs. Actually build something by thoroughly reading the docs.<p>Now you got 100x more developers building foundational blocks that other developers <i>blindly</i> build atop.<p>Study what Unix did when they were building small composable highly quality building blocks. Still used today after 45 years!')
