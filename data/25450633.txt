I&#x27;ve never been more comfortable with being myself, whatever I am, than now, in mid-forties.  My midlife crisis is raging out of control, because I&#x27;m looking at things that are outside of my reach. Activities I&#x27;m too frail to do, girls I&#x27;m too old to date... It&#x27;s more of a temporary Peter Pan syndrome than anything else.<p>Life runs past you really quickly, one day you wake up realizing it&#x27;s still the 20-something you, just in a 40-something body.  Midlife crisis is the process of coming to terms with the physical, temporal reality.')
