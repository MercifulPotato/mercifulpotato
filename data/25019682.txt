Do you have anything to backup the claim that Californa D&#x27;s want to have no republicans on the ticket? If not, please refrain from even mentioning it. Not even as a rant. Thanks.<p>Also why would that happen? There are tons of republicans in California. Obviously, California republicans running for state offices should have a platform that might resemble a D platform. Because as I said - you adjust to the elctorate. What parties stand for isn&#x27;t written in stone. Parties that think it is will become irrelevant. Annd no, not because they are banned from running.<p>If they bothered to break democracy, why hold elections at all? There is no legitimacy coming from a one party election. \nMulti party and ranked choice I hope will bring some sanity to the system.')
