Twenty years from now, this could make  a big difference as to whether my kids are disciplined, independent, employable adults, or screen junkies. As a society, I believe screen addiction is creating a reversion to the mean scenario where mean focus and productivity is decreasing over time as companies continue to optimize how they manipulate people for profit. This is another case of socialize the costs, privatize the profits.')
