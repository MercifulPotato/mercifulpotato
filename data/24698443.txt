Work is still being done on static-analysis tools for C.<p>To speak of Frama-C specifically, it isn&#x27;t competing with new languages like Zig and Nim, it&#x27;s competing with rival tools like [0], and with SPARK Ada. Formal reasoning about code is, for now, a niche reserved for critical-systems development. That kind of work tends to use tried-and-true languages with tried-and-true tooling: C, C++, Ada, and occasionally even Java.<p>&gt; the languages we did design would be designed to make it easy to make tools that help us use them.<p>This is already a factor in language design. It&#x27;s one of the reasons C-style preprocessors are now unfashionable.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eschertech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eschertech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;</a>')
