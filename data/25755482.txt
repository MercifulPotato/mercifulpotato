You can find many images of people doing exactly that in Germany with a cursory internet search. The Nazis appropriated many existing symbols and customs, but that doesn&#x27;t make the entire symbolism or custom automatically &quot;Nazi&quot;. Neo-Nazis use Norse mythological symbols too. Other people just like Norse mythology. Context is everything, and the context here is most certainly not one of &quot;a torch march protest&quot;. Not everyone who shaves their head is a Nazi skinhead either, nor is everyone who wears army boots.<p>I wasn&#x27;t there. Maybe they <i>were</i> talking about the &quot;final solution&quot; for the Jews. I don&#x27;t think they were, but there is no way for me to know for certain. But lacking any evidence of this, I find such a grave accusation based on such incredibly thin evidence – especially when stated like it&#x27;s almost a certainty – deeply troubling.')
