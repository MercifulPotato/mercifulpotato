I didn&#x27;t expect this to be posted on HN because the project is kind of still in its infancy.<p>The motivation behind the Browser was that I usually &quot;use the Web&quot; as a knowledge resource and am reading articles online, on blogs, on news websites, on social media and so on. But there are a couple of problems when seeing &quot;what a Browser is&quot; currently. A Browser currently is made for manual human interaction, and not for self-automation of repetitive tasks. These are currently only available at the mercy of programming or extensions, which I do not think is the reasonable way to go.<p>Why block everything except 2 things on a website when you could just grab the information you expect a website to contain?<p>I&#x27;m calling it a Semantic Web Browser because I want to build a p2p network that understands the knowledge the websites contain with its site adapters (beacons) and workflows (echoes), whereas the underlying concept tries to decentralize as much automation aspects as possible.<p>In the past a lot of websites were taken down (some for BS reasons, some not), but what&#x27;s more important to me is the knowledge that is lost forever. Even if the knowledge is web-archived, the discovery (and sharing) aspects are gone, too.<p>My goal with the project is to be a network that tries to find truth and knowledge in the semantic content of the web, whereas I&#x27;m trying to build something that understands bias in articles, the authors of said articles, and history of articles that were (re-)posted on social media with biased perspectives.<p>I know that NLP currently isn&#x27;t that far, but I think with swarm intelligence ideas (taken from Honeybee Democracy and similar research on bees) and the compositional game theory, it might be possible to have a self-defending system against financial actors.<p>Currently the Browser doesn&#x27;t have a fully functioning UI&#x2F;UX yet, and the parsers are being refactored. So it&#x27;s still a prototype.<p>It is a decentralized Browser in the sense that if you&#x27;ve trusted peers in your local (or global) network, you can reuse their caches and share automation aspects with them (your friend&#x27;s or your family&#x27;s browser(s)), which allows fully decentralized (static) ways to archive websites and their links to other websites.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where the journey is heading to be honest, but I think the Tholian race and the naming makes it clear: &quot;Be correct; we do not tolerate deceit.&quot; pretty much sums up why I built this thing.<p>Currently I don&#x27;t have funding, and I&#x27;m trying to build up a startup around the idea of this &quot;Web Intelligence Network&quot; whereas I see a potential business model for large scale actors that want to do web scraping and&#x2F;or gathering via the &quot;extraction adapters&quot; of websites that are maintained by the network.<p>I think this project turned out to be very important to me, especially when taking a glimpse at the post-COVID social media that contains so much bullshit that you could easily lose hope for humanity.')
