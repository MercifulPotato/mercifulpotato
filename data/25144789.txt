An interesting experience, given that novelisation of film usually goes &quot;the other way&quot; experientally. Film-of-novel is of course far more common.<p>In some ways, the book was better than the film.<p>(I read Abyss after the film, which I think was Orson Scott Card. I think the film is better than the book)')
