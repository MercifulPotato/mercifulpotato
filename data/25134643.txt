And yeah, there’s an argument to be made that if there are no links to a thing that’s basically the same as that thing not existing and I do buy into that argument.<p>But in this case, it seems to me like it’s as likely to be a mistake as anything else, seeing as the old pages themselves are still there and haven’t been removed, and the search functionality has only been missing them for less than a day (according to the linked article)<p>To me, it seems more likely that some overenthusiastic webdev re-implemented the site’s search functionality and accidentally missed indexing a bunch of older documents in the CMS.  I’d be inclined to report the issue to Sony and then maybe give it another couple days for the mistake to be noticed and fixed, before really sounding the alarm.<p>For reference, here’s the “Ape Escape” page for the original PlayStation game, referenced in the article’s header image: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playstation.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;games&#x2F;ape-escape-psone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playstation.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;games&#x2F;ape-escape-psone&#x2F;</a><p>And here’s the PS3 remaster of the game: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playstation.com&#x2F;en-nz&#x2F;games&#x2F;ape-escape-ps3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playstation.com&#x2F;en-nz&#x2F;games&#x2F;ape-escape-ps3&#x2F;</a>')
