However, Amazon.de (Germany) is also popular, and you can avoid S&amp;H with Amazon Prime.<p>The reason there is no huge Amazon.nl is the same reason there&#x27;s no huge eBay.nl; there&#x27;s already a large local competitor: Bol.com (and Marktplaats.nl).<p>Because of Amazon Prime Germany being popular in NL, Amazon introduced an Amazon Prime Netherlands. They even offer a discount deal but they offer a lot less than Amazon Germany, so it does not make sense to switch the Prime subscription (apart from the discount).<p>If you want to order something in The Netherlands from Germany, and they only ship to Germany, then you can use a service like Huifkar. They have a drop place in Germany to ship to, drive over border, and post it from there in The Netherlands to your address in The Netherlands.<p>I had positive and negative experiences with all of these. On Bol.com I received some kind of fashion (?) book by Kim Kardashian instead of a 200 EUR budget smartphone (I didn&#x27;t even know who she was before that). They fixed it though.<p>If you look at the working circumstances in distribution centre of Amazon and Coolblue you understand why sometimes things go wrong.<p>[1] It is called &quot;The Netherlands&quot;; not &quot;Netherland&quot;. You can also use the ccTLD, &quot;NL&quot;.')
