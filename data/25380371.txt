Therefore the bucket can contain infinite water.<p>I&#x27;d say a more apt comparison to the point I&#x27;m making is &quot;I&#x27;ve been filling this bucket with after and it&#x27;s never overflown, and it appears that there is no way to overfill the bucket and exceed it&#x27;s carrying capacity.&quot; I never said anything about continuous population growth, in fact, my point is that it is not possible to grow the population beyond the carrying capacity.')
