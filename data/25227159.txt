Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=[25227384, 25227637], score=None, time=1606471143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227004, text='Zebrastreifen (&quot;zebra stripes&quot;) is the German colloquial name. You will hardly find anybody (at least in my parts) calling them the proper official &quot;Fußgängerüberweg&quot; (pedestrian overpath&#x2F;pedestrian crossing). Even most police will call them Zebrastreifen except sometimes when writing reports or in court.<p>I failed a few recaptchas like that too, tho not due to language barrier, but because I didn&#x27;t pick some things that didn&#x27;t look like crossings at all. I am convinced that some of those supposed markings were not crossings at all but things that somehow got into google&#x27;s labeling db as outright false positives.')
