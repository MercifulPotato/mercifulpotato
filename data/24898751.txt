Just like an unix shell, everything is a string and you don&#x27;t need to use &quot;double&quot; &quot;quotes&quot; &quot;everywhere&quot; &quot;like&quot; &quot;this&quot;. However, in almost every part of the language, the way that Tcl does it is saner than the way the unix shell does it.<p>The infinitude of footguns of Unix shell make us discount it as a serious programming language but Tcl shows that it doesn&#x27;t have to be that bad :)')
