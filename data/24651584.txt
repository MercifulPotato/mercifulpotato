Even if I I&#x27;ve been down a road countless times, if I approach it from a different direction I can easily become lost and turned around, so I&#x27;ve just relied on my gps to get me anywhere.<p>This is something I always figured must be due to something with how my brain is structured. Just a reality of how I&#x27;ve developed.<p>Then one day I travelled to cuba on a whim. Spent a week there with no phone service. Within just a few days, I had most of Havana memorized and could easily navigate it without a map, even intuit where I was by the position of the sun. It&#x27;s like I unlocked a new super power I never had.<p>Then it hit me... the reason my sense of direction has always been so poor is because I offload that part of my brain onto machines.')
