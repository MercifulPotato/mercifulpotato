But in reality their work was rushed, sloppy, riddled with issues and a nightmare to maintain. And it would inevitably fall upon us &quot;lesser&quot; performers to actually investigate and fix all those issues, making us look less productive in the process.<p>This is one of the most common complaints I hear about fast devs, is the produce lots of bugs. But what I&#x27;ve seen is fast dev produces 5x more code than normal devs and produces 5x more bugs. Which means the ratio is the same but it feels different because they&#x27;re producing so much more code. You then get the devs who say they have to spend lots of time investigating these bugs so look worse. But I&#x27;ve literally seen the fast dev go on to a bug that one of the other developers was spending 2 weeks investigating and find the issue in the data within 5 minutes. You then have the slow and careful devs who will write 5 functional tests, 1 unit test and add 10 seconds to the build (not much but it adds up when it&#x27;s ever issue) and still have the same ratio of bugs as the guy who is doing 1 units tests.<p>I think the realitity is, a good dev is someone who produces the most business value. And something lots of devs don&#x27;t want to hear is that the tiny little tweaks they make to improve the code quality, adds very little business value. Where as a required feature that works 90% of the time adds lots of business value. I think a lot of the complaining about these rockstar devs is just jealously. Code quality is one of the smallest tech problems yet so many devs think it&#x27;s super important. No, getting stuff delivered so other departments and customers can do things is. Being able to plan things out is super important. Having a good data model is super important.')
