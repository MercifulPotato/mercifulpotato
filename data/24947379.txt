Highway miles would seem significantly safer on a per-mile basis (but I can&#x27;t find any numbers to back that up), and with Waymo excluding highways for now they&#x27;d be all surface miles. I can&#x27;t find data that breaks down crash rate by street type,  but I suspect surface traffic has a much higher crash rate than highway miles.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Api&#x2F;Public&#x2F;ViewPublication&#x2F;812183" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Api&#x2F;Public&#x2F;ViewPublication&#x2F;...</a>')
