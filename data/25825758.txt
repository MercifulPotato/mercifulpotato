For a n00b this is basically impossible, and takes cost monitoring to notice their rate of learning. For a person with the basics of the language that they&#x27;ll be using, and a tiny bit of experience in the libraries they&#x27;ll be using, things get easier.<p>For everyone (n00b to senior) I would always recommend designing &amp; breaking things down into no smaller 1&#x2F;2 day blocks, where nothing went longer than 3 days (for inexperienced), but longer for more experienced. Senior devs should be able to be able to be trusted (to be accurate) for week-long blocks.<p>Use a Gannt chart (ms project or similar) and monitor the inexperienced, gauging their real-life times with their estimates, adjusting accordingly. Give semi regular feedback at the accuracy so that they (&amp; you, the manager) are working with.<p>In one of my companies, the most inaccurate we were for <i>any</i> project was that we were late 2 days over 2 years. Build on trust, build on meetings and other time sinks. Include testing, sign offs, etc.<p>So, absolute n00bs need close mentoring so that the (senior) mentor can begin to gauge the growth rate... Which will be steep... But different for everyone.')
