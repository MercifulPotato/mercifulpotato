If only because deaths are less likely to overlook too many people.<p>If the IFR is around 1% we would expect around 1,000,000 deaths if one third of Americans have to be infected for herd immunity. So that would suggest the US is 20 percent of the way there.<p>Given the haphazard way of calculating these numbers I would, however, put huge error bars around some (something like ±15 percentage points at least).')
