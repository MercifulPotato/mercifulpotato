While the original post i replied to believes that if somehow this &quot;car culture&quot; phenomenon disappeared, people will stop using cars and everyone will ride bycicles like a happy hippy nation. That won&#x27;t happen, because, like i made it clear, everything gravitates around cars, not the other way around.<p>Your research is therefore irrelevant to the base issue.<p>What i choose is to use reason and make a simple link between cause and effect.')
