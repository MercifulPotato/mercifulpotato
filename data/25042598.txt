ACF waves can greatly vary in magnitude and if there is a loud bass wave that&#x27;s 1000x bigger than small wavelets from background music, those wavelets will be present, but barely visible. That&#x27;s also why classical or otherwise &quot;peaceful&quot; music looks so good: all waves have about the same height.<p>I&#x27;ve in fact tried implementing the equal loudness contour - try adding ?acf.aweight=1 to the URL. However the result is mediocre. I&#x27;ve also tried applying a few bandpass filters for low, mid and high frequency ranges, rendering them separately with different colors and then mixing images together. The result is, again, medicore. I&#x27;ve been entertaining the idea that ACF waves are ought to be rendered like ocean waves: via light reflections.')
