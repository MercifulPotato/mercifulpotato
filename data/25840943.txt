Now that it&#x27;s time for the powers that be to punish the red tribe, the blue tribe is all too happy to join in the authoritarianism - eg feigning outrage at the gallows (ignoring the guillotine symbolism of the past year), assertions that speech must be policed, and calls to take right-wing terrorism &quot;seriously&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;re equivocating around the elephant (no pun intended) in the room. Members of authority on the red team have been actively working to overturn the election since they were voted out and those attempts finally culminated in a deadly attack on the capitol. These big tech companies <i>are</i> policing speech, but they are doing so on their own platforms based on a philosophical opposition to the message of sedition that 50% of the red team is pushing. These companies are saying &quot;enough is enough, if you spread election fraud misinformation you are not welcome here&quot;, that&#x27;s perfectly reasonable, and <i>forcing</i> these companies to rebroadcast this message is the only example of authoritarianism present in this debate.<p>&gt; <i>(meaning attack red tribe protests with the same zeal as blue tribe protests)</i><p>This is false. Any leader on the blue team will say they would prefer <i>all</i> citizens be treated well rather than all citizens be abused. I&#x27;d be interested if you had any examples demonstrating otherwise.<p>&gt; <i>the tech angle is how such nonsensical propaganda took over the red tribe so strongly</i><p>There&#x27;s a little bit of tech to it, but this was happening on cable news and talk radio long before it was happening on the internet, the only difference is that twitter is massively popular whereas Fox News is not. If Fox News had 180 million prime time viewers we&#x27;d all just say &quot;well, they could just watch MSNBC is if they wanted!&quot;')
