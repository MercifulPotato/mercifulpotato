In particular, many software folks don’t know the most rudimentary data structures and algorithms. Those should be memorized, frankly. Lately I have been exploring old programming books on archive.org and realize how downhill the industry has gone from fundamental principles, which leads to “language-z” zealots to satisfy some business need.<p>The author mentions COBOL as being antiquated and irrelevant but in all honesty, modern languages don’t improve upon much. Underneath all the layers  people add to modern languages (so the rest of the developer community can push buttons without even the faintest idea) lies assembly language and the machine.<p>Knowledge of the systems is abstracted away so much that people are focusing on mastering the wrong thing. One should be able to implement algorithms in C or COBOL or even assembly. Otherwise, it’s like learning to google the notes of a concerto without understanding the chords, scales, harmony, melody, etc.')
