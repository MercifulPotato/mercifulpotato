We produce an enormous amount of low-quality food, and malnutrition is driven more by external interference (misgovernment, wars) than by agriculture. Food is, as a percentage of people&#x27;s budgets, cheaper than it has ever been.<p>That suggests that there&#x27;s a middle ground, where we shift to more labor-intensive practices to grow some more expensive but better produce that&#x27;s less hard on the environment, without dismantling the entire industrial system. People could introduce more fresher foods, while still growing vast amounts of highly-processed-maize-and-soybeans for people who can only afford that.<p>There are a lot of dimensions to that. It&#x27;s not easy to prove that eating this way is necessarily healthier or easier on the environment. But we do know that the Western diet is bad for people&#x27;s health, and we do know that it&#x27;s hard on the environment, so it&#x27;s worth considering alternatives.')
