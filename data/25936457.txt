The SEC pursues the mostly harmless while letting the sharks go free. Did they do anything about naked short selling of Overstock stock? Nope, and now that it’s happened again and retail took advantage of a bad trade, the rules suddenly change “to protect the little guy.”<p>It’s disingenuous at a minimum, and crony capitalism when taken to the maximum.<p>Are they doing anything about Nancy Pelosi (her husband Paul to be specific) buying Tesla calls before bills were brought forth with generous EV charging network subsidies? “Nothing to see here.” (Nothing against Pelosi and not intended as whataboutism, picked because it was top of mind from some research today and the disparity of enforcement)<p>Edit: Pump and dump schemes absolutely should not be supported. Piling into a short squeeze is not a pump and dump scheme.<p>Edit 2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;SZJ9XEa_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;SZJ9XEa_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;...</a>')
