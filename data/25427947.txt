That is a part of the job that makes me want to bash my brains out with a rock.<p>I actually do sort of like that kind of problem-solving, in the abstract, buttttttt in reality I usually need to do it under pressure for unappreciative clients&#x2F;management who just know that things are taking longer than expected.
