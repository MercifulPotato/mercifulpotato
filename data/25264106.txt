Item(by='cromwellian', descendants=None, kids=[25264235], score=None, time=1606819359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262164, text='Watch Robert Whyte&#x27;s presentation. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4</a>  The basic problems have all been solved, the science has been solved too. Tokamaks have already made net fusion power. The only difference between JET, which already succeeded, and ARC, is using Magnets with 2.6x the field strength. The B^4 power scaling, gives you about 50x the power, so ARC will generate 500 MW of power whereas JET (remember, already proven engineering), generated 10MW.<p>So without a doubt, this is just an engineering problem at this point. A prototype device that didn&#x27;t have to be maintained, could be built exactly like any other Tokamak, just with REBCO magnets, and you&#x27;d have the required fusion power.<p>To get the required electric power, and add in maintenance, you need to at the FliBe liquid blanket, replacable toroid sections, and a heat exchanger, but again, these are known engineering problems with known solutions, akin to knowing that landing a rocket is possible, but figuring out the grid fins, heat shield, landing legs, and guidance software.<p>Fusion devices on a small scale have been proving the plasma physics since the 90s. We don&#x27;t have fusion yet simply because of people being conservative and sticking with traditional &quot;known to work&quot; magnets, which is why ITER is a huge, hulking monstrosity.<p>As Dr Whyte says, cost scales by R, R can be reduced by a factor of 10 from ITER simply by using different magnets, so ARC will produce the same power as ITER, but significantly smaller and cheaper.<p>The basic papers have been peer reviewed by Nature, and the science and engineering have been found solid, and thus, the economic arguments as well. Ergo, this is <i>exactly</i> like the SpaceX scenario vs ULA and NASA (e.g. SLS). Small allows fast iteration, fast innovation. ITER&#x27;s going to spend $20 billion and 20+ years of development just to turn around a realize that the follow on to ITER will need to use HTS magnets and a smaller design.')
