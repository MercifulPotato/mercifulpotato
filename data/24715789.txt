But I would argue that it was more of a curiosity at the time.  It certainly was nowhere as widespread as the harpsichord or clavichord.<p>At any rate the pianoforte of Bach&#x27;s day sounded very different from the modern piano, so playing Bach on a modern piano is still an anachronism.  (Whether that&#x27;s a problem is a separate issue.)')
