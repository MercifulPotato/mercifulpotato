Nick Fuentes is still on Twitter, and pinned to the top of his page is photo evidence that shows the person they are asserting was in the Capitol is not him. He was wearing a suit. The photo of him at the steps of the Capitol is not incriminating in any way. He was protesting along with 250K+ other conservatives in Washington DC. It&#x27;s not a crime to hold a megaphone in front of the Capitol. It&#x27;s literally his First Amendment right. This article is false, baiting, and loaded. Please remove it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;NickJFuentes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;NickJFuentes</a>')
