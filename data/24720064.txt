It&#x27;s click bait because you only indicate social connections exist between entities of question and use excessive hype to build to the idea. It only raises more questions and does nothing to answer anything concrete about the &quot;situation&quot;.<p>&gt; If they&#x27;d cover it on TV news, it&#x27;s probably off-topic.<p>That&#x27;s from the posting guidelines on HN. We like answers here, not more questions.')
