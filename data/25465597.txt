Haha yes, it is surprising on the face of it. But when you think about it, its not trivial to make that everything is seamless for all use cases. It requires a lot of time and constant iteration and feedback. Being a maintainer is anyway not easy and when you have the entire framework to maintain, these things happen more often than not.<p>On the frontend side, we have two libraries - supertokens-auth-react and supertokens-website. The supertokens-website repo deals with sessions (interceptors to axios for refresh + race condition synchronisation). On the other hand, supertokens-auth-react provides login &#x2F; sign up UI + session management (it uses supertokens-website).<p>Thank you for the commendation! Would love to hear your feedback. Please do drop me an email on: advait at supertokens.io<p>Cu√≠date! (love Spain, have several friends and have visited barcelona, majorca, Sevilla and more)')
