It was actually for a client, don’t know what happened to it. I used it for personal use a bit and frankly I like the untracked and unnamed nature of comments. I don’t need to follow people for thoughtful comments. I add insight where I can and honestly only return if I want to. I don’t need notifications, I’d rather explore organically.<p>That being said, good work and I’m sure others will find value. Just not for me.')
