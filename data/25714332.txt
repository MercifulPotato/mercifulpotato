Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=[25714668, 25715923], score=None, time=1610284149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713589, text='&gt; Norway is probably the least good example example, due to the relative dominance of the oil &amp; gas sector,<p>I once found an article I haven&#x27;t been able to find ever since, but it&#x27;s on a basic economic theory that high profitability in sector X makes sector Y uncompetitive. (read X as Oil and Y as anything else in this example).<p>This is because the profits not only X push up wages in sector X. But also in Y, because the entire market must also compete with X in a bid to attract labour.<p>This makes Y less competitive compared to other countries which don&#x27;t have such a sector X.<p>Of course in a world without friction, labour would move across borders to the first country&#x27;s sector X and thereby push up wages in Y around the world. But labour mobility is obviously lower between countries than within countries, so other countries tend to be a little more insulated from this effect of profitable industries abroad.<p>Does anyone remember the name for this economic theory?<p>I feel this happened with Norway. In the 70s and 80s for example you saw it become less competitive and more rapidly deindustrialised.<p>Still, you&#x27;d also think this would fuel a high-tech industry because you&#x27;d have to get into high-value added sectors to compete. Meanwhile Norway&#x27;s second biggest export product is fish. Would be fun to have a Norwegian (economist) join us for some explanatory thoughts!')
