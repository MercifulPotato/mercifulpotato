A quick google search of “bitcoin seized” will uncover countless instances of governments’ confiscating bitcoin from illicit businesses, including Silk Road. This reality contradicts part of the old narrative about bitcoin—that it is useful for criminals. Bitcoin is easily trackable on the public bitcoin blockchain, making it a bad choice of currency to use when committing crime.<p>Could someone explain this to me? How would a government confiscate bitcoin held in a cold wallet? I get they can track it and potentially seize it if it was held on an exchange, but presumably anyone buying Bitcoin because they&#x27;re worried about the government seizing their assets would not hold it on the exchange and would store it on a cold wallet?')
