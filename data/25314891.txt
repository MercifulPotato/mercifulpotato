If you&#x27;re not familiar with factoring, let&#x27;s say you get a large order that you can&#x27;t actually afford to fulfill due to a lack of cash-on-hand to buy materials, rent equipment, etc. Rather than requiring the customer to pay up front or getting a loan (possibly using the invoice as collateral), you can just sell the Net-30 (or 60, or 90) invoice outright for something like 95Â¢ on the $ to get the money you need to fulfill the order. This is particular popular in industries like fashion that have long lead times for both manufacturing and for billing.<p>Anyway, could Treasury be used like this?')
