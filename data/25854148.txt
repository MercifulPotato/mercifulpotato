I think this way this would mean we could have privacy focused forks that work well with the OS. Other problem I have is that this way Microsoft appropriated huge amount of work without paying a penny to the developers. I would have looked at it differently if they paid salaries and bonuses to contributors for several years. Microsoft wants to have the cool opensource kid badge, without paying fair share. That stinks.')
