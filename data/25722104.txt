I do disagree with having Twitter, a monopoly, compared to Pravda, a state-sponsored communication channel. Ignoring practical feasibility, I suspect if you tried starting a platform that disagreed with Pravda, you&#x27;d risk your life. I don&#x27;t think starting a competitive platform to Twitter will put you at a higher chance of being arrested, kidnapped, or killed by the US government.<p>I think there are fairer comparisons to be made, but Pravda is in my opinion not one of them.')
