But we may see a proliferation of hybrid companies that maintain office spaces but allow certain roles to work remotely most of the time.<p>I think your analysis here is one-sided and is ignoring all the major problems with 100%-work-in-office cultures. Housing costs are absolutely out of control in major urban centers, and newcomers are sacrificed at the altar of NIMBYism in order to make existing homeowners&#x2F;landowners wealthier. People are wasting away commuting hours a day. Folks have been getting crammed into denser and denser open floorplans and bullpens for years.<p>People are willing to put up with these things when they don&#x27;t have any other options. But when other companies are investing in supporting hybrid environments and you&#x27;re stuck still requiring people to relocate to San Francisco permanently, you&#x27;re going to start losing talent. Not supporting some kind of hybrid remote policy is going to become a serious competitive disadvantage in the talent market. You can still maintain your trendy urban office space to attract the college graduates who want that lifestyle.')
