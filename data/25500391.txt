Before, I needed to spend at least a couple hundred dollars (usually on a contract spending an hour on the phone to cancel) on one vendor, who may or may not have the content I want, and it may or may not be available at the time I want it.<p>Now, I can pick and choose exactly what I want, when I want it, and without advertising breaks.
