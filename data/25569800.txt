They&#x27;d frequently route traffic over IPv6 to... Nowhere. Websites of major tech companies such as Google and GitHub would occasionally get routed wrong and just... Hang. It&#x27;s like they black holed outbound IPv6 traffic. The traceroute6 output would quit displaying new routes.<p>Never had that problem on IPv4. So I ended up disabling it.<p>(I do have an unrelated issue that sometimes they can&#x27;t route traffic between two customers in the same general area. Traffic tends to go out to the west coast Comcast DCs and get stuck, never comes back. We&#x27;re midwest).')
