If the code being removed has any effects in it (the encoding of which is possible in a pure language), the fact that it&#x27;s unreachable could be a bug. If you sneakily just remove it without telling the user, you&#x27;re colluding with the bug.<p>Recently, I discovered an like-new pair of shoes at the bottom of a closet. I bought them some four or five years ago, I guess, and somehow forgot about them. They got buried under other items.  This was a day or two before Christmas; it was like an unexpected present.<p>Now, someone could have surreptitiously entered my home at any time before that and removed these &quot;dead shoes&quot;. I would never have known.<p>So therefore, it wouldn&#x27;t be stealing, right? It&#x27;s a &quot;semantics-preserving transformation of someone&#x27;s belongings&quot;.')
