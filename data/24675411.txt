Since they&#x27;re hurting the perception of the community, maybe Babel&#x2F;Webpack&#x2F;ESLint could admit that using multiple packages is the cause of most complaints against the Node.js&#x2F;NPM community, and revert to single packages? Babel already use a monorepo, so I don&#x27;t really see any disadvantage from their side. Most Webpack loaders are maintained by the same people who maintain the core packages. We need the whole community to push for this. I&#x27;ve done my part but I&#x27;m only a single person. We need more people reproducing my claim, seeing with their own eyes and complaining to those projects.<p>2. The community could rally around projects that don&#x27;t use multiple packages. Sebastian McKenzie (writter of Babel) is working on a transpiler&#x2F;bundler&#x2F;linter&#x2F;tester called Rome. There&#x27;s also SWC written in Rust, which is a transpiler, but they&#x27;re working on a bundler.<p>3. Using ES6 modules directly in the browser instead of using transpiled&#x2F;bundled output. I&#x27;m in Europe, which is a big holdout on modern browser adoption, but even considering this, 99% of our customers are on evergreen browsers. With HTTP2 and gzip on the server you get the same advantages of using Webpack+Babel+minifiers without the bloat on node_modules.')
