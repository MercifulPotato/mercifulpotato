We could have reduced our GHG footprint by 20-30% for the last 3 decades just by having gone nuclear in the 80s and 90s.<p>What&#x27;s crazier still are all those &quot;extinction rebellion&quot; types who oppose it even now because &quot;it&#x27;s too late now&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;ll have better storage tech in 5-10 years&quot;. It makes absolutely zero sense. What rational mind when faced with an impending existential threat wouldn&#x27;t take a known good solution over a potentially better solution down the road?

And that&#x27;s assuming what they want is even achievable or desirable in practice.<p>I swear half of the &quot;greens&quot; you meet are actually just malthusians in disguise. They don&#x27;t care what happens to the environment as long as they have theirs, others be dammed.')
