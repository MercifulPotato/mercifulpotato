The lecturers set problem sheets themselves based on their lectures. Sure, you can still cheat from other people in the same lectures, but that&#x27;s a different game to having cheating commercially available.<p>That said, the exams were pass&#x2F;fail anyway and the questions worked on during the course didn&#x27;t have any bearing on that. Made cheating on problem sets pretty irrelevant, I guess.')
