TIC-80 documentation [2] is a little thin, but overall it&#x27;s a very pragmatic integrated development environment that combines sound, sprite, map and code-editor into one very simple IDE environment (no debugger, though, only rudimentary logging).<p>You have a choice between multiple script languages (Lua, Javascript and more).  The run-time library [3] only has a handful of simple functions but is feature-complete nonetheless (plus there is some address-based peek&#x2F;poke API to do more advanced, low-level stuff).<p>I&#x27;d imagine learning javascript programming by starting game-development in TIC-80 to be much more straight-forward than attempting to wrestle with the complexities of HTML5+CSS+javascript+tooling for in-browser programming.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tic80.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tic80.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nesbox&#x2F;TIC-80&#x2F;wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nesbox&#x2F;TIC-80&#x2F;wiki</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nesbox&#x2F;TIC-80&#x2F;wiki#special-functions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nesbox&#x2F;TIC-80&#x2F;wiki#special-functions</a>')
