Think: every 3rd request in a minute doubles the difficulty with some cooldown period.<p>With that the cost (and complexity) of an attack can hopefully be in the same ballpark (or higher) than ReCaptcha - without your end user having to label cars or send data to Google.<p>But in the end a determined spammer will get through any captcha cheaply (for reference: ReCaptcha solves are sold by the thousands for $1) - we just hope we can do better than ReCAPTCHA, especially UX-wise.')
