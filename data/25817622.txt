If pre-corona traffic in some of the major metropolitan cities is any indicator, we&#x27;re nearing a point where progress for most will be significantly slowed whilst those who fly above the top, avoiding messenger based distractions entirely, will suddenly have infinite time and blue seas abound.<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;s time to disable notifications when in a context that isn&#x27;t messaging, and use an emergency-style app to bypass disabled notifications so one won&#x27;t miss anything time-sensitive in 2021.')
