It is impossible to satisfy everyone&#x27;s needs – <i>&quot;do everything I want in safe mode&quot;</i> – both from a practical perspective (the language and the compiler would become incredibly complex and therefore buggy) as well as from a theoretical perspective (you would solve the halting problem, among other impossible feats).')
