The question is whether the apps that each users wants are sufficiently available on the platform of their choice. And true, sometimes the answer is no; just as some people are stuck on NT because WINE doesn&#x27;t work and they need a Windows app, so some people will be stuck on Android&#x2F;iOS, but by the same token some of us are doing just fine on FOSS platforms.')
