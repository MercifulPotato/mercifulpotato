This puts me in a terrible financial situation over the holidays, the timing couldn&#x27;t be worse.<p>Countless reviews online show them doing the same to MANY other people lately, buried beneath hundreds of suspicious looking positive reviews.<p>This startup is apparently based in India and well beyond the reach of any legal measures.<p>What would you do?')
