Half of my friends have left San Francisco<p>Moving out doesn&#x27;t stop you from voting. I didn&#x27;t change my voter registration when I moved from San Francisco to China. Years later, back in California, I voted in San Francisco, where I was still registered, despite residing in Hayward.<p>For verification purposes, they asked me when I voted what my address was. I was allowed to vote despite not knowing my own apartment number.')
