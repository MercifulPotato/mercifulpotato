I will restore from backups.<p>To me, reproducibility is more than about restoring the old bucket of bits I had. It&#x27;s about understanding, about being able to reproduce the means that a system got the way it is.<p>With Kubernetes, there is a centralized place where where the cluster state lives. I can dump these manifests into a file. The file is human readable, well structured, consistently structured, uniformly describes all the resources I have. Recreating these manifests elsewhere will let me reproduce a similar cluster.<p>The resources inside a kubernetes cluster are just so much easier to operate on, so much easier to manage than anything else I&#x27;ve ever seen. Whether I&#x27;m managing SQS or Postgres or Containers, being able to have one resource that represents the thing, having a manifest for the thing, is just so much more powerful, so much better an operational experience than either having a bucket of bits filesystem with a bunch of hopefully decently documented changes over time on it, or a complex Puppet or Ansible system that can enact said bucket of bits. Kubernetes presents high level representations for all the things on the system, of all shapes and sizes, and that makes knowing what I have much easier, and it makes managing, manipulating, replicating those resources much much easier &amp; more straightforward.')
