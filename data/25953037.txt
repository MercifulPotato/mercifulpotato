Item(by='kibwen', descendants=None, kids=[25953243], score=None, time=1611888069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952905, text='<i>&gt; It&#x27;s all or nothing.</i><p>This is demonstrably mistaken. Look, here&#x27;s an entire Wikipedia article on limits to free speech in the US: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_free_speech_exceptions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_free_speech_exce...</a><p>And if you&#x27;re talking about the ill-defined philosopical concept of &quot;free speech&quot;, that&#x27;s also mistaken. Free speech is a subservient value in pursuit of free society; if an instance of speech would do damage to the freedoms of others (e.g. slander) then it is morally just for that speech to be forbidden.<p>Black-and-white thinking isn&#x27;t the recourse here. Free speech is a nuanced topic, and not as cut-and-dry as you have been led to believe.')
