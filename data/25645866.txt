What he fails to realize, is that this is precisely the argument of those who believe real inflation to be higher than reported; Namely, that without including cheap electronics and luxury items the picture is much much worse - which it is. This article built a nice strawman and burnt it - what I&#x27;d like to see is the author actually tackle the claims of his opponents rather than gross mischaracterizations of them.')
