About six months into it, I visited Herräng. Picture the main dance house: a huge spacious hardwood dance floor, cute decorations over the walls, a custom-built DJ booth at the back, and standing at the front was Dawn Hampton.<p>Dawn was a short woman whose talents spanned dance, music, songwriting, and anything Cabaret. Her favourite song was Count Basie&#x27;s Splanky.<p>I had arrived at Herräng during setup week, and got to know some of the crew who run the show, plus a few secrets---password for free Internet, less-frequented shower areas, and to avoid laundry duty at all costs.<p>Between the DJ booth and Dawn were countless dancers sitting, mostly cross-legged, eating up her every single word.<p>So on that afternoon while Dawn was holding the crowd&#x27;s attention, I was up in the DJ booth, gazing over everyone, a clear view of Dawn at the other end. When she asked, &quot;Who wants to do Splanky with me?&quot; nobody budged. It took me a half-second later to shout, &quot;I do!&quot; I launched myself off the platform, leap-frogged over people&#x27;s heads, and managed to score a dance with Dawn Hampton to her favourite song.<p>See when Dawn danced with you, she danced _with_ you. She held your gaze, recognized you as a person, played with you, back-led with you, showed you how to embody the music with your movements. She adapted to your level and made you look like a pro. She and Frankie Manning were Lindy Hop.')
