The user might have found a bug or edge case that&#x27;s useful for the authors own usage. Perhaps even something the user doesn&#x27;t need to function, but just stumbled upon.<p>Not saying that this is often the case or the author should dive into every question (the author doesn&#x27;t have any obligations at all) - there are just too many ungrounded assumptions in the interpretation.')
