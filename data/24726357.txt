Hell, a Canadian protester would fulfill the criteria.<p>My impression is that this is exactly why DHS wrote the Intelligence Report &quot;The Syrian Conflict and its Nexus to US-based Antifascist Movements&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltairenet.org&#x2F;IMG&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;471292844-The-Syrian-Conflict-and-Its-Nexus-to-U-S-based-Antifascist-Movements-5.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltairenet.org&#x2F;IMG&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;471292844-The-Syrian-Con...</a><p>The idea seems to be to gin up a facially plausible but totally spurious connection from Antifa to PKK via the YPG, to claim that YPG is a &quot;foreign power&quot; (ridiculous, but might be technically true under 50 U.S.C. ยง  1801(a)(5)), or that it&#x27;s somehow the same organization as the PKK (false) in order to justify a counterintelligence investigation of protestors.')
