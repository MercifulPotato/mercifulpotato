Phones (android or apple) are sugar-coated tracking devices.  The point of them, is that they externalise the internal.  They were planned to make your private information into a commodity.<p>It also shouldn&#x27;t be a surprised that no action will taken against them.  Corporations are the government.<p>Well, &#x27;they&#x27; might even put up a show of pretence in &quot;punishing&quot; a corporation.  But they will only do that once they know how they will achieve their plans anyway.  And let&#x27;s not forget that the media are corporations too - in their news shows, they will only present what&#x27;s expedient.<p>Its a sad story, but until a majority of people are on board with the idea that corporations&#x2F;media&#x2F;government are different sides of the same beast, nothing will change.  Government is slavery.  You are (or should be) your own master.  Self-sovereignty is what you need.
