See my past posts.<p>I am not doubting you being an CIA shill, in fact, I&#x27;d give everyone the shadow of a doubt that they are NOT shill. But my point is more towards the fact that I find these boards to be very much influencing people to one specific type of ideology, rather than to provide evidence and have other people having a greater understanding of the matter (which I always assume is what HN is supposed to be).<p>Incidentally, I find it funny that while on US platforms, people call themselves Brit, whereas no one in the UK calls themselves that.')
