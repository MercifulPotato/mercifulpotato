Gaining +2000 hospital beds (or 20% growth for a lot of areas) means jack diddly squat against a Virus that replicates into the millions.<p>Its far easier to stay home for Thanksgiving and cut down on the spread, rather than grow hospitals. But of course, we&#x27;re growing hospitals where we can (moving Navy Hospital Ships, hiring student nurses before they graduate, etc. etc.) But the USA already had a nurse shortage BEFORE COVID19 came around.<p>There comes a point where there&#x27;s no point building Hospital beds: we simply don&#x27;t have enough nurses &#x2F; doctors in this country to staff them. Even if we include student nurses &#x2F; doctors.<p>----------<p>In either case: China has the right idea. You stop the spread before it becomes a million cases. You can&#x27;t just magically grow hospitals and create expert nurses out of thin air.<p>Free Liberal countries like New Zealand got to stop the exponential growth because their society was more unified and rational about things. Authoritarian wasn&#x27;t necessary, but its clearly a good cudgel to use in this situation.')
