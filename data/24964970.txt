I haven’t <i>really</i> needed the background blur feature personally, but I’ve tried it and both myself, colleagues, and friends — pretty much everyone I’ve talked to that has used it — loathe Google Meet’s background blur, and prefer Zoom’s by far.<p>In my experience, it doesn’t completely cover the background most of the time, and if you move at all, as you point out, it can’t keep up.<p>Kind of funny to see Google engineering blogging about it when it feels extremely half baked.<p>This makes me sad, because in all other areas, I think Meet excels well beyond the competition.<p>EDIT: removed my general sentiment on Google')
