Patching software through diffs is error prone and you basically have to fiddle around with the order as to not accidentally mess up your entire program, it makes the software basically non-extensible in a sane way because there&#x27;s no interface between extension and core code. The line number limits on code also incentivize spaghetti code. If you want software that sucks less you don&#x27;t need fewer line numbers, you need good program structure and design.')
