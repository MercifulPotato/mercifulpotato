When the computer was acting slow and LibreOffice Writer was lagging, the Finnish layout&#x27;s characters äöå would jump to the front of the typing queue somehow. So if I typed &quot;menkäämme&quot;, I might get &quot;äämenkmme&quot; when LibreOffice finally renders the typed text. I don&#x27;t know if it still occurs but it was really annoying and I always wondered how on earth it could happen.')
