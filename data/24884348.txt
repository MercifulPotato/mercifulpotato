I think the real long term solution is to have a decentralized version of YouTube&#x2F;video publishing platform that is resistant (invulnerable?) to censorship. I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s not difficult, or even impossible, but I would love to see more discussion regarding true web decentralization, not legal semantics.')
