On my blog SQLwithManoj.com I used to get decent 3k-4k hits every day for last 4-5 years. But since Jan 2020 hits got reduced below 1k. And when I checked google webmaster I couldn&#x27;t see my blog meta entry. Don&#x27;t know how it got removed from there. Now since I&#x27;ve added it back the hits are still at around 1k, and this has cased good revenue loss for me too.')
