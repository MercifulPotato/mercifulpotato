The reported efficacies are (from what I understand) 1 - (n infections in experimental group &#x2F; n infections in control group). But then I see people draw wildly varying conclusiona from that, most of which I suspect are wrong (e.g. the relationship between &#x27;efficacy rate&#x27; and &#x27;group immunity&#x27; after everyone is vaccinated). But despite looking long and hard, I can&#x27;t anyone explaining <i>in detail</i> what such efficacy rates mean (and don&#x27;t mean).')
