In general, electrification was done for entire rail lines. If you look at maps of non-electrified rail, it&#x27;s a relatively small amount where you have a sufficiently long electrified section near a station to charge. And usually, at the end of the line, you don&#x27;t have enough time to get a good charge in.<p>Certain regions of Germany are an exception, partly due to their early electrification of the rail, then subsequent damage in WW2, then strange rail layouts, but if you look at non-electrified rail maps of the Netherlands, France, the UK etc it will be extremely clear that battery trains wouldn&#x27;t work well.<p>Part of the reasoning is that you want these massive batteries to last, so you&#x27;re going to want to charge at the fastest around 1C, aka 1 hour for a full charge. Turnaround time at the end stations being usually around 5 minutes for these services, your choice is either to absolutely destroy your schedule, fork up far more $$$$ for more material or ignore battery rail.<p>Look, if they made economic sense, we&#x27;d already have electric locomotives - the technology is extremely simple, just toss a bunch of batteries into a box; the engines themselves are already electric. Similar batteries to electric buses, too. But while the economics of electric buses do make sense - and you see electric buses in most of the world&#x27;s cities today - trains running on batteries really don&#x27;t make sense in most cases. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t really see them. Out of the nearly 2000 Stadler FLIRTs that are running across Europe, zero of them run entirely on batteries today - and there will only be a projected 55 in 2023 (!) in one region of Germany.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_railway_lines_in_the_Netherlands#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File%3AElektrificatiekaart.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_railway_lines_in_the...</a>')
