I am very happy with Firefox, and it fulfills 100% of my requirements for a modern browser (must have sane browser dev panel, must perform with &gt;50 tabs open, must be extensible with a huge extension ecosystem).<p>On my Android phone, I&#x27;ll just go ahead and claim I&#x27;m not missing anything and it&#x27;s not even close - Firefox is so much better just for being able to run extensions like uBlock Origin.<p>But on a workstation (macOS) - I&#x27;ll keep an open mind.')
