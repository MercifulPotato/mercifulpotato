Item(by='yiyus', descendants=None, kids=[25230043], score=None, time=1606494442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229548, text='You can easily define it, that&#x27;s what I meant saying that you can do the same things in practice, but it&#x27;s not usually defined (at least in the books and articles I&#x27;ve read), and certainly it is not so ubiquitous as in DFs texts. And, of course, the exterior product is contained in the geometric product. I guess that, in the same way, you could define a geometric product operator when using a DFs formulation. Would you then say that geometric algebra occurs in differential forms?<p>In any case, you did not attempt to answer my original question. Are GA and DFs just different ways to define &quot;equivalent&quot; concepts or is there some more fundamental difference that I am missing?')
