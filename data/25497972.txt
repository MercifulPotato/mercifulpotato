Lenses, flashes, adapters, it’s all so much. It’s Nikon’s core business to build such an ecosystem, and they’re not great at it. Never did get a fully fleshed-out set of DX lenses.<p>Here’s my pipe dream: Apple transitions all iOS devices to USB-C, they cook up a low-latency fast protocol to connect to cameras, and they give the camera manufacturers documentation and support to build out a way to use an interchangeable lens camera that immediately lets you pipe photos and video off the camera into iOS apps for immediate processing and offloading.')
