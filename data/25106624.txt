Instead of genuinely caring for what will the lives of others be like in the future, they only care about how they will read his name when he is not there. How petty is that, how meaningless? What meaning carries the pronunciation of a name in isolation?<p>Humanity will only progress once we deeply realize the reality of other minds, that we are made of the same stuff, that our conscious and identity is only pragmatically separated. You and me are the same stuff; helping myself and helping you are effectively the same thing. Helping my children (or your children) is the same as helping myself. I just can&#x27;t see through their eyes, but they are all like a part of me, equally alive and thinking, that I just cannot access.<p>Once (and if) we realize this, then we can hope to go on longer than a few decades.')
