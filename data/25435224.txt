How do you accurately and consistently measure &quot;reach&quot; with the internet?  Language adapted sites as a ratio of the population that is possibly able or actively accesses the internet? Accounts? Active accounts?<p>Also, my first thought is to simply then start breaking up into smaller social media companies that are somehow networked. It may actually be that this brings about just that, that we get a kind of adversarial competition or interoperability (I think it&#x27;s being referred to).<p>I just find it extremely disheartening that with all the good work and forward thinking it seems the EU is doing, their free speech policies are right out of a dystopian terror novel, the more so as ever more and tighter speech and though control measures are put in place.<p>It WILL snuff out and strangle innovation and creativity when there is constant fear of drawing the ire of the Thought Police based on intentionally ambiguous thought and speech limitations that are arbitrarily enforced. It&#x27;s unfortunate that Europeans do not have the courage and conviction to allow for free speech, but it also seems like it is being snuffed out in the USA too. Pursuant consequences will inevitably follow.')
