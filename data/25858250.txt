That&#x27;s basically glorified thread scheduler, with some basic synchronization primitives.<p>Regarding the Linux question, the larger cortex M devices can, but this one is probably too small at 264 kB, although not very far from the minimum (I could find boards with ~320 kB claiming some support). The biggest question is wether or not the Cortex-M0 architecture has all the required features for Linux (M4 and M7 can, but are much bigger chips).')
