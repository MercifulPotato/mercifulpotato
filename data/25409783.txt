Of course, enter BPF and all that jazz.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t play as nice with BIG.little multiprocessing (AMP - asymmetric multiprocessing).<p>edit: I should note I am not advocating getting rid of preemption entirely, because it is needed for at least one processor, but having a fixed quantum causing a context switch on application CPUs is highly disruptive, both from the operation itself, and from blowing the cache all the time. Incidentally, one of the main reason for green threads.')
