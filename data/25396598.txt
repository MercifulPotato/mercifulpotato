Item(by='remarkEon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607760040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396268, text='&gt;It&#x27;s about combating weaponized misinformation.<p>Nah. It&#x27;s about whether or not we are okay with giant corporate tech companies deciding what is and what isn&#x27;t &quot;weaponized misinformation&quot;. I&#x27;m fully up to speed on the history of the United States using information as a weapon abroad, but what makes me uncomfortable about this situation is that tech folks seem to have dropped our usual skepticism about that strategy, and are somehow now okay with this happening domestically. Maybe I&#x27;m being naive, and this skepticism was never really justified, or is easily overrided by feelings about &quot;making the world a better place&quot;. Whatever. It&#x27;s still going to be weird to me to watch my friends who work in tech, who in <i>literally any other circumstance would be freaking out at the prospect of tech companies deciding what you get to see on these gigaplatforms</i>, jettison their skepticism in order to &quot;protect democracy&quot;.<p>&gt;And if you think the &quot;American spirit,&quot; or somesuch nonsense, makes us immune, I hope we won&#x27;t have to find out.<p>Not sure this invocation makes the point you think it does. Seems to me the &quot;American spirit&quot; you&#x27;re invoking in the negative is one built on a mythos of telling totalitarians, be they government or corporate, to go fuck themselves. Recent history gives one good reason to be skeptical, give the corporatism and financialism rampant in the US economy. But that&#x27;s still the mythos. I&#x27;ve still got a little Faith left.')
