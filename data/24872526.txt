It’s \n  &gt; basically the W3C’s fault, I think?

For simple API stuff, JSON ended up being <i>worlds</i> better. No fiddly XML preamble, no schemas, no envelopes, just enough structure to be able to quickly pull out a couple of fields and we&#x27;re set. Beautiful.<p>But <i>let me tell you</i> how much I appreciated XML and schema validation when we were working with fifteen different partners all using a standardized XML format with a schema. These are cats who were putting XSDs into their IDEs, clicking generate to get a class, and then just not caring.<p>So when our integrations broke because they were sending XML payloads that failed schema validation, our conversations were <i>so easy.</i><p>Before you say &quot;yes but technically you could have done the same with $OTHER_THING&quot; -- sure it&#x27;s possible, but XML is ubiquitous. Shit, our tools were in Ruby.<p>XML can be a bear, but sometimes you need a bear.')
