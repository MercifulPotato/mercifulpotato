Good idea to build off the nostalgia. Just on first glance, I noticed you&#x27;re using URLs like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacehey.com&#x2F;profile?id=123" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacehey.com&#x2F;profile?id=123</a> for accessing profiles. That seems like a bad idea, using increasing numbers for pages in general is not great, because it makes it easy to scrape for every user on the site. Why not switch to something like a UUID or random base64 code?')
