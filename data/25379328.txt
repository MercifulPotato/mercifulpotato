That is literally an apt-get or install away. If you are learning Clojure then installing the JVM should be the least of your problems.<p>Note that there are a bunch of really nice Clojure starter kits available. And now many options for editors. For learning you don&#x27;t need anything fancy, even a REPL will do to get you excited.<p>If the JVM turns you off then yeah maybe not try out languages built on top of it.')
