Who doesn&#x27;t know this? It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t know we can do these things, it just seems so wasteful to hire someone to do some thing that you (assuming you are able-bodied) can do yourself. Hire someone to &quot;stand in line for you&quot; or &quot;run errands&quot;? Are you kidding me? It&#x27;s like the Anti-Frugal.<p>I&#x27;m a bit of a DIY obsessive, so maybe I&#x27;m just all the way on the other side of the spectrum, but I don&#x27;t hire someone to do something unless I feel the task is so far outside of my comfort zone that it poses a danger to me. I usually only do it after I&#x27;ve tried the task myself and utterly failed. You&#x27;d be surprised what you can do yourself with just a few YouTube tutorials and a decent collection of tools. As a side effect, I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at being handy around the house, managing the family&#x27;s finances, repairing our cars, doing major home improvement projects including building barns and sheds, building furniture, lawn care, tree trimming, electrical, plumbing, etc. I consider developing these skills a better investment than the alternative which is perpetually needing to pay someone to do them.<p>And all it costs is my time, which is free.')
