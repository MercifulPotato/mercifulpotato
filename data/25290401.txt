I did end up taking some courses at the local community college.  But e.g. when the opportunity to participate in the Johns Hopkins CTY program came up, my parents couldn&#x27;t afford it so I did not do so.<p>(In fact in adulthood I ended up teaching at CTY for three years.  It is absolutely a program I would have benefited from as a youth, but very much skewed toward children of wealthy parents.  I distinctly remember one session I taught, how much trouble the one public school kid had fitting in.  The kid who flew in on a private jet found more in common with his classmates.)')
