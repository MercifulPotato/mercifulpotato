Nice thing about this repo is that it points to other options re. conditions with pros and cons of each one.<p>Now that I think of it, you might also be referring to the fact that Common Lisp can load libraries through the REPL. Clojure can also do this through an alpha feature, add-lib, that you can already require in any project.')
