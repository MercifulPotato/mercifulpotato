It&#x27;s reasonable to have users VPN&#x27;ing in only when&#x2F;if they need access to a specific system storing sensitive data, and even then, have only that access happen through that VPN, there&#x27;s no need to pass their Zoom conference through the same VPN, and it would be a benefit (or even a requirement) to ensure that the sensitive data is separate from their Zoom conference. E.g. a remote desktop access that prohibits copy&#x2F;pasting and file exchange so that you can&#x27;t accidentally get the sensitive data to your email or chat environment.')
