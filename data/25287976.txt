They used an adeno-associated virus to overexpress OCT4&#x2F;SOX2&#x2F;KLF4 (three transcription factors involved in pluripotency) in the mouse retina. They found that this caused it to regenerate after damage, and they also suggested it might be used to reverse aging.<p>Safety concerns (e.g. teratoma formation) are only briefly mentioned. They write that, &quot;After 10â€“18 months of continuous OSK induction, no increase in tumour incidence or negative effects on overall health were observed&quot; but if this were to be used in humans, much more rigorous safety studies would be required.')
