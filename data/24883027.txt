I remember using a rocksmith cable into my laptop running Bias FX as a last minute replacement for my amp when it died the day before a gig. Good to see that there is a product that fills in the niche for USB-C.<p>My biggest question for this product is the sample rate, and at what output the input clips. This would be fine for most passive guitars, but active EMGS or a Piezo system could definitely clip or distort the input if you don&#x27;t roll off some volume.')
