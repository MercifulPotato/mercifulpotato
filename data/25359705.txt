Using unique, randomly generated passwords for the 30 or so sites I routinely use is safer against breaches, but starts to almost require a password manager, which presumably can be broken if someone is already exfiltrating secrets from your phone.<p>In my opinion, the only route to actually make this work and still be good against breaches is to memorize a function that generates a unique password given the website name. If you type it enough youâ€™ll eventually memorize it, otherwise you can just use that function to figure it out more slowly.<p>Not to mention that if you have access to my texts a lot of sites will just let you reset my password.')
