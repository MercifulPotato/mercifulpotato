They have sound manufacturing principles and have demonstrated them for decades and caused radical shifts in the way cars are made across the world — including in the US and in Europe. Much of what Western carmakers learned from them is articulated in the exceptional book &quot;The Machine That Changed the World&quot; — which Musk has almost certainly read, despite being written in 1990 (there are clear sections that seem to incredibly presciently predict Tesla&#x27;s strategy — exceptional entertainment value in the car, self-driving capabilities, and electric engines).<p>Toyota employs far more people, produces cars that are incredibly low-key yet functional, and is backed by robust teams that work incredibly well together, as opposed to Tesla, which <i>is</i> generally functioning okay, but operates largely at the whims of Musk, much as Ford did back in the day. Which works for a while, but is not a sustainable mode for innovation. Apple is a semi-notable exception to this rule, of course, so we&#x27;ll see what happens. But again, rooting for Toyota.')
