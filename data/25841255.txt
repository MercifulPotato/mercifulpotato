Some people were probably there just to wave some flags and take some selfies, as you suggest.  Others were erecting gallows, setting bombs at the RNC and DNC headquarters, breaking windows, carrying zip-tie handcuffs into the building, actively searching the building for Mike Pence and Nancy Pelosi, fighting with the police, and so on.  (This is just the stuff we know about.)<p>I think it would be a stretch to call all the rioters terrorists, but I think a lot of them would fit any reasonable definition and they were well-organized, intentional, and numerous.  Even if a terrorist attack is unsuccessful or does not kill or injure a large number of people that doesn&#x27;t make it not terrorism.  And I think there was a real risk that members of Congress could have been kidnapped, injured, or killed if things had gone a little bit differently.')
