For most people I think laser printers probably are a huge win.<p>As someone who mainly wants to print some photos now &amp; then, sometimes in large-ish sizes, I&#x27;m not sure if there are offerings that will suit me here. Where-as, when they are running well, there are some very nice many color inkjets.<p>There have been some neat attempts to make economical better inkjet printers. Epson make a L1800 wide format printer with 6 refillable &quot;ecotank&quot; ink tanks, but it was targeted for non-primary markets &amp; vanished with no replacement. Whether it was any more reliable than the other notoriously finnicky inkjets, and what, exactly, it&#x27;s quality was, are unknown. But I think it&#x27;s an interesting example of a product that was willing to break product segmentation boundaries that have been long standing, and deliver a lot of great capabilities- tank based rather than cartridges, many colors, wide format, good specs- at a very competitive price point, many times less expensive than what one would normally have to pay for such a printer. To me, it seems like strong evidence that the problem is markets, markets that don&#x27;t want to compete, &amp; that are reluctant to deliver better capabilities. Companies would rather raise the limbo bar, allow a little more fat; pushing for better is hard, but also, why do it, if you don&#x27;t have to? Sell &amp; compete at the next tier up.')
