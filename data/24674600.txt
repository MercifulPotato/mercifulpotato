We are simulating fire by dramatically reducing fuel loads on our lands.</i><p>As a lifelong sonoma county resident, curious why were you not managing fuels already? It&#x27;s a duty to your neighbors. CalFire is very aggressive up here in certain areas, and will red tag your property if it gets past a point.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;No, I don&#x27;t believe that to be the case. Broadly speaking, prescribed burns are thwarted by a mix of local objections to smoke, noise and traffic&quot;</i><p>Can confirm this for Sonoma County, CA. They used to burn a lot when I was young. Not much anymore, mostly because of the $$$ moving up here and they have no understanding of the need for it. Well, this is the alternative.<p>Also, a lot of land is private.')
