I was looking at the wrong part of the frame, under the arch and didn&#x27;t see the staircase. Yeah, that looks pretty brutal. The police needed to be a lot more active in putting the protestors down.<p>But that, at best, upgrades the scene from a mostly peaceful protest torching vehicles to a violent clash with the police officer. Violent protests are not unheard of. It doesn&#x27;t justify the idea that anyone was trying to irreversibly staining American history with the blood of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the chain of command of the United states of America.<p>I mean, the fundamental argument here is that we shouldn&#x27;t mix the actions of the people on the stairwell facing the police with the rest of the protest. That line of thinking applied to protests was roundly debunked in 2020.')
