If you don&#x27;t want to login to your corporate account you don&#x27;t have to root the phone. If your manager wants you to have a phone with corp access then he will get you a corporate phone to do it. However many would rather root their phone than have a separate phone for their private life so Google provides that option. If that starts being a legal problem for Google I&#x27;m pretty sure they will stop rooting phones and just require people to get corp phones instead.')
