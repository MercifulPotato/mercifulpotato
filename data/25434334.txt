However, masks are important, because they enable people to safely perform essential activities like grocery shopping, and most jobs.<p>We don&#x27;t need to stop _every single transmission_, all that we need to do is make sure that each infected person doesn&#x27;t infect more than one person on average.  If each infected person infects two people, for example, that&#x27;s a chain reaction of spread where everybody eventually gets the virus.  However, if each person has a 50-50 chance of infecting somebody else, than over time infections will go down, and Covid will eventually be gone.<p>Wearing a cloth mask is not difficult, and is a very tiny tradeoff in favor of a significant decrease in transmission chance.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomaspueyo.medium.com&#x2F;coronavirus-the-swiss-cheese-strategy-d6332b5939de" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomaspueyo.medium.com&#x2F;coronavirus-the-swiss-cheese-s...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;coronavirus-mask&#x2F;art-20485449" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;i...</a>')
