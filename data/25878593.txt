It&#x27;s extremely foolish and naive to waste the power of the sun.<p>Solar panels lead to lots of tech trash, e-waste which destroys the environment. Not to mention the buildings themselves and all the electronics required to keep such a farm running.<p>This kind of over-engineering will simply never work without a fundamental re-understanding of how our world works.
