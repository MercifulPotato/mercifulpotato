It seems to rest a lot on the ideas that:<p>1) Fusion is hard. While it <i>can</i> be hard (fusing x86 will be), I do not see why it would be meaningfully difficult for RISC-V hardware (except on devices so small it&#x27;s better to have the simpler base ISA anyway), or compilers, who can in the worst case just treat fused pairs as their own instructions.<p>2) There&#x27;s anything wrong with just most software assuming a fairly fixed set of extensions, as seems to have happened. If microcontrollers want to use a subset without multipliers, that doesn&#x27;t mean anyone else has to care. If bitmanip is stabilized before RISC-V breaks into more common consumer use, why not assume it when writing code? It&#x27;s only a problem if people make it one.<p>Most of the rest don&#x27;t matter much in a global sense. The arguments about which operations go in which extensions might have meaningful merit, but it seems not very important to me.')
