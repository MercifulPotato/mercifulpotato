He then announced project homekey, spending vast sums on buying hotels and motels to convert into &#x27;housing&#x27; this summer. The astonishingly autocratic one party California government have been buying city center hotels with no discussion or oversight to convert into &#x27;homeless&#x27;&#x27;homes&#x27;. Newsom is doubling down on his failed policies and despite being family is now in danger of burning out his political capital.')
