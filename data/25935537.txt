From that level it might not be apparent, but within that component the mistake would be immediately obvious, <i>on a cursory glance</i>. Again, I don’t think React or whatever makes this less obvious.<p>But really, this just isn’t a problem I’ve seen in practice. Because of good tooling, and the ease of doing things the right way, I think the majority do it well. Those that don’t were going to fuck it up regardless of the framework or paradigm.')
