Rajnath Singh himself says to a Sikh Officer, please do a Jaikaara. Now, here, those things make a farmer terrorist.<p>I am doubtful if any Army officer, even if they are Sikh, will support what happened at the Red fort. Also the protests were supposed to be representative of are farmers, not just Sikh farmers. Giving it a religious angle will be detrimental to the protests.')
