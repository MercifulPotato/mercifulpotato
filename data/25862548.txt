It was a shock to land in a company where that was not true at all, and furthermore that it was codified into the payscale.<p>Having an MBA is certainly not a negative signal like HN tends to suggest. The bigger issue is resistance to the modern dual-track career ladders. Many people still want the management title (or an MBA credential) to guarantee them higher compensation, and they&#x27;re resistant to any system which doesn&#x27;t match those expectations.')
