I can&#x27;t help myself. This is <i>fine</i> for making art, and this is a <i>really fun</i> project that I enjoyed a lot.<p>But... I&#x27;ve seen enough unboxings of damaged goods, and ropey packaging over the years that has similarly led to damage here in real life, that it seems worth saying even amongst an intelligent crowd: the thickness of a cardboard box is <i>not in any way</i> sufficient to protect <i>any</i> goods more valuable than a book&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;video game&#x2F;CD jewel case[0] during shipping, let alone fragile goods.<p>You need to make sure that you buy a box that&#x27;s big enough to hold whatever you&#x27;re sending, plus all the padding you&#x27;re going to pack all around it to prevent it from being damaged by knocks or being dropped.<p>This will add to the weight and size of your package, and therefore the cost of shipping, but it&#x27;s worth it to ensure your goods arrive undamaged at their destination.<p>&lt;&#x2F;thatguymode&gt;<p><i>[0] Even this one is debatable given how easy these are to crack and prone they are to the hinge tabs snapping off. The CD jewel case is a wildly successful design but not, I would argue, a great design - certainly not a great design for the particularly brittle plastic they&#x27;re made out of. Ironic considering the discs themselves are made out of polycarbonate, and are therefore fairly durable.</i>')
