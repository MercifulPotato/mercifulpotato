Standard tools also tends to not change much. web protocols, C, C++, php, those are not getting away despite many attempts to reinvent the wheel. Maybe someone will make a better wheel one day, or maybe not, but for me it&#x27;s nice to have a starting point in the domain of p2p &quot;exchange&quot; that may or may not be adopted as a standard.<p>As for inflation, it makes it harder for the poor workers to become wealthier, but the issue is more when it stops being sustainable. Inflationary fiat has proven that it could fail. I personally don&#x27;t trust those persons handling it and I feel that such sentiment is growing among people. There&#x27;s reasons behind that. That is terrible for a currency. Governments may or may not start having a better monetary policy. We don&#x27;t have guarantees and much control over it, that&#x27;s the issue for me.\nI&#x27;d rather avoid an economical disaster and keep a business running than having to deal with the failure of others.')
