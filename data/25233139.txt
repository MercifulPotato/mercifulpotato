I learned quaternions in my day, and there are some obvious advantages. When I discovered GA some years ago, it was really eye opening. It makes quaternions an easy to explain concept, even intuitive, and I&#x27;ve used it since then, not only in my own work but also to teach other people. Then, I learned about differential forms, and it&#x27;s also very interesting, I think I could base my &quot;intuitive explanations&quot; in this other paradigm, but I&#x27;m not sure I should. I do not think it makes a big difference in my particular case, but as I said I find this &quot;competition&quot; a bit frustrating, and am trying to understand it better.<p>I cannot discuss with a mathematician if the Hodge star is a GA or a DFs concept, but I have found it all over the place when reading about DFs, and not so in GA related material (though I have a vague idea about how the Hodge star operator can easily be defined in GAs using the pseudoscalar). But is this really my choice? I have listened opinions about which one is more general, but not really convincing arguments (at least not arguments that are obvious to me).<p>Thanks for your explanation. I think I need to have a deeper look at this stuff. I like to get lost in these rabbit holes, but sometimes it goes a bit over my head.')
