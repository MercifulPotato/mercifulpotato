We&#x27;re effectively unsupported.  Why do you continue to argue this over and over when there&#x27;s no way Android is productive for programmers as-is?<p>Yes, plenty of musicians, painters, designers, can do real on Android.  We cannot.  The unix nonoculture, as you call it, is effectively programmer culture -- even Microsoft has included Linux with Windows now.  Supporting a Linux user land on Android would be easy (given it&#x27;s Linux kernel roots) and instantly give developers a massive library of software to work with.<p>In 12 years, not a single decent useful developer tool has ever been built natively for Android.  With a few small moves, Google could give developers 50 years worth of software to be productive with.  Instead they continue to make it more difficult.')
