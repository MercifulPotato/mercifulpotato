It&#x27;s fine on race cars where the steering racks are incredibly fast and you don&#x27;t have to park.  In the real world they are awful.<p>Navigating parking lots will be annoying, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to parallel parking where you need to turn lock to parallel without looking.  A tesla will try to park itself under ideal conditions, but there are still lots of situations where the driver needs to take over (like when there are no lines marking individual spots due to snow).<p>I know Elon is excited about getting rid of the driver, but until they actually have level 5 autotomy Tesla needs to retain the basic features that make it possible to be a driver.  Even race-inspired steering wheels with flat sections (worst offender: Audi) are annoying around town.  A steering wheel that doesn&#x27;t connect will be awful.<p>Tesla made the same mistake removing driver-oriented features in model 3 by not having a small HUD or other gauge cluster directly in front of the driver.  When the level 2 autotomy is engaged it&#x27;s unnecessary, but I don&#x27;t use those features in my Model 3 and I&#x27;d love to have just a couple key facts displayed without having to glance to the center screen.  I&#x27;m curious if retaining the driver binnacle in Model S is an admission they made a mistake removing it too early from Model 3 or they didn&#x27;t want to incur the expense of more radically altering the dash.')
