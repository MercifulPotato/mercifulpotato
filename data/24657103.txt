You get a lot of varied gameplay for a small amount of code.<p>You need an event loop, and a basic object-oriented model where all game objects have movement operations, shape vector lists, hit boxes, and object transitions upon death.  Typical object state is position and velocity, and possibly an age counter.  So, the player, each asteroid, the bullets, and the attacking aliens all have the same prototype.  Very clean.<p>I did it in assembler on a PDP-11 with bitmap graphics a long time ago.  100% fun.')
