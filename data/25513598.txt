When I first researched the device I found out that the manufacturer of its chip no longer exists. I ultimately gave up after trying many different things such as compiling different versions of gcc, setting env variables and using the configure script but I just couldn&#x27;t get it done. Compiling on the device would have been even harder because it only has a statically linked busybox and some proprietary stuff on it. As someone who is younger than the internet, it can be really hard to try something without being able to google it because no one has even tried that yet. But after seeing this video and the fact that you ultimately got this to work, I feel motivated to try this again tomorrow!')
