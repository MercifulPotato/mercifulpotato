The basic premise was that the application menu was replaced with a &quot;new document&quot; menu (like Google Drive has) that would take you to the relevant place to get things done automatically.  Standard apps could still be run, but like you might go &quot;new&gt;text document&gt;template&quot; you&#x27;d go &quot;new&gt;app&gt;terminal&quot; for example.  The File Edit View menus were also gone, replaced with a search function much like the Unity Desktop HUD where you just type what you want rather than drill through menus and point at what you want.  Window management would be mainly tiling except for dialog boxes related to the programme that made them, but ideally the search function would handle most cases where you need a dialog box, employing a simple command parser reminiscent of Zork and the like, where you would just type out what you want to be done in mostly natural language and the agent responsible for the programme will automate as much as possible.  Finally, window switching and virtual desktops would be handled by an expos√© similar to GNOME 3 Activities or macOS Mission Control.  While I don&#x27;t think its the best approach, a little bit of intelligent arrangement of windows so that maximised windows move to a new workspace, remembering what apps are opened together on the same workspace, and encouraging the user to keep to about three or four tiled windows per workspace just for the benefit of keeping clutter low, and I think it could be easily managed without too much effort - and some keyboard combos or trackpad gestures would go a long way to quickly switching workspaces.')
