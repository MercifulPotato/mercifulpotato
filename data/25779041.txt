These are someone&#x27;s livelihoods and also sources of power. Will the incumbents simply say &quot;there is no more interest in identity politics, our task is done, we made ourselves redundant&quot;?<p>This isn&#x27;t an empty argument, I&#x27;ll grant. It extends to yellow &quot;journalists&quot; (from OANN to CTH), political campaign staff (divided country = more spending on politics), social media companies, and others. Division is profitable.<p>But lots of awful things are profitable. There are always stakeholders in whatever enterprise is polluting the water, the air, or the discourse. You deal with it by offering them progressively worse compromises and hoping that, over time, the frogs will jump out of the pot.')
