My kids (and others like them) are being raised in a 2-parent household.  We encourage the kids to study, and help them where needed.<p>It&#x27;s a form of privilege, but I don&#x27;t feel guilty about it.  We take part in programs that help other kids outside the family (including after-school homework help for ELS kids).     IMHO, we all should become &#x27;privilege factories&#x27;, helping first our own kids and then other kids.  It advances quality of life for everyone involved.')
