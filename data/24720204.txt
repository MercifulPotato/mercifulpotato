Now I know that there are a lot of missing numbers in here like passenger count production impacts, etc. But the solution you seem to imply is that flight just shouldn&#x27;t happen and I&#x27;m not sure this is an option so if Boom can reduce the amount of pollution created by flying then it seems like something you should be for not against.')
