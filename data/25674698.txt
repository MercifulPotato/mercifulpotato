They&#x27;re going to feel like the game is rigged.<p>I don&#x27;t think it was a good idea to go inside the capital and it will cause very negative and counterproductive blowback.<p>Media coverage of this will be biased, compare it to the &quot;mostly peaceful&quot; protests happening all summer. It will be used as an excuse to further censorship and sideline sympathizers. The reaction will increase polarization and decrease our ability to communicate.<p>I&#x27;m not saying election fraud  happened but I completely understand their frustration.')
