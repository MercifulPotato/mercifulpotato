I also think that a law about where you could smoke would inevitably be abused and not serve anyone: for example, is it really a police matter that you can smell your neighbors smoking weed, or that someone is doing it to near you in a park. I think we need to get away from this tattle tail mentality and work on being clearer with people when their behavior is interfering with our enjoyment of our surroundings. Being polite about smoking pot needs to become a social norm, not a law.<p>And just as a concrete example, I would rather see tax money go to an ad campaign that says &quot;a lot of people find the smell of pot disgusting, smoke it away from others&quot; than into law enforcement.')
