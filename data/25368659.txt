You subscribe to a vodcast and the app automatically downloads new &quot;episodes&quot; for offline perusal as they become available, and they remain on device as long as you want them to, just like how current podcasts work.<p>Popular content creators could just manually embed ads or product placements in their videos, just like how some already do, or they could sell subscriptions at a price of their own choosing, or just accept Patreon donations etc.')
