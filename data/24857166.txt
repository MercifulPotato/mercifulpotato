Sounds so awesome, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Meanwhile old RMS, an academic with tenure&#x2F;nearly guaranteed income for life, finished us all off by establishing a political system that attracted all of the young minds to give away their software in such a way as to allow adversarial countries to obtain a 30 YEAR technological jumps without spending a friggin&#x27; dime.<p>(If you had any doubt that was his plan, you need only read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;07&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;2025226&#x2F;rms-protest-song-on-gitmo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;07&#x2F;04&#x2F;21&#x2F;2025226&#x2F;rms-protest...</a>)<p>Combined, they created a platform for extremely ignorant and naive people to sip cups of coffee while uploading our national infrastructure and data to run on all that free software all over the planet.

Maybe they can increase their efficiency using Vint Cerf&#x27;s new suite of protocols.')
