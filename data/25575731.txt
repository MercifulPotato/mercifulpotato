A teaspoon of olive oil is about 40 calories. And most people use a lot more than they realize, especially when it requires sauteing. That can add up quick.<p>Also, using fattier cuts of meat compared to leaner cuts (chicken thighs vs breasts). Of course that&#x27;s part of the &quot;fat&quot; equation.<p>Besides flavor, mouthfeel is part of what makes a food taste good. Fats usually provide good mouthfeel for the average people.<p>What I do to minimize the amount of calories I need to use is use non stick spray (near 0 calories for a splash of oil), leaner cuts of meat, and sugar substitutes like stevia.<p>If you give people a meatloaf using turkey, sugar free ketchup, no breadcrumbs, and minimal use of oil OR a meatloaf using 80&#x2F;20 ground beef with bread crumbs and real ketchup, they&#x27;ll probably pick the &quot;unhealthier&quot; meatloaf if the seasonings are equal.')
