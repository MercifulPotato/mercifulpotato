And I wonder what&#x27;s the closest thing to that existing right now.<p>On the science side there are dry studies, either relatively tiny or looking at what is there.<p>On the practical side there are technical people fighting for privacy, decentralization and against censorship, but with little feel or innovation beyond that.<p>No one does proper product research.<p>I wrote a concept for a curation tool in my studies, but it didn&#x27;t really fit the program and I wonder where it could fit after all.
