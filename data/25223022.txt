I can comfortably type over 70 wpm, but it hasn&#x27;t changed my development experience. Even during the period of relearning to type on the new layout I realized that I don&#x27;t actually have enough volume of typing to quickly learn and had to do typing exercises daily to speed up the process.<p>I&#x27;m still glad I made the switch--typing is certainly smoother and I never get any sort of cramps or pains in my hands or wrists anymore.')
