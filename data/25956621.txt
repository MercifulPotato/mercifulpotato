There are a ton of articles and documentaries about Blackrock being some secretive bank that &quot;secretly&quot; owns a big chunk of worldwide assets, which fuels this belief in my opinion. And while it&#x27;s true that they own a lot of assets, they don&#x27;t own it directly and are actually a rather boring business. They are completely passive most of the time.')
