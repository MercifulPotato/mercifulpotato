As the original article states, the measurable effects of grit seem to be a near-equivalent of conscientiousness from the well studied &#x27;big five&#x27; personality metrics, and (as far as I understand) the evidence shows that these traits are very stable over the years (conscientiousness slowly increases over age, but roughly equally even for people who have lead <i>very</i> different lives) and there are no known interventions that would reliably change them.<p>So an argument against an educational policy to emphasize grit is that, as far as we know, this will not actually increase grit in the students. Socializing children to view the world a certain way will have many effects, but not that.')
