From the document:<p>“The MEI is meant to allow media heavy websites (e.g. YouTube, Netflix) that rely on autoplay for their core experience. It is a non-goal to allow websites with a “good media behaviour” to autoplay without restrictions”<p>It doesn’t sound too good, and still doesn’t really explain how everything is seeded.')
