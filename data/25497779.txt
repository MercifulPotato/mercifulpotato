No effect on the ocean environment and sea floor beneath the berg? Surely to maximise the disruption of the ice sheet you&#x27;d need to explode the nukes underneath it. Otherwise you&#x27;ll need to use more nukes, and even exploded on the surface they&#x27;re still going to blast and cook a fair swathe of ocean and sea floor.')
