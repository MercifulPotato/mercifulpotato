Every problem type has a range of possible solutions. Most of these solutions are wrong and a few are correct with different tradeoffs. When you can&#x27;t do better without making tradeoffs, you&#x27;re on the curve.<p>Novice engineers will struggle to get something done. Intermediate engineers can get things done but fail to see the tradeoffs. Expert engineers can identify possible solutions with different approaches.')
