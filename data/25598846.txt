Why would any human participate in such a virtual economy? No matter how much money you possess in the virtual economy it is ultimately meaningless. All the goods and factories that you own are also virtual. Why even care? Well, because we like playing the game.<p>The real world is exactly the same. We live because we like living. Even if you only produce the most essential products you will still run into the meaning of life problem. Sure your food production is allowing people to live but why even let them live? If they didn&#x27;t exist you wouldn&#x27;t have to make food for them. It&#x27;s completely circular at its core. Essential needs are purely artificial just as non essential needs are purely artificial. The reality is that people are selfish (both in a good and in a bad way), they want things, especially those that don&#x27;t serve any essential purpose.<p>They don&#x27;t care about endless growth, they just care about getting the best deal possible and that&#x27;s exactly what capitalism offers. Communism at its core doesn&#x27;t care at all. It just cares about the essentials and nothing else.')
