There were weeks of articles about USPS and how there were problems. There were <i>years</i> of reporting about collusion and corruption with regard to Russia and other scandals. Whether you were looking at Fox or at NY Times or WaPo or CNN or whatever, whether it was for or against, there was neverending coverage about the Trump scandal of the week, and that Trump&#x27;s explanations were BS.  The problem wasn&#x27;t lack or reporting or criticizing Trump, it was that there was always a new scandal every week that needed coverage.')
