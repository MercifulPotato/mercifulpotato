The world&#x27;s most boring office worker use case.<p>I know it&#x27;s a deceptive metric but Task Manager shows 12.5GB &quot;In Use&quot;.  16.2 Committed.<p>Each Firefox tab has between 250mb and 1g &quot;Memory (Active Working Area)&quot;.<p>HUUUUUGeeeee long tail of 100MB trailing down to 20MB services and things. Adobe has half a dozen at all times, etc etc etc.<p>I&#x27;m game to use any other &quot;more realistic&quot; specification or monitor as I know that with memory paging and virtualization things are wonky.<p>I don&#x27;t think this indicates I <i>MUST</i> have 12 or 16 or 32GB - I have a 4GB media PC that works just fine. But I do believe it&#x27;s an indicator average user can <i>use</i> 16GB, if it&#x27;s available. Or in other words, if I buy a $1000USD laptop, I don&#x27;t think 16GB is going to waste away unused with zero benefit ever :-\\<p>Again, perfectly willing to be educated :).')
