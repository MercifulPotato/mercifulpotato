Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602505186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753580, text='&gt; I see that the economic cost of perpetuating economic classes and the economic disruption of confinement without trial far outweigh this taxpayer cost.<p>Sure, but in this instance the person you are metaphorically telling that to is the person who is paying half the costs in their capacity as a taxpayer. If there is a scheme that is cheaper than incarceration for 3rd parties and gets everyone to court on time then I&#x27;m sure everyone is in favour of it except maybe the bail bondsmen.<p>But the status quo is defensible - &quot;rich people shouldn&#x27;t be privileged&quot; isn&#x27;t a sensible argument. They have to get some comfort out of all that money. That is the point of money - to buy comfort. Lots of money = lots of comfort. Many people get rich through exceptionally hard work and it makes sense that they get something out of it.<p>If they can&#x27;t buy comfort with money then there really isn&#x27;t much point to it.')
