The solution is simply a clock that increments based on logical events within the system rather than a global real world clock. This is very much the same way time appears to work in our physical universe (i.e. time emerges from cause &amp; effect interactions at the quantum scale as entropy increases - if those events slow down, so does the percieved incrementing of time).')
