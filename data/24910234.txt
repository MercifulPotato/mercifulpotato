This includes in store purchases, digital purchases, and can even include cash purchases if you have a store discount card etc.<p>Generally IME we would get other devices associated to that user.  e.g. If Sam bought something on his cell phone, when we aggregated that data or purchased it from others, we could associate Sam&#x27;s other devices (computer, tablet etc).  Typically we would only target this consumer based upon their marketing id across devices, and not target associated devices which didn&#x27;t match to the user.  However, there are some aggregators that do track devices commonly seen with the user, regardless of a known marketing id.<p>So not impossible you could have been targeted this way.')
