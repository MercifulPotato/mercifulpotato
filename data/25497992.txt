It&#x27;s a Mac with an ARM processor.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are nice hardware and the custom silicon and the overall design is beautifully executed.  But there&#x27;s nothing in there that is a must have.<p>I might get one in a year or so once the software support is more refined.  But then again, if I want to develop on ARM, there are thousands of boards to choose from.  I already have four on my desk ready to use for whatever, so I&#x27;m not exactly lacking choice.')
