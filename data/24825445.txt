Item(by='mauvehaus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603108215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825255, text='I build furniture professionally, and I agree. IKEA stuff has been engineered to within an inch of its life to hold up for a reasonable length of time while being made of the lightest possible materials.<p>A lot of other factory made furniture is built starting from some vestige of traditional joinery, and then cheapened until it hits a price point. The construction is appalling. I don&#x27;t expect mortise and tenon face frames, but pocket screws would be a much better solution than a couple of pneumatic nails, which do nothing to stabilize the case and can&#x27;t be driven back in when they pull out under racking forces. At that point, the whole frame has to come off, and since the rest of the piece is as cheaply built, it&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess whether it&#x27;ll hold together long enough to put the face frame back on.<p>The thinness of veneers on the tops of things that look like solid wood is a crime too. Most pros do the bulk of their stripping chemically, which doesn&#x27;t risk damaging the veneer, but you usually have to do at least a little sanding, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to find out what lies beneath. The result is that you can refinish a piece once.<p>Just like in software (which was my first career), doing repair&#x2F;maintenance can be a real eye-opener.<p>If you like the look of IKEA, it&#x27;s generally a good compromise between cost and durability.<p>EDIT: I should probably add that, in fairness, IKEA stuff , at least the particleboard or honeycomb cardboard stuff, is completely unrefinishable. I haven&#x27;t seen any of their solid wood stuff come in for repair, but I&#x27;d take my chances on that if somebody wanted to pay me to.')
