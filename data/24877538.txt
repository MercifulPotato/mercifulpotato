Money isn&#x27;t some magical evil thing. Money is the unit of account that we use to measure goods and services. Something &quot;costing money&quot; means that it reduces the amount of goods and services we can create. Climate change &quot;costs money&quot; in the sense that it reduces global output. Reducing global output has a human cost, especially for low income nations.<p>To you and I perhaps it is &#x27;just money&#x27; because your standard of living is sufficiently high that a 10%, 20% or even 50% reduction is a sacrifice of comfort, and not existential. But contracting the growth prospects for India by 25% over the next decade means consigning millions of people to crippling poverty.<p>This idea that money is some morally lesser concern just fundamentally misunderstands what money is. Aggregate wealth is just all the stuff we have. Less money means less stuff. Less stuff means more poverty. That may be worth while, if we think climate change is severe. But it&#x27;s always extremely important to keep this in perspective.<p>Climate change is primarily going to hurt the world&#x27;s poor, and so are the cuts we&#x27;ll have to make to combat it. But if you don&#x27;t keep that in perspective, the cure may end up worse than the disease.')
