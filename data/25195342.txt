The fertility rate in Finland is 1.46 children per women. The fertility rate of hispanics in the USA is 3.08, more than double that of Finland. The third (or more) child born to a woman is not equal in maternal mortality rate as the first child. The rate goes up with each child born. I don&#x27;t know if we would expect it to go up to 4x higher, but certainly 3x higher wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable.')
