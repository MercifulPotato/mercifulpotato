You&#x27;re better off listening to entrepreneurship podcast, audiobooks, youtube, ycombinator blogposts, etc.<p>I also don&#x27;t think working at FAANG is hurting you, as you can always find a cofounder through ycombinator &quot;founder dating&quot; or other networking events. (What about your university alumni network?)<p>They say to be successful as an entrepreneurship you need to give it 100%. And that&#x27;s after finding an idea worth monetizing. Before might be the same. Do you have some cash saved up, and can you work full-time to find a side project that can become a startup (or sole proprietorship?)')
