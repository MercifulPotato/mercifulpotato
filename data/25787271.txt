Let me look up a checklist of failed states.<p>Yemen. Libya. Somalia. Syria. DR Congo.<p>Hmmmm. Exactly the worst countries to live in.<p>Now let me look up checklists of countries with the highest levels of human development index, life expectancy at birth, and income per capita.<p>Norway. Sweden. Denmark. Canada. The United States. South Korea. Singapore.<p>All countries with well established governments and public services infrastructure, and a social safety net (this is somewhat less true for the US).<p>Most humans living in places without governments and well organized societies live either in the middle of literal warzones, desert wastelands, or are indigenous tribes living far from civilization.<p>Bunker survival can be nice and pretty for a few years at most, but the idea that modern technology has abolished man&#x27;s dependence on his community is a fantasy.')
