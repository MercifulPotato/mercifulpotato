Blaming Brexit or saying &quot;the USA does it too&quot; isn&#x27;t a great answer when it&#x27;d be so easy to fix this.<p>I think the main thing I&#x27;ve been learning about import&#x2F;export rules in&#x2F;out of the EU in the past few weeks is how much life must have been sucking for years for people trying to trade with us who aren&#x27;t physically in Europe. A huge number of the rules that are tripping people up are stuff that&#x27;s just taken to an absurd bureaucratic extreme, like the guys who couldn&#x27;t sell their fish because the Latin name on a form had a spelling error, or the others who needed to translate their product description into every single European language before they could put their goods on a lorry.<p>The EU could easily fix all these things and make the lives of not only Brits but everyone else easier too, but the so-called single market is basically the only argument they have for why a country should join the EU. The EU has created a perverse incentive for itself to make selling things to it as convoluted and painful as possible. That is ultimately bad for everyone, but especially for people who live and work in member states.')
