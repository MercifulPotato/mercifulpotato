Further, they can bundle debs from the Ubuntu repositories using the &quot;build-packages&quot; and &quot;stage-packages&quot; manifest keywrods. One bonus of this design is that the people writing the manifest don&#x27;t have to worry about how the deb dependencies themselves are built. They only need to worry about building any third-party dependencies.<p>Now, flathub does maintain a collection of &quot;modules&quot; -- basically prewritten manifests for building various common dependencies from source. But that collection is still quite small, and writing a working flatpak manifest can involve duplicating a lot of the hard work of Debian and Ubuntu package maintainers.<p>Recently, Fedora started something promising from a maintainer&#x27;s point of view by:<p>* creating a flatpak runtime based on fedora releases, and<p>* allowing one to specify existing Fedora packages as dependencies instead of having to figure how how to build all the dependencies from source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.fedoraproject.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;flatpak&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.fedoraproject.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;flatpak&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;</a>).<p>But it is still in its early stages.')
