Oregon literally tried to ban immigrants from California back in the 1940s, and Coloradoans have a notorious saying  from the 60s &quot;Don&#x27;t Californicate Colorado&quot; (it used to be a pretty common bumper sticker) due to this effect.<p>Go to Wyoming or Idaho and people feel the same way. California has unfortunately been exporting its ridiculous cost of living and lifestyle to the American west for decades, Austin is just the latest to feel it.<p>Somewhat related, Austinites used to also have a fairly common saying &quot;Don&#x27;t Dallas my Austin&quot; (also related: &quot;Keep Austin Weird&quot;), referring to wanting to keep the &quot;corporate&quot; feel of Dallas out of Austin. The ship&#x27;s sailed on that one too, though.')
