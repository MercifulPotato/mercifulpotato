I feel like this would explain why so many open source projects these day seem surprised when confronted with the expectations of being an open source project.<p>All things being equal, a piece of software will become more popular if it&#x27;s open source. If it&#x27;s open source and worse than the proprietary alternative, it will still pick up steam, while a proprietary competitor would be largely ignored. In fact, I would claim that a proprietary competitor will even be ignored if it&#x27;s just as good, and even if it&#x27;s a bit better: because there is a cost of adoption of new technologies, being a bit better isn&#x27;t enough.<p>An example of something that wasn&#x27;t open source but succeeded anyway is Splunk. As far as I know, they have never leveraged open source, but their selling point was so unique that they didn&#x27;t need to. However, most ideas aren&#x27;t that game changing. Most projects don&#x27;t have the luxury of an idea that has an elevator pitch so attractive it will attract both investors and customers right away.<p>By 2007, Splunk had raised US$ 40M. The initial release of Elasticsearch was in 2010. How would ES have been received if they went to market with a proprietary product? I think the reason why it was open sourced from the start is quite obvious: noone would have cared otherwise, or they would have been overshadowed by an open source alternative. There was a demand for new, flashy, modern log monitoring among those that didn&#x27;t want to buy Splunk, so it didn&#x27;t have to be as good.<p>What seems to happen more frequently though is that cloud services pick up these open source alternatives, make money off them, and&#x2F;or buy up the company holding the IP. They move in and &quot;embrace, extend and extinguish&quot;, killing two birds with one stone: on the one hand they damage the primary free alternative, while at the same time improving it while owning the full rights to the improvements.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer to what to &quot;do&quot; about this but it seems like an increasing trend ever since the cloud industry started swallowing up most of what IT is about. In a way I suppose it&#x27;s unavoidable, and maybe we need to see the beauty in the inherent resilience of open source: even when it&#x27;s bought off and killed, they can never kill the previously freely licensed code. The &quot;idea&quot; if you will can live on, and must live on if we&#x27;re going to avoid a complete dystopia in the long run. So turn the frustration of your favorite project being killed off into action: realize that no code comes for free, behind every open source success is usually an unsung and unpaid hero, and if you can&#x27;t pick up the torch yourself, at least throw a few bucks to those who do. What else is there?')
