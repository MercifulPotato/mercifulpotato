He got so excited he started migrating part of the 50k line reporting Spring&#x2F;java codebase he had written 7 yrs ago to Node at the huge telecom he&#x27;s at. He says he likes rewriting sw as a way to iron out bugs and refresh neurons.<p>My mom, 75, got her degree in law 10 yrs ago being the gramma around a bunch of college teenagers. Passed the bar exam after 5 attempts and now works at a Ngo representing women in need to get pro bono divorce and custody from their wife-beating husbands.<p>Apparently motivation to learn increases with age in my family. I think maybe as a way to defeat death or something.')
