The media industry have learnt from their promotion of Trump in 2016, and will not allow this. If necessary the ruling class will rig the election. Anyone who points out that the election was rigged will of course be deplatformed, on the pretext that they are &quot;white supremacists&quot; engaging in &quot;hate speech&quot;.')
