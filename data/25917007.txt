I got an unexpected windfall last year that meant I could finally afford the downpayment on a house and in the Minneapolis suburbs (not exactly a &quot;trendy&quot; area) basic post-war (50s-70s, 2-4 bedroom) homes <i>start</i> at $250k unless they&#x27;re exceptionally tiny or in poor condition. Just a few years ago these places were going for under $200k. If I wanted to live in a more rural area of the state I&#x27;m sure I could find homes going for $110k but for a lot of reasons I don&#x27;t want to do that.')
