It&#x27;s definitely not true for the long tail of smaller companies.<p>&gt; Unfortunately as long as offer expiration is being used as the lever, you can&#x27;t entirely separate the pressure from the need to fill the position.<p>Two weeks is already a generous amount of time to wait for a candidate to make up their mind. If someone needs extra time, the hiring company is almost always happy to regenerate a new offer letter <i>if</i> they haven&#x27;t already filled the position.<p>Companies obviously aren&#x27;t going to reject otherwise qualified candidates simply because an arbitrary date has passed.<p>However, it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect a company, or multiple companies, to reserve a spot for someone indefinitely while they decide which company to join. The show must go on.')
