The safety features of my 2019 Accord are pretty worthless. The lane keep assist works in maybe 20% of cases and once even tried to stear me into a barrier, the collision detection like you said has many false positives, the rear parking sensor didn&#x27;t detect a huge rock wall which made me hit it while reversing because I got used to rely on the beeping sound, the app that lets you track the car&#x27;s location is so full of bugs it&#x27;s not even funny, the Android Auto implementation for Maps likes to bug out... ah I could go on and on, the problems with the electronics are endless. And now they are supposed to suddenly have autonomous cars which is several orders of magnitude more difficult to do than all the stuff they couldn&#x27;t implement properly so far? Sorry but I am extremely sceptical. Not that I expect any other car manufacturer to get it right any time soon either.')
