Item(by='pedalpete', descendants=None, kids=[24736503], score=None, time=1602299451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735131, text='I feel like this isn&#x27;t a good article for &quot;startups&quot;, as it completely misses the big equation of &quot;who are your early adopters, and where are they?&quot;.<p>Rather than looking at different channels, if you first understand the target segment, and when I say target, I mean REALLY refined early target, then you will understand where they are. Speak to them there, let them guide you to where others like them are.<p>Looking at channels first feels a bit more like a spray-and-pray technique.<p>I was really surprised the other day when a VC couldn&#x27;t grasp the idea that we knew exactly who our target customer is, and we are able to reach them with very little cost. They couldn&#x27;t grasp the idea that we had a very focused customer compared to the rest of the market (because we&#x27;re focused on early adopters), and that we knew this customer so well that we knew where to find them, where it doesn&#x27;t seem other people in our market are.<p>At the same time, we&#x27;re also defining a new category, so we&#x27;re somewhat distanced from the rest of the market anyway.')
