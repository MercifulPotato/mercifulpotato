Item(by='sebow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604644754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003473, text='&gt;Twitter is a very public place<p>These kind of comments always rub me the wrong way.<p>My basic argument against this is: if Twitter&#x2F;Facebook is a public space, then why are twitter&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;other staff allowed to restrict your access to it? There have been literally countless times that this has happened without people violating any laws that would apply in real life(or even their own TOS in some cases).<p>This is to say that twitter is not run by the government,and while that idea sounds scary,the point is that a private citizen is not able to remove you&#x2F;your speech from a public space in real life.This is besides the fact that these platforms claim both publisher status and the right to censor because &quot;they&#x27;re private companies&quot;(which they are, but the contradiction is clear when we&#x27;re talking about them being &quot;hosting public places&quot;).Most people forget the uneven playing field because of their addiction to these platforms.<p>We either treat them fully as private companies or begin developing a &quot;bill of rights&quot; on the internet, unless of course we keep treating everyone (including the government) as 2-nd class citizens compared to the owners of these platforms.(Who can de facto &quot;virtually jail&quot; everyone without repercussions)')
