If I truncate, I risk ending up with an invalid UTF-8 string.<p>Yes, and? You can have an invalid sequence of Unicode code points too, such as an unpaired surrogate (something Python&#x27;s text model actually abuses to store &quot;invalid Unicode&quot; in a special, non-standard way).<p>If you truncate at the byte level, you are just truncating &quot;between code points&quot;; it&#x27;s a closer granularity than at the code point layer, so you can also convert to NFC, truncate on word boundaries, etc. You just need to ignore the parts of the UTF-8 string that are invalid; which isn&#x27;t difficult, because UTF-8 is self-synchronizing.')
