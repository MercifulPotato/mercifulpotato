This Flexport article [1] was interesting, but didn&#x27;t mention any such legislative moves afoot. This article [2] lays some numbers down.<p>One way I can see to introduce and sustain nuclear-powered container vessels is to expand US naval shipyards that currently handle nuclear carrier and submarine construction to take on the container vessels&#x27; commissioning, refueling, maintenance, and decommissioning, design vessels with much longer service lifespans than current container ships to amortize the cost over a much longer period, standardize the power plants on existing designs, and carve out specially-secured multimodal ports with preferential rates for the nuclear-powered container vessels with much faster container moving infrastructure. In the US political-economic landscape, this would spread out the current military expenditures on the power plant R&amp;D, manufacturing capex, and opex costs, into a wider market.<p>It would be an interesting geopolitical power play a nation, if the nation subsidized from taxpayer funds the regulatory compliance and national flagging expenses, to make a play to dominate and control the global container shipping service market. Nearly half of container ship opex costs are fuel and port costs [3]. Subsidize away the ruinous regulatory and security compliance costs of nuclear, crater the existing bunker-fuel powered shipping market rates, and controlling global shipping could be wielded as a significant geopolitical tool. Certainly cheaper than the trillions spent on the US military, and delivers leverage at the logistical and supply chain level. I can easily see China do this too, especially with their OBOR initiative. If this came to pass by any nation, then I&#x27;m sure it would rightly alarm a lot of people and nations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flexport.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;nuclear-powered-cargo-ships&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flexport.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;nuclear-powered-cargo-ships&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;now-time-nuclear-cargo-shipping&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;now-time-nuclear-cargo-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transportgeography.org&#x2F;?page_id=2250" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transportgeography.org&#x2F;?page_id=2250</a>')
