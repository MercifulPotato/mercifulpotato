I still find BT to be a pain on Linux and Windows (unlike Mac &#x2F; iOS, where Apple has really figured out the experience). I ended up buying a bunch of Apple USB-C to 3.5mm adapters for $9 each. Fantastic audio quality and tiny enough to leave permanently attached to headphones. The only catch is they aren&#x27;t great with very high impedance headphones unless you add an external amplifier.')
