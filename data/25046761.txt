It guaranteed a bonus payout from a pool of 5% of any future sale, based on a multiple of years service (up to 5) and salary at the time of sale.<p>We sold for a similar sum and the bonuses were pretty small by SV standards - a bit more than £20,000 for a few, down to a few £00 for people who had just joined (maybe 50% annual salary for a few).<p>Me &amp; my partner had a fishy earnout clause over 12 months, but I got us pleasantly fired after 3.  Half the staff got made redundant after 6, which I don&#x27;t believe was a surprise to any of them.  Nobody buys a business for its cosy culture, or sells one expecting it to stay.<p>I think it&#x27;s right for founders to be up-front about the likelihood and consequences of an exit, which is why we put it in our employment contract.   But IMO more than 10% would be very generous for these ordinary private buyouts at 4-5× profit - no rocket ship valuations.  At least that&#x27;s clearer and more certain (and less tax efficient) than the kinds of games people play with options &amp; rounds of funding.<p>UK tech companies, salaries &amp; employee expectations are a whole different world from what&#x27;s discussed here. Maybe Baremetrics was closer to that world than SV.<p>(In another life I wish I&#x27;d looked into what our old customers Torchbox did last year which is form an employee-owned trust and sell to that - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torchbox.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-selling-up&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torchbox.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;not-selling-up&#x2F;</a> )')
