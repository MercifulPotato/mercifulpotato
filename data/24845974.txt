To put it short, all members have a Trust rank, only TR1 can publish an IP without counter verification, and only if it doesn&#x27;t shoot a Canari from our whitelist of IPs. TR1 mean perfect accurate reports for 1+ year. All other TR level can partake but need counter verification from either our own honeypot network or other TR1 peers before being integrated. There is also an AI that will be trained soon to confirm false negatives and extract more complexe patterns.')
