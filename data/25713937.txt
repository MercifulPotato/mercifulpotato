When they&#x27;re at work, they work - but at the same time, they have a healthy relationship to their workplace, due to strong workers rights &#x2F; laws.<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that social conformity there, is on par with countries like Japan.<p>In some countries, you&#x27;re almost applauded if you manage to screw over your boss &#x2F; company, by simply getting paid without doing much at all. For many, it&#x27;s the dream situation - to just clock in at work, do nothing, get paid, and go home.<p>That&#x27;s not at all the case in the Nordic countries, where you&#x27;re expected to work hard and produce.<p>Strong sense of work ethic, labor laws, balanced with expectations of healthy work&#x2F;life balance.<p>(But with that said, there are some serious drawbacks. If your only goal is to accumulate as much wealth as possible, at all costs, and as quickly as possible - Nordic countries is not the right place, IMO).')
