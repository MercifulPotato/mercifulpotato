Might do a small thing with my parents and sister, but that gets less appealing as the rates climb.<p>Flying to Florida for a wedding in December, which I&#x27;m very unhappy with.  But my wife&#x27;s a bridesmaid, the bride&#x27;s her best friend she hasn&#x27;t seen for years, and the bride cut down on guests.  She&#x27;s doing a webcast for most family and friends.  I wish they&#x27;d just delay it.<p>No Christmas gatherings.')
