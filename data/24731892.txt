Ads should be individually approved by publishers and not subject to change after approval.<p>Partially agree. Publishers should definitely be able to <i>blacklist</i> advertisers. However, networks like Google get thousands of ads that run for only a handful of impressions. Asking publishers to manually approve every single ad that might run is onerous.<p>I <i>would</i> like to see approval required for anything executable: JavaScript, Flash, etc. Waking up to find that your website has become an attack vector through malicious banner ads is not okay.<p>&gt; Ban user tracking and targeting.<p>Mostly disagree.<p>I click on a meme site. There&#x27;s not a lot of relevant ads for that. I could get served ads for lolcats-themed merchandise that I don&#x27;t want, or low-value broad-targeted ads that probably still aren&#x27;t relevant to me. Nobody wins.<p>Or, based on my search history, I could get ads for computer parts that I&#x27;m actually interested in. I get ads that are relevant, the publisher gets more revenue, and the advertiser has a real chance at a sale. Everyone wins.<p>&gt;  It&#x27;s a red queen&#x27;s race and no one benefits.<p>That couldn&#x27;t be less true.<p>Now, systems that try to track individual <i>people</i> (rather than blocks with similar demographic&#x2F;behavioral traits) are a serious problem. We <i>do</i> need stricter controls to prevent this.<p>&gt; Pay for ad time slots, not user impressions.<p>Here we go. You want to throw away the very thing that democratized digital advertising. You want a system where either you pay five figures to reserve a time block, or you don&#x27;t get to play.<p>Hard disagree.<p>&gt; Use anti-trust to prevent link aggregators from being advertisers.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how anti-trust ties into this. Are you alleging that, say, Fark has a monopoly status, and is abusing it to gain an unfair advantage in an adjacent market?<p>Now, I think you&#x27;re on to a very real problem here--advertising dollars are being diverted away from the organizations that produce content--but severing the only real revenue source for most aggregators seems like an inappropriate response.')
