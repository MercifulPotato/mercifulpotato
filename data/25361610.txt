I followed the MongoDB case a bit and it&#x27;s not exactly how many make it sound like. MongoDB was doing fine as a company. It wasn&#x27;t like they were unable to pay their programmers because AWS offered a hosted MongoDB.<p>In the months before that controversial license change they got plenty of funding from investors.<p>It looked all more like investors created expectations of future revenue and they became cold feet if they could meet those expectations.<p>It remains to be seen how this will work out in the long run.
