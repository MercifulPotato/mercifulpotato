Item(by='funkaster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607897133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410781, text='A few weeks ago, over the Thanksgiving break I made this quick hack to aid with the ergonomics when programming in my iPad (my mobile setup is an iPad pro with Blink Shell and an AMD PC that I mosh into). My default keyboard layout is programmer dvorak with caps lock mapped to ctrl key. I can&#x27;t get that on the iPad, but I can map the keyboard to Dvorak layout (close enough). However, mapping caps lock to ctrl is really flaky and some times works, some times it doesn&#x27;t (IIRC Apple broke it a few releases ago). Tired and starting to develop a pain in the wrist, I decided to quickly hack a pedal to type ctrl. I thought it was going to take a lot to get used to it, but I was wrong. It&#x27;s super intuitive and fun :)\nIf you want to repro, I uploaded the STL and OBJ to 3D print the base, the firmware and other instructions. Enjoy!')
