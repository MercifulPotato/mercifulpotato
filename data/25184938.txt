You should think on this, and realise how much trust and faith you are putting into the stories you are told, and how much or how little it coheres with what is the gold standard - your personal experience.<p>Yes - at school, I think you were convinced I think by water condensating and by the loud pop (as was I).  This is almost the definition of a magic trick!  You are told it explains something, but of course at that age, you wouldn&#x27;t have looked at the experiment with a critical or knowledgeable eye.  The evidence that we were shown as kids should not be considered rigorous or acceptable in science - mixing invisible gases in an open container that allows air in, is not rigorous.  Personally I have not seen any examples of this experiment that are undertaken in what I deem to be an acceptable scientific manner.<p>I too believe that computers work.  :)  I don&#x27;t dispute that we are able to use things to create some excellent technology.  What I dispute that we know what we&#x27;re doing.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that we do not get to see or understand the first principles.  We do not see them in almost any of the science we are presented when we are taught at school.  What we are given are claims and explanations that are not supported by the evidence.  We are put in a position where we are forced to trust.  It seems we require an explanation, so much so that we will latch on to any story rather than sit uncomfortably with one or 2 open-ended hypotheses.<p>The heart of the issue, we are not given evidence to know, we are given a claim to believe.  I can know I am resting on a table.  I can know that if I drop my pen it will fall on the table.  There is no debate to be had.  There is a clear path to experience, or empiricism.  Empiricism is purported to be the basis of science, but some very basic ideas are not actually possible to experience it seems.<p>In the original article here, evolution is the implied explanation.  But, we have no means to test or confirm the truth or not.  We cannot see evolution occurring.  (Feel free to point me to an article or something that you think shows this.)  Yet we are all taught it as if it was true!  If it is as I say, what we are presented with is an unfalsifiable theory which is without evidence.  This is to say it is based on trust and faith.  This is religious thinking, and is no different to a religion.<p>Finally, are you aware of the replication crisis in science?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Replication_crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Replication_crisis</a><p>and<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-39054778" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-39054778</a><p>&quot;According to a survey published in the journal Nature last summer, more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&#x27;s experiments.&quot;<p>There should be 100% replicability, not 30%.  Science shouldn&#x27;t be about playing the odds in a casino.<p>And as to the science we do, funding is probably the most serious issue.  All science funding comes from the government, the military and corporations.  These 3 entities form our governance structure.  This is to say they have vested interests in ensuring that only certain areas are looked into, the point being is that science is not an independent field of enquiry - it is about what is expedient to the governance structure.')
