Say I have two independent ISP routers, an offshore VPS with a \nperfect stable connection, and an old video call software which disconnect the call when the TCP stream breaks. Is there a custom protocol that can retry packets on the other 2nd ISP connection, or even say duplicate all packets like RAID 1 for hard drives, and the VPS+Client will determine which packets made it and which didn&#x27;t, ensuring perfect connections.')
