So look:<p>&quot;GitLab is second only to Microsoft-owned GitHub in this market. GitHub is tough to compete with in part because of Microsoft&#x27;s financial clout and the fact that GitHub is more a strategic asset to win developers than a profit centre.&quot;<p>Aren&#x27;t ms kinda dumping the price here.
