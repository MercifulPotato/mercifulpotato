Today we have new techniques available. I think the shuttle could be inspected much quicker now than 10-20 years ago - AI can help a lot with automated checks and 3D-printing as well as simplified tile layout (like the Soviets used for Buran) would also shorten inspection time and reduce cost.<p>I honestly see the main risk with Starship in the heat shield. Musk loves to take unnecessary shortcuts like no flame deflector tunnel on the launch pad which lead to completely avoidable problems (like the SN8 static fire that destroyed an engine due to debris from the launch pad).<p>The Shuttle had foam damaging tiles and Starship may have debris from the launch or landing damage heat tiles. They will have to be very careful with that and not be arrogant about it.')
