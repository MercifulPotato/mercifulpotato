Corporate censorship is legal.<p>Therefore, whether the censorship is justified, or not, there is also room for accusations of impropriety.  Ergo: where there is room for accusations, there accusations will go.<p>The fact that leadership at Big Tech Companies tend to publicly espouse liberal ideas paints a big bullseye for conservatives to shoot at.
