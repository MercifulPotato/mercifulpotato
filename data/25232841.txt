So it&#x27;s relevant and provides context to that policy of focusing on company mission, instead of making statements about racial inequality, police brutality, and unfair societies.<p>You are entitled to political thoughts. If you can handle it, you are even allowed to share them with colleagues. But don&#x27;t get upset if others have different political thoughts. And certainly not get upset enough to accuse them of racism.')
