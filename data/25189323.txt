In the case of the Tesla Model 3&#x2F;Y, the motors won&#x27;t work without the VCSEC, the security controller from the car, which also needs an unlock sequence to activate. AFAIK separating the VCSEC from the motors is still an open research problem, as is unlocking the VCSEC without a key card.<p>As for the battery, that also is traceable and necessarily so if the new operator wishes to use a Supercharger. A Tesla that can&#x27;t supercharge is much less valuable than a Tesla that can, so that would be pretty hard to hide from the end user. A stolen battery ends up being a con job on the end buyer.')
