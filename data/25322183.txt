I kind of agree with you, however I just keep my contact list small. Probably I miss some opportunities with that but at the same time it mostly consists of people who have little interest to traverse my contacts. As soon as there&#x27;s an equally well working alternative for job hunts, I&#x27;m off but I don&#x27;t see that yet. I&#x27;m curious about honeypot.io etc. but I don&#x27;t like the idea to put people with price tags online')
