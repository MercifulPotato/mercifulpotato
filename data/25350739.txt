I&#x27;ve run them all in production, so getting to brass tacks I say this will push people into either SLE or Ubuntu&#x27;s arms for the fact that these are the two main alternatives that offer both a support model and have high deployment numbers and great teams behind them. I prefer SLE but to each their own. The fact that I have advocated for rolling release as the distro model of the future doesnt negate the many cases where tracking with RHEL for stability is required.<p>That said, I think a lot of issues I&#x27;ve seen would be helped by people not being so afraid of rolling release , so maybe reconsider the fundamentals before being too chicken little. Also, I suspect this could be the kick we all need to start pushing nix and guix more seriously.<p>I like stream. A handful of my side projects are running it now, but IBM done fucked up with this move.<p>ps: please, dont go trusting oracle')
