For example, I have a hard time imagining why they chose to specifically quote &quot;American Patriots&quot;, as if <i>that</i> somehow contributes to the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back. Perhaps they have a strategic reason for going about this how they did, but I think it will have some negative 2nd&#x2F;3rd order effects. that they haven&#x27;t yet realized.<p>I imagine we are still only in the early days of the conflicts that are to come in this sphere (and I&#x27;d include just about every company and political faction in them, unfortunately).<p>(Also because apparently I have to state this explicitly in every comment related to Trump: I do not support Trump, his supporters, the recent events that occurred at the capitol, etc etc)')
