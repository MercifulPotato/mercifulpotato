Just because Google produced them does not mean they are the right choice for any broader adoption than they already have.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18188519" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18188519</a> for example, and note that the the discussion on personal vs technical aspects has already happened.<p>I agree with the idea of schemas for API definition. JSON and XML are more transport-level, lacking major semantics that must be enforced in the software, Therefore, schemas need to be expressed with language bindings.<p>Protocol buffers have good traction here because of the investment that Google has made in IDL with multi-language bindings. There are other serialization formats as well with many language bindings, but investment in the IDL needs to be made. The OP is drafting off of Google.<p>So, yes to the thesis and no to one of the conclusions.')
