And it&#x27;s frustrating to see most people getting tricked this easily.<p>In the old days, when telecommunications devices and networks were getting monopolized like this, we&#x27;d <i>break the company up</i> into smaller entities, and then regulate the hell out of them, especially on monopolized&#x2F;duopolized prices.<p>In a just world, Apple would <i>never be allowed</i> to set the app store tax at all, a group of state or federal regulators would have strict price caps set by the public at large and enforced by state or federal law. (This is how many places still handle Electricity and Natural Gas. This is approximately what we did to AT&amp;T, when they tried this same crap).<p>If you own a monopoly&#x2F;duopoly, you should expect to be heavily regulated like one. If you don&#x27;t like that, <i>stop monopolizing</i> that market. This isn&#x27;t rocket science, it&#x27;s the <i>conservative</i> position on this issue.')
