I hadn&#x27;t thought about that.<p>&gt; Obviously since you are just starting out your users won&#x27;t have too many issues merged<p>Sponsors may very well be looking for a temporary fix, something that can last them a year, or one project. No credibility necessary, just a fix.<p>Not really a problem, though; a sponsor can fork on Github, then put a bounty and accept the PR even though upstream would never merge it.')
