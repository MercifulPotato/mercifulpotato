If they don&#x27;t survive it will just be a matter of time before ES is dropped by Amazon and totally unsupported.<p>I don&#x27;t get how you came to this conclusion.<p>If Elastic goes bust, why would Amazon suddenly drop support for product? They have customers paying millions for the service, why the heck would they drop it?<p>If anything I would expect Amazon to keep the service and work harder to ensure good service, so they can absorb that portion of the market not being served.')
