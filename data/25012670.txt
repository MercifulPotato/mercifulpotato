What matters is the density at which you can have a checkerboard of these things toggling in opposite directions without neighbors inducing failures. \n Otherwise we&#x27;re simply trading the propagation time of electrons for the propagation time of heat rather than the propagation time of light.<p>Light may move fast, but heat doesn&#x27;t.<p>Edit: also, I&#x27;m skeptical about power efficiency if the principle of operation for this thing is fundamentally based on turning free energy into heat.  Generally heat is a waste product of the switching event, leaving hope that future generations can continue to reduce that waste.  Here, the waste product is what makes it work, meaning that it&#x27;s probably very inefficient (joules per switching event) and unlikely to improve much.  Current mode logic is wicked fast, but never caught on (except for I&#x2F;O drivers) because fundamentally it works by burning up energy into heat -- it&#x27;s crazy inefficient and hasn&#x27;t improved after 20ish years.')
