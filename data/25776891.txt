If you take Europe or even the EU as one entity then it is one of the most unequal places on Earth when it comes to income and wealth.<p>Bulgaria is an EU member state and in 2018 had an adjusted net national income per capita of $8,148.[0] Luxembourg is part of the EU as well and in 2018 it was $60,189. Denmark was at $52,641. Poland was at $12,954.<p>All of this varies <i>enormously</i> from country to country.')
