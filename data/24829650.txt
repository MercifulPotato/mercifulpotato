I expect better from HN.<p>&quot;Indicative of possible criminal conduct&quot; means more than just &quot;looking like a criminal.&quot; That means, if you were to be arrested for something, your use of Monero might count as evidence that you were involved in criminal activity. Combined with enough other circumstantial evidence, it might even contribute to your conviction, even without a smoking gun. This would depend on the judge and jury, but it&#x27;s worth noting.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; for people to ignore the risks of certain behaviors and pretend those risks don&#x27;t exist. You apparently care a lot about optimizing a particular dimension: privacy. Recognize that other people have different mixes of priorities. Not everyone must agree with yours. Some people who disagree with you might even comment on this very site, as offensive as that is.')
