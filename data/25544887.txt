The reason I order them is because they&#x27;re incredibly cheap ($8 medium pies with 3 toppings, at least half the price of local pizza shops), ease of use (online purchase is seamless), tracking (you can see the stage it is in) and consistency. Pizza to me is more or less a commodity product as I&#x27;m sure it is with a lot of Americans<p>All of these reasons are driven by technology. The process is automated so it runs very efficiently and with minimal human intervention. No person has to constantly be opening the oven to see the progress being made, which lowers the temperature of the oven and leads to inconsistency, and takes longer. The app is nice and most importantly the product is consistent. I think once I got received a pizza with a missing topping, but didn&#x27;t follow up on it.')
