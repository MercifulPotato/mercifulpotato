See e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;som" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;som</a>.<p>&gt; Lua 5.1 has float as the only numeric type<p>It internaly differs between int and float.<p>&gt; Ruby, Python and JS all need to copy x into a new VM Register when it’s used<p>Even the OpenSmalltalk VM is much faster than CPython, as well as V8.')
