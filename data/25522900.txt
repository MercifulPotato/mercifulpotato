If someone is pressuring you to sleep with them and you&#x27;re not sure whether you want to, they&#x27;re not your friend.<p>2.  If someone is harassing you because you&#x27;re still a virgin, they&#x27;re not your friend.<p>[Edit:  It&#x27;s in the relationships section.  So I guess it means &quot;If things aren&#x27;t great yet in the bedroom, and someone&#x27;s making you feel inadequate because of that, the someone in question isn&#x27;t your friend.&quot;]')
