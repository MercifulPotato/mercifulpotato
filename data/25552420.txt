They are now blocking requests from Gambia and a group of other countries, which has accused Myanmar of genocide at the World Court, to access posts and communications from Myanmar police, military, and other government officials[1].<p>Beyond that, just look at the dumpsters-ful of hate speech (anti-trans memes, etc.) out of the American right wing, passing without criticism; only recently has Facebook bothered to at least even point out that <i>lies are actually lies</i> in their ecosystem.<p>It would be wrong, perhaps, to say that Facebook <i>supports</i> hate.
