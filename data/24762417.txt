I personally had many dozens of neat &quot;Apps&quot; installed, giving me all kinds of weird &amp; interesting music experiences via the Spotify app.<p>That all of course got axed[1].<p>More product-oriented decisions like removal of messages &amp; inbox[2] I am more sympathetic to, as this is more them picking &amp; choosing? Re-work is hard[3].<p>But cutting off remaining support for DJ apps &amp;c, as has recently happened: that&#x27;s un-good[4]. Spotify withdrawing the remote-control capabilities that standard Freedesktop users have enjoyed for a decade, that&#x27;s sad as heck[5] &amp; just petty (ed: this might be more &quot;whoops&quot; than sinister intent).<p>In sympathy with the GDPR spirit of being-able-to-get-your-data-out, it feels there&#x27;s actually a decent phase happening now, where sizable parts of the tech world are waking up to the realization that it needs to act less crummy, not box people in, not leave users feeling so trapped. Efforts like Data Transfer Project[6] have a long way to go, are frankly not yet very practical for much, but feel like one of the few places tech can redeem it&#x27;s name, long term, where dignity might be restored to both parties. A starting place for not needing to be regulated into the sun as mal-competitive &amp; toxic. This kind of re-opening from the locked-off closed inaccessible cloud tech is also, likely, necessary for innovation &amp; competition to emerge, which is a thread Cory Doctorow discusses in his excellent &amp; on-point discussions on Adversarial Interoperability[7]. Alas, as this Spotify story &amp; their history indicates, not everyone is willing to help turn around our bad practices &amp; treat other humans with technical respects &amp; deserving of technical rights or capabilities.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160310102643&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.spotify.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;apps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160310102643&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer....</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musically.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;spotify-is-removing-its-inbox-and-messaging-feature&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musically.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;spotify-is-removing-its-inb...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inverse.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;56923-spotify-update-backlash-recently-played-alphabetical-scrolling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inverse.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;56923-spotify-update-backlas...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;24&#x2F;21192473&#x2F;spotify-revoking-support-developer-api-third-party-dj-apps-algoriddim-djay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;24&#x2F;21192473&#x2F;spotify-revoking...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.spotify.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Desktop-Linux&#x2F;Spotify-stops-publishing-artists-and-song-titles-to-Dbus&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;4824544" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.spotify.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Desktop-Linux&#x2F;Spotify-stops...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatransferproject.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatransferproject.dev&#x2F;</a>')
