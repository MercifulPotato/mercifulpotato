Item(by='anderspitman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603740990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893615, text='&gt; I set GatewayPorts clientspecified in my &#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh&#x2F;sshd_config on the server. This is needed so that the client (RaspberryPi) can specify which ports to enabled reverse tunneling on.<p>This isn&#x27;t quite what GatewayPorts does. By default, the client can open a tunnel to any ports the user has access to, but those ports can only be connected to from localhost on the server. So even if you don&#x27;t have a firewall, external IPs can&#x27;t connect to your tunnel (but your reverse proxy can, if it&#x27;s running on the same machine). You can use GatewayPorts to allow binding from other IPs. This is useful if you want to tunnel arbitrary TCP traffic, not just HTTP through your reverse proxy.')
