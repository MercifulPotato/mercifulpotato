Usually I&#x27;d get stuck after a few sentences but then remember a whole bunch of concepts attached to that sentence and start writing for a while.<p>I&#x27;d then go back and find any gaps or things that I was unsure of or didn&#x27;t make any sense and then study those with extra caution. It was a very mentally-intensive exercise but it had proved the most successful study technique thus far in my academics.')
