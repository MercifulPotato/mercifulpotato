Kennedy voted in the affirmative for both Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Obergefell v. Hodges, both of which both being particularly egregious examples of legislation from the bench.  I am both pro gay marriage and pro-choice - but neither of these things exist in the Constitution. Not one word. Either amend the Constitution or allow states to create their own legislation.  If both Roe&#x2F;Casey and Obergefell disappeared overnight - do you think abortion and gay marriage would all of a sudden become illegal in New York and California?<p>If the Democrats don&#x27;t see the judicial branch as an extension of the legislative, then why would they be threatening to pack the court with justices that will vote for their causes?')
