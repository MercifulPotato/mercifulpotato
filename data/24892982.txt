LTV forecaster 2. Budget Allocator 3. Bidder for our own service.<p>We are running a video editing app service, which has IAP products. And we wanna gather as much user group as possible globally, keeping unit economics positive.<p>So, is there any marketing solution to automatically turn off or change budget&amp;bid of Facebook, Google ads, Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter advertisement campaigns with forcasted ROAS (estimated CLV of user group acquired by a campaign&#x2F;CAC of campaign)?<p>For example, suppose that we&#x27;ve spent $300 on Facebook ad campaign A since 2 weeks ago, and revenue from the user group acquired by the campaign A is $150 (but the estimated CLV is $350). Then we wanna increase budget on the campaign A by 20% automatically.<p>And if we&#x27;ve spent $300 on Facebook ad campaign B since 2 weeks, and revenue from the user group acquired by the campaign B is $80 (but the estimated CLV is $200). Then we wanna stop the campaign B right away.<p>Now we have payment performance data for each marketing campaign collected from Adjust and Appsflyer. So we can provide this data as a raw data or set up the integration on Appsflyer.<p>Is there any SaaS you can recommend for this situation?')
