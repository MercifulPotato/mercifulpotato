I know it worked for me with their pretty cool TheC64.<p>Why not buy a <i>real</i> vintage home computer then? Well, in the case of the C64, vintage ones are unreliable, hard to get to work with modern screens and hard to get stuff in&#x2F;out of them. You end up needing expensive extra hardware for all these things and for what? -- the retro remakes are pretty convenient out of the box, and give you the convenience of an emulator with the look &amp; feel you remember from your childhood.<p>However, if you didn&#x27;t own one of these as a kid, then you&#x27;ll find them pointless.')
