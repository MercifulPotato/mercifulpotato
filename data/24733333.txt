In my defence &quot;argparse&quot; is a lot more explicit than &quot;clap&quot; for a such a library. Also argparse&#x27;s last update was 2 years ago, so there&#x27;s been quite a bit of overlap.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s an other problem with the current package ecosystem: you often end up finding multiple packages purporting to do what you need, and it can be tricky to figure out which one you want. As an example, if you want a simple logging backend the log crate currently lists 6 possibilities: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;log" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;log</a><p>I picked &quot;simple_logger&quot; basically at random.')
