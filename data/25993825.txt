Until now weâ€™ve been focussing completely on building a scalable, reliable product by standing on the shoulders of these cloud providers where we can take advantage of services like S3, RDS, and elastic compute.<p>We&#x27;ve done a deep dive into the cost model for metrics and posted more about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;pulling-cost-curtain-back" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;pulling-cost-curtain-back</a>. We are still working on a full cost analysis for logs - I&#x27;d be happy to send it to you once we have it (feel free to email me mat@opstrace.com to chat about your use case). Our goal is to be super transparent (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25992081" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25992081</a>) with cost and to have a page on our website that helps someone determine what to expect (probably some sort of calculator with live data). Our UI will also show you exactly what your system is currently costing you with some breakdown for teams or services so you know who&#x2F;what is driving your monitoring cost.\nWe&#x27;re doing user testing on our to-be-released UI now and would love to have people like yourself give us early feedback (since you mentioned the BigQuery interface).')
