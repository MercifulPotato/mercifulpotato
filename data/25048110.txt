What type of treatment is needed (pain tolerance is different from person to person, so even if two people have the same injury or disease, one might say 8 and need pain killers and the other might say 3 and not). It will be used to gauge if a treatment is working (when you first came in you were at a baseline of 6, but after taking this treatment, you&#x27;re at a 2), and so on.<p>Thus, a personal scale makes sense.')
