It&#x27;s good to squash them all when the work is ready to be merged, so that there&#x27;s a single, clean, clearly explained, atomic commit to add functionality. No one gains anything from seeing a dozen work-in-progress&#x2F;cleanup commits. The history of how I got to the merge point isn&#x27;t important. A single unit of new, tested functionality that&#x27;s ready to merge only needs one clear commit in most cases.')
