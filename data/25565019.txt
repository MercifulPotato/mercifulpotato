I wanted to preserve them, so wanted to upload them to Google Photos.<p>It took me some looking around in eBay to find a camcorder to play these back. When it came home, I realized that I needed a FireWire 400 port to capture full resolution. So more digging around for a FireWire PCI-E card. I was finally able to transcode and upload some 15GB worth of video. It took 3 minutes on my gigabit internet for the upload. About a month for the whole process acquiring the hardware etc.<p>When I think about these tapes some 50 years from now, it might as well be completely unrecoverable, not because the tapes went bad, but because we have nothing to read them. Makes you wonder about galactic time scales like in Star Trek.')
