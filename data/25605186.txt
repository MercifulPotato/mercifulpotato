It can even run the Python REPL fine, though it takes a good number of seconds to start up.  Apache is no problem and it can host a website, though I imagine it would crumple with more than a dozen requests a minute or so.  Actually, the only real annoyance for that kind of work is that the machine&#x27;s too slow to authenticate SSL keys in a reasonable time, so logging in takes forever and you can&#x27;t host an HTTPS site.<p>Given this ARM machine is probably ~100x faster, if you&#x27;re willing to add some swap for flexibility, I imagine it&#x27;d be usable for a wide variety of low-memory tasks.')
