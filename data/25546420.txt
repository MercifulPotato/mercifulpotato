Its not that crazy to think this would leak out somewhere.<p>I&#x27;ve written (un)parsers where we would just treat IPv4 addresses as integers because A) that is how they were treated in the binary data and B) given what we were doing with the data, we didn&#x27;t actually care about the IPv4 field.')
