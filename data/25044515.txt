Most git frontends seem to be really quite bad for many reasons. Though &quot;Push failed, want to pull, merge and push again? [Yes]&quot; =&gt; constant &quot;merged ssh:&#x2F;&#x2F;upstream.server&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;repo.git merged into branch master&quot; commits being added to the history certainly irks my OCD the most. These frontends also seem to try and hide what git does, which leads to incorrect and confused mental models and much more frustration down the line than just learning to do it the git way directly. Yes, git is a &quot;my way or the high way&quot; tool, that&#x27;s not great or something to emulate, but it is what it is. Trying to work around that only results in more pain.<p>Only use the git command line, use gitk for browsing history graphically if need be, and git-gui for preparing commits. git-gui seems to be the best GUI for making commits (and is probably written in Perl with Tk).<p>Logical conclusion from &quot;only use the git command line&quot;: Also never make a dirty merge from your web browser.')
