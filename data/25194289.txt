More precisely, one would create custom slopes for him, which he would then follow automatically after hitting &quot;Play&quot;. The goal was to prevent him from falling or crashing.<p>There was even a YouTube video of a guy who must have spent hours creating slopes, which the stick man would then follow to the precise melody of some classical piece of music. Truly epic.<p>Does anyone remember the name?<p>UPDATE: Line rider! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vcBn04IyELc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vcBn04IyELc</a>')
