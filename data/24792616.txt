Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24792687], score=None, time=1602789333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24792228, text='&gt; moderating any platform is a challenging endeavor, mostly because of malicious users. Having all the rules broken down in detail allows bad actors to either get close to the line but not cross it, or abuse the system while technically not breaking any rules.<p>Couldn&#x27;t that same argument be used to support secret laws and secret courts enforcing those secret laws? After all, we&#x27;re definitely seeing the problem of people going as close as possible to the line without overstepping.<p>I think those laws would help tremendously, but mostly by forcing everyone to be overly cautious not to break them, creating strong chilling effects. They&#x27;d stifle freedom, and so does Google&#x27;s secret law system.<p>To minimize fallout, I think it&#x27;s more useful to split up Google along services (Search, Youtube, Gmail, Office&#x2F;Suite etc). You could search for double plus ungood things on Google Search then without running the risk to loose access to your emails.')
