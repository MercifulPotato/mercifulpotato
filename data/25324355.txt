If you&#x27;re paying less than that, you&#x27;re being subsidised by the land owner (the city, and thus the residents of that city)<p>There is always land available to buy, â‚¬10k per square metre for this property for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tranio.com&#x2F;france&#x2F;adt&#x2F;1928891&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tranio.com&#x2F;france&#x2F;adt&#x2F;1928891&#x2F;</a><p>Maybe that&#x27;s too much to park your car, but land has a cost, why should a car owner be allwoed to store their property on public land for free? Can I build a shed in that space instead?')
