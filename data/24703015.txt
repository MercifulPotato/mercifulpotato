Everyone likes to say that syntax doesn&#x27;t matter, but it can affect your time-to-POC, example comprehension, debugability, especially if you&#x27;re starting a greenfield project.<p>Otherwise, I would say stick with elixir.  It is more opinionated about how to do tests, how to organize your code, how to do documentation, how to deploy, how to use libraries, all of which will make your life way easier, especially for a greenfield project.')
