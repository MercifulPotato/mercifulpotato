We&#x27;re going straight in space-time, but space-time itself is curved because of the heavy mass nearby (the Earth). This is visualized by the rocket curving towards the planet in the video, and the bent sheet experiment where the balls spiral towards the center.<p>So we&#x27;re curving in towards the center of the mass of the Earth, but the reason we don&#x27;t end up in the core of the Earth is because the surface stops us. The Earth is &quot;pushing&quot; us away from the center, and that&#x27;s the acceleration. It&#x27;s accelerating you off your straight line path, and this is the deviation from the geodesic.')
