Item(by='LaunchSong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603474921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871410, text='Thanks for the suggestion. Songs are ranked and listened to only within a genre so I would expect each genre to end up with its own popular set of songs.<p>I am definitely open to further experimentation but so far users have enjoyed the ranking process and it is easier to say I like this song more than this song than it is to say this song is good vs bad.<p>Also the upvote downvote system is ripe for abuse comparatively. Because LaunchSong doesn&#x27;t let you link to a song to rank it gives artists without an existing audience a level playing field (because people cannot say go upvote my songs). Furthermore the elo rating system lets newer songs climb more quickly')
