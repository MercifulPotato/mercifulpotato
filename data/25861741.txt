It&#x27;s just the cost of business to support rapidly scaling and developer velocity to try to capture as much of the market as fast as possible. As long as your profit stays ahead of your cloud costs, mission accomplished.<p>If the above does not apply, of course you&#x27;re going to be better off using a combination of Cloudflare (CDN, networking), Backblaze (object store, also has S3 compatibility layer), and either dedicated service providers (OVH) or VPS providers (Digital Ocean). Perhaps even colocation if you&#x27;ve got the experience in house (Stackoverflow and Wikipedia, for example).<p>AWS and other cloud providers are designed for the price insensitive, who prefer having a single vendor, more abstraction away from the metal, or require support for bursty workloads. Shop around and model your run rate based on expected workloads. There is no best or worst solution, only a scale of solutions for your use case(s), ranging from suboptimal to optimal.')
