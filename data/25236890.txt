Item(by='theon144', descendants=None, kids=[25237026], score=None, time=1606561175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232488, text='Mishima is unfortunately pretty popular in the alt-rightish kinds of circles too (one of the few articles I could find about him in English were published on Quilette, for instance), but don&#x27;t let that colour your impression too much. There&#x27;s worlds of difference between the kind of nationalism and militarist creed that Mishima was espousing, and whatever people latch onto his work. (Which is not to say that the appropriation is not at least in part understandable.)<p>Nevertheless, I think Mishima is best interpreted completely on his own terms, as he essentially gave a blueprint for his life in his work - and vice versa. His personal life story and the themes he engages are both equally as fascinating and deeply intertwined, and I personally feel there&#x27;s lots of beautiful and unique insights about the sorts of questions that are timeless.<p>I can only recommend Schrader&#x27;s <i>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</i> (curiously not mentioned in this article.) It&#x27;s obviously a rather poetic&#x2F;movie-style retelling of Mishima&#x27;s work and story, and I did go into it rather sceptical, seeing as its context is rather removed from Mishima&#x27;s, but it actually holds together really well, and I never felt that at any point the movie did not give the material the time and depth it deserved.
