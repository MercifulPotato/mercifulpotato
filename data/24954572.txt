He knows to not put all his eggs in one basket. So he invests in small nuclear, because it is a technology we have and can fix deployment issues. He invests in solar because it is a far cheaper option in sunny areas. He invests in carbon capture and sequestration to reverse the effects of climate change to this point and how we&#x27;ll likely continue to pollute. He invests in battery technology so we can use those renewables without a base load (really would be a phase in). And he&#x27;s investing in fusion because it could make all these questions obsolete. He&#x27;s investing from many different angles because you can&#x27;t really predict what will work.<p>There&#x27;s this weird myth of &quot;either or&quot; here. People are treating money, labor, and materials as if they are these static things. This isn&#x27;t a video game where if you need more pylons you just buy them. In reality we only have so many experts in a field at a time. We can&#x27;t just solve fusion faster by throwing more money at it. There are diminishing returns after a point. So you use this money elsewhere. This weird myth of &quot;either or&quot; really comes down to thinking that everyone is stupid and &quot;I&#x27;m an expert&quot; (the &quot;It&#x27;s so simple, you just...&quot;). I find this odd on a site full of tech nerds who have to frequently deal with these types of logistical issues and laymen making wildly naive conjectures.')
