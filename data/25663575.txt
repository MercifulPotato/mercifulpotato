That&#x27;s physically impossible.<p>Who said we need to &quot;replace P2P&quot;?  WebRTC&#x27;s security issues are not predicated on it being a P2P technology.<p>&gt; How do you replace webgl without identifying information on shader support and GPU model?<p>There are <i>already</i> ways to draw things in browsers that don&#x27;t require this information to be leaked.  The simple answer to your question is &quot;abstraction&quot;.<p>&gt; These technologies are nowhere the same as activex, flash or java. All of those technologies were not built to be safe. They were built to give functionality browsers lacked.<p>This statement will, one day be just as true about webRTC and webGL as it is today regarding ActiveX, Java, and Flash.<p>While I don&#x27;t have a time machine, I do have full confidence that new technologies will be created that solve today&#x27;s problems.<p>&gt; Users want their stuff to work, for that to happen you have to have the features necessary for it.<p>Before Javascript and Canvas this is literally why ActiveX, Java, and Flash were used.  But since we have those better alternatives now, we use them instead.')
