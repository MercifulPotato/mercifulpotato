The difference is she has a lucrative job so she can easily afford that. I&#x27;m as baffled as the next guy and personally stay the hell away from microtransactions, but if she&#x27;s happy and doesn&#x27;t feel ripped off who am I to stop her. It&#x27;s no secret that F2P, microtransaction-driven games are mostly funded by whales, and I suspect the vast majority of whales are like my friend here, or at least wasting their parents&#x27; money with approval.<p>IMO the more conservative and likely more effective solution is better parental control, requiring approval for IAP by default (not sure how you implement that on devices not specifically set up as kidsâ€™ devices though).')
