Item(by='RonaldRaygun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603054184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820211, text='Very strange that an unusually terrible politician would have an unusual number of negative articles written about him, isn&#x27;t it? Clearly this is bias in action. Many people don&#x27;t realize that everyone has exactly the same moral standing, and that any indication to the contrary is not to be trusted.<p>Thank goodness we have the catchphrases &quot;Orange Man Bad&quot; and &quot;Trump Derangement Syndrome&quot; to safely allow us to ignore any and all criticism of the president. This certainly helps assuage any cognitive dissonance, which as we all know is a leftist plot.<p>Do make sure to read this extremely informative article from  the eminently neutral Washington Times (here misidentified as the Washington Post, in what was surely an honest mistake) and while doing so keep in mind, that all politicians have a god-given right to exactly 50% positive coverage. This is as true for Trump as it is for Maduro, who as you know we laud precisely as much as we denigrate.<p>Just remember, anyone telling you that Donald Trump is going to reject any non-landslide loss and claim tens of millions of fraudulent votes without a shred of evidence, merely because he&#x27;s told us this with his mouth, is clearly suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, their brain fried by a surfeit of orangeness.')
