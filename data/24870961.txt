That may be a reasonable argument but has nothing to do with the amount the CEO is paid.<p>The reality is that the leader of a not for profit organization competes in the same job market as those for for profit organizations. So if you want someone decent to do a good job then you need to pay them the market price.<p>Now one thing some may point to is that occasionally the not for profit CEO is paid too much even relative to the for profit CEO. But this is misleading because for profit CEOs get paid in many other ways. Stock options, bonuses, promises of future profits, buying them a place to stay, an airplane, etc.<p>Now, there is a different argument that CEOs in the US overall are paid too much. But that’s a wholly different issue that needs to be resolved at a macro level and cannot be resolved at an individual organization level.')
