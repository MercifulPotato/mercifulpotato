The 520 is a bit more modern than the others, it allows PC keyboards (PS&#x2F;2) and higher speeds. The vt220 would already choke on faster streams than 19200 IIRC. It also has more spacious modes than 80x24.<p>I don&#x27;t use it for everything but one of the nice things is that it is easy to concentrate on something. No chance of procrastinating by opening facebook :)<p>And as a debugging &#x2F; recovery tool it&#x27;s sometimes handy, when the whole GUI side is crashed I can still kill some processes. Sometimes I can&#x27;t switch to a text CLI console even.<p>And the retro feel simply appeals to me. I know it&#x27;s not for everyone.<p>I&#x27;ve actually been thinking of making something like a modern terminal. Like a Raspberry pi with an SSH client in baremetal so it boots really quickly, with easily switchable font sizes etc. But it&#x27;s too much work I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get around to it. Maybe I&#x27;ll skip the baremetal part and just go for fbterm on a really cut-down Linux distro, that might work.')
