Item(by='radioactivist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609835914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643286, text='One hundred years ago there were many things that did not have any real explanation -- classical physics was not &quot;stuck&quot; and was not &quot;explaining everything fine&quot;. Our understanding of something as common as metals and insulators depends heavily on quantum mechanics. That&#x27;s not even counting things like spectral lines, the stability of atoms, etc, etc that were unexplained in 19th century physics, and explicitly known at the time to be at odds with classical physics.<p>While worldviews can be overturned and paradigms can be shifted, it is (significantly) harder than it was before. We simply know more now, and have a better understanding of our limits. So whatever new framework that has to supercede our current framework has more ground to cover than it did even in the recent past. This is exacerbated by the fact that in physics in that most everything outside the early universe and black holes (which aren&#x27;t easily accessible experimentally) seems to conform to our current framework -- there is both more to fit in and less data to work with.')
