Electric is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to queue up at a fueling station, this is especially convenient in situations where an outage is anticipated like in advance of inclement weather. Also, in a typical emergency situation if you&#x27;re using your vehicle, it&#x27;ll be taking you out of the disaster area into a place where electricity (and gas) will be available.')
