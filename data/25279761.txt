These vaccines have been formally tested for their ability to protect the recipient, &amp; there is some unquantifiable risk that they&#x27;ll still get harmless-to-themselves mild infections – especially nasal&#x2F;mucosal&#x2F;surface infections – that can still transmit to others.<p>But it&#x27;s reasonable to also expect the following to be shown when there&#x27;s more time:<p>* The milder infection makes such infections <i>less</i> transmissible (in terms of duration-of-infectiousness of quantity-of-sheddding)<p>* such superficial infections in the vaccinated don&#x27;t recur often, or as they recur become ever-milder – because the nasal&#x2F;mucosal surfaces themselves eventually improve <i>their</i> immunity. So, an extra step is required to achieve the simplified idea of &#x27;herd immunity&#x27;, but the vaccines is still one step in that direction.<p>So it is still very much the hope &amp; eventual aim of these vaccines to keep enough people alive, with mild easily-recovered infections, that &#x27;herd immunity&#x27; (and thus much-lower or almost non-existent rates of infection even in the unvaccinated) is reached.')
