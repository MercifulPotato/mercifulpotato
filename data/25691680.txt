The era we call the &quot;Neolithic&quot; does indeed start a bit earlier, and the earliest layers of the site are within the PPNA. Sometimes we use the term neolithic to refer to certain sets of economic and cultural modes, the so-called &quot;Neolithic Package&quot;. The general thinking has been that the earliest layers and probably the site as a whole were not made by one of these groups.<p>There&#x27;s been a long-running argument that all of the elements of a really old, really bad concept called &quot;civilization&quot; require this so-called &quot;neolithic package&quot; to be invented. All the other known examples post-dated the earliest of these societies, and the (dumb) explanation was just that the ideas had <i>diffused</i> from more &quot;sophisticated&quot; societies. Gobekli Tepe was clear evidence against that.')
