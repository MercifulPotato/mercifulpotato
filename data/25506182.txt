It&#x27;s the same performance most of the time, and for tasks longer than 5 minutes, thermal throttling will only reduce performance by ~20% or so - for many that&#x27;s still, plenty, plenty fast, when the baseline is a super fast machine. And in return you save some money, save some weight, get rid of the Touchbar, and gives you the wedge shape that doesn&#x27;t put an edge right up against your wrists when typing on it the way a Pro does. Unless you really need every ounce of performance, there&#x27;s a good chance an Air will just be a more enjoyable machine.')
