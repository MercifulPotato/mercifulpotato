Let&#x27;s have one specific group of people determine what is true, whoever they may be, and set the parameters of what may be talked about. Criticizing that group should be the first to be censored.<p>Look, there&#x27;s lots of problems with Trump, QAnon and other groups. Open, honest, fair discussions are what&#x27;s going to squash them and organically strip membership. Censorship won&#x27;t solve it. Never has in history. Never will. You&#x27;re only enraging those fires more. This isn&#x27;t becoming a slippery slope. It&#x27;s going to be an avalanche. Just because you may agree right now with those who have the power, doesn&#x27;t mean you should give them a blank check of power. The past decade of politician and political party worship isn&#x27;t healthy in general. They&#x27;re all flawed humans, no matter what lip service they may pay. Add in there&#x27;s a &quot;clear enemy&quot; for both sides to use as an excuse to gain more power and strip away freedoms... but hey, I&#x27;m just an asshole that likes reading history books for fun. What in the hell can past authoritarian rises of power teach us?')
