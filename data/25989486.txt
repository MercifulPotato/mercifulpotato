The 30cm version was obtained through downsampling the 10cm image.<p>Other companies could potentially drive towards higher resolution, but spatial resolution isn&#x27;t everything. You give up temporal resolution (revisit rates) and overall area coverage, so we expect some companies to continue to cater to the lower resolution type applications.')
