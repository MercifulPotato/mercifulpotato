In my own systems, I just punt on naming the concept and say “url.”<p>I use read, but I have a friend who frequently corrects me when I say I’ve read something where I’ve actually listened, like an audiobook. I use read because “listen” will confuse people slightly more in conversation that they started about the concept in a book they read. I’m not sure the correct parent is to the concept of reading a book and listening to an audiobook version of the same book. I tried using “process” but that’s pretty confusing to people.<p>I think the author also wants a parent to include watching a video, so consume may be best possible.<p>Maybe “regard?”')
