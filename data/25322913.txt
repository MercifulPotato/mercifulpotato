BitTorrent works today for free, many peers are seeding content just to be seeders. DC++ worked yesterday, where people shared data just to share data.<p>While probably offering money for storing data will get more people onboard to store others data, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the only solution we have at hand to get free sharing of data.')
