But I&#x27;ll play:<p>- He intros by talking about copyright, DRM, terms of use, etc<p>- Then jumps to the fact that Opioid companies try to hook you with addiction, just like Facebook. (So what&#x27;s that got to do with Copyright, DRM, Terms of use?)<p>- Then hints at network effects of &quot;How can you leave Facebook if all your friends are there?&quot; (What&#x27;s that got to do with anything?)<p>- Then he talks about service lock-in which again has nothing to do with Intellectual Property. You are locked in to all sorts of things in your life as a consumer, that is a capitalistic practice the fact that software companies use IP as the way to pull the lock-in lever is kind of secondary to the point isn&#x27;t it? Isn&#x27;t the main point: Why do we accept lock-in at all? (Again he&#x27;s conflated these, not separates them)<p>- He talks about Copyright like it&#x27;s just the US... so what about GDPRs &quot;Right to data portability?&quot;, that&#x27;s the beginning of inter-op. Or Countries copyright exceptions for interop purposes? No mention of those. So not only has he conflated Monopolistic tendencies with IP, he then conflates &quot;Global IP laws&quot; with &quot;US IP law&quot;... which misrepresents the vast majority of the world. As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other comments, in the country I live in: there is no such thing as &quot;Fair Use&quot;, you are allowed to copy things for certain protected reasons, and people can&#x27;t even bring a case against you for those reasons (A subtle but important difference).<p>- Lets take the kindle example where he says (paraphrase) &quot;Amazon have locked you in, and you are breaking the law if you attempt to undo it&quot;... Well what if I live in a country that allows me the right to reverse engineer for the purposes of inter-op? I can (legally) hack that kindle to pieces... Now they might make that really hard, or even impossible... In a similar way that Oil companies have depressed the EV market and made it WAY harder to own an EV to an ICE... But IP isn&#x27;t getting in the way here.')
