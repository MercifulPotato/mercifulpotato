Item(by='remlov', descendants=None, kids=[25506412, 25505861], score=None, time=1608640720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505499, text='FWIW Planar makes 27&quot; monitors that use the same 5K and 2K panels used in the iMacs, down to the bonded glass surface. The Planar IX2790 and PXL2790MW respectively. I have the PXL2790MW and if you look closely you can see the glass peephole for the nonexistent iSight Camera. Not sure if it&#x27;s B grade panels that Apple rejected but it&#x27;s flawless, maybe I just got lucky.')
