Is it unfounded to think depression generally has its roots in being disconnected from other people&#x2F;society?<p>I&#x27;ve felt depressed before, but I&#x27;ve probably never had it as bad as many people. But generally I&#x27;ve felt depressed when my life felt too narrow. When I&#x27;ve felt like there was only one or two things holding me up. When I felt like nobody really understood what I was going through or I couldn&#x27;t open up to others.<p>From what I understand, tripping on psilocybin inhibits your DMN, which apparently is the part of your brain most responsible for your sense of self and makes you feel less like there is a barrier between you and the rest of the universe.<p>If certain medicines help people cope with depression, I definitely don&#x27;t want to detract from the progress those medicines have provided to those people. But does it go against prevailing wisdom to think the only cure to depression is other people? And that, if psilocybin gets people to connect more, it can be part of the cure. But that no drug, in and of itself, can &quot;cure&quot; depression?<p>Just thinking out loud. Please go easy on me. I&#x27;m just curious and want to know more.')
