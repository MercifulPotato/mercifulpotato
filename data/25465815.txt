At the time &lt;center&gt; was introduced, browsers did not support dynamic reflow (except by re-rendering the whole document from the top). For example tables had to be fully loaded before they would be rendered, and the same would be the case for a hypothetical &lt;vcenter&gt; element.<p>&lt;center&gt; on the other hand can be progressively rendered without requiring reflow.<p>My point is just that vertical centering requires a more complex layout model than horizontal centering.')
