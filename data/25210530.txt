Item(by='ascagnel_', descendants=None, kids=[25216432, 25216211], score=None, time=1606319752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209961, text='&gt; The other thing I&#x27;d like to see is the app open immediately, w&#x2F; the check happening asynchronously in the background. (This seems like super-basic good engineering to me.) No idea if they&#x27;re planning to fix that or not.<p>How would this work?  The point of the check is to block malware from running, and opening without the check would, by definition, negate the entire system.  If malware authors get wise to the async scheme, they can write programs that deliver their payload in the opening milliseconds of an appâ€™s execution, while the network call is running (even the fastest pings would leave 1 or 2 ms worth of window).')
