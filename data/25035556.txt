Capitalism is what brought that mode of production about, but it&#x27;s a prerequisite for any economic system that wants to be productive.<p>I think market socialism is a great idea and we should move towards it. I also think that it can occasionally give us all more agency, by increasing the power of employee representation and participation in firms.<p>However, I have little hope that it will truly move the needle on subjective&#x2F;perceived alienation from our work for most people.')
