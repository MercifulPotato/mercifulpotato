Metropolitan areas in the US are expensive as f. But assuming they are the same. Health care and education of your children will kill you financially.<p>A small number of metropolitan areas in the US are expensive, basically all other metro areas offer near similar lifestyle options while being massively cheaper.  I live in the 7th largest metro in the US by population, it&#x27;s exceptionally diverse and cosmopolitan, my cost of living is 1&#x2F;6th what it is in the Bay Area and 1&#x2F;5th what it is New York City.  Not every metro area in the US is NYC and SFO.  I&#x27;ve lived in numerous places abroad, and my cost of living in this city is on par with places a lot cheaper than Europe and the only places I lived or visited in Europe cheap enough to compare was Prague and Lisbon.  Everywhere else in the EU was significantly more expensive to live in.<p>Again, you&#x27;re repeating the healthcare issue, while ignoring the comment you&#x27;re replying to.  It is standard, basic, benefits in the tech industry (and in many other professional industries) in the US to have quite competent employer-paid healthcare.  Tech and Finance are certainly blessed industries compared to others, but even in other industries any middle-class professional will have employer-paid healthcare.  The plight of the average person (the majority of Americans are lower-class, not middle-class, which heavily skews the average) is not the plight of tech workers, who are among the most well compensated and most privileged individual contributors in the US economy.  If you&#x27;re single, it&#x27;s even better.  In my entire career, spanning almost two decades, I&#x27;ve never once had to pay even a single dollar towards my healthcare premiums and I&#x27;ve had high quality non-stop uninterrupted healthcare coverage the entire time.  I&#x27;ve also never worked at a FAANG and grew up in the Midwest.  This is just how the tech industry is, nation-wide.  For people with families, they usually have to cover some of the premium cost either directly or being taxed on it as imputed income (if your partner is not your spouse, legally).  Even then, most employers cover spouses and children at no premium cost to the employee in the tech industry, although that&#x27;s not as universal.<p>Educating your children for K-12 is free at the point of service, paid for by tax dollars (primarily property tax) across the entire US.  Different areas have different qualities of public schooling, but a tech worker salary makes it more than affordable to buy a single-family home in an area with good schools in most cities in the US (but not all).  If you feel the need for private education, that&#x27;s on you, but that&#x27;s a cost you&#x27;d have to bear in Europe as well.  European public schools aren&#x27;t really any better than public schools in the US unless you compare to the worst quartile.  Suburban school districts in the US are pretty well-funded.  College on the other hand, is another story.  But if your kids perform well academically, scholarships are very plentiful in the US, and there are tax-incentivized ways to save to cover the cost of college, and college isn&#x27;t really necessary to enter the middle-class in the US unlike in Europe (however it does certainly help).  Since you&#x27;d be residing in the US while maintaining EU citizenship in this hypothetical scenario, it&#x27;s also likely your kids could go to Europe for college at a significantly reduced cost as well.<p>There are ton of totally valid and reasonable criticisms of life in the US that would not incentivize someone to move here, but for the subset of affluent people we&#x27;re referring to in the context of this thread, healthcare costs is simply not one of those things.  The economics &#x2F;clearly&#x2F; favor the US, many other things do not.')
