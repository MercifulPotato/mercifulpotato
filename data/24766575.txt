Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[24766836], score=None, time=1602603267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24766413, text='there are ways to break a lease without penalty; I&#x27;d guess the qualifying circumstances vary state to state. also, some leases have explicit buyout clauses. I can get out of my current lease free and clear at any time by giving sixty days notice and paying an additional ~$2000 (a bit more than one month&#x27;s rent). so if rents collapsed soon after renewing my lease, I could break even pretty easily by moving out.')
