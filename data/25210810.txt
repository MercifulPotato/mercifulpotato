Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25211081], score=None, time=1606321154, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25210441, text='&gt;How far the disease can spread would depend on sources and sinks, no?<p>By air alone? How far can it possibly spread? Can you get measles if you walked within 100ft of a mass grave? miasma theory would say yes, but I doubt that&#x27;s actually the case.<p>If you include other forms of transmission (eg. insects, animals, food&#x2F;water), then it can definitely spread miles away, but this goes back to my original point of only being correct about disease being (loosely) correlated by distance. But even then it gets a bunch of stuff wrong. A rat with the bubonic plague stowed away on a ship can infect people hundreds of miles away, for instance. You could also live next to a mass grave and be fine as long as you have mesh windows and boiled your drinking water.')
