That FPU had 24 FP registers (as compared to 8 in a regular 287). The best case would be to load a matrix to the registers and then have a bunch of vectors to multiply the stored matrix with. Then this thing could fly. Loading the matrix to the registers was slow though because 287 coprocessors used DMA to communicate with memory.')
