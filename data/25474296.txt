In fact would this type of reform have to happen at the state level, and basically 50+ times?  Unless explicitly stated in the constitution, there will be a cat fight of litigation over federal vs state rights, and the current federal court system is being more and more tilted towards states&#x27; rights.  I&#x27;m wondering if this is some sort posturing by the author.')
