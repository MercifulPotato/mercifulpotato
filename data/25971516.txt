He said that if given the chance, he wouldn&#x27;t have done anything differently.</i><p>It&#x27;s a quote that sounds like he&#x27;s a bitter, self-absorbed, crazy person. Could indeed be true, but given that the Principle of Charity is not a journalistic practice, we did not learn his argument and cannot judge for ourselves.<p>Unfortunately, NPR is considered among the best of US news.')
