So you can focus on that thought. :)<p>Of course, this is possible because the average man will have far fewer relationships than the average woman. So in the end the numbers for this imaginary couple will look like:<p>For the man: He will marry then number 2 mate out of a total of 5.<p>For the woman: She will marry the number 10 mate out of a total of 15.<p>Obviously the numbers are totally made up, but you get the point.<p>So be positive! When you will settle, your mate will probably exceed your expectations.<p>Disclaimer: I am also a man.')
