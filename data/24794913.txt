There isn&#x27;t an explanation about what this really does. I tried registering but it stopped me because the &quot;username&quot; field is actually for an email address. Once in, there are various sections like &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Outreach&quot;, &quot;Testimonies&quot;, &quot;Struggles&quot;, etc, but they just have random Bible quotes, sometimes some input fields, and little else. How can I use this to strengthen my faith? I am missing some context and information.')
