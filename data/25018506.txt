It&#x27;s very odd to refer to drug legalization as &quot;our ideas,&quot; yet still 1) associate them with the Democratic Party, which does not agree with them, and 2) refer to the election of a Democratic POTUS who has said that he doesn&#x27;t support drug legalization as a &quot;victory.&quot;')
