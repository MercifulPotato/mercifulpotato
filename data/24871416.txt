Its English is pure water and its anecdotes pure food. It is more than a window into the 18th century—when you read it you are actually there, and you can come back to it forever because the intellectual and human space it opens is timeless. It is also a deep source of wisdom—not the wisdom of the meditation cushion, but of the public house and the coffee house and the art of conversation. It is embodied and social. You can open it at almost any page and, as long as you&#x27;re willing to give attention to a different way of thinking and speaking, with its seemingly endless sentences, you will be pulled into its flow.<p>I&#x27;ve changed the article title to the book title because it deserves more than 2020-level clickbait and moralizing.')
