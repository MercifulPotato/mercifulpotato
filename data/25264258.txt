It means convincing all of your friends and family to use a new platform. Facebook&#x27;s network effects impose very high switching costs.<p>That&#x27;s one reason your &quot;free choice&quot; defense of Facebook is inadequate. Yes, people &quot;choose&quot; to use Facebook. Yes, they are techncially free to stop using it. But, when the cost is high, is the choice really free?<p>If an individual&#x27;s social and professional life depends on a platform because that&#x27;s what everyone else uses, they cannot in practice switch to another platform even if that is their preference. You might as well argue that someone from a disfunctional family gets a new family. Or that someone living in a disfunctional state emigrates. They <i>can</i> do these things in theory, but in practice they are not completely free to do them.')
