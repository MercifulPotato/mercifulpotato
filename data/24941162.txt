Fining people for petty BS is the financial meat and potatoes of their operation.  Good Old Fashioned Police Work (TM) is just a loss leading sideshow to keep public approval high enough to get money.  It&#x27;s like how Red Bull&#x27;s primary business is selling energy drinks but they also have a bunch of extreme sports ventures for PR purposes.<p>Pretty much every enforcement agency is like that.  You want to see the EPA, OSHA or SEC or whoever levy big company ending fines that scare everyone into compliance then you need to take away the low effort to enforce petty stuff that is the bulk of their revenue stream.')
