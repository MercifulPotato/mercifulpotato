I really don&#x27;t think NVDA will become complacent in the way INTC became. Nevertheless, the last generation of GPUs seemed to close the gap if we ignore DLSS and raytracing. In the former NVDA has a non trivial advantage, and that is their cards have been the backbone of DL research. It&#x27;d be interesting to see how the NVDA+Arm partnership continues.')
