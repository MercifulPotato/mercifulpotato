While conceptually at a high level they are the same thing, the  difference is in who bears the risk when the plan is underfunded. In the first the risk is entirely born by the individual which frequently doesn&#x27;t have any choice in the investment companies much less the investments. The latter the risk is squarely on the shoulders of a larger organization, be that a company or as the last resort the government. Aka the risk is socialized&#x2F;insured.')
