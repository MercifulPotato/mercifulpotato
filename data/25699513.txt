It makes me consider whether the rest of what you&#x27;ve said is actually incorrect since you made such a conflation.<p>Intelligence is a notoriously hard thing to define and measure, and I think it&#x27;s more easily predicted by environmental factors than genetics. The idea that smart people breed and have smart children and that&#x27;s why some people are smart and others are dumb, is more of a cop-out, since predictors of success that tests like IQ try to explain are more accurately explained by socio-economic factors.<p>Basically this has no real world implications. I realise this isn&#x27;t the argument you were trying to make necessarily, you were just pointing out a perceived &#x27;fact&#x27;, but it lacks a lot of nuance that could lead to dangerous assumptions about the real world, especially since you related it to sexuality.')
