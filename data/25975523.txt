A $15k car might need a $100&#x2F;year in oil changes, and then like $500 in  service every $30k miles or so. The most expensive part is probably replacing tires, which is common to the electric car as well.<p>All of the maintenance on ICE cars gets bad in that 120k miles+ range. But at that point you’ve had to replace the battery on your Tesla, which almost buys you another new $15k car.')
