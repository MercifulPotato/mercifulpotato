I want something that separates the data from the display as much as possible, has an easy &#x27;note taking&#x27; and has an easy install. One problem I always encounter is that if the interface to add notes has too much friction, I stop using it pretty quickly.<p>Anyway, so I created something over the weekend called &#x27;notenox&#x27; [0]. It creates a a JSON file of relevant information, one JSON file per note, with keywords and a &quot;special&quot; keyword prefix called a &#x27;title&#x27; that mimics how I&#x27;ve actually been taking notes (email, so the &#x27;title&#x27; mimics an email thread). For display, I consolidate all JSON files into a single JSON file and then have it loaded into the browser with some Javascript to group by title or keyword, along with doing all cross referencing and counting on the client end.<p>Creating notes is done through the command line, because that&#x27;s a common way I interact with my computer, with different options to create titles, links, keywords, etc. I&#x27;m sure there are many different Zettelkasten implementations out there but they always seem so clunky and cumbersome. It&#x27;s not hard, so the simple use case should be simple, nor should it proprietary or locked behind a SaaS.<p>You can see my personal notes in action, if you like [1] (sorry, not mobile friendly!).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;www.mechaelephant.com&#x2F;tree&#x2F;release&#x2F;home&#x2F;meow&#x2F;notenox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;www.mechaelephant.com&#x2F;tree&#x2F;releas...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechaelephant.com&#x2F;notenox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechaelephant.com&#x2F;notenox</a>')
