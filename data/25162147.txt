Item(by='da_big_ghey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605890696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25161672, text='It&#x27;s not really a fuel filter.  Or technically it is, but it&#x27;s really a suppressor kit sold as a fuel filter.  You may also hear them called or sold as &quot;solvent traps&quot;.  This is largely because a suppressor is largely a safety and convenience device, but acquiring one legally is a painful, multi-month process with a $200 tax.  You can make one legally by filing a form 1, but it is generally understood that the wish.com &quot;solvent traps&quot; or &quot;fuel filters&quot; will not necessarily be used legally.<p>And I&#x27;m with you - I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to put a wish.com-sourced fuel filter on a firearm any more than I&#x27;d want to put it on any machinery.')
