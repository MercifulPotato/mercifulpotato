BUT, this only means we cannot know (as in theoretically prevented) all of the variables to arbitrary enough precision to accurately predict the outcome.<p>It doesn’t mean, however, that there aren’t any initial conditions even prior to measurement.<p>Nor does Bell’s inequality doesn’t negate this.  Note Lso that non-local does not imply that causality is broken (you cannot transmit information FTL via decoherence).<p>In fact, one of the more interesting (and unexplored) possibilities is that the boolean-logic law of excluded middle is wrong.<p>This is because Bell’s derivation is pure arithmetic and logic.  It’s the one bit of QM that any student can follow.<p>Lest this is handwaved away, know that there are entire branches of constructivist mathematics that do just this.')
