Different people start with different advantages in life. Some with wealth, some with looks, some with none. In your bid to make an equal society, will you throw acid on attractive people so they become less attractive?<p>Attractive people, men and women have a significantly higher advantage in life, maybe call it an asset. \nLooks are an asset.<p>Wealth tax is a tax on your fucking assets. You gonna tax looks too?<p>If I consume less, I should pay less tax. A tax on wealth is a tax on hardwork and savings. People should be rewarded for spending wisely, not penalized.<p>Once you have a solution for other inherent advantages in life apart from money, and how to account for them, come back.')
