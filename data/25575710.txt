Metrics&#x2F;data driven marketing for the masses leads to a lot of unspartan marketing. I can think of few brutalist marketing&#x2F;branding - Berkshire Hathaway (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;</a>) is one, although their product is abstract - financial services.
