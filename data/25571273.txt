So I build the library, keep it up to date, and just provide all the command lines and code to make it easier.<p>I&#x27;m sure many devs still prefer to clone their own Git libraries, but I remove that step so its simple setup and the rest is just plug-and-play.<p>Basically, you can use the API service to build your own web apps.
