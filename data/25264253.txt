Or maybe we need that next thing to trigger our maturing, as a consequence of competition switching to another domain?<p>Or, is it possible that competition about important matters is not an inherently human trait, and we could actually just all switch to deeply caring about who is best at Trackmania or who follows the best football team or whatever?<p>In some sense a sizeable portion of the human population has already done the latter - perhaps they are actually the enlightened ones?<p>(I&#x27;m assuming that competition is important for humans, since this seems to be a well established fact. The question here is whether the competitiveness needs to be about factors related to your intellect and studies&#x2F;workplace achievements.)')
