With the media platforms and social networks I am also very concerned with every action they take in regards to deleting content and banning users, since they basically operate as a monopoly for public discourse. But infrastructure services such as aws or google are only offering a completely optional service in regards to hosting a webpage&#x2F;forum&#x2F;etc. Everybody can buy a server and give others their ip address. By not offering their services to certain parties they&#x27;re not silencing anyone, they&#x27;re just not helping them. Parler could just as well buy some racks, like the many other companies that already do. So how is amazon deciding what people on the internet see and what they don&#x27;t see?')
