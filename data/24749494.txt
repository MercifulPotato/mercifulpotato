We plan on using TFRC&#x27;s TPUs in order to replicate GPT-2 (with a few changes to support scaling to GPT-3 and beyond as well as the larger context length). With success on a GPT-2 model we hope to garner enough interest to get more compute to train a full-sized GPT-3 model. After that, it&#x27;s 1T or bust.')
