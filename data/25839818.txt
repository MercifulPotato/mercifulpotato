ZERO charges of attempted kidnapping. ZERO charges of insurrection. ZERO charges related to congress-people in any way, shape or form.<p>The initial charges in any event like this are whatever is easiest to get to withstand a probable cause hearing. Serious charges that aren&#x27;t immediately, trivially clear from the circumstances of arrest take more time (especially in the Federal system, where serious charges require indictment or the defense agreeing to proceed by information, which usually only happens with a plea bargain.)<p>Also, the District Court-charged unlawful entry on restricted building or grounds charges (which sound superficially similar to the D.C.
