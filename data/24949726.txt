Item(by='nendroid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604129816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949581, text='&gt;I can’t help but feel like articles like this are an attempt to racialize Asians and make them identify as a marginalized minority group, instead of as individuals who are in the process of achieving upward mobility. Calling the long-standing economic trends a “myth” is borderline deceptive and risky. Clearly something is working. But if you make people think that it isn’t working, you might inadvertently break it.<p>Economically us asians are doing quite well but that&#x27;s not the only aspect of racism that exists. We&#x27;re marginalized in different ways. It&#x27;s hard to put into words what this is exactly. Quantitatively you can see an aspect of this in low asian representation in Hollywood but it&#x27;s much more deeper than that. See here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KsWTFeP1hno&amp;t=3s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KsWTFeP1hno&amp;t=3s</a><p>As you can see from the video it&#x27;s not even about economics. It&#x27;s something else that&#x27;s deeper because the most insidious thing about it is that huge amount of Asian women sort of have this attitude against their own race as well. It&#x27;s a subtle sentiment that no one really talks about so it comes out in different ways.<p>The examples are related to dating but I&#x27;m not talking about dating specifically. There is something going on terms of class divide and perspective that is influencing the dating game as a side effect. We talk about class in terms of money but clearly something else is going on with class here that is seperate from money.<p>It&#x27;s really something that&#x27;s hard to pinpoint and as a result I feel a lot of articles like this are written in place of the actual problem.')
