And while I&#x27;m sympathetic to voultair&#x27;s notion of freedom at any cost, I don&#x27;t believe it holds up well to modern scrutiny.<p>Voultair&#x27;s works predate successful democracies, large scale propaganda campaigns, and the internet. I choose these three examples because I believe these are at the heart of the current crisis.<p>Now I can see from your comment that you have a specific viewpoint of our current political climate. I empathise with your experience, and the feeling that the world is moving in a way that seems counter to your own understanding.<p>But, I worry that you are finding yourself in the position that I&#x27;m most concerned for. You are acting in a small way as a network repeater for exactly the kind of missinformation I&#x27;m worried about spreading.<p>And while I think a widespread doctoral conspiracy is far less likely than the possibility that HCQ is a bad drug to combat Covid-19. I&#x27;m far more concerned about the harm that we&#x27;re doing to our democracy by rejecting the outcomes of what, by nearly all accounts, appears to be a successful election. One that again, for it to be a false narrative would require a huge conspiracy including members of both parties across numerous states.\nAnd it&#x27;s not even so much the faith in the election but the deep resentment afterwards that scares me. How do we repair the divide in the country when truth is being questioned as subjective. What is the shared ground we work from?')
