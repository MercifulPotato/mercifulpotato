Expect the following differences as the class gets dumber:<p>- Less material is covered by the instructor.<p>- There is less of an expectation that any given material will be remembered more than a week after it was covered.<p>- Hints for questions asked of students in class will be more direct.<p>- More time is spent on watching movies with themes notionally related to the class, and on playing games (think &quot;chemistry bingo&quot;) during class.<p>Note that all of these are pretty smooth continuous scales; there&#x27;s lots of room for tuning.')
