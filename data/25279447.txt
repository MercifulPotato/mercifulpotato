And that does not capture the significant amount of people with severe, long standing side effects.  Many people have had months of decreased lung capacity and cardiovascular problems post covid recovery.<p>Beyond all that, these drugs are being rolled out to the most at risk group, those that have a mortality rate higher than any risk rate that was not captured by a smaller sample size of the test.  Unless you&#x27;re elderly or a medical worker, you won&#x27;t have the option to take the vaccine until millions of other do.  I&#x27;m getting pretty sick of you people whining about nonsense.')
