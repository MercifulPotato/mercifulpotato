So then have the court find them in contempt. This requires no involvement from Visa or Mastercard.<p>&gt; And since videos could be downloaded and uploaded by anyone, removed videos quickly showed up on the website again and again.<p>How are they supposed to know it&#x27;s the same video? Compare every video to every other one? The uploader would presumably just reencode the video or make whatever other changes to evade an automated system, and a manual system is infeasible. And no matter what Pornhub does, there are six quintillion porn hosting sites on the internet and it would just end up on a different one.<p>The correct answer is for the police to investigate who is continuing to upload them and impose penalties. Then no more uploads, no more video.')
