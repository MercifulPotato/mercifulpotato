As a service consumer, if I need to call the same 3 other services for EVERY OPERATION, then we&#x27;ve achieved microservice hell.<p>&gt;monolith with 500.0000 lines of code could be very well designed...\nAs someone who was part of a &quot;de-monolith&quot; effort, the first step of our process was to create internal service facades that grouped things according to the logical domains that aligned well with our required functionality, data storage, and availability requirements.<p>Once those were functional, decoupled, and comprehensible, we actually had an easy to maintain, clean monolithic code base that exposed a small handful of services that were de&#x2F;loosely coupled and conformed to workflows we need to support via web services.')
