You are wrong on both counts.<p>What makes you think that poor people don&#x27;t inherit property? There are lots of people with very low incomes but who own a house.\nAnd no they don&#x27;t just sell it. Why sell the only house you have? Or maybe it is not their house but it is a piece of property that they have always owned and which they use as a garden or a yard or storage.<p>They don&#x27;t sell it because they&#x27;d rather have a piece of land to enjoy then some money in the bank. It might be their only luxury in an otherwise frugal life.')
