I would have agreed before dealing with issues around getting consistent versions of python + libraries to run.<p>The issues I see with Python are as follows:<p>- pip doesn&#x27;t actually check to make sure your dependencies are compatible, which causes real problems with numpy et al<p>- conda isn&#x27;t available by default, and running it on remote boxes is non-trivial (I spent a whole week figuring out how to get it running in a remote non-login shell).<p>- This makes it really, really difficult to actually get a standard set of libraries to depend upon, which is really important for production.<p>R, on the other hand, actually resolves dependencies in its package manager, and the R CMD BUILD for packages, while super annoying helps you produce (more) portable code (did you know that conda doesn&#x27;t provide cross-platform yml files unless invoked specifically?).<p>In terms of handing it over to engineering&#x2F;non data science people though, Python is much much much better.<p>tl;dr Python&#x27;s an ace language with a terrible production story.')
