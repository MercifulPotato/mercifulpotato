I will say the industry is not interested in simpler things. they&#x27;re not interested in making the web faster for everyone. your typical <i>insert</i> framework here web app is slow on a laptop and even worse on mobile. now throw in hiring, it means everyone thinks their app should be on react or whatever, when it doesn&#x27;t warrant it to be. look at Basecamp for apps that work without a major framework. \nthings like htmx exist but community is small.<p>so yeah, props to the author for making a proposition for something that would work.<p>but nah, frontend work this days is about making everything complex from getting the project running to the build steps and even deploying the project.<p>though one area, I will say frontend is now better on is testing: cypress, jest and react-testing library are nice things to work with.')
