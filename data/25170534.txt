I&#x27;m used to that kind of bad take.<p>But it&#x27;s actually written in C++. There isn&#x27;t a Makefile, just make.sh. And in there, I don&#x27;t see the C++ standard specified. I&#x27;m guessing g++ defaults to C++98.<p>So that really makes you think. suckless means C++, but not the convenient parts like type inference. Not the safe parts like unique_ptr. A language with inheritance _and_ all of C&#x27;s footguns.<p>What a head-scratcher. Excellent outsider art.')
