The manhole is generally surrounded by a security perimeter.  The &quot;landing station&quot; where the NSA&#x27;s equipment sits is either in the same compound or (less ideally) very nearby.  In the latter case the cable run from the manhole to the landing station has to be protected as well.<p>The digging that they do on the beach is quite disruptive.  It often involves blasting.  Beachfront landowners fight these things tooth and nail, which is why the landings tend to be in either highly industrialized port locations (Portland, OR) or middle-of-nowhere rugged rocky beaches that nobody visits or lives near.')
