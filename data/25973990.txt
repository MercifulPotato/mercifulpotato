I use Stadia in two different households, one with a 50 Mbps connection (where Stadia works perfectly) an one with a connection capped at 10 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up. The 10 Mbps connection only allows for 720p gameplay and I get frequent stuttering every 5 minutes or so but this doesn&#x27;t really ruin the experience with most story driven games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or AC Odyssey.<p>At first I was surprised by the playability of Stadia at such a slow connection myself but even though I cannot play shooter games I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to call the experience I get with the 10 Mbps connection &#x27;unplayable&#x27;.')
