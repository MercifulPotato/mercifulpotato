The article is rife with culture war rhetoric.<p>&gt; I invite people to examine the primary source and come to their own conclusions.<p>Why don&#x27;t you tell us what you found? Or are you saying historian&#x2F;philosopher Laura Synder is lying&#x2F;wrong?<p>Or better yet, since you found &quot;the source&quot;, why not point us to where whewell says, in somerville&#x27;s honor, I coin the term scientist. Just because whewell wrote &quot; An English man of science who called himself a philosopher now did so rather self-consciously&quot; in a review of somerville&#x27;s book doesn&#x27;t mean that he coined it for her. After all, somerville isn&#x27;t an english man of science is she?')
