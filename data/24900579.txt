Almost every major news outlet that would cover international news I found had some story about coronavirus pretty dang early.   It wasn&#x27;t a breathless story predicting the impact, but they covered it.<p>I feel like most media &quot;media does this&quot; or &quot;didn&#x27;t do that&quot; is mostly just what passed in front of someone&#x27;s nose.<p>Purely anecdotal experience of mine was a reddit story ages ago that was &quot;The Media is too busy covering X to cover this story Y.&quot;<p>Purely out of curiosity I turned around and flipped on the TV and checked the news channels.   The first 3 news channels, 2 were covering Y... but the claims about nobody covering it were constant.')
