Don&#x27;t feel sorry for yourself, get help.</i><p>While you are close to being 100% correct with this advice, don&#x27;t you think you are being a bit harsh on the OP as it&#x27;s obvious that&#x27;s exactly what he has done by posting his job seeking issues here on HN?<p>I mean...if this is how you feel, why bother even replying to him? Obviously, it&#x27;s too late for your advice to be of any help to him now in his current situation, right?<p>I&#x27;ll come clean and add that I, too, am in a very similar  boat as the OP...I&#x27;m a 55yo software developer with 35 years in the industry, and due to my lifelong passion with a side-career as a semi-professional musician and other introvert-type issues, I literally have a non-existent network of people who will help me find work.<p>In no way am I feeling &quot;sorry for myself&quot; with my job hunt...I&#x27;m just trying to keep from being homeless and hungry.<p>It&#x27;s probable that the OP is facing the same things.')
