Looking at the TIOBE top 10 programming languages for this month, 6 of 10 languages don&#x27;t even offer a way to address memory with numeric pointers (and that climbs to 8&#x2F;10 if you rule .NET as &quot;pointers are technically available, but not commonly used and are somewhat discouraged&quot;).<p>If I grab JS&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Python&#x2F;PHP, an array&#x2F;list is a magic sequence of values with opaque under-the-hood operations, and my only interface to it is the item index. In that context, promoting idioms because they make mechanical sense in a language I&#x27;m not using doesn&#x27;t seem compelling.')
