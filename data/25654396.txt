With devlog you get:<p>- custom templates for three different common document types(todo, notes and development logs) that you can pre-populate with whatever format you want. Populating it with questions has been useful for some of my users who use it as a way to quickly reflect on what they&#x27;ve been doing.<p>- automatically timestamps the document so you know when the document was written and it makes sorting through notes easier.<p>- tagging: this makes grouping and searching for documents much easier<p>- configuration: from any directory in your OS you can type a single command &quot;devlog&quot; and have a new document generated to a directory you want.<p>It&#x27;s written in golang and incredibly lightweight as well so the &quot;installation burden&quot;is very low.')
