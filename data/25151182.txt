Mac keyboards in general <i>do not</i> lack the delete key; he usual full-size keyboard certainly has a delete key.<p>- Keyboards are a personal thing, and it&#x27;s very easy to plug in any normal USB keyboard, and then get all the benefits of the [delete] key as usual. There&#x27;s nothing else to do, just plug in your favourite keyboard..<p>[Mine came this morning: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;at1mGiT.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;at1mGiT.jpg</a>]')
