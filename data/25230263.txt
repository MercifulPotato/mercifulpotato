My PERM has been approved and I&#x27;m waiting to apply for i140. I&#x27;m getting married in few months (my to-be spouse is outside US and doesn&#x27;t have a visa) and I want both of us to get the green card together.\nIs it OK to start the i140 process without getting married and add my wife&#x27;s name when filing for i485 (after wedding in few months?)?')
