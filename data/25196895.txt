Yes of course I am aware of the status quo and very much following all major events. What I was commenting was the general everyday activity involving law and legal system. I don&#x27;t know how you get confused but I wasn&#x27;t referring to events like the Hong Kong situation, which is clearly not a local level case.<p>I merely want to contribute to a meaningful discussion by personal experience so I wouldn&#x27;t expand to those topics (in my opinion quite sensationalised by social media). I live in Europe now and absolutely understand what the general public are interested in.')
