Since then I’ve seen a couple of others discover and report this independently as well, and I’m sure plenty of others have found it too. It’s always fun when you have a complex system and people stumble upon interesting emergent behaviour. I doubt that the CSS Custom Property spec writers had this sort of application in mind when they specified that it was whitespace-sensitive.')
