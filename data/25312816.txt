Some of them even lament the latest round of decriminalization measures in cities like SF because it leaves no recourse whatsoever for compulsory treatment. (And, yes, some of these people who counselors in SF.) Before full, de facto decriminalization of drug use, SF already had shifted all cases to specialized drug courts which, AFAIU, never sent anyone to prison, but could only force people into treatment, which (AFAIU) they typically only did if advised by addiction counselors to do so.<p>Moreover, because SF and similar cities have so fully decriminalized drug usage, they <i>attract</i> addicts to the city (it&#x27;s not just the weather or social services). Whether or not you think compulsory treatment is ever effective or morally justified, surely one must admit that the last thing any addict or at-risk person needs is such a permissive environment, where they can surround themselves with others suffering from the same affliction and who will give them license to let go, hit rock bottom, and <i>stay</i> <i>there</i> indefinitely. SF has such a concentrated drug problem partly because it&#x27;s like some platonic ideal of an enabling environment for codependent drug use.<p>Addiction isn&#x27;t some simple phenomenon, neither socially nor psychologically, and there certainly are no simple answers. My family has a long history of alcoholism, including both my parents. My grandfather was a regional AA president or some such, though long after he had destroyed his family. I&#x27;ve seen addiction up close and personal. I&#x27;ve been in foster homes and met kids from families destroyed by drug addiction, or who turned to drugs. I&#x27;ve seen how enablement works, how my mother&#x27;s alcoholism, while never going away, ebbed and flowed, yet at least for her was invariably precipitated by her alcoholic &quot;friends&quot; coming over or inviting her to drink with them. In the aftermath we&#x27;d be lucky if she only lost her job; on more than one occasion we ended up on the street, though thankfully we never had to sleep on the street.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve also met several very intelligent and otherwise perfectly functional alcoholics who chose to give themselves over to alcoholism. It&#x27;s what they wanted and they literally said as much. They were perfectly capable of scraping together a lawful subsistence, and did so, though in one case that didn&#x27;t always include regular electricity and running water, which they were fine with. Of course, I&#x27;m not sure what it means for an alcoholic to &quot;choose&quot; to live like that, but from my perspective if &quot;choice&quot; has any meaning it applies to those particular people just as much as it applies to me or anyone else. But the contrast between people like that, and people like my mother (or especially like my next door neighbor&#x27;s daughter, someone who&#x27;s drug addiction is so thorough she has given herself over to the streets and her codependent addicts, and won&#x27;t even entertain offers of help from family or the city) tells me that there&#x27;s plenty of legitimate need for various forms of compulsory methodologies, including treatment. My mom was forced into compulsory treatment exactly once, for 3 months. She lapsed a year or so later but if you ask her I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll tell you that that experience was important and critical (if not absolutely necessary) to reaching the day she had her last drink, even though her darkest days were after that stint in the hospital.<p>There&#x27;s a dangerous narrative in our culture that beating addiction is about &quot;hitting rock bottom&quot; so you can come to the realization about your problem and then seek treatment. I have no doubt that such is the experience of many addicts, but it&#x27;s hardly universal. Other not uncommon experiences are repeatedly cycling through rock bottom for much of, most of, or all of your life; or hitting rock bottom and staying and rock bottom until you die. There are people who manage to sustain a heavy habit but otherwise seem to live a normal, functional, middle-class lifestyle; maybe they&#x27;re perfectly contended or maybe hate themselves and wish someone would discover their secret and force a reconciliation, through legal compulsion or otherwise.<p>There are countless dimensions at play when it comes to addiction and addictive behaviors. There aren&#x27;t many clear answers, but in my experience and opinion categorically excluding options like compulsory treatment is one of the few <i>wrong</i> answers. Certainly it can be done wrong, and perhaps in many contexts (i.e. many U.S. jurisdictions) the capacity to do it effectively and judiciously doesn&#x27;t exist. But that&#x27;s a different kind of argument.')
