There&#x27;s IWW and Solidarity Federation, not sure how active. There&#x27;s also a bunch of Marxist and other varios left-wing philosophically based groups.<p>There used to be a great group called Space Hijackers who bought an APC and drove it through the G20 but that was 11 years ago, they were kinda Situationist.<p>There was UK Uncut. I think a lot of groups end up just being overwhelmed with the amount of awful shit the Tories do and how apathetic&#x2F;ignorant our population is.<p>London Renters Union is a new and amazing left-wing group, not necessarily anarchist, but not ML or Trot either.')
