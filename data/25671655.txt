It&#x27;s always been for spin people, and spin classes are their own thing entirely.<p>Certainly SOME of my riding pals do spin during the week, but most of them are doing structured workouts using TrainerRoad or TrainingPeaks or Zwift and a smart trainer attached to a real bike. (Mostly, it&#x27;s their old bike, because cyclists nearly always have more than one bike.)<p>Indoor training for cyclists has, for the last 15 or so years, generally been focused on power targets. You do some fitness tests to determine your maximum hourly wattage, and then your workouts are expressed as a series of X minutes at Y% of your max power, etc.<p>This is tedious if you&#x27;re using an old-style, fixed-resistance trainer, because you&#x27;re watching the clock during the intervals and then shifting on the bike to achieve higher or lower levels of resistance in order to hit the right power target at a reasonable cadence. Honestly, this SUCKS.<p>Smart trainers take that out of it by dynamically adjusting the resistance for each segment during the workout, so all you really have to do is keep pedaling at the desired cadence (typically 90-95 rpm); sometimes it&#x27;s harder, and sometimes it&#x27;s easier. You don&#x27;t have to manage anything. It&#x27;s awesome. (I watch bad movies on the trainer now.)<p>The Peloton, as I understand, doesn&#x27;t dynamically adjust its resistance. I&#x27;m baffled by this, given how home training is for go-fast cyclists, but maybe that&#x27;s just not a thing spin people want.')
