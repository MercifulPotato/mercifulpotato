I only use SRS for (independent and disconnected) atomic-type knowledge that I need to drill. My rep loads are generally not onerous, so it&#x27;s not a problem  that necessarily affects me too much.<p>(Example: I learn through cognitive dissonance so I use it primarily to deprogram certain associations in my head. For instance, the word &quot;oficina&quot; looks like &quot;office&quot; to my English brain, but the word actually means &quot;mechanic&#x27;s workshop&quot; in Portuguese. Or &quot;pretender&quot;, which looks like pretend in English, actually means &quot;intend&quot;. SRS helps me drill the Portuguese meaning into my skull. I use SRS to memorize bits of knowledge that don&#x27;t fit anywhere and that are hard to create a context for.)<p>I have looked into SuperMemo in the past because I was attracted to the prospect of a general pro-level memorization tool. I use complex pro tools all the time and was not fazed by the learning curve, but I felt the UI was, let&#x27;s say, overfitted to the creator&#x27;s personal preferences.<p>It was a purely emotional decision but I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly, and the best SRS tool is one that one would use over one that one would not.')
