With that in mind, the somewhat arbitrary and limited choice of entities[0][1], hard deadlines[1], and scope of requested data[2] to me personally somewhat make sense.<p>[0] Given it’s a study, it seems overwhelmingly likely that the results will be extrapolated and generalized to the rest of the industry.<p>[1] The more time passes, the less representative the results would be.
