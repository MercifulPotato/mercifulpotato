The main premise of AA is that alcohol is the ultimate gateway drug and cause of relapses. (I don&#x27;t endorse AA&#x27;s literalism and AA&#x27;s attitudes about cannabis border on a crime-against-humanity IMHO. They are so powerful and they have done, and continue to do, SO MUCH DAMAGE by maintaining that old garbage. Founder of AA was a psychonaut anyways. Sigh.)<p>I&#x27;m from an opiate-epidemic-plagued state. My family&#x27;s been affected, every extended family has been affected, every close friend has been affected. (Affected like -- 1+ members of that&#x2F;their family having severe addiction problems.)<p>And you know what&#x27;s the <i>most</i> consistent factor in the relapses? Alcohol. It&#x27;s there every time. This is anecdata of course but ... we are lacking hard data that can displace the anecdotes many of us have. Alcohol abuse is so widespread that we can&#x27;t really control the variable (seemingly).<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;<p>@pmoriarty, I really, really appreciate your comments on this thread. Looking forward to the readings that come from the sources you&#x27;ve linked.')
