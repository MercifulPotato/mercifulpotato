Except the `ctrl+x+[other]` uses the command key.<p>IMO its significantly superior for programming.<p>It&#x27;s also the reason there is less key on the keyboard, it&#x27;s simply more efficient. Plus, you have the benefits of having the same bindings in all the apps. Either it&#x27;s the terminal, your mail client or your IDE. `cmd+s` or `ctrl+x` or `ctrl+q` or name it, always do the same thing. That can&#x27;t be said for any other desktop.<p>I know you can configure Gnome to have emacs keybinds, but it&#x27;s not the same and many apps break the users  configured.')
