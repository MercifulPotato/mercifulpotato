And it (and it&#x27;s next versions) will likely remain best for quite a while.<p>But it&#x27;s not that the rest of the chips out there turned into garbage. They are still very usable.<p>Personally I have gone away from laptops back to desktops.\nHaving desktop and a phone&#x2F;tablet combination for me is better than just laptop or laptop + phone&#x2F;tablet. I still have my laptop, but I very rarely use it now. (mostly if I travel, which I don&#x27;t because of covid :) ) But having latest gratest laptop is not anywhere near the top of my purchasing  priority.<p>And on desktops, latest AMD chips and lots of fast ram, are quite decent.<p>Bottom line even if OS never has anything that matches M1, it will still be fine.')
