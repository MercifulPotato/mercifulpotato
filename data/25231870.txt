True, he doesn&#x27;t use those terms, and he often couches the language he uses about the undesirables in sort of a &quot;they can&#x27;t really help it, they&#x27;re just born that way&quot; phrasing, but the distain is barely hidden.<p>And I find all of this somewhat ironic, given that as high as pg values curiosity, I don&#x27;t really see a lot of self-introspection (at least as communicated in his essays) about why he seems to be much more interested in recent years in writing about how one group of people is intrinsically special and the other basically just exists to be led.<p>I will specifically contrast this with Sam Harris. While they talk about different subjects, I find Sam Harris to be much more interested in thinking about &quot;why do I think the way I do.&quot; More importantly, after listening to a Harris podcast I often find myself thinking about things in a very different way, where lately with pg&#x27;s essays I find myself thinking &quot;not this shit again.&quot;')
