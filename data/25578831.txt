Item(by='pontus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609305463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577490, text='Yes, when I say that AdS&#x2F;CFT is successful, I definitely am not saying that we have a falsifiable prediction for black holes, but I also don&#x27;t mean that these are simply results that famous physicists like and promote, it&#x27;s a bit deeper than that.<p>For many years it was conjectured that gravitation is actually most clearly understood as a two-dimensional theory (people call this the principle of holography). The rationale is that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its area rather than its volume. Since a black hole is in a very specific sense the object of maximum entropy, that means that the amount of information that we can store in space is not proportional to its volume, but rather the area of the encompassing &quot;sphere&quot;. This is super surprising since it suggests that what we perceive as 3d is really just an illusion and that the correct formulation of physics ought to be a 2d theory.<p>Now, for a long time we didn&#x27;t have a way to actually write this sort of duality down. We sort of knew one side of the story (gravity with general relativity), but it fails in precisely the domains where we want to investigate it (black holes). String theory, whether you believe it&#x27;s the true theory of everything or not, is nonetheless a mathematically consistent theory of quantum gravity (in a sense it&#x27;s at least an existence proof that gravity can consistently be quantized). As such, it&#x27;s at the very minimum a great arena to analyze these problems carefully. The first explicit construction of the duality between a 3d theory of quantum gravity and a 2d theory without gravity is precisely AdS&#x2F;CFT. It says that a quantum theory of gravity is AdS space is mathematically and physically equivalent to a 2d theory of a conformal field theory that lives in 2d.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that AdS&#x2F;CFT is being studied because famous people like it. It really does have a lot of value if nothing else than as a playground to understand how one could in principle formulate these dualities consistently.')
