I just want them to be held legally culpable and made accountable when their behavior has negative consequences. The issue of morality is saved for humans.<p>Fortunately, companies can already be held accountable if their negligence exposes personal data in security breaches.<p>Likewise, individual members of the corporation can already be held both morally and legally responsible for their personal actions and negligence. That&#x27;s enough for me, I don&#x27;t need to try to shame legal constructs too.<p>Now, whether companies are <i>actually</i> held accountable in practice is a separate issue. Equifax certainly wasn&#x27;t, not in any way that matters. The same could be said for morally culpable CEOs (or CISOs for that matter). But, that&#x27;s a question of how the law is applied, not whether our moral stance should be changed.')
