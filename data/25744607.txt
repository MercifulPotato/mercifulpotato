It shouldn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s just how the world is. UI has been honest about it, and informed every customer as a precaution. (I assume they&#x27;re still investigating).<p>I can&#x27;t be sure, but since UniFi Video went offline at the same time the breach was announced, a week earlier than it was scheduled to, that might have been the entry point.<p>In any case, the UDM (despite all the negative talk) is a fine machine, and does what it promises to do. If you want similar performance you&#x27;re either looking at building something yourself, or paying twice of what you paid for a firewall appliance. The Netgate SG-3100 has less performance at twice the cost.<p>You need a UI account to set it up, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you have to allow managing it from the cloud. Disable the cloud controller access and any access to your firewall configuration will have to happen from your local network. I&#x27;m unsure if you can disable the UI account, but i have a spare UDM sitting around so i will test it.')
