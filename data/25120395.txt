For the first, I actually went on my social media and “sanitized” it before I started my job hunt.<p>Since then I have been mentally snacking on this: This used to be fun but now it&#x27;s all about policing and extortion, and thus I have been working on something. The idea is:\n    “I want the things I post to be safe from abuse, be ephemeral, be anonymous.&quot;<p>I cannot elaborate in 2000 word limit, but this observation, without letting it turn into a something-chan, leads to a set of rules:<p>• All users must be verified with a strict measures<p>• Users should be able to make any number of usernames<p>• Everything a user puts out must have an expiration date upon which the content will be deleted.<p>• The only data that the engine needs is that which verifies their identity — every other piece of data is at most ephemeral.<p>• Under no circumstances is a user allowed to take a screenshots<p>Rules like these and others, are what I am trying to build this engine around.
