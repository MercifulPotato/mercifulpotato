This has been a common problem in the Mojave Desert in California: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sacbee.com&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;living&#x2F;travel&#x2F;article2573180.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sacbee.com&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;living&#x2F;travel&#x2F;article25...</a> (Edit: James Kim actually used a paper map)<p>I will use Google Maps to plan routes, but I will also use common sense:<p>• I will look at the route on the map to become familiar with it<p>• I will use street view to see what each turn looks like (street view is <i>also</i> useful to see if the road is which needs a 4x4 with high clearance and pure rubber tires which do not use air to successfully drive)<p>• I will memorize the map (making simplifications as needed)<p>• I will then use the route<p>If one just lazily puts in a destination and depends on their phone to do all of the work for them, they can and will encounter problems.  One time, I was with a buddy who does that, and the route given to us was horrible, so I just looked at him and said “Ignore what your phone says. I know how to get there.”  It ended up he accidentally left “do not use freeways” enabled.')
