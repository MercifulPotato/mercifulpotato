If I didn&#x27;t practice I would have stayed at shit companies and continue earning half the salary I got at Google. In the end when I look at the difference in salary progression between me and those who didn&#x27;t join Google I earned around $300k after taxes for practicing algorithm problems for a few months so far. I&#x27;d say anyone who don&#x27;t want to do that is just plain stupid.<p>When people say &quot;work smarter not harder&quot;, practicing algorithm interviews on your free time instead of trying to get a raise at shit companies is exactly the smarter thing to do. By choosing not to do this you make your life way harder.')
