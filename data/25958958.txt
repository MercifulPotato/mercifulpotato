In fact, for something like bluetooth settings I wouldn&#x27;t even pull up the control panel, just click start and type &quot;bluetooth&quot; then enter (when you see it&#x27;s brought up the correct item).<p>I remember in the old versions of windows changing environment variables was something that was a bit of a pain paint because it was hidden behind multiple &quot;advanced&quot; dialogs. Now it&#x27;s real easy, click start type &quot;envi&quot; and hit enter. That actually brings up &quot;System properties&quot; advanced tab and you have to click &quot;environment variables.&quot;')
