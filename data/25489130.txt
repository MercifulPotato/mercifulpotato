It&#x27;s where we should and must move towards anyway, the time of nations squabbling is over if we want to tackle the crises of the future: climate, water access, food access, poverty, droughts, space exploration, and if they&#x27;re turning out to be real, dealing with non-terran species.<p>The only open question I have - who decides upon engaging? The UN Security Council which should deal with issues is effectively gridlocked as the Russians and Chinese veto everything.<p>The UN General Assembly isn&#x27;t that much trustworthy either, given how many countries would vote an instant Yes on the question if Israel should be sanctioned.<p>In the end we need some form of &quot;global democracy&quot; with strong protections of individual rights.')
