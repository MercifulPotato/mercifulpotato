Those early short positions[1] are closed out, losses have been taken, GME is going to burble along for a bit as the people who scammed you exit their own positions and then it&#x27;s going to crash back down to $80 or less.  It is no longer a short squeeze, this is a speculative bubble sustained by people like you who were lied to about it being a short squeeze.<p>[1] Obviously people are taking out <i>new</i> shorts like crazy on this stock given the bubble.')
