It really grinds my gears if people are spreading misinformation about &#x27;being on the same network as a spammer&#x27;, &#x27;indiscriminate blacklists&#x27; and corporate overlords for being the reason on why their email is not being delivered.<p>Spam filters have been content driven for a long time now. IP addresses and domain names are ephemeral and so are &#x27;blacklists&#x27;. With the amount of spam being send, we would have blacklisted the entire internet by now.<p>If a spam filter gives false positives, it hurts the receiver just as much as the sender.<p>The real problem with self-hosting is that the majority of self-hosted e-mail servers are terribly configured. Getting the SMTP server running is one thing, but getting DKIM, DMARC, SPF, TLS and MTA-STS running properly is often overlooked. What was the last time you checked the validity of the TLS certificate of your SMTP server?<p>Get your server and domain setup properly. Sign your email with DKIM, setup an SPF and DMARC policy and perform DMARC monitoring to spot problems. Setup TLS and an MTA-STS policy service for your incoming email. Throw in SMTP-TLS-reporting for good measure. E-mail servers are not set-and-forget if you want to do it right. And this is not the fault of large corps, it&#x27;s the spammers who got us in this situation.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to blame large services or blaming your email deliverability problems on being on the same IP block as a spammer, but really it&#x27;s almost always a misconfiguration on your side.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the founder of Mailhardener (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mailhardener.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mailhardener.com</a>), we do e-mail hardening and solve deliverability issues.')
