Better yet find one of relatively rural parts of the US. You&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find an obese person, yet if you took the same picture today in many of those places you&#x27;d see a majority of obese people, many grotesquely so.<p>So what, did people magically lose all willpower and discipline in the past 60 years? Of course not, but we have instead build up a society, both around industrialized food and sedentary lifestyles, that is basically geared to make people fat.<p>Similarly, while &quot;discipline and willpower&quot; may work for any one individual, it is completely useless as societal-wide advice, mainly because it&#x27;s been proven over decades that this advice (again, societal-wide) doesn&#x27;t work: we&#x27;ve been saying this same thing for years and yet Americans are as fat as ever. What&#x27;s that definition of insanity again?')
