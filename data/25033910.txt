Here in Norway it is pretty easy to pick wild blue berries or easy raspberries when out walking. The ones I get in the store don’t actually taste that different. But it probably differs from where you live. I thought in particular when living in the US that stuff tended to be really large great looking but quite tasteless.<p>However I have noticed from when visiting small towns in Italy that tomatoes taste way better there than in Norway. Ours don’t have the explosion of taste I felt in Italy. I had no idea a chibatti with just tomato and mozzarella could taste that amazing.')
