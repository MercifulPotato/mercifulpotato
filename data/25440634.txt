Your mail gateway should have some heartbeat checks to subsystems it depend on (AuthZ, AuthN, Storage, etc.) and it should switch to fail-safe mode if something happens. Auth is unreliable? Switch to soft-fail on everyone regardless of e-mail validity. Can hard fail others later, when Auth is sane.<p>Storage is unreliable? Queue until buffer fills, then switch to error 421 (The service is unavailable due to a connection problem: it may refer to an exceeded limit of simultaneous connections, or a more general temporary problem) or return a similar error.<p>SMTP allows a lot of transient error communication. Postfix, etc. has a lot of hooks to handle this stuff. Just do it. Being Google doesn&#x27;t allow you to manage your services irresponsibly. If we can think it, they should be able to do it too.')
