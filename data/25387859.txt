We already know Apple&#x27;s noise cancellation and transparency mode are pretty damned good from the AirPods Pro.<p>If these were about $200 less, I&#x27;d probably have pulled the trigger on these already. At $550, it&#x27;s a pretty tough pill to swallow when fundamentally there are some damned good ANC headphones for quite a bit less.<p>For the moment anyhow, I don&#x27;t watch TV on my iPad or phone enough for spatial audio to matter. So the only big features which make it stand above much more affordable competitors is: transparency mode, easy source switching, and overall niceness. Worth $200?? I kind of think no. Maybe I&#x27;ll revisit this when more reviews are in and the wait time is less than 3 months to order them.<p>Edit: Gruber also mentioned this, but worth noting. They would be a lot more appealing if the Apple TV supported spatial audio.')
