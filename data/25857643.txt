Rent control is great at that moment. But this means there&#x27;s and enormous part of the demand that&#x27;s unmet. If supply would increase there would be no need for rent control.<p>(That said ther are many possible problems that need&#x2F;would-benefit-from regulatory intervention. Eg. high vacancy rate because speculation and long-term investors. The residents of a city probably don&#x27;t want to live in a playground for perpetual construction due to &quot;irrational demand&quot; and arbitrageurs supplying it. For example when folks in oppressive regimes try to put their money in foreign real estate, they don&#x27;t real care about doing that efficiently, hence the high vacancy, nor do they care about ROI or anything, just to have better odds than putting it locally, ie. in China&#x2F;SaudiArabia&#x2F;etc.)')
