Adding the reactive core components on top saving you a lot of time and effort creating reactive UIs in pure Ruby. Compared to Stimulus Reflex, you have to write less code and manage less added complexity. That&#x27;s at least my experience. But as said: Cells and Stimulus Reflex are great projects, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I just love the pure Ruby thing ;)')
