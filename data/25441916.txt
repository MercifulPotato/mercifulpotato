A lot of it is caused by fake benevolence. A good example NGOs that take money to protect the amazon, the process goes like this : raise money &#x2F; buy land &#x2F; cut 70% of the land &#x2F; replant &#x2F; advertise the replanting &#x2F; repeat ...<p>It is completely legal and the environmentalists are in favour of that. At some point they might own the whole thing. Problem is that this is the cause of the fires, these new replanted forests are nowhere as dense and humid as the new quick raising ones.<p>Current Government did two things, relaxed on releasing the amazon satellite data and curbed down the 70% allowance to 30%.  That might make it less profitable for the NGOs and maybe the reason they only recently double down on the rhetoric.')
