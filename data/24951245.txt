I think believing that<p>a) “identity politics” is a major movement on the left, rather than a pejorative right-wing term for civil rights activism, and<p>b) somehow deciding you’re “against” this<p>is in fact right-wing. It is sort of like people who are against “critical race theory” - with a tiny handful of exceptions (mostly left-liberal quibbles), they are not making an academic argument about the actual subject of critical race theory so much as signaling their opposition that they’re opposed to anti-racist ideology. Criticizing the term “critical race theory” without having read  a bunch of sociology is basically telling on yourself.')
