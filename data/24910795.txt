Hacker news is full of experts who know everything, but our teams are not all posting here.  If you adopt a good low code framework that you understand inside and out, then you can achieve a lot of output with an inexperienced team.<p>I use a LOT of co-ops to develop full applications using Oracle&#x27;s low code solution, because we don&#x27;t need anything more complex than that.  Complex shit should be done by our ERP, I&#x27;m just turning a manager&#x27;s spreadsheet and half baked business process into a well built system.  Plus, I use the low code solution as a training ground for our more complex technologies, its great for weeding out the duds.<p>You should still have a programmer do the work though.  I have seen far to many smart business analysts fail because they get hung up on the programming basics.')
