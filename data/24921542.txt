Sway has good dynamic output configuration. `wl-clipboard` and `wl-paste` are there for CLI clipboard access. There&#x27;s a rofi fork that works on Wayland, and can also emulate `dmenu`. `clipman` is Wayland compatible. I use `grimshot` with `rofi` integration for screenshots. I have a HTML Color Picker script for sway that&#x27;s launched from `rofi` that I should share. `ydotool` and `wtype` emulate the parts of `xdotool` that I care about.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no longer tearing when I resize windows!')
