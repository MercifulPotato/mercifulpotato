I could probably say romanization is a casual, reasonable effort method to convey a word so that the both sides can agree on the word in the source language with reasonable accuracy.<p>Uncommon&#x2F;novel&#x2F;excessive romanizations like &quot;katsukaree&quot; or &quot;hakkar nywusu&quot; can be technically correct or more precise, but if they can&#x27;t be traced to the word or concept at less effort for an average audience than &quot;cutlet curry&quot; or &quot;hacker news&quot;, they actually serve the purpose less.<p>For real world uses, Google Search[1] in Japanese for &quot;cutlet curry&quot; gives me an info panel for cutlet, a dictionary page as top result, as well as multiple Japanese videos about cutlet curry(why would anyone take and upload that kinds of videos is a mystery to me). In contrast, for &quot;katsukaree&quot;, it gives me &quot;maybe you meant...&quot; mini panel, and the top three results are an Instagram tag page, English Wikimedia Commons link, and Tripadvisor page for a restaurant in Columbia. I checked the tag results page but none of top or newest posts seemed to be someone from the country. I think it&#x27;s safe to say &quot;katsukaree&quot; is quite an unpopular expression to native Japanese speakers.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;jdPZN7m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;jdPZN7m</a>')
