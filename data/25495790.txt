Especially with the proliferation of online options.  If I sent my kid to Oregon State to get an online CS degree, they&#x27;d pay the same tuition as if they were on-campus.  If they went to somewhere like ASU for the online CS masters, it is similarly overpriced.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m just about to finish my Georgia Tech masters in CS for under 10K for the entire program.  If other institutions follow their lead, it&#x27;ll put a lot of downward price pressure on the rest.<p>Especially for online classes that can scale pretty inexpensively, the current tuition rate is absurd.')
