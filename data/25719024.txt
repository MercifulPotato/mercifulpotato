I own a handful of Samsung T5 and T7 SSD drives (the new T7 being twice as fast, but also more expensive) and they are great. 1-2TB is sufficient as the internal HD <i>for me</i> (aka make no representation of other’s needs) and everything else goes on my NAS or when remote a SSD HD like the T5&#x2F;T7. When I need extreme performance (aka video editing usually), I’ve got a Samsung X5 which uses TB3 and NVMe to get nearly 3GB&#x2F;s speeds. If they weren’t so expensive, I’d use only the X5s, but instead have a mix of T5&#x2F;T7&#x2F;X5 for various purposes.')
