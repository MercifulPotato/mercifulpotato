If there were in the M1 chip, I don&#x27;t know why Apple wouldn&#x27;t expose them. NVidia does, on every platform except macOS because Apple doesn&#x27;t want them to.<p>As for benchmarks, the best you&#x27;re going to get is a Vulkan benchmark running on the Nvidia card via the native driver and on M1 via MoltenVK.')
