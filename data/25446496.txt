What is the optimal size of the population for a given country&#x2F;territory&#x2F;planet?<p>That is, the size of the population at which the welfare&#x2F;wealth of the median individual is maximized.<p>Given that, as you say, prime land, prime housing, prime infrastructure, prime tourist destinations don&#x27;t easily scale, yet more people enable better technologies&#x2F;more efficient production of other consumer goods and services.<p>Have too few people (in the extreme - a dozen), and you cannot have many nice things - not enough people to create nice art, build houses and cars and computers. Have too many (in the extreme - 100 billion), and there is too much competition for the same houses and tourist spots and what not.')
