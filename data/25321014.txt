Add to that the politicization of this issue, and people have become  very set in their stance of being pro lockdown versus against lockdown. This has led to them expecting authoritarian mandates from politicians to help them not feel so panicked.<p>The politicians themselves feel they have to issue the mandates this cohort expects even though they don’t believe in those mandates themselves. This is why so many politicians have been caught violating their own rules (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;rules-for-thee-but-not-for-me-a-rundown-of-lockdown-leftists-ignoring-their-own-rules&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;rules-for-thee-but-not-...</a>) - it’s not that they think they’re above the rules (although it plays a part) as much as the fact that they don’t believe in them.<p>The reality is that life comes with risks. We will never face zero risks. We still need to go about with our lives and retain the freedom to make our own choices and evaluations of which risks we are willing to accept. Arbitrary actions like banning outdoor dining are a step too far.')
