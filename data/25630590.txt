We basically have no clue if it&#x27;s better off or not.<p>Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#x27;t have a marketplace of options as there is a single or just a few employers (e.g. Hollywood, teachers, coal mining towns, hospital staff, etc.). Unionizing at Google makes no sense, as there are thousands of tech companies hiring engineers in the valley -- engineers can &quot;collectively bargain&quot; with Google by simply leaving and working somewhere &quot;better&quot;.<p>The reality is that Google is an easy place to work relative to how much people get paid. People don&#x27;t want to leave a cushy job for one where they would have to work harder for their money, so instead, they are trying other means to have their cake and eat it too.')
