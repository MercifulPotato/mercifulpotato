The first I was aware of any snow was when walking out of the conference and seeing a BMW covered with an inch of it (from elsewhere? there was nothing on other cars).<p>Like the other poster said, Dan was an influence in people&#x27;s careers&#x2F;lives and definitely on mine, even if I met him only a few times per year. I changed jobs and no longer have the original emails, but somehow he put me in touch with folks at CoreOS about a blog post, which led to a lot of networking that I probably would have never made otherwise, including a relay race in LA(!)...<p>This week has already started badly. :-(')
