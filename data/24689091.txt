I made a really quick web app to help people validate their ideas.<p>The app is a simple landing page builder, but every page includes a really simple Yes&#x2F;No &quot;Are You Interested?&quot; poll.<p>Every vote is recorded and tracked, and if they click yes they are brought to a page where they can submit an email.<p>This makes validating ideas super easy because you can post your link to different communities and get statistically significant results as well as build an email list.<p>Given an hour, you could easily create 50 different landing pages and be able to validate your ideas in bulk.<p>The site (click Sign Up in top right - no cc needed): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;areyouinterested.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;areyouinterested.co</a><p>Example landing page (Built in &lt;60s): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;areyouinterested.co&#x2F;site&#x2F;pals-insurance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;areyouinterested.co&#x2F;site&#x2F;pals-insurance</a>')
