I also meant the &quot;dark cave&quot; as more a metaphor to bats&#x2F;coronavirus and I should not have tried to make cheap jokes if I&#x27;m trying to make a serious point. I realized after reading your comment how a lot of what I wrote could be interpreted another way. I&#x27;m going through the article now and changing the tone.<p>I&#x27;m actually new to writing anything online, I&#x27;ve just lurked the Internet for years and read so much good writing on HN. I&#x27;m going to take a step back, re-evaluate and get more eyes on what I&#x27;m writing before I carelessly post something again. I love this community more than any other, and I want to meet the standard.<p>Plus if I am stoking partisan fire as you are suggesting, I am accomplishing the opposite of what I hope to actually do as a pseudonymous writer. I really do appreciate you taking the time to read and provide this honest feedback.<p>Edit: I finished revising based on your suggestions and will look at it with a fresh eye tomorrow. Thanks again for explaining your perspective to me so succinctly.')
