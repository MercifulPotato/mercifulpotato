In about 1h I realized that no, it&#x27;s not me. Ansible is really just a huge masturbation. You&#x27;d think that a tool that purportedly helps with managing servers would at least give you meaningful error messages but it still spews JSONs, that don&#x27;t even start and end on its own lines, where actual error message is single line with \\n for line breaks.<p>I have also tried cdist[1]. Compared to glorified shell command generator like Ansible, cdist is actually closer to Puppet in that you actually declare resources and dependencies, where by &quot;declare&quot; I don&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s a guard in imperative steps like in Ansible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdi.st&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdi.st&#x2F;</a>')
