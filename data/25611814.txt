If the state invests in a startup&#x2F;spinoff, the state should get equity in return rather than just some lofty words about future jobs or such.<p>Not for the purpose of creating long time state owned companies, but for cashing out when&#x2F;if the investment is successful, just like VC&#x27;s. This would both provide the state with money, removing the need to raise that same money via taxes, and hopefully also better align the incentives of the funding organisation by providing measurable goals.')
