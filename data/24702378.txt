[1]<p>&gt; Michael [Jackson] left to go across the hall to do some children&#x27;s speaking record. I think it was &quot;E.T.&quot; or something. So I asked Quincy [Jones], &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Whatever you want to do.&quot; And I go, &quot;Be careful when you say that. If you know anything about me, be careful when you say, &quot;Do anything you want!&quot;<p>&gt; I listened to the song, and I immediately go, &quot;Can I change some parts?&quot; I turned to the engineer and I go, &quot;OK, from the breakdown, chop in this part, go to this piece, pre-chorus, to the chorus, out.&quot; Took him maybe 10 minutes to put it together. And I proceeded to improvise two solos over it.\nI was just finishing the second solo when Michael walked in.<p>&gt; And you know artists are kind of crazy people. We&#x27;re all a little bit strange. I didn&#x27;t know how he would react to what I was doing. So I warned him before he listened. I said, &quot;Look, I changed the middle section of your song.&quot;<p>&gt; Now in my mind, he&#x27;s either going to have his bodyguards kick me out for butchering his song, or he&#x27;s going to like it. And so he gave it a listen, and he turned to me and went, &quot;Wow, thank you so much for having the passion to not just come in and blaze a solo, but to actually care about the song, and make it better.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t think of a more innovative and imaginative musician in history.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;showbiz&#x2F;music&#x2F;van-halen-jackson-thriller&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;showbiz&#x2F;music&#x2F;van-halen-jacks...</a>')
