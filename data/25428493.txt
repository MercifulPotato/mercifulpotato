It feels shoehorned into the project because Google wanted to find a use for it. It simultaneously alienates mobile developers and cross platform developers by picking a language neither have experience in and neither can use outside of this one framework. There are people taking about Flutter being to Dart what Rails was to Ruby so maybe time will tell. Flutter itself seems decent though, despite a few oddities.')
