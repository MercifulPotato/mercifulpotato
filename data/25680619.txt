However, in practice, even functional programmers still tend to couple data and behavior.<p>For instance, not much would change about programming in Haskell if List was defined as an abstract type, so users couldn&#x27;t see its constructor or interact with it in any way except through its functions.<p>In OOP languages, this is unambiguous because the function&#x2F;interface implementation is explicitly defined as part of the type. In FP languages, this is a little less clear because the implementation can be defined anywhere (although, should really be either near the data declaration, or the typeclass declaration).')
