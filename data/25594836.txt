Because that&#x27;s <i>true</i>, but HTTPS <i>is</i> effective against network attacks. Deploying HTTPS also won&#x27;t prevent someone from mugging you IRL, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not an effective security measure for what it does.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about SSL Stripping, then 1. we&#x27;re back to you needing to control the network, so apparently my goalposts are exactly in the right place, 2. that is at best partially effective (AFAIK, requires the victim to start from a non-HTTPS page, so again, <i>we really want 100% of sites on HTTPS</i>), and 3. that works specifically by getting the victim back onto insecure HTTP, so if you need that then it&#x27;s proof of the effectiveness of HTTPS.')
