I&#x27;m really happy with it, although it does add a constant background &#x27;hum&#x27;.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been possible however if we weren&#x27;t doing major renovation -- we tore out &amp; replaced the downstairs ceiling and completely redid the second floor bathroom; that meant we could run the ducts down the corner of the bathroom and then through the joists in the first floor fairly easily.  And the attic is a bit cluttered with the ducts.<p>You definitely notice a difference when you turn it off.')
