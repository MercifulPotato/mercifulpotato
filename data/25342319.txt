It is correct if you assume the hard lockdown doesn&#x27;t have any downside.<p>The lockdown is not necessary in the first place.<p>In most places, hospital are not overloaded. Even in the event of overload, the correct measure should be to increase capacity, do not admit people with mild symptoms, etc.<p>Case number are misleading, vast majority of the case are not actually sick or only have mild symptoms.<p>Better test needed to be identify people who actually sick and need  intervention.<p>If anything the lockdown could cause hospital overloaded due to delayed treatment and nurses being furloughed.')
