The methods aren&#x27;t added globally, which is why you need the first method to switch the context. It&#x27;s generally a good policy to avoid adding those class methods at the top level, which Sorbet does assiduously.<p>Sig also turns into a no-op if you have runtime verification turned off, which is another good reason not to call params right away, because (in ruby) you can ignore everything in the block if the block is not called, sort of like a debug macro in C, but you can&#x27;t do that with a method that is called - it must evaluate its parameters.')
