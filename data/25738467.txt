It&#x27;s fairly hard to get mod points and they expire quickly, so brigading is almost impossible.  Posts have a very low mod cap (5) as well so it stays fairly flat.  There is also a meta-moderation system although it&#x27;s never been clear to me how effective it is.<p>Probably the biggest thing keeping it in check is that they still a fully editor driven website.  No article shows up that hasn&#x27;t been seen by someone at Slashdot HQ, so it&#x27;s nearly impossible for trolls to flood the zone with hate speech, and even if they try it&#x27;s easy to filter out by just changing your post threshold.  Also, the community is so small these days that nobody would even bother.')
