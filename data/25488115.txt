Item(by='folkhack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608486905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486097, text='&gt; I often wondered if it&#x27;s just because these folks want free lunch and some socialization.<p>In over 50% of the careers I have had in the US I can honestly say that it was more about the ceremony of &quot;work&quot; that it was ever about the work. So much of this is the middle-management dilemma where as a producer&#x2F;IC I find myself more worried about the outward appearance of my work vs. the actual substance of it.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t spend my workdays socializing<p>I&#x27;d advise against this in most places. I&#x27;ve done the whole &quot;work not socialize&quot; thing and it comes up in 1:1&#x27;s as anti-social behavior. I&#x27;m not saying I disagree with you _at all_ but I&#x27;ve learned to go through the motions and begrudgingly participate in &quot;dev beers&quot; at 2:30pm on a Friday, or Go-karting, or the lavish meals... I&#x27;ve had to go to dance clubs for my job, I&#x27;ve been pressured to go to strip clubs (never went), I&#x27;ve been pushed to perform for talent shows... It infuriates me. It makes me mad enough to punch a wall. <i>I am here to work. My culture is work. Let me work. I am a god-damned engineer - let me perform the work I am paid to do, then let me go home afterward...</i><p>Socializing is largely the new American work culture. It&#x27;s pathetic, and it&#x27;s a bubble that will pop. We didn&#x27;t get to the god-damned moon knocking off at 2:30pm on a Friday for &quot;dev beers&quot;... =|<p>---<p>Also, as a drop-out I totally feel you. Self-learning was the only way to getting a successful career after a very toxic &quot;education&quot; experience I went through in the middle-of-nowhere Iowa. I legitimately do not know if I would be OK if it wasn&#x27;t for the internet. It allowed me to self-learn whenever I could, and allowed me a platform&#x2F;audience to hone skills.')
