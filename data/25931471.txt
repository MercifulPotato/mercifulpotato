The images that we saw before were generally censored of gore--we saw night-vision imagery of bombs raining down on Baghdad, but we didn&#x27;t see the actual death. Similarly, we saw the towers fall, but most of the actual death was censored (the worst I can recall were people falling from the towers from such a great distance that they appeared to be specs).')
