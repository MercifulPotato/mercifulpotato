It&#x27;s basically Robinhood for collecting&#x2F;analyzing&#x2F;visualizing data from internet(Twitter, reddit, yelp etc) in realtime as well as doing the same with proprietary data. Quantale provides a modular platform that comes with integrated ability to collect data from commonly used platforms, analyze data using frequently used ML algos and visualize it on aesthetically pleasing dashboards.<p>Quantale provides end to end data analytics as a service. You can checkout some sample dashboard here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.quantale.io&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;50778f4a-02bb-4d31-b6e7-13acefd63ce9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.quantale.io&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;50778f4a-02bb-4d31-b6e...</a><p>Quantale was invited to interview for Y Combinator Winter 2021 Batch but Michael Seibel wanted to see some more progress before backing Quantale.<p>I am looking for a co-founder who is interested in making data analytics accessible to everyone. Contact me(email on profile) for the same or for any suggestions on my project or just to say Hi.')
