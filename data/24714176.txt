Sure, I do have a hobby project that will, hopefully, make the world better at some point. But that&#x27;s a hobby project. It doesn&#x27;t help with this crippling loneliness the slightest. And then starting your own company is a lot of responsibility. Much more than I&#x27;m willing to ever take. Not only do you have to have an idea good enough and that there&#x27;s market for, you also have to devise a way to make money, preferably without ruining your product both in the long and short term. And delegation. I don&#x27;t like delegation, but running your own startup demands a lot of it. I&#x27;m such a kind of person that it&#x27;s almost always easier for me to do something myself when I know exactly how it&#x27;s done rather than to explain someone else what I want.<p>The software industry is trending towards dumbing everything down and making increasingly user-hostile design decisions. This is the exact opposite of my values. Then there&#x27;s the purely technical side of things. It&#x27;s becoming scarily common for software developers to not understand the abstractions they&#x27;re using and the compromises they&#x27;re making while choosing those abstractions. This leads to poor-quality, underperforming products. It&#x27;s become so ingrained into the culture that people legit look at you weird when you tell them that they don&#x27;t need react and 50 JS libraries to build a website and that using the Android APIs in an app directly is a perfectly okay thing to do.<p>So, there are diminishing opportunities for creating a startup, and most existing companies&#x27; values go against mine. I feel lost at this point. I truly have no clue where to go next and what to look for. Nonprofits maybe?')
