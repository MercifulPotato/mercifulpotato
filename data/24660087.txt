I&#x27;m sure companies like apple wouldn&#x27;t give a fuck either way and would just go with whatever looked aesthetically pleasing, USB-IF cert be damned.<p>That is made possible by USB-C standard. USB-A and USB-B cables were too dumb to support that.<p>&gt;you seem to already consider it reasonable to look at pins<p>The pinouts are the same for all different types of cables. It is literally impossible to differentiate cables based on visual inspection. The USB-C standard is a unified charger and a bunch of different cables in with the same connector.')
