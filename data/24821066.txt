You&#x27;d ordinarily bring in a couple major deps --- OpenSSL, zlib, pcre, &amp;c --- and then maybe vendor in the small stuff. Most large C projects don&#x27;t dep in things like logging or error handling the way Rust programs all do.<p>This particular program needs no third party dependencies at all; in fact, I bet it&#x27;d get longer if I added them (like a glib hash table, or pcre).')
