Challenges follow the &quot;Build your own X&quot; format, where you learn about a popular open source tool by building a small version yourself (popularized by this Github repo [2]).<p>The primary difference compared to other coding challenge websites like Codecademy, HackerRank, Exercism etc. is that we offer real-world programming challenges - no inverting binary trees here!<p>I&#x27;ve posted about this multiple times here before, but haven&#x27;t managed to gather much interest. Trying out a text post this time instead of just submitting a link.<p>Any feedback is welcome! I&#x27;d love for more people to try this out, it&#x27;s a _very_ effective form of learning.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecrafters.io&#x2F;challenges<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danistefanovic&#x2F;build-your-own-x')
