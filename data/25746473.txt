Everyday people may not care about how &quot;cool&quot; the Netflix engineering is, but they certainly care about the end product.<p>For example, over the holidays I watched 3 different streaming platforms:<p>BBC iPlayer - occasionally cut out and dropped back to main menu requiring me to find the program again.<p>Amazon Prime - often had buffering problems requiring me to manually lower resolution (on a 150Mb&#x2F;s connection...)<p>Netflix - No problems, hit start on a movie and watch it to the end.<p>This kind of thing does get remembered; I certainly ended up watching a heck of a lot more Netflix than any other platform.')
