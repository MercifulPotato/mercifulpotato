Or even borderline extortion: &quot;Nice user growth you have there, Signal. Would be a shame if your employees walked out on you.&quot;<p>The entire value proposition of Signal is that no one in the middle can see what&#x27;s going across. The vast majority of those things will be benign or even good. A few will be bad or abusive. People use Twitter, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Apple Messages and whatever Google is calling their chat client today for good, bad and ugly things, too.<p>I&#x27;d have much more respect for Casey Newton (I hope you&#x27;re reading this) if he disrobed from his pretense and lectured us about Signal being a tool for Orange Man 2.0, rather than this vague whisper campaign about &quot;abuse.&quot; And, personally, unless Newton entirely made up his quotes or took them totally out of context, Gregg Bernstein (hope he reads this, too) would have very little shot of making it past a phone screen with me. A former employee trying to stir up my workforce by attacking the core values of my company in the press is not something I look kindly on.')
