Item(by='CydeWeys', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607176471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311797, text='&gt; 5 cars worth of carbon emissions is not a lot given that it is a fixed cost. Very few are retraining BERT from scratch.<p>It&#x27;s not a fixed cost though, it&#x27;s just how much was spent on this year&#x27;s iteration of the model.  The overall point being made is that model training costs are growing unbounded.  Next year it could be 30 cars&#x27; worth or whatever for BERT-2, then 600 cars&#x27; worth for BERT-3 the year after.  That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s warning against.  At some point it isn&#x27;t worth it.')
