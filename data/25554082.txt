Tasks and issue management, wiki, kanban board, discussions, ci&#x2F;actions to trigger other stuff (send notification email for e.g.), storage of docs, revision control, tagging and organization, notebooks (with code too!), static hosting, support tickets, and so much more with Github API&#x2F;webhooks :) Startup of this size shouldn&#x27;t be spending a dime on anything but the most crucial aspects of what you&#x27;re building.<p>You don&#x27;t even need GSuite&#x2F;Office 365. Just use Libre Office and git commit them to your github repo for others to look at it. About the only thing you need to pay for is $10&#x2F;year domain license and $5&#x2F;month&#x2F;user for email service such as FastMail. Your SaaS webpage can be statically hosted on FastMail as well.')
