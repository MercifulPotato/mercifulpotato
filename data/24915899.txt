TSMC&#x27;s process node gives some hard upper limit to what can be built, but whether you can make your design that compact is an open question.<p>One consideration is that while we think of each transistor as individual and isolated, in reality they are simply wells of n and p type silicon with some oxides and metal thrown in. Because of this we can get unwanted parasitic components and latches. A BJT transistor for example is just a pattern of three silicon types, so it is somewhat inevitable that these will occur, whether they cause issues, and to what extent depends on the design.<p>Packing everything as tight as possible gives noise concerns, thermal concerns, signal integrity issues ect.<p>This is not to devalue the achievement of TSMC, but to state that design work is still a work as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;145696" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;145696</a>')
