Developer time is either very expensive or you just don&#x27;t have the right developers.<p>It also depends a lot what kind of money you can throw around. Are you a big fat insurance company? Music business? Bank? You are just gonna throw money at Oracle and your hardware vendor and its gonna scale (thinking 10-ish years back into my past here as an example). I think we came from like 4GB of RAM on the DB and a couple of CPUs with single path i&#x2F;o.<p>Could have spent ages optimizing all the different workloads. And this was already using read only replicas heavily for around the globe acceleration. This internal app was used 24&#x2F;7 from different places in the world tho heaviest usage was Europe&#x2F;US timezone. Instead they got 128GB of RAM, 16 cores IIRC and 4-path i&#x2F;o (still spinning disk w&#x2F; SCSI at the time). Sure it cost a lot I&#x27;m sure. But I doubt it cost more than a year&#x27;s salary of _one_ of us developers. And optimization would&#x27;ve required the application developers, the backend batch job developers and the (shared resource) DB admins to work on a multitude of workloads and use cases to analyze and optimize.<p>FF to my current job with lots and lots of but mainly smaller customers. One DB instance per per customer would be a lot of overhead. We do one schema per customer on PostgreSQL right now with sharding.')
