This is a bad analogy, or a good one depending on how you view the overt false narrative-creation of much of today&#x27;s media. Fauci didn&#x27;t &quot;change his mind&quot; with more evidence. He readily admits to overtly lying because he made a determination that some lives were more valuable than others. That. Is. Frightening.<p>This isn&#x27;t intended to be a political statement, simply a fact that you are memory-holing.')
