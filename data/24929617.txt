It has to be done by your end, you need to not do anything more.<p>There&#x27;s some more work coming up? Don&#x27;t take it, don&#x27;t get involved in email threads about the new projects&#x2F;tasks. They will find somebody else to do the work. They want you to be oncall after hours? Don&#x27;t do it, phone is off.<p>Good fast workers are a magnet attracting more and more work until they burn out under the load. Look around you and notice people doing no more than they are required to, learn from them, it&#x27;s the only way to last more than a few years at any place.')
