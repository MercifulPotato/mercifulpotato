Languages that earned me money before Ruby: C, Perl, Delphi (or something on DOS similar to it), Visual Basic, a little Visual C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript, even some Cobol plus a number of other languages for fun (hello to Postscript, Tcl, Forth, Pascal, BCPL, several assemblys and too many others to remember). Ruby was so much better. Garbage collection as in all interpreted languages, no types to write and a number of niceties that made me happy.<p>As you wrote, I started with Ruby because of Rails and I slowly migrated all my scripts from Perl to Ruby. Ruby is the language I use for my projects, plus some Node when I have to. Everything else is too hard, life is too short to waste it wrestling with those other languages. If I had to write something very parallel I&#x27;d go with Elixir. We&#x27;ll see what Ruby&#x27;s Ractors will bring to us.')
