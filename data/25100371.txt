Also the number of wires allowed in a single tube is limited.<p>Many houses have concrete walls, floors and ceilings, so you don&#x27;t run extra tubes easily...<p>Reconfiguring switches is next to impossible and via existing switch wires you can dim&#x2F;switch the lights but not change colour(temperature).<p>So here the original switches are removed and the connection is bridged (always on) and battery&#x2F;kinectic powered ZigBee switches control the lights directly, even if the gateway is down.')
