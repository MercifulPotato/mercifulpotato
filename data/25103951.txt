As we move towards more and more lockdowns, where you won&#x27;t be even able to just go out and speak your mind to the public, the social media will become the only way of communication.

Free speech laws should apply to social media.<p>You might not agree with the ideas that are being censored right now, but sooner or later they will come after you too.')
