Imagine you are given a fact that &quot;Alice works at Google&quot; and 1 month later you want to remove that and add &quot;Alice works at Facebook&quot;. In fully latent representation model of the data, you can not guarantee this.<p>For similar reasons, you can not guarantee preventing implicit biases in the data. Pre-trained generative models tend to hallucinate facts, for example you have two facts: &quot;Alice works at hospital&quot;, &quot;Bob works at hospital&quot;, if someone asks what does Alice&#x2F;Bob do? You don&#x27;t want your model hallucinates Nurse&#x2F;Doctor.')
