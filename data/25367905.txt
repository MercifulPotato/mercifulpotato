The news shouldn’t be caricaturizing anyone. The reporting should be as faithful to reality as possible.<p>&gt; My guess: because this is playing with fire. You might not be privy to it, but the calls for violence in their various echochambers if the crapshoot for overturning the election doesn&#x27;t pan out(hint: it won&#x27;t) are reaching audiences well armed and with nothing better to do than to engage in stochastic terrorism.<p>So because there exist some extremists with a particular viewpoint, nobody else should be allowed to entertain that viewpoint?<p>Funny because on the other side of the political spectrum there actually just recently were extremists that were not just hypothetical and they did actually go out and commit violence in order to “make their voices heard” and their viewpoint was not condemned by the media at all for doing so.')
