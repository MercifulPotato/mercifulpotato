Not a single mention of Intel.<p>When you listen to Intel, whether it was tech forum, Investor meeting or marketing presentation. They seems to talk more about AMD than their own offering.<p>Exec loves these FUD. Business purchase made up to 50% of the PC market. HyperScaler have long lead time and planning of new instances which makes Intel&#x27;s future Roadmap, promise, marketing and FUD works better. Delaying the purchase of AMD at all cost.<p>As I have been saying, Intel&#x27;s marketing machines has been working in full force since last year. From Leaks ( notice the amount of Intel leaks coming out are two to three times the volume over the past 12 months ? ), PR, Investor notes to sales partner&#x27;s promises, Channel Clearing discount etc. It is the same playbook as they did in Athlon 64 era, and credit where credit is due they are <i>exceptionally</i> good at it.')
