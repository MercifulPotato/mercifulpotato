Integrating the memory controller in the CPU was supposedly a big gain at the time. Now it&#x27;s in a different chip and multi-socket motherboards already have to traverse the board to access RAM attached to another chip. Are the interconnects better now and so going back to a single northbridge is workable? Would it simplify the topology in multi-socket systems to have all the RAM together instead of having to take care with process affinity to RAM? I&#x27;d love a source for discussion around these kinds of tradeoffs.')
