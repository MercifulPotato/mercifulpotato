Compared to Bach written for other instruments (Chaconne for violin or Cello Suites for cello), his solo keyboard works---Two- and Three-part Inventions or his WTC fugues---have a reputation for being polyphonal rather than emotionally moving, because piano is uniquely positioned as the instrument that allows an individual performer to exhibit counterpoint. Compared to other composers such as Chopin or Debussy, the difference in emotional response is stark.<p>Unless they are trained in music, the average listener has listened to monophonic music their entire life and isn&#x27;t capable of appreciating the nuances of polyphonic music, so it takes a talented pianist to make Bach&#x27;s music leave an impression on the listener. Absent the appeal to emotion, one must appeal to the listener at an intellectual level. I&#x27;ve heard the Two- and Three-Part Inventions referred to as music that would appeal to a music professor, which is not exactly drawing room fare. These two factors: (1) monophonic style used in pop music, and (2) Bach&#x27;s solo keyboard works being predominantly contrapuntal rather than emotionally moving compared to his other solo instrumental work might give Bach for solo keyboard (amongst casual music audiences) a reputation for being &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;unfashionable&quot; (which I think is completely undeserved).<p>Exceptions of course exist such as WTC preludes, which might appeal more to an untrained listener.<p>For example, Prelude 8 from Book 1 WTC (one of my favourites): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xFTvjRpaU38" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xFTvjRpaU38</a><p>Funny anecdote: Freeman Dyson wrote an excellent essay about Edward Teller, father of the H-bomb, playing this piece. It&#x27;s included in his collection of essays, Disturbing the Universe, which I&#x27;d highly recommend.')
