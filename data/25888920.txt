And the money for refactoring and updating stuff is zero. For any lab equipment connected to a computer, the computer is as old as the equipment.<p>And then everything in between.<p>In my view the vast majority of scientists using Python are using it at a level where they could practically switch to Python 3 just by cleaning up their print statements.<p>And an amusing anecdote... by the time my thesis project was in full swing, the OS that I had been using (MS-DOS running hardware that I had built) was largely obsolete. But I sure as hell wasn&#x27;t going to change horses in mid stream, so I persisted with the old stuff.')
