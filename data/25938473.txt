Isnâ€™t that, not so good? Lot of looting going on.<p>My position is that its not-so-good for these groups to get a free pass since the precedent that is set then messes with justice regardless of the event that preceded it. Two wrongs don&#x27;t make things right.<p>Condemning the violence around the capitol while not doing the same for the violence around the anitfa actions and blm protests where there was also real violence... doesn&#x27;t seem wise.<p>The mess just gets bigger. Those on the left and right need to examine their actions. They are setting precedents that are shaping the future in some not-so-good ways. Chaos for the sake of chaos doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere good.')
