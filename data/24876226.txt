It’s not one or the other. The fallout of climate change is potentially so catastrophic, you need to spend the money on nuclear anyway. You have to double down just in case renewables don’t pan out 100% the way we hope. You want to spend the money to maximise the chances of a working solution.<p>Think of it like COVID vaccine trials. We’re spending money on multiple vaccine candidates in parallel.')
