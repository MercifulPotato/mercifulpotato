DNA sequencing is done by sampling, then predicting the rest and as far as my own biology teachings go, it&#x27;s categorized as &quot;solved&quot;. Sequencing might get better, but we&#x27;ve accepted it as a solution for the moment.<p>Arguing the term &quot;solved&quot; is just pedantic. We know it&#x27;s not 100%, but the actual usefulness of improving the prediction of a few more Angstroms isn&#x27;t going to make a huge practical difference.<p>What matter is that we can start actually building tooling and lab tests on this method.')
