Even using the term &quot;censorship&quot; is somewhat dubious when&#x2F;if the &quot;censor&quot; is acting against the interests&#x2F;wishes of government.<p>That said, I think google are making a bad mistake here. They&#x27;ve crossed a line that they&#x27;ve been toeing.<p>Social media isn&#x27;t just a mass media. Media is always edited. Editing isn&#x27;t censorship. But social media is also a communication channel.  Haphazard interference in a communication channel sits wrong. We have no frame of reference for it.<p>Meanwhile, there are credible claims that social media fallacies have caused horrible things (including possibly genocide in Myanmar) in other countries&#x2F;languages. FB (in that case) has no knowledge of the language or interest in getting involved in that. How can you justify one without the other?')
