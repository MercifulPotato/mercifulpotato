People are responsible for themselves, if someone is going to stop using Gitea based on the fact that a random internet commenter decided to put &quot;Please avoid Gitea&quot; at the start of their explanation of flaws, isn&#x27;t that their choice? I&#x27;m not sure how those three extra words &quot;remove&quot; anyone&#x27;s &quot;choice&quot;, can you explain why you think that is the case? Thanks.')
