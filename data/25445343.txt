I do really think that is gonna continue in the future.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before and I&#x27;ll probably say it in increasingly irascible tones, but &quot;next year macOS is gonna become just like iOS&quot; is becoming the new &quot;next year is the year of Linux on the desktop.&quot;<p>Yes, Apple will almost certainly keep making security decisions people (including me) don&#x27;t like, but there&#x27;s no compelling business decision for trying to lock the Mac down to only App Store installs. Yes, I know Apple gets 30% of software sales that way. No, that is not enough of a reason for them to take the hit to their <i>hardware</i> profits that would undoubtedly entail. Even if it were just a loss of a few percent of Mac sales -- which I think is <i>extremely</i> optimistic -- it&#x27;d be coming out of the sales of the most expensive Macs, and making up one lost Mac sale literally requires <i>hundreds</i> of sales on the App Store to make up for it. Any executive at Apple who suggested that would be beat senseless by their accounting department.')
