You could also use other people on an individual level to do great things for society in general. Also you don&#x27;t have to be happy while doing it, and I would consider being influence on the world to be a definition of success. And arguably you would be able to have more influence if you were willing to use some &quot;dark personality traits&quot;.<p>Essentially to understand whether &quot;dark traits&quot; can be more productive and achieve more you would have to exclude from results anyone who is fine with doing activities that generally harm society.<p>Take Bill Gates for example. He obviously has &quot;dark traits&quot;, but as he got older he got better at hiding them and now look, what kind of positive influence he has had over the world. And arguably there aren&#x27;t many people out there that are more successful than him. Same with Elon Musk, yadayadayada.')
