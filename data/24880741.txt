And polling in 2018 was generally quite good.  But again, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with their &quot;methodologies&quot;.  Polling errors in 2016 were in fact not far from historical norms.  Numerate consensus (c.f. 538) picked a likely but not certain Clinton victory and the result was an extremely narrow loss instead.  That stuff happens.<p>Unfortunately a bunch of people whose political desires hinge on this kind of error being present in all elections and always to the advantage of &quot;the other side&quot; never want to hear this analysis and so repeat the nonsense that &quot;polls are always wrong&quot;.<p>But they&#x27;re not.  They&#x27;re just not as precise as we want.  If the polls are exactly as wrong this year, and in the same direction, as they were in 2016 then Biden wins a solid victory.  If they&#x27;re as wrong as they were in 2012 then he wins a landslide with Texas and Georgia going blue.')
