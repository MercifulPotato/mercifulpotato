A few that jump out to me as important are :<p>* Cross-Platform - You can reliably stay up-to-date on discord from basically every device you own with reliable notifications<p>* Excellent group voice chat quality and controls - Every user can control the volume for each chat participant(You control your own mix.)  This is something Teams doesn&#x27;t have and god I wish it did...<p>* It&#x27;s Slack for friends.   Discord basically does everything Slack does (rich-media real time chat with a specific group of contacts.) It&#x27;s far easier to crank out a new discord for your friends and you don&#x27;t get slammed with the &quot;Free Organization&quot; restrictions that come with Slack.<p>There are lots of things it does right, but these were major selling points for me.')
