You can see that many high-speed roads have reasonable fatality rates (autoban vs. US interstates). Also, speed limits on highways in the US have been rising in recent years, mostly due to enhanced specs and safety of vehicles. Fatalities have also be declining during that time as well.<p>In my opinion, the real difference if the intelligence of the driver when it comes to laws, vehicle dynamics, and decision making. The US driver&#x27;s test is a joke. You can see that other countries (think EU members) have tougher tests and fewer fatalities per mile, while in some cases also having higher speed limits.')
