As someone who lives in Seattle I believe that being able to be out walking and biking year round is one of the best reasons for being here. The weather west of the Cascades is quite temperate - so with some basic gear from Costco or Goodwill (or REI or Patagonia if you want, but it&#x27;s not necessary) you can go to town pretty much any day (or night) of the year except for rare snow storms and the like. \nAnd during Covid, that getting out and about has really helped maintain a positive outlook in this crazy time.
