I see more and more Youtubers asking their audience to write comments.<p>The carwow channel for example is definitely asking to answer stupid debates in the comments to improve its ranking. The vilebrequin channel does the same but as a joke and explain that it&#x27;s to improve the ranking. The community then write a lot of long and stupid comments to improve the ranking.')
