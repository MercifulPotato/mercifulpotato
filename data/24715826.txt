Even a few PPM of the diamine left in the water is going to be an issue either due to toxicity or if non-toxic, water quality (i.e. taste and perception of potability).<p>The &quot;switchable&quot; chelating agent is pretty interesting, but I haven&#x27;t been close enough to know if this is groundbreaking or just an advancement of an exiting phenomenon.<p>I might be a major cynic here, but my guess is that this is really cool science and like a lot of cool, basic science, the researchers need to find a practical use for it.  That helps translate &quot;cool basic science&quot; into &quot;existing new technology&quot;.<p>My PI did it when I was in graduate school - we always talked about our new molecules as being potential cancer treatments when really the focus was on the basic organic chemistry.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to win grants saying you&#x27;re developing &quot;new anti-cancer compounds&quot; than being honest and saying your research is focused on the development of &quot;novel chalcogen compounds that undergo pericyclic rearrangements to form strained heterocycles&quot;.')
