Modern GPUs are amazing, as is the software stack on top of them. (Crufty, fragile, maddening, inconsistent ... and amazing.)<p>For the next-gen needs of video calling, some combination of Nvidia, Apple, Intel, Arm, Microsoft, Google, codec IP owners, and a bunch of mobile chipset manufacturers are going to have to agree on a bunch of stuff. That never happens in a logical, straightforward way.<p>For the past 10 years Nvidia has been betting that a really big chunk of their future growth will come from powering machine learning applications of all kinds. They&#x27;re probably ... right? (I mean, I have no idea.) But as someone who cares a lot about video and only intramurally about machine learning, I find that frustrating. There&#x27;s a lot of relatively low-hanging fruit, from a technical perspective, in hardware codec support.')
