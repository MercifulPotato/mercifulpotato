It suggest writing articles and creating videos but there is then a drive to release less information publicly to try and get people to pay because your code is confusing or your docs are lacking. That seems like a big negative.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t work for team based projects. I&#x27;m one of the maintainers of Streamlink [1] which has members from around the world and we&#x27;ve been running various methods of donation since 2017 or so. In that time our Open Collective  [2] has made about $1600 USD. We have over 50,000 users across all platforms (based on download stats as we don&#x27;t collect any metrics in our apps so it&#x27;s potentially higher) yet the entire amount we&#x27;ve collected is thanks to less than 100 people. We note the Open Collective on every release as well.<p>My own personal donation methods total $15 from one person in the past 5 years since we forked the project and started maintaining it. We have more users than many start ups do and I know that there are several companies using our software, but I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make donations really work yet. How do we determine who should make what from a shared pool of money? How do you value a contribution, PR, etc., and most importantly how do you get users to actually pay without negatively impacting the project?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;streamlink&#x2F;streamlink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;streamlink&#x2F;streamlink</a> [2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;streamlink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;streamlink</a>')
