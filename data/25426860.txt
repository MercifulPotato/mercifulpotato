They don&#x27;t care about property values ballooning because they pay property taxes on the assessed values from when they bought, which is often decades ago, due to Prop 13. Prop 13 in general keeps things stagnant. For another example, there is no incentive to renovate&#x2F;tear down&#x2F;rebuild bigger because now you will pay significantly higher property taxes. Single family homes don&#x27;t get turned into denser properties. The list of consequences goes on beyond my interest in it.')
