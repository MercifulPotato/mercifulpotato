I see scattered sub-60fps reports in Minecraft for both Nvidia &amp; AMD. It seems to just be a &quot;minecraft&#x27;s engine is shit&quot; thing, not an AMD thing?<p>But I&#x27;m not seeing any actual comparisons or head-to-heads or anything showing AMD in particular is struggling with Minecraft in particular. This unknown quality benchmark is the only thing I&#x27;m finding for Minecraft: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpucheck.com&#x2F;game-gpu&#x2F;minecraft&#x2F;amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt&#x2F;intel-core-i7-8700k-3-70ghz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpucheck.com&#x2F;game-gpu&#x2F;minecraft&#x2F;amd-radeon-rx-57...</a> and it&#x27;s definitely not struggling to hit 500 fps numbers at 1080p, either.<p>And other OpenGL games &amp; apps are not showing any severe AMD issues, although the only significant sample of those are on Linux so that also has \na different OS, so there certainly doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything <i>systemically</i> wrong with AMD&#x27;s OpenGL as you&#x27;re claiming. Unless for some reason they just never brought over the way better Linux OpenGL driver to Windows, which would be highly unexpected &amp; definitely something that needs evidence to support.<p>&gt; zero acknowledgement that people play games other than the latest AAA games<p>This is just completely false and seems to just be because your pet peeve is Minecraft in particular? Both Nvidia &amp; AMD discuss popular games not just the latest AAA games. Usually in their latency section, since that&#x27;s where it comes up as more relevant (esports games), but it&#x27;s definitely not an <i>ignored</i> category entirely.')
