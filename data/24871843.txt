I did recently read the NYT piece entitled The Relentless Shrinking of Trumpâ€™s Base [0], which at least seems somewhat data driven.  Obviously, the characterization of &quot;White voters without college degrees&quot; as the Trump base is certainly a very rough approximation, but using their demographic groupings, they estimate that the Trump coalition shrunk by 48,000 since  2016, and the &quot;Biden coalition&quot; grew by 140,000.  This in a state that Trump won by less than 23,000 votes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-voters-demographics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;t...</a>')
