My workflow has, for now, become start new post -&gt; save draft of post -&gt; go to &#x2F;wp-admin and select the &quot;classic&quot; editor from the posts page. It&#x27;s been a huge regression in usability for me; I wonder how many others feel similarly.<p>I guess the obvious answer is, &quot;You should&#x27;ve self-hosted if you want control over the editor.&quot; Still: I didn&#x27;t imagine wordpress.com moving to create a much harder-to-use default.')
