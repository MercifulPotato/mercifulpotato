It might be OK.<p>Gen-x who remember the TRS80 MC10 and its keyboard remember chiclet keyboards as not much better than membrane keyboards (Consider the ZX81 Spectrum)<p>But decades later Apple started shipping chiclet-appearing keyboards that actually worked, so the style has been somewhat revitalized.<p>That said, yeah they could be shipping a 1980s quality chiclet keyboard or a 2020s quality chiclet keyboard, so that&#x27;s worrisome.')
