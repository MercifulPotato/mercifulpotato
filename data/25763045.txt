That is, it is its own entity with its own will and liability for its actions.<p>This legal person is effectively controlled by a very small group of people, but it outlives them as these titles are replaced (new CEO, changing board). Everyone else contribute to its function, but not its interests. They are recruited to work for the entity through an uneven symbiotic relationship, where the entity covers the simple short-term needs of individuals.<p>It then uses it the power amassed to benefit itself, and those in control. Either by simply being large, or by trading the immense resources it can produce.<p>To the entity, the individual is no more important than a random cell in your body (left small toe fibroblast anyone?). And just like in your body, only a small number of cells get to drive the machine.<p>This is very different from a grouping of individuals, where individuals are merely cooperating towards a democratically elected goal.')
