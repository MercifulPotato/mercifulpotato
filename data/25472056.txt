No formation is needed or wanted.<p>I still rarely see even one drone used. We need to start with one, if its useful.<p>I can give you many locations with invasive species, swarms won&#x27;t solve that. Unless you give the swarms guns.<p>But one drone with a gun would kill pests fine. I think even with hunting humans most killing wouldn&#x27;t need formations.')
