Xi is one person and he can&#x27;t run the whole country by himself.<p>I don&#x27;t even think Xi&#x27;s work involved any particular IPO, the stock exchange and regulators on that level rushed the process likely knowing what&#x27;s to come and having huge amount to gain from it. Which made them competing interest against the central government, and in the murky waters local&#x2F;lower level functionaries often win because central government can&#x27;t focus on all of them.<p>This happened in Wuhan, with disastrous consequences. But the saving grace is when things no longer stay murky, that it has drawn the full attention of the central government, the center always win, often the opposition will just cease to exist. That has also happened in Wuhan&#x2F;Hubei.<p>This is likely the case here.')
