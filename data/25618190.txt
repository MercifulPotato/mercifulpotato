Choose a couple things to focus on and write those down in my planner (pen and paper). Lately it’s been:<p>- read more books, especially biographies and histories<p>- spend time with my kids<p>- write a blog post or essay once a month<p>Outside that, I don’t get much more specific. Work is already busy enough to juggle. I don’t need another thing to juggle. I’m not interested in forcing that much structure on my time outside work. I try to prioritize simple things that make my family or myself happy.')
