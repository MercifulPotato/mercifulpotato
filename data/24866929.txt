Who are you to say that you know what they want better than they do?<p>That&#x27;s an idea that is centered around individual freedoms rather than maximizing the utility for the most people. This is simply a political&#x2F;ethical conflict.<p>My reasoning works like this: I want a functioning labor market, where &quot;functioning&quot; means that the worst jobs are good jobs. So I want my lawmakers to ensure it. I&#x27;m happy for them to <i>severely</i> reduce my freedom to make agreements as an employer or employee in that process.<p>&gt; The cost of labor in SF is so high that it&#x27;s not reasonable to pay someone to bus the tables. While there I would frequently see a man outside who was clearly homeless.<p>This problem has 2 solutions 1) let people take worse jobs 2) make social security nets better. Both are required. I can&#x27;t stress this enough: any change to the labor market laws must come with corresponding changes to welfare.<p>My view that even the worst jobs should be good jobs is of course coupled with an understanding that this potentially raises the equilibrium unemployment by <i>a lot</i>, so it it obviously follows that I also believe society (i.e. my tax money) should take care of everyone in society who is unemployed. There is an inconsistent viewpoint here: and that would be the one where you think there shouldn&#x27;t be a massive social safety net but <i>also</i> people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to take low-paying jobs. To be clear, that&#x27;s not what I think. I think the idea of &quot;the worst jobs being good jobs&quot; is a good goal, and that it also must be coupled with a large social safety net.<p>I realize that social safety net isn&#x27;t in place in California - so arguing for the change to labor laws is, at least, arguing the for the inconsistent state - but it&#x27;s hopefully something that can be addressed next. One thing would have to come first.')
