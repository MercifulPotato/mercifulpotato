It&#x27;s an imaginative extension of the &quot;being poor means you have poor character&quot; trope.<p>Also, when it extends beyond actual luxuries to basics like having a refrigerator (yes, I&#x27;ve actually heard this one) or the classic &quot;an HD TV&quot; (when was the last time you saw a non-HD TV for sale?), or in this case an iPhone (smartphones are no longer optional luxuries, and a used iPhone is one of the better investments in that category), it suggests that poor people should be robots who totally forego the very most fundamental creature-comforts until they&#x27;ve managed to turn their world around completely. It&#x27;s dehumanizing.')
