You can even set it to sound an alarm if your SpO2 drops too low.<p>Apnea is serious though.  It hit me when I was relatively fit at 43 and took a chunk of my youth with it.  Ever since, I have more of an &quot;old man&quot; brain(like getting overwhelmed by stimulus, especially when driving).  I&#x27;ve been on CPAP for over 2 years and my apnea is well controlled, but some things just don&#x27;t seem to come back.')
