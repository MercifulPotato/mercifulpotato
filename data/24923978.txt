Here I was: lead trumpet (carrying the entire melody), totally exposed, audience of maybe 60 people.  Zero nervousness as I stood on stage looking out at everyone, as we get ready to begin.  But about two minutes in, my hands began to shake, my lungs couldn&#x27;t take in oxygen,  I couldn&#x27;t hold the notes.  Nowhere to hide -- I was the solo lead part for the entire performance!  If I even stopped playing for one measure to re-collect myself, it sounded ridiculous because I&#x27;m the melody and the pieces had no breaks.  The embarrassment was <i>severe</i>.  The other players didn&#x27;t look my way as we packed up afterwards, and I barely said a word as I raced for the exit.<p>So the idea of being able to get that under control (a lifelong struggle) -- yeah, potentially life-changing.')
