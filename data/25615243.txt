Algorithms carried out by computer have been used to administer and surveil since before the 90s.<p>Personally, my understanding of Kurzweil is that &quot;computer intelligence&quot; is something greater than just an algorithm that is carried out by a machine, but could be done by a human. It would mean something more malleable and conscious than that. Based on that standard I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s wrong about nearly everything (save the privacy one - but again - that was true in 1998 with weaker encryption).')
