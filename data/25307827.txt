It sounds like maybe there will be some overlaps in Turbolinks 6 and NEW MAGIC when it comes to partial updates.<p>Maybe for basic partial page updates where you don&#x27;t need to broadcast something to every connected client over websockets then Turbolinks 6 will be enough on it own. If that ends up being the case that&#x27;s amazing because it&#x27;ll be fully client side.<p>In any case the near future is looking to be the best its ever been for developing very nice feeling apps without going the SPA route with any back-end technology.')
