Item(by='deetsb', descendants=None, kids=[25885977], score=None, time=1611326420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870599, text='I&#x27;m not quite sure I agree with your words here; generally speaking, net income is profit (accounting profit, to be precise -- there are other profits but we normally talk about accounting profit).<p>Secondly, revenue is super not meaningless! It&#x27;s the capacity for you to be profitable! Amazon had 0 net income but were able to spend money on growth because they had revenue, and were able to classify their R&amp;D as an expense, which pushed their profit&#x2F;net income down. Without that, they would&#x27;ve been a positive net income&#x2F;profit company who then reinvested net income&#x2F;profits into R&amp;D.<p>You can do all the expense classification shenanigans you want to to muck around with profit (ex. have profit &amp; spend that on growth, or classify your growth as an expense and have no profit), but it&#x27;s a lot harder to grow without having the money to put to growth. You&#x27;ll get that of course in two ways -- increasing capital (equity&#x2F;liabilities), or well, revenue!<p>EDIT: Had some typos so cleaned them up.')
