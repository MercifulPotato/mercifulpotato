The require licensed sales people. And when one messes up there people go to jail because the &quot;oops&quot; mess up in those industries mean criminal charges.<p>So even if Google is to launch those product them as well as this re-iteration of Google Pay will be a flop for Google as every single other consumer product. It will be killed in a couple of years.')
