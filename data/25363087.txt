[3]<p>Don&#x27;t blame our inability to react to the virus on China. The pandemic was raging for months, with news coverage of people being locked in their own apartments, doctors dying, makeshift hospitals getting set up in stadiums, before it exceeded more than a handful of cases in the West.<p>Hell, even after hundreds of thousands dead, we still don&#x27;t have the political will to do what would have been necessary to stamp it out back in March - massive testing, massive contact tracing, enforced quarantine. If we were to go back in time, and do it again, I think we would arrive at pretty much the same outcome.<p>The &#x27;China hid the facts&#x27; [4] narrative has little explanatory power, and its primary purpose is to shift the blame from our own failings.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;health&#x2F;china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html?searchResultPosition=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;health&#x2F;china-pneumonia-ou...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia&#x2F;china-virus-wuhan-death.html?searchResultPosition=4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia&#x2F;china-virus-wu...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;health&#x2F;cdc-coronavirus.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;health&#x2F;cdc-coronavirus.ht...</a><p>[4] It[5] <i>did</i> hide the facts, but it hid them so poorly that everyone who was paying any attention, both inside, and outside China was aware of how serious this pandemic is at the start of the year. It&#x27;s hard to hide the facts about something when you put an entire city under lockdown (But don&#x27;t cut the telephone and internet lines into it.)<p>[5] China isn&#x27;t a monolith. To be exact, local government did its best to downplay the pandemic. National government was not very happy with how that went down, and purged their local and regional party branches for their mishandling of the outbreak.')
