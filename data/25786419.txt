Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610679275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25786191, text='Politics is just a small part of twitter, the <i>overwhelming</i> majority of twitter content is music, sports, entertainment etc, so a potential silo effect isn&#x27;t much to be concerned about. Most people just don&#x27;t engage in politics on social media because it&#x27;s a soul draining exercise and generally not time well spent unless you&#x27;re a political junkie that enjoys exchanging barbs with friends and strangers online. So is it possible some of the conservative political content on twitter might wane? Sure, but that&#x27;s just a fact of life, some communities online just lean a certain direction. Finally, conservatives are not in exile from social media, just about every prominent conservative has an active twitter account with millions of followers and there are <i>millions</i> of conservatives posting all over twitter <i>right now</i> and this is something that can be trivially verified. The bottom line is that none of this is a big deal, it&#x27;s politics flavored tabloid gossip.')
