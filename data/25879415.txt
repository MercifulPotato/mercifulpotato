Generally those orbits are used for parking bulky rubbish that&#x27;s too much trouble to de-orbit.<p>Geosynchronous orbits are above the worst parts of the radiation belts, so maybe that&#x27;s a good place for the ISS.  Or even higher; it doesn&#x27;t need to be geosynchronous.  The main advantage of a low orbit is that it&#x27;s easier to get to from Earth, but if you&#x27;re just parking it long-term as a museum piece that doesn&#x27;t matter as much.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect Lagrange points to have much of a problem with clutter unless we decide to start parking enormous quantities of stuff there.  Objects can spread out and orbit the points; as long as they&#x27;re all going in about the same direction they should be able to avoid running into each other.')
