Item(by='gpm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602266752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732476, text='The same way that selling a timeslot that happens to be sized so that on average there will be one impression is not selling one impression. You aren&#x27;t pretending to be able to accurately decide whether any given page load is an impression. You aren&#x27;t even guaranteeing that there will be a page load, let alone an impression.<p>It seems like a way of directly eliminating fraud, by preventing people from having an avenue to lie about impressions, and a way of discencentivizing tracking, since impressions stop being the billing metric and therefore stops &quot;needing&quot; to be accurate. Hopefully this (as well as the other things suggested by OP to discentivize tracking) would result in less tracking and less hoarding of dangerous user data.')
