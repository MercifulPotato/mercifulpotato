It&#x27;s just good design, not a PITA.<p>It seems to be a common view point that Haskell makes IO difficult.  I actually personally found that it was more powerful because I was being more explicit about it. It also allowed for higher ordered functions to abstract common patterns in IO.  The only difficulty in Haskell was not due to monads or type safety, but rather in getting my brain to understand lazy evaluation by default.')
