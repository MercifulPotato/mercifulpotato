I park on the street, the city has gone nowhere with its plans to provide on street chargers.\nYet it isn&#x27;t a problem, despite a relative lack of public chargers compared to elsewhere in the country it is still perfectly feasible. I&#x27;ve tweaked my habits to go to the supermarket that has a charger in the car park, when planning what to do at the weekend I check nearby charging locations.<p>Business locations can acquire visitors by offering them, and there&#x27;s all sorts of upsell benefits. A garden centre that has one might get me to stay and visit their cafe if I know I&#x27;m going to be there for an hour for instance.')
