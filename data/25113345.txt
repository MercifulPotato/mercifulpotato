However, you do need an architecture that supports it.<p>I suspect a lot of online communications and data hosting services now have a barrier to implementing E2E simply because they already have established infrastructure and software architecture but everything was originally specified to support a centralised system. You can&#x27;t just drop in a different library or edit a handy configuration file to turn one type of system into the other. Fundamentally, you need to build something new and with a different architecture to work on an E2E basis, which is a major investment and a significant risk if you already have an otherwise successful product operating on a large scale.<p>The main challenge with E2E, as far as I&#x27;m aware, is still how to scale up the basic principle effectively as the number of participants increases.<p>However, none of this affects the iCloud functionality I&#x27;ve been referring to, where essentially you&#x27;re only storing data for one party anyway.<p>[1] This statement is made in the context that encryption in general is a field where you really want people who know what they&#x27;re doing implementing everything and if you don&#x27;t have experts in-house then you should probably use someone else&#x27;s tried and tested implementation instead of attempting a home-grown version.')
