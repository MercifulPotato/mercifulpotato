We have a few churches around us that have a bunch of people who do home schooling and &quot;alternate&quot; schooling, and this whole alternate society thing is really noticeable. The kids have friends and play and socialize, but it&#x27;s an entirely different circle from the public school kids. The kids play video games but different ones, they watch TV and listen to music, but have a totally different concept of pop culture than the regular school kids. Like if I made a Spiderman or Harry Potter reference&#x2F;joke they wouldn&#x27;t get it at all, but they have their own memes that only they get. Feels kind of insular, like the Amish or one of those communities of immigrants who deliberately don&#x27;t assimilate into the shared US cultural melting pot.')
