Even if contracts are not very explicit about this, it appears that AZ really saw it as a separate supply chain from the very beginning, at least for initial doses. Looking into contract is like trying to catch them at technicalities which is not done in good faith.<p>Why are you insisting on 12 weeks difference in a contract celebration when the issue at hands is AZ failing to fulfill their commitment - and it&#x27;s not by a short amount, but by more than 50%+.<p>If they &quot;saw it as a separate supply chain&quot; then they shouldn&#x27;t have added to the contract that it wouldn&#x27;t matter where the vaccines were produced, right?<p>And saying that&#x27;s a technicality when they are hiding behind the quote &quot;best possible effort&quot;. They basically can claim they are doing their best effort while they have plenty of stock being made, and not shipping it.<p>&gt;Again, it is not contracts that can miraculously create more doses now. It was only because of investments done before. AZ is doing this for non-profit (a big mistake in my opinion), so what can you squeeze out of that?<p>&gt;In fact, the EU should have invested even more, make them to build even larger facilities with more bioreactors that in case of low yield they would still have more doses. But it is all in hindsight, so not very useful to say it now.<p>Then maybe AZ should have made arrangements, or asked for help, if they saw they weren&#x27;t going to be able to fulfill the orders - or maybe they were expecting to move orders from UK, yet they were blocked? Who knows, right?<p>EU released the contract, they are not hiding. So if AZ is hiding something, they should come forward or face the consequences.<p>&gt;The UK is not privileged because their sites had the same issues with the first batches. The only difference is that they started 3 months earlier.<p>Again I see no relevance in this, AZ signed a contract and committed to a deadline which they are failing by A LOT! I&#x27;m not saying UK is privileged or not, this is the contract between AZ and EU - now if UK is blocking AZ from exporting vaccines, let it be said out loud and let&#x27;s all be transparent. If AZ is fulfilling UK contract and shitting on EU contract, then they are the ones privileging UK.<p>EU is asking for transparency. One thing is AZ fulfilling all contracts by less than 50%. Other thing is some countries get 90% of fulfillment, and EU gets 30%.')
