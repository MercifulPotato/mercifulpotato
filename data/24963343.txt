A lot of x86 cpus run in the 4-5Ghz range meanwhile ARM cpus usually stick to 2-3GHz. So the vast majority of CPU designs are not hitting their theoretical limits. They are only hitting thermal limits.<p>The only real benefit is that fixed length instructions are easier to decode. That&#x27;s about it. If you can get away with fewer instructions then that&#x27;s what you should do.')
