In particular, the noisiness of the channel plays a huge part in Shannons equation for information capacity.<p>In this case in particular, if you receive no particles you know that the event either did not happen _or_ it did happen and you failed to detect the particle. If you do receive a particle you know that either the event happened at least once _or_ it did not happen and you have a false positive from your detector _or_ there was a particle but it was introduced by quantum noise. To make sure what actually happened you would need more signal, more particles per transmitted bit.<p>However, it is entirely possible that this reduction in effective bit rate will slow down actual bit rates back down to &quot;normal&quot; subluminal speeds.')
