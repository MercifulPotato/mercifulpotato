Current processes and procedures should still be used because they are all we have, but something new is also needed.  Part of that something new should be an acknowledgement that systems are unprotectable, so instead of just security procedures we need, for example, faster recovery procedures (not just restore from backup).  Another  example might be dual implementations of systems, built with different technologies, so that when one is compromised the other is less likely to be susceptible to the same compromise.  Expensive, but that may be what it takes to keep the world running.  Splitting the internet into layers of VPN&#x27;s with everything having it&#x27;s own VPN might be useful too.  The internet is fragmenting anyway, might as well fragment it in a useful way.  Maybe everyone should have multiple physical computers as well, one for each work project, one for play, one for home finances, etc., each with tailored protections and no connections between them.  I&#x27;m not sure what the answers are but it&#x27;s obvious what is being done now is not good enough.  I do fully expect to see the IRS hacked, chemical plants destroyed, factories stopped, etc. the way things are going now.  Simple ransomware is already causing major problems and there seems to be no way to stop it and it&#x27;s going to spread to all sectors and it seems likely there will be ransomware without the ransom too, just pure destruction.  Already happened in Saudi Arabia.')
