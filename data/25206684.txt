I am a bit ashamed to admit that I still don&#x27;t know any &quot;from first principle explanation&quot; for this fact.<p>Don&#x27;t sweat it, here&#x27;s a rough proof. First a proof that a negative times a positive is negative:<p><pre><code>    a*0 = 0 [Assumed but you can prove this too.]\n    a*(b-b) = 0 [Definition of 0.]\n    a*b + a*(-b) = 0 [Distributive law.]\n</code></pre>\nFor any X, only its inverse -X has the property that X + -X = 0. Therefore a×(-b) is the inverse of a×b [which is -(a×b)].<p>Then apply the same idea but with a negative a:<p><pre><code>    (-a)*0 = 0 [Assumed but you can prove this too.]\n    (-a)*(b-b) = 0 [Definition of 0]\n    (-a)*b + (-a)*(-b) = 0 [Distributive law.]\n    -(a*b) + (-a)*(-b) = 0 [From above.]\n    (-a)*(-b) + -(a*b) = 0 [Commutative addition to rearrange to X + -X = 0 form.]\n</code></pre>\nAnd as before, only the inverse has this property so -(a×b) must be the inverse of (-a)×(-b) -- which is a×b! So a negative number times a negative number is positive. QED.<p>In case you&#x27;re interested, the proof that the additive element is a multiplicative absorbing element (a×0 = 0, for all a) is also fairly trivial[1].<p>The above does somewhat implicitly assume that 0 and -0 are equal (or at least that (-a)×0 = (a)×0 = 0, which implies that 0 and -0 are equal).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Additive_identity#The_additive_identity_annihilates_ring_elements" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Additive_identity#The_additive...</a>')
