I don&#x27;t understand why my Google Drive and Gmail have input lag and choppy animations on my 5 year old xps13, it&#x27;s not that hard to make navigating a filesystem or list of emails fast. Actually I do understand, it&#x27;s because they want everything they build to be made in a massive javascript framework with shared components, which looks nice but runs like garbage on anything not modern.')
