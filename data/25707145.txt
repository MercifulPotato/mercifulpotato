Go has captured the hearts of sysadmin types and those looking for something just a step up from python (as evidenced by much of the devops code written in it -- which I&#x27;m very grateful for, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use kubernetes if it was in Java still), so I can see it growing in that field.<p>I don&#x27;t see how Rust doesn&#x27;t become the most important emerging systems language (C &amp; C++ obviously aren&#x27;t going anywhere just by virtue of being incumbents) of the next decade.')
