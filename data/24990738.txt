It&#x27;s where people publish final builds of the images that they release to the world and others pull them from there. If you&#x27;re using it for basically passing your own images between CI workers or whatever other workload that requires you to constantly be pushing and pulling, you should be paying them for it or hosting your own registry.<p>If you&#x27;re in a situation where having your own registry means Docker Hub &quot;loses all relevance&quot;, then you&#x27;re probably not the kind of user they have any reason to care about (and that&#x27;s nonsense anyway, because you&#x27;ll still almost certainly be using 3rd party images from there).')
