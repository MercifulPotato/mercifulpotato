The reporter will naturally be drawn to stories that match up with their perspective on the world. It&#x27;s very difficult for us to actively and constantly challenge our own assumptions and seek out evidence that contradicts them.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot. I think that if an outlet is reporting on some statistical fact. Like the frequency of mass shooting deaths for example they should also place that in perspective against car accidents, cancer, heart disease etc. Contrast that with crime and murder trends over a large swath of time etc.  This way people can properly contextualize and rank the real risk in the situation and separate it from the sensationalism.<p>But even if all of that is carried out. There is still bias from what the reporter chose to write a story about.<p>I think the worst offenders of situations like this are the investigative NPR style stories where a reporter seeks out an individual&#x27;s story as a means to emotionally manipulate the reader into a particular policy position. It&#x27;s far better to look at the larger statistical picture.  You can find a sob story to emotionally manipulate people towards quite literally any policy position imaginable.')
