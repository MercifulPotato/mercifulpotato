Its just a lot of text&#x2F;json. Its in a db and not blobs or object store due to sync, filtering, tagging, reporting ..... larger assets(img) will be in an object store<p>Maybe its not supposed to be in a DB, but using my export of google keep as a guide on average my larger files are 10-20kb of json. x that by 1000 for unlimited* storage and x that per user you&#x27;re over 1 TB.<p>Even in that case postgres will still work and there will be enough time to scale up manually. But from the perspective of architecting something on this scale or beyond I made my original post.<p>And so maybe I am over architecting then both of yours advice about pg still applies. (you guys are ultimately right, practically)')
