Each of these offerings was a bold bet at first, and sensible people worried (often!) that they could not work. But at this point, itâ€™s become pretty clear how special they are and how lucky we are to have them.<p>&gt; With good execution and a bit of continuing good luck, Marketplace, Prime, and AWS can be serving customers and earning financial returns for many years to come.<p>From the Amazon 2014 letter to shareholders: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s2.q4cdn.com&#x2F;299287126&#x2F;files&#x2F;doc_financials&#x2F;annual&#x2F;AMAZON-2014-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s2.q4cdn.com&#x2F;299287126&#x2F;files&#x2F;doc_financials&#x2F;annual&#x2F;A...</a><p>It&#x27;s kinda interesting that Devices (Alexa&#x2F;Kindle) and 1st party retail are <i>not</i> called out as flywheels. Advertising and Alexa are other candidates for the next flywheel I believe. I think the reason they&#x27;re not there yet is that they&#x27;re not self-sustaining, i.e. like Logistics, they&#x27;re growing but their growth is driven by the other flywheels.')
