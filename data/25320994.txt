Really bizarre to see this in the front page of HN! Tourists have been allowed inside the tree for a while now. You can drink cashew juice, there’s a very neat observation platform and a charming wooden pathway. I recommend looking up “maior cajueiro do mundo” for pictures. The Wikipedia article doesn’t do it justice :)')
