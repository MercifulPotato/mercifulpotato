For example, maybe they worked on a team of 2 software developers and they call themselves &quot;Senior Software Developer&quot; because they had 2 years of experience and the other guy (or gal) was an intern.<p>That might seem like a joke, but it isn&#x27;t. I have seen that many times.<p>Another popular one is people that put &quot;CTO&quot; or &quot;CEO&quot; on their resume because they did freelance work for their cousin&#x27;s friend&#x27;s brother&#x27;s pizza restaurant once. They started a company called &quot;AAA Software Enterprises&quot; and made themselves CEO. Then closed the company after that project finished.<p>These people need to realize that overembellishing your resume can often hurt you more than under-crediting yourself.<p>I have also noticed that the 2-3 year experience gap is a dangerous gap in Software Development. Developers have learned enough at this point that they are walking all over the other junior developers that are doing basic bug fixes. They feel like a God and feel like they can do anything. But what they don&#x27;t realize is that they might have too much experience for the Junior Developer position, but they don&#x27;t have enough experience to realize how much they actually don&#x27;t know yet, because they have never experienced it. So some developers fall in this trap of never being pushed hard enough in their early years and not realizing how much they still have to learn. So they think they know it all and tend to overembellish, without realizing how dumb they look because they have no idea how niave they still are.')
