After discussing work conditions with enough people who worked at other space companies, I&#x27;m pretty damn sure I&#x27;d never work in the space industry again after I leave here, lol.<p>I&#x27;ve heard stories about &quot;water clubs&quot; and &quot;coffee clubs&quot; because some companies are so cheap they don&#x27;t even pay for bottled water machines - so the employees group together and pay for it themselves. Like WTF?! And a couple of these stories came from programmers too.<p>As far as I know, we get paid better, have free basics like that (there was free lunch before covid), and whenever we carry our equipment to test sites, it&#x27;s usually several generations newer and better than anything else I see at those sites. It&#x27;s kinda funny lol.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a golden handcuffs thing I suppose. The problem is even if they pay better than anyone else in the space industry, I could probably double my compensation by getting a job at google. Of course, landing an interview at google in itself seems nearly impossible.<p>Sometimes I wonder if having a space company on your resume is a bad mark for hiring managers at companies like google. It kinda feels that way. Like as if only the riff raff work at space companies. But there are a lot of us who just wanted to work on cool stuff lol.')
