Item(by='jerry80', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602361828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740880, text='&gt;In my opinion, punishment that isn&#x27;t intended to reform the criminal is done so three rest of us can feel good. I consider it sadism, but can understand if others object to that term.<p>Punishment is arguably intended first and foremost to be a deterrent to committing crime in the first place, and secondary as a way to take dangerous criminals off the street. Reform of the criminal should probably be considered a bonus, not the primary intention. I think almost no one, aside from direct victims and their families, want punishment purely for punishment&#x27;s sake (i.e. sadism).')
