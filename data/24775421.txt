As someone else already pointed out, the issues today are still nothing compared to the 60s.<p>Current domestic issues have <i>nothing</i> to do with the Civil War. There is no state-like military complex ready to secede. There is no geographic division that lends itself to secession. Etc. etc. The only reason this is invoked is because it&#x27;s the only meme that most people are aware of, not because it&#x27;s even remotely accurate. Even something like the 90s Balkan Wars is so far from the contemporary American situation, it&#x27;s absurd to compare it.<p>The only thing that&#x27;s truly new is the media&#x27;s profit motive for creating a perception of chaos.<p>Of course, the fact that things have worked out in the past doesn&#x27;t mean they will always work out in the future. But people who compare contemporary America to the Fall of the Roman Empire or the American Civil War really don&#x27;t know much about either.')
