There&#x27;s two possibilities: the offset (aka &quot;random number&quot;) is dynamic, or it&#x27;s fixed. If it&#x27;s the former all you have to do is sample enough times to get through the noise. If it&#x27;s the latter, it&#x27;s not vulnerable to the previous attack, but if you have a known point of reference (so you can deduce what the offset is), then you can still stalk them (forever?). IMO the only way to do is &quot;properly&quot; is to quantize people into map cells, like how apple does it with their coarse location feature[1].<p>[1] &quot;Apple doesn&#x27;t reduce the accuracy of location fixes by adding noise. Instead, they&#x27;ve carved up the world into regions, allowing approximate locations to preserve the user&#x27;s current city when possible.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radar.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;understanding-approximate-location-in-ios-14" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radar.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;understanding-approximate-location-in-...</a>')
