Because at this point a touch interface is expected by people.<p>Even me who is used to non touch screens user interfaces, I tend to touch the screen on a non touchscreen laptop once in a while. It&#x27;s frustrating that it doesn&#x27;t work, because it does work on my ThinkPad and I enjoy it.<p>Apple not having a touchscreen option on their high end laptops is weird, since they did so well with the iPhone and the iPad.<p>At least that would help developers to implement touch interfaces for iOs.
