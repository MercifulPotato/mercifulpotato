Why do &#x27;researchers&#x27; risk exposing themselves like this (if the bulk of what you do is blackhat?). I&#x27;m not saying Mr Fowler is secretly a blackhat, but many people in the hacking scene are obviously blackhat judging by what they post on social media. You can infer that they like to get up to some sketchy stuff (again - risking exposing themselves to LE).')
