And you need to make that assumption if you&#x27;re going to invest in nuclear, otherwise you&#x27;ve pissed away many billions of dollars.<p>Renewables and storage right now could handle the grid.  So the downside, if we go with them and the decline suddenly stops, is that costs are higher than we wanted them to be.   But that&#x27;s it -- they can still do the job.  If the economic risk for nuclear is higher than that, it&#x27;s still worth going with renewables.  At best, it might make sense to do some token nuclear projects to keep the industry from dying completely.  You can view SMR efforts, or even Chinese reactor building, in that light.<p>I think, though, that renewables and storage will continue to get cheaper.  For storage, in particular, I think the trends are very clear.  There are many different storage technologies vying in the marketplace -- for example, hundreds or thousands of battery chemistries, or more with organics -- and increasing economic incentive to make them work and install them.   Zero or even negative grid pricing is becoming common in more and more places.   Trillions of dollars are available to those who win at this.')
