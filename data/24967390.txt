I could still use the workflow and tooling I&#x27;m used to.  Contrast that with GitHub where losing your account means losing the workflow and tooling you depend on.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about trying to re-host a controversial project though.  I&#x27;m more interested in the risk to the average small developer where getting banned would ruin your life, but wouldn&#x27;t make the news.')
