While I support the right of private companies to do as they please, I think that Net Neutrality has a role to play here.<p>The packets I send and whom I send them to should be protected by law in the same way that the letters I send are. It is a crime to open someone else&#x27;s mail without a warrant, even if that mail contains hate speech or incitement to violence. Private companies who carry mail are not excempt from this restriction, they are content-agnostic. I beleive ISPs fall firmly into this category, and that a strong case may be made for cloud hosting providers as well.<p>With regards to accountability, individuals are accountable for their actions. It was those people who trespassed and committed violence who should be, and it seems will be, held accountable. Those who directly (as in &quot;go here and do this&quot;) incited them, or directly planned their actions, committed crimes as well. Those who simply failed to condone them, or who expressed sympathy with their ideals and causes, or who delivered their mail, are not responsible for the actions of those people.')
