From what I’ve seen V takes a similar route as Nim’s recent ORC feature (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;destructors.html#move-semantics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;destructors.html#move-semantics</a>), which automatically inserts destructor calls using move semantics. The question is, is there a similar move semantic model in V akin to C++ and Nim, or does it work in a totally different way? This wasn’t clear when reading the documentation, which made me a bit skeptical about it.')
