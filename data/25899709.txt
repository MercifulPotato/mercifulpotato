Once I let the environment &quot;spill&quot; outside of the terminal emulator, it&#x27;ll be hard to draw the line on where to stop... and it&#x27;ll be hard to reconcile that functionality with the command line version. (For example, right now, the editor on the web shows a status bar within the terminal, not outside.)<p>By the way: replying back to your original post because I did not see that earlier. The idea to have a command line vs. an editor you can easily switch to came from Borland Sidekick Plus. I used to use that back in the day on an 8086 to write Clipper code, and toggling between DOS and the resident editor was very cool.')
