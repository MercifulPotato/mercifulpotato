It would have been a disaster for a lot of the local restaurants, economically.<p>IIRC, two days after the flood the road was back in order. It certainly didn&#x27;t take more than a week.<p>Obviously, inventing a new vaccine is orders of magnitude more complex than fixing a road, but I think this aspect of human nature still applies.')
