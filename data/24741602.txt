I kept it that way for a couple weeks, until my nervous system was rewired, and turned it back into a layer key.<p>These days, the remaining problem is that I&#x27;ve moved a few &#x27;glyph&#x27; keys, so when I&#x27;m on the laptop my fingers go to the wrong place when I try to type e.g. &quot;-&quot;. It&#x27;s like I have two modes with substantial overlap, and sometimes it takes awhile to switch to the laptop mode.<p>Not the end of the world, and more than made up for by the convenience and ergonomics of the Ergodox.<p>Edit to add: from this and other reports, it&#x27;s clear that for some people, the ortholinear layout requires substantial adjustment. I wasn&#x27;t one of those people, it was a rapid accommodation and I don&#x27;t consciously notice switching between ortholinear and staggered. It would be nice if there were a way for people to guess which category they&#x27;re in, before shelling out $300 and change on a keyboard!')
