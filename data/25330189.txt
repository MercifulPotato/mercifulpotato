I was in similar state twice and neither time I would be eager explain that to someone external.<p>I was &quot;afraid&quot; to commit in a team where code review evolved into huge micro-management with inconsistent requirements on what good code looks like. The reviewer iteratively forced you to change it again and again each time with &quot;this is bad code cant go in&quot; comments. But you could not learn what he considers good code, cause it was different every time. I left after.<p>Second time I was &quot;afraid&quot; to commit to part of code when our main architect had completely disproportionate blow up over previous bug. I made easy to fix bug which was my mistake. But it turned into massive public blow up over work being shitty, us intentionally ignoring his needs, there being tons of bug unusable version (there was literally one bug). Then he wanted massive refactoring to avoid possibility of same bug ... and I made bug in refactoring which led to same blow out, again claiming it was done without care etc.<p>After that, I really did not wanted to do any changes in that code. I cant guarantee complete lack of bugs in my code. Other people do bugs too for that matter, I dont think I make so much more of them. But, he was under pressure and stress that had nothing to do with me and I became rod for that.')
