What makes it <i>seem</i> difficult to get passage of particular amendments that particular special interest groups have proposed is that there is <i>not</i> general agreement that they are needed. And in that situation, the amendment should not be passed--and that&#x27;s exactly how the Founders set things up. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> they required a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress to send an amendment to the States for ratification, and three-fourths of the States to ratify it in order to have it in force.<p><i>&gt; The most recent Amendment took 202 years to ratify</i><p>That was an anomaly; no other amendment has taken anything close to that long. And that particular one probably could have been passed sooner, except that once it got left out of the original Bill of Rights, it was forgotten.')
