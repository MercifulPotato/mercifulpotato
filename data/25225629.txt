With business degrees.<p>this also happens in software companies i feel.<p>The underlying issue, i suspect, is that engineers are not &quot;people persons&quot; - less able to manoeuvre politically, and &quot;play the game&quot;. But in any societal organization, those who can play the political game can win.<p>Thus, the dedicated managers end up in those positions. They play the political game, and they get rewarded for it - because they control the reward scheme when they get to those high positions.<p>Meritocracy is an illusion that gets used by those playing a political game to make engineers feel they are not part of the game.')
