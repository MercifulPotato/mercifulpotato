Item(by='ketamine__', descendants=None, kids=[25740453], score=None, time=1610410303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739845, text='&gt; Ordinary Americans understand the First Amendment better than the elites do. Users who say Facebook, Twitter and Google are violating their constitutional rights are right. Aggrieved plaintiffs should sue these companies now to protect the voice of every American—and our constitutional democracy.<p>Does anyone find it amusing that Facebook and Twitter, which are basically venues for cheap entertainment, are now considered an important part of democracy by this author? If both these sites didn&#x27;t exist people would go to Reuters, NYT, Imgur, etc directly. And nothing of value would be lost.<p>&gt; Suppression of dissent breeds terror. The answer to last week’s horror should be to open more channels of dialogue, not to close them off. If disaffected Americans no longer have an outlet to be heard, the siege of Capitol Hill will look like a friendly parley compared with what’s to come.<p>What did domestic terrorists like Timothy McVeigh do before Facebook and Twitter? They killed people.<p>&gt; Liberals should worry too. If big tech can shut down the president, what stops them from doing the same to Joe Biden if he backs antitrust suits against social-media companies? Our Framers deeply understood the need for checks and balances in government. They couldn’t anticipate the rise of a new Leviathan with unchecked power to make extraconstitutional political judgments under the mantle of private enterprise.<p>That&#x27;s fine if a website doesn&#x27;t want to feature Biden. The framers couldn&#x27;t even imagine the amount of media exposure that politicians have achieved from the internet.')
