You just 3D print steel ones.<p>You use the metal sintering printer to deposit the metal.  Then you use an in-envelope milling head to polish it.<p>The cooling can be conformal since the shape isn&#x27;t limited by milling technology.  And, since molds have a lead time of <i>at least</i> 6 weeks (and generally worse because something <i>always</i> goes wrong), speed isn&#x27;t the issue.<p>There was a good talk at Molding 2018 by the CEO of a Silicon Valley medical prototyping company about how his folks simply won&#x27;t deal with conventional molds anymore and he has bought 3 of the 3D metal printers with in-envelope milling heads.<p>Unfortunately, the Molding conference website is a dumpster fire for useful technical information.  If I can remember the name of the company, I&#x27;ll reply.')
