Let&#x27;s say I know you&#x27;re cheating on your partner: I can tell the partner, and that&#x27;s legally fine. But if I say &quot;I&#x27;m going to tell the partner if you don&#x27;t pay me $7500&quot; then that is not fine, even though the first action is legitimate. Coercion really is quite a bit about the second part as well.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this rule would cover all coercion&#x2F;blackmail, but a rule like the following is probably a good guideline: If the first part negatively impacts the &quot;victim&quot; while the second part positively impacts the other person, it&#x27;s might be getting close to coercion territory.<p>Let&#x27;s take your cake example: The person with the cake isn&#x27;t really negatively impacted. If they don&#x27;t like the cake, they aren&#x27;t materially harmed by someone else eating it. Although even there, context matters: Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a baker, and you sell cakes, even ones that you don&#x27;t like yourself (maybe you hate buttercream icing). Taking your cake and eating it when you might otherwise have sold the cake and made money would be a problem.')
