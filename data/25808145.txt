Not just in this post. Americans in general seems to spend a lot of time telling everybody how great they and&#x2F;or their team and&#x2F;or their country is and how hard working they are etc. independently of reality. Trump is a perfect example of this. You could almost call Trump the personification of American culture pushed to the extreme.')
