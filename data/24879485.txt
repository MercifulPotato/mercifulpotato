YouTube requires the video to be on-screen or it stops playing, which makes it completely useless for listening to things.  Other video sites are much better for this.<p>(I don&#x27;t need advice on how to get around this thanks, I already know how to.  But that&#x27;s another of YouTube&#x27;s crappy standard behaviours.)')
