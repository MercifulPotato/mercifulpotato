More weirdly, in her account of the story, the &quot;back-and-forth&quot; came from, tada... HR department, which is super weird.<p>Look, I am not necessarily picking her side in the more general story, but it is apparent this paper submission story in isolation is super weird. It seems feasible that she was in the queue for getting the axe having engaged in prior fights with the company (some mention of threat of lawsuit, etc).  I also acknowledge the account of story from her side was quite cherry-picked and actively strategic, if not deceitful, and it does not even seem that Jeff was a direct player in this saga. Looks the highest level person in the loop was Megan, not Jeff, and Jeff is simply dragged into the mix for the opportunity to throw a punch at his reputation.  That, however, does not minimize the weirdness of putting the whole thing on this two-week paper submission policy.')
