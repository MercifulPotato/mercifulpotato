In these sorts of situations the burden of proof is on the accuser and you aren&#x27;t even close to that standard.<p>Let&#x27;s just pick &quot;video showing dead people voting&quot; from above. It ignores the fact that two different people can have the same name. And often this happens in the same family with people living at the same address. In an election with over 150M votes cast, there is every reason to believe there would be plenty of instances of daughters with the same names as their dead mothers casting votes. There&#x27;s no evidence that this isn&#x27;t what happened here.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Trump and his associates brought a lot of the so called &quot;evidence&quot; to court and were nearly laughed out of court almost every single time.')
