There is a huge incentive to produce papers in the modern medical system, and I&#x27;m in a good place to know that you can make the data say whatever you want with techniques such as meta analysis, which incidentally is a big part of Cochrane studies. Meta analysis as a field has grown trendemously because who doesn&#x27;t want to publish high impact papers without having to gather any new data, right? Publication of end-to-end single-command build reproducible research should be the only one allowed at this point, with everything accessible to the reader, including data. I&#x27;ve been doing shit medical science for ten years already because of hierarchical pressure, and I&#x27;d love a change of course.')
