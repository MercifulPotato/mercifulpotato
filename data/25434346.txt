It isn&#x27;t a big issue in practice, however; you can update markup from HTML to Markdown along with your other changes.<p>* As a recent-past engineer on the Windows team, I have a rather lower opinion of Windows API docs than you. :) The Windows developer platform has not had enough dedicated technical writers for years; our developer content teams are mainly editors of engineer- and PM-written original docs, which can lead to API doc sets with badly written pages, important missing information, or references to Windows-internal developer tools. I tried to channel my frustrations into correcting and extending my coworkers&#x27; writings, or into gently asking them to fix their omissions when I didn&#x27;t have the free time to spend on the needed research.')
