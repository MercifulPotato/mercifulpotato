Item(by='Grimm1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605974937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25168859, text='I&#x27;m in a studio apartment with every distraction I could possibly imagine (most of my own design since before this I&#x27;d just come here just to rest and recharge) the first few months were rough and overall I really prefer the office. The only thing working from home has done for me in terms of work is give me some more flexibility and prepared me for how to block out the distractions for when I move on to my own thing full time next week but I can count on my hand the number of times I&#x27;ve been in flow since the pandemic and work from home started and that is significantly less frequent then in an environment where work is the primary objective.<p>It&#x27;s really very jarring and I&#x27;ve resulted to some newer&#x2F;crazier things to get it back. For instance I work in VR often now and that blocking out the distractions&#x2F;tricking my brain in to &quot;being in&quot; a work place is really great. I also have a different seat for when I&#x27;m working on the day job versus my startup vs relaxing. Finally I stopped listening to music recently as I&#x27;ve read it actually can hurt focus and that&#x27;s been working too.<p>The thing is at least with my current job the office space was really comfortable, I&#x27;d move around often between couches and private spaces as needed people wouldn&#x27;t interrupt too often and I would go out for lunch to give myself a mental break. Still figuring out the mental break part again.')
