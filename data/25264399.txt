You&#x27;re still limited to WhatsApp&#x27;s &quot;one device per account&quot; policy, but that&#x27;s more of a WhatsApp issue than a Windows issue.<p>As for the Tuya thermostat, the terrible IoT landscape is to blame here, not MS. With IPv6 support any device in your home can be controlled by any device you own, except that IoT manufacturers are not capable of securing their devices and would much rather pull everything to their own private little cloud, letting them permanently pull the plug on their old hardware whenever they feel like it. There&#x27;s very little preventing Tuya from making a Windows application, but they just choose not to.<p>I can make Telegram calls from any device with a microphone and&#x2F;or camera just fine and there are plenty of IoT devices that can show a web interface to control the heat. It&#x27;s all about the vendors you choose. The Windows&#x2F;PC ecosystem has nothing to do with vendors&#x27; mediocre design decisions.')
