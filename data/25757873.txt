He foresaw the assault on institutions and warned that ideas carried by the Republican party and supported by them will tear the country apart.<p>And it happened in less than 4 years of trump rule.<p>Make no mistake, the country is torn apart for sure. Radical and in-human ideas have caught on and will become mainstream. The republic is on the road to crash and burn because the rot is spreading into regular public discourse, and so far, the democrats are losing.<p>It will not be long before a charismatic one, with deep seated ideas, sugar coated with good intentions will take power and slowly work the system from within.<p>Heck, trump did it overtly, and Republicans are still defending him.<p>To put it raw, the republicans are defending the idea that violent seditious insurrection activities and storming of the capitol do not warrant a strong punishment.<p>Its a sad coming decade for America, and the rest of the world.')
