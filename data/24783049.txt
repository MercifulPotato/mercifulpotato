The challenge is that those metaphors take a long time to create and are fragile. A new need arises or the paradigm shifts and all that equity evaporates.<p>In the early 2000&#x27;s there were promises that we were on the verge of graphical programming. Environments where anyone could stitch programs together visually. They turned out to be more trouble than they were worth. Anything sufficiently complicated needed a proficient software engineer. That engineer inevitably did away with cumbersome graphical tool preferring to just write the code. The tasks that non-software engineers were able to work were of questionable value to begin with.<p>Personally I prefer the patchwork.
