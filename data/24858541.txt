Same for my neighborhood or city block.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s also a tragically regressive tax. Wealthy families that regularly travel to Miami or New York don&#x27;t suffer much from it -- they just buy their electronics there. They may even make some money by bringing some home and selling the goods for much more than they paid.<p>If you&#x27;re poor and you need to buy a laptop or phone on your meager salary, you&#x27;re screwed.')
