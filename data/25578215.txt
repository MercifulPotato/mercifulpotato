Just seeing how everyone reacts looking at and seeing how absolutely fucking insane it is to have the FBI and their powers in a building named &quot;J Edgar Hoover&quot;<p>Someone said the fbi reformed since those days of criminality. Why would anyone believe that while they continue to celebrate J Edgar Hoover. While they go to work to protect the rule of law to a building named J. Edgar Hoover. Why would any judge take the word of any FBI agent when they&#x27;ve covered up criminal behaviour, and performed it and lied about it instead of arresting J. Edgar Hoover the first second they became aware of what he was?<p>They said they weren&#x27;t criminals when Hoover was in charge. They lied. They continue to exult Hoover while claiming they aren&#x27;t criminals anymore. Who actually isn&#x27;t feeling sick at the idea of believing that? Hoover is the biggest FBI hero. A vicious criminal thug running the FBI as a criminal conspiracy is the FBI&#x27;s biggest hero. Says so right there on their HQ.<p>It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s impossible to get your head around. 30 years ago. No sign of it changing?<p>The FBI flagrantly advertise their lack of respect for the rule of law. That&#x27;s on all of us.')
