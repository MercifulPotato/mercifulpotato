On the one hand from a broadcasting perspective, I&#x27;ve found that freeing as there&#x27;s less to worry about. You just pick up the phone call and start talking and don&#x27;t think about everything else. But we do want to improve audio quality, so expect more options here going forward including web broadcasting!<p>Then, on recordings: When you wrap up a broadcast (which happens in Capiche when you hang up the phone after live streaming), you can download an mp3 of your call, or can go back and download it again anytime later. So you never have to think about recording, and can still always have a full copy of everything you broadcast.<p>Email anytime if you have any more ideas here!')
