The phrase &quot;internal business&quot; isn&#x27;t thoroughly fleshed out in the terms. But at the same time, that phrase remains very common in professionally drafted commercial software licenses to this day. It&#x27;s the flip side of prohibitions on &quot;service bureau&quot; use, which go back decades. Lawyers are used to seeing it.<p>Simple familiarity explains a lot of why &quot;noncommercial&quot; full stop irks more than &quot;internal business&quot; full stop. But I&#x27;m not sure fleshing out &quot;internal business&quot; in the PolyForm Internal Use license would work any practical improvement, either.<p>Historically, the perceived vagueness of &quot;noncommercial&quot; prevented adoption by a lot of institutions, even academic institutions, who are mostly noncommercial but occasionally do commercial or arguably commercial things. To avoid that holdup, PolyForm&#x27;s Noncommercial form fleshes &quot;noncommercial&quot; out, not by defining &quot;noncommercial&quot;, but by green-lighting a list of specific kinds of institutions. I don&#x27;t think the Internal Use license has the same institutional-acceptance problem.<p>I&#x27;m affiliated with PolyForm, but don&#x27;t speak for it here.')
