Not even a little bit. Why? Anyone who actually has a motive (like a company trying to make money) should be kept far away from the regulators that oversee the study, and the whole point of double blind trials is to keep self interested bias away from the result of a study where lives are literally at stake.<p>Isn&#x27;t the point of a clinical intervention to save lives? Either the intervention saves lives or it doesn&#x27;t. The researchers should be selected from people who can maintain a neutral viewpoint. If that is impossible their neutrality should still be maximized and biases should be eliminated as much as humanly possible.<p>Simply accepting that bias as a matter of course is imo the worst way to approach it.')
