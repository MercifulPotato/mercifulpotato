There are major farms operating on a completely different scale for mass staple crops, and bless them because it&#x27;s an efficient backbone to a lot of our core foods. But I don&#x27;t think the continued existence of small farms is <i>that</i> obscure either is it? This is now 3 year old (2017) data [0], and the last few years have been hard.

Average size just 450 or so acres and even that is skewed up by the few percent of enormous farms.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just kind of fascinated the first few comments on something like this would be about it being &quot;hobbyist&quot;. Anything that could lower operating costs and externalities for small farms also deserves a bit more positive attention.<p>-----<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usfarmdata.com&#x2F;percentage-of-small-medium-and-large-farms-in-the-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usfarmdata.com&#x2F;percentage-of-small-medium-and-la...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nass.usda.gov&#x2F;Publications&#x2F;Highlights&#x2F;2016&#x2F;SmallFamilyFarms.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nass.usda.gov&#x2F;Publications&#x2F;Highlights&#x2F;2016&#x2F;Small...</a>')
