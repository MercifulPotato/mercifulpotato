Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610454303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737611, text='One should set both ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings on ssh to a reasonably small time (e.g. 1 min or 5 min). Note that there&#x27;s another setting {Server,Client}AliveCountMax which multiplies this to find the actual &quot;connection is dead&quot; determination time.<p>The tradeoff is between a network disconnect-reconnect killing your connection when it shouldn&#x27;t (because you&#x27;ve noticed the disconnect but you wouldn&#x27;t if you didn&#x27;t send heartbeats), and discovering the network disconnect or dead peer (which you wouldn&#x27;t if you didn&#x27;t send anything, thinking it&#x27;s still there).<p>Personally, I prefer to know the connection is dead sooner than later even if it comes back on its own.')
