I went though my childhood actively angry and embarassed every time somebody was told about my disability and wished for it to stop.  Disabled people don&#x27;t nessecarily have a choice in being portrayed as a victim that choice is thrust upon them my the medical establishment and if you don&#x27;t want to be treated as a victim you have to jump through hoops to mask your victim status.  It&#x27;s not like all disabled people in the first world were on Tumblr and went &quot;You know what - I feel kind of bipolar&quot; and that was their identity from then on.<p>I hate this question BECAUSE it pressures me into admitting I have a disability, that I&#x27;m a &quot;victim&quot;, when I would rather not do that.  Victimhood doesn&#x27;t get you ahead in the first world either - that&#x27;s why so many disabled people react negatively to this question - because it makes others see you as either a victim (if you say yes) or a liar (if you say no).  Just listen to how you perceive disabled people in the first world - in my situation wouldn&#x27;t I have every incentive to hide my diagnosis from you to hide that fact from somebody like you so you didn&#x27;t see me as a whiner taking advantage of sympathy for disabled people to seem cool?<p>P.S. The first world is seeing self-reported depression and suicide rising simultaneously.  Certainly some people think it&#x27;s cool to be depressed, but maybe more is going on than westerners becoming image obsessed given people are killing themselves more and more.')
