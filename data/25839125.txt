Goes from first-order logic to peano arithmetic to a model of x86 to a model of the verifier written in x86. Interestingly, it demonstrates that verification of a compact proof can be performed in linear time (!) if the proof is structured correctly. -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digama0&#x2F;mm0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digama0&#x2F;mm0</a><p>The fact that proof checking can take linear time (though not proof-finding), and the fact that it incorporates so many &#x27;layers&#x27; has emboldened my opinion that such a thing as I described above is possible and has enormous potential.')
