We have a standard height for headlights in cars because we tried a bunch of different ones and found one that worked best. Without that experimentation, how can you arrive at a standard? If regulations inhibit the ability to experiment in fields where there is not yet a defined standard, we will not be able to reach one, or we will pick one arbitrarily that may not be the best and we will have no mechanism available to find a better one.')
