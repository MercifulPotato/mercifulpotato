CDC guidance[1] is to isolate if you have a positive test OR if you have symptoms.<p>To do otherwise is to gamble with the health and lives of the people they meet, and the people those people meet, and so on. It may prove almost impossible to show who caught COVID from whom, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that ignoring guidance won&#x27;t lead to deaths. A statistical death is still the death of a real person, even if we can&#x27;t put a name to them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;if-you-are-sick&#x2F;isolation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;if-you-are-sick&#x2F;is...</a>')
