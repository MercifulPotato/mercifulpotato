Other FAANGs might be different.<p>I&#x27;ve had candidates ask me why we do this, and my answer is that once you&#x27;re in the company, transferring to another job on the same ladder is fairly trivial and requires no technical re-interviews.<p>I go on to describe how I&#x27;ve been around for 10 years and am on my 5th team. None of those transfers required any sort of technical re-check. Teams trust me when I say what my abilities are.<p>Sometimes they&#x27;ll look at past CLs, and we certainly have a couple interviews to make sure that the fit is good, but nothing technical.<p>In none of my positions has it been &quot;crank out the code, pass it off, then on to the next piece&quot;.
