It forces one to pay attention rather than daydream and ignore the content entirely. It would be less tiresome, of course, to just pay attention and not take notes, but it does serve that purpose.<p>Another purpose for note taking is to pass the notes on to someone not present during the class&#x2F;lecture&#x2F;talk. For example: I was paid to take notes for others in college.<p>Another use for notes is to look back on the notes and verify that you have effectively absorbed the material; studying portions that you don&#x27;t understand fully.<p>The article is far too dismissive on the value of plain note taking.')
