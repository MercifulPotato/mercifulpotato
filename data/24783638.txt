Their progress, as you say, is spotty and individual. Personally, the ones that have made an effort to improve themselves mentally have been the most successful to any degree. When it comes to memory, saying that you just have a bad one will likely let it remain as such. Working on memory will help, if slowly or at all. Things like notepads, journaling, meeting notes, and a &#x27;no excuses&#x27; attitude were key methods to friends that made progress.<p>But, as you say, the brain is awfully murky and nature kinda has to take her course. Nothing is likely to stitch back together the neurons that were lost. However, the brain is awfully murky, and there seems to be nothing stopping it from rewiring the neurons that are left.<p>Best of luck!')
