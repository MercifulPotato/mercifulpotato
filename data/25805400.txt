However, you are welcome to enlighten me on well supported arguments against vaccine safety. You can&#x27;t just tell me that I&#x27;m throwing up strawman, then make 0 actual arguments except &quot;I&#x27;m not doing enough research&quot;. If you are asking me to doubt vaccine safety on no data except some vague claims on there being &quot;less extreme&quot; positions, then I would argue you are spreading misinformation; especially when there are decades of research showing the safety otherwise.')
