I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well past 99% and will only improve: it correctly handled the sentence &quot;voice transcription is approximately as robust as stenography&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t make the sentence <i>true</i> but is suggestive.<p>I guess my point was that it&#x27;s easy to recognize that voice transcription is &#x27;not typing&#x27;, and stenography just isn&#x27;t typing in the same way: there&#x27;s software between the actual transcript and the final, legible text, which lets it be faster.<p>Steno would be pretty useless for me as a coder, though I do use snippets, which are kind of the same thing if you squint.')
