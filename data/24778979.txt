In this setup, it is key that you have a resume where a machine can identify that you have 80% of what the company is looking for&quot;.<p>I talked with the recruiter I quoted later on, and while they think <i>eventually</i> the industry will go towards having more automation, she also confirmed she did not see any automation like this, today.
