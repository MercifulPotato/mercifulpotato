It&#x27;s definitely harder in terms of &quot;discoverability&quot; to connect with people you enjoy spending time with.<p>But over time that difficulty lessened. I found the connections I made outside of Facebook were longer lasting and more meaningful, because there was actually some onus on me to try and stay engaged. And people do respond well when you demonstrate you care to engage in a deeper fashion. It feels like relationship building &#x2F; maintenance in today&#x27;s age is something of a lost art, because it&#x27;s become so easy to superficially connect without putting in a bunch of work.<p>The big social platforms make you want to believe there&#x27;s a monopoly on societal participation.
