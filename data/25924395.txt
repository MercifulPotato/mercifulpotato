A person playing violin would tend to naturally migrate to JI voicings of intervals whether they&#x27;re consciously doing it or not. So, a tool that tells you whether you&#x27;re &quot;in tune&quot; or not should ideally not tell someone they&#x27;re out-of-tune when if they play in perfect JI.<p>On the other hand, if the goal is to just be in the general ballpark and accuracy of +&#x2F;- 15 cents or so is just rounding error, then ET is probably fine.  (My own violin skills are pretty rudimentary, so ET would be good enough.  But if I were better I&#x27;d probably want a JI tuner.)')
