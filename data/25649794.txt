They&#x27;re both lying in a plausibly deniable manner in order to market something to the public.  Anyone who bothers to verify either claim will find it&#x27;s all crap.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the research.  It&#x27;s that we blindly trust &quot;the research&quot; and people know this so the research gets manipulated and cherry picked and whatnot.  Two hundred years ago these sorts of people and entities all invoked gods name in order to peddle crap.  I have no idea what the solution is but I think whatever it is will involve the public being more disapproving of parties that behave in a slimy manner like this.')
