Do you know what those people worked on? I&#x27;ve read a lot of things in the past that strongly suggest Palantir helps configure there systems for specific use cases, including the &quot;killing people&quot; ones mentioned in the article - is this erroneous? Is there no customer-specific configuration and assistance and help with whatever goals the customer has in mind?')
