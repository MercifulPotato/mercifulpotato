Even though I agree the Fediverse is better, it&#x27;s useful to ask that question.<p>There seems to be a gap in the understanding around what the internet is and what it&#x27;s for, and the gap is a social one around the concepts of the Private and Public spheres. I use caps for them because they are ancient, named concepts (look up &quot;polis and oikos,&quot; the private sphere wiki page has been vandalized). The 90&#x27;s internet was initially an extension of, and a bridge between Private spheres of individual thought, competence, family, niche communities of interest, and preserved this with conventions around both anonymity and tribal, benevolent-dictator style governance.<p>The Fediverse seems to replicate some of that, but to me it still seems like an anti social media reaction technology and not one that grows organically from a higher-order use case.<p>Social media was the act of hauling out these Private sphere relationships into a Public sphere, for which they were not adapted, and to satisfy the infinite vaccuum of need for attention that defines the Public. The Public sphere has always necessarily fed on the Private, and the Private used the Public for its civilizing social benefits. I&#x27;d go so far as to say that the insanity of the Public sphere right now is the direct result of scarcity of Private sphere culture to sustain it and it&#x27;s cannibalizing itself.<p>Viewed through this broader lens, the Fediverse doesn&#x27;t need social media features, it needs a Private sphere purpose for people to create and build things together, and then it can be more careful in adding bridges to the Public sphere.<p>Anyway, abstract comment, but the question shouldn&#x27;t be whether the Fediverse is an adequate social media replacement, it should be, &quot;what are we going to make?&quot;')
