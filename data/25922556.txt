Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[25923098, 25922590, 25923034], score=None, time=1611705861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25918592, text='&gt; const r = Math.pow(2.0, 1.0 &#x2F; 12.0);<p>It looks like the app uses 12-tone equal temperament as the standard for &quot;in tune&quot;.  For violin it would probably be better to use a just intonation scale as the reference rather than ET.  (ET major and minor thirds and sixths differ from just by about 15 cents.)  Even better would be to be able to toggle between JI and ET.<p>A pretty good 12-tone just scale is to use 1:1, 9:8, 16:15, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 45:32, 3:2, 8:5, 5:3, 9:5, 15:9, and 2:1 is the octave.  (Multiply the ratio by the frequency of whatever your root note is.)  Though notably on a violin you run into a complication with the open E string. If the G string is 1:1 and the strings are all tuned in fifths, they&#x27;re 1:1, 3:2, 9:4, and 27:8.  27:8 is octave-equivalent to the pythagorean major sixth 27:16 rather than the simpler 5:3 major sixth that goes better with the rest of the scale.  So, if you go with a just scale there&#x27;s a potential for people to be confused about why their open E string seems to be out of tune (and the answer is that unless they&#x27;re deliberately trying to play a pythagorean major sixth it probably is).')
