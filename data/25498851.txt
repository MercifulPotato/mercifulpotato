Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608580829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493476, text='&gt; I wonder whether GPUs would be more cost-efficient and feasible for this rendering task.<p>GPUs are a superior computer for raytracing calculations. But...<p>CPUs have the software advantage: decades of engineering effort have been poured into CPU-renderers. While we&#x27;re at the point where GPU-rendering is starting to become a thing, it will inevitably take decades of engineering to recreate all of those features on the GPU.<p>One important GPU specific problem is the shortage of RAM: CPUs always have more RAM available (even if that CPU-RAM is much much slower). Teaming up the CPU + GPU to handle the RAM problem for large scenes is going to take significant effort. The general ideas are known in research papers and whatever, but not really ported to the actual tools yet. Disney&#x27;s Moana dataset is known to take ~100GBs of geometry data &#x2F; textures &#x2F; animations. But there&#x27;s no GPU on the planet that can hold all that data. So you&#x27;d have to make a CPU+GPU team to take on that problem.')
