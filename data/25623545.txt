Haskell is cool if you want to think about or play with ideas. Clojure is cool ideas, and can still be productive in (ie full modern library support).<p>As well if you don&#x27;t know, F# falls into that same bucked of cool ideas, better than your avg imperative language and can still be very productive due to language and .net library.<p>We&#x27;re trending to a point where any non-systems language is just an exploratory language unless it&#x27;s build on JVM or .Net.<p>Otherwise the produvtivity loss from lack of libraries is almost impossible to overcome from any possible produvtivity gains from the language.')
