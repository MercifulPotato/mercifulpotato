The only <i>standards conforming</i> way (prior to `std::bit_cast`[0] in C++20) was to use `memcpy`.[a] `reinterpret_cast` was added for situations where code you have no control over requires a certain type, but you need to force it to take your variable.[b]<p>[a]: As `memcpy` (in addition to reinterpreting bits) <i>copies</i> the bits (although a compiler will most likely optimize it out), it doesn’t violate aliasing rules.<p>[b]: This also requires that the code you give your kludged variable to not read out those bits as what it thinks it is (because aliasing). Kindof pointless because: what’s the point of passing a variable that’s never read?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;numeric&#x2F;bit_cast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;numeric&#x2F;bit_cast</a>')
