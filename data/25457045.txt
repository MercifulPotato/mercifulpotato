I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here though. I like to pose the following thought experiment to people who like driving fancy cars: if your car looked like an old honda civic from the outside but had all the bells and whistles and looked stunning from the inside, would you still want it? The point of the experiment is to show that a nontrivial part of the reason why people drive fancy cars is the signal that it sends to other people. Similarly here, if there was a mechanism to improve a company from within that was anonymous so that you wouldn&#x27;t get any credit whatsoever for it&#x27;s improvement, would they use it? It&#x27;s human nature to want credit, so I wouldn&#x27;t blame people for not wanting to use it, but let&#x27;s be honest about there being a nontrivial part to all of this that is founded in virtue signaling and in-group&#x2F;out-group tribalism).')
