Freedom of speech is very important to me, but I believe there&#x27;s a big difference between an indivual speaking from their heart, and a corporation spewing nonsense.<p>Edit: To be clear, I don&#x27;t think the solution is to silence an entity&#x27;s publications. They do have the right to speak, but when they make unfounded accusations they shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when they get sued to kindom come. We all have the right to speak, but the rest of us also have the right to defend ourselves and kick your fucking ass if you&#x27;ve misrepresented us with your speech in a public way, because that&#x27;s libel.')
