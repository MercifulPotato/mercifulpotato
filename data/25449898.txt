Evidence to the contrary is disregarded, and the lack of supporting evidence is used as additional evidence (&#x27;the real evidence is being hidden by those in power&#x27;).<p>What I see in these documents, and based on responses, is that the case is strong.  I do see that it is from states that disagree with me philosophically and politically.  This information is irrelevant and is categorization error and outgroup bias; the same things that I would request my current political opposition to give up, without success.<p>If we all suffer from these cognitive illusions and refuse to abandon them, then we cannot grow as a society or a people; we can never have a shared understanding because the experiences I am basing decisions on are not a real.<p>Discussing a &quot;Vast right-wing conspiracy against Google&quot; might be falsifiable with perfect information, but what percentage of &#x27;right wing&#x27; conspirators must there be before it is determined true?  How many &#x27;right-wing&#x27; members - of which there are at least 74M - would I have to poll to find out if the conspiracy is vast?<p>I don&#x27;t deny that we are in an [mis]information war, but the boundaries of that are much better known and are often discussed by security experts.')
