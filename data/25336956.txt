If you&#x27;re getting paid 140k, but your rent is 5k a month, you&#x27;re only capturing 80k of wages, and the landlords are capturing 60k in rent.<p>If you&#x27;re working remotely for 100k, and paying 1.7k a month in rent, you&#x27;re capturing ~80k as well. That means more capital is going to the employers(who saves 40k) at the expense of the landlords (who lose out on that 40k).<p>I honestly think I&#x27;d rather have the capital go to the employers because a) it improves my value in relation to them (I now can argue that I should get paid more, because I bring in 40k a year more value than I did in SV) AND I have a financial interest in the company doing well (with options&#x2F;RSUs&#x2F;bonuses&#x2F;etc).<p>The money going to the landlords starts to become very literally &quot;rent seeking&quot; where they will capture the capital without providing any productivity gains in return. You could argue that their value in &quot;provide a location for people to live so they can collaborate more effectively&quot; is decreasing with remote work, and they will have to charge less because the value they provide is decreasing.')
