It was a desktop environment targeted for GNUstep and programmed in Objective-C that tried to rethink a few fundamental concepts of the Desktop Environments available at the time (~10 years ago). Among them, proper file versioning for <i>everything</i>, seamless app interoperability and data sharing,  etc.<p>Sadly, the developers never managed to go beyond a few core libraries and a nice theme (the GUI used GNUstep under the hood). I followed the development with great interest till they stopped updating the site; I believe that the effort would have required many more developers. What a pity!<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;etoileos.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;etoileos.com&#x2F;</a>')
