One could oppose it, on the grounds that people should be able to make up their own minds as to whether somebody is competent to perform surgery on them. Saying that a person can&#x27;t call themselves a medical doctor is just denying them freedom of speech! Who is the government to come between private parties! Etc, etc.<p>But in practice that would lead to incredible harm for little gain. I think individual freedom is an important value, but not the only one, and that real-world concerns require balancing values.')
