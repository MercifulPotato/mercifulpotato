I&#x27;d obsessively look at my downloads, conversions, page views and what have you.<p>Earlier this week I had a revelation. What I was doing was in no way helping my work or the users - it was just bringing me down because I was comparing with all the people who had &quot;made it&quot; already. And feeling anxious about not getting overnight success.<p>Couple days I decided to stop that. For all those moments I&#x27;d rather read a book or play with the kids or listen to the wife. Feeling a bit better already to be honest, and interestingly somehow more... free.<p>I guess you can set out to find freedom but get trapped in pursuing it.')
