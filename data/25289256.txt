You just set the x,y,z coordinates and the engine does the hard work.<p>but setting x,y,z coordinates so that they do the kind of motion that you want is exactly where you need linear algebra.<p>Say you want to make a ball move in a spiral motion, how do you do that, from code, without students understanding algebra and basic operations like &quot;translation on a plane&quot; ?')
