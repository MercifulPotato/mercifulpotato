San Francisco for exampple, has doubled itâ€™s budget in 10 years with the population growing only 12%.    The California legislature keeps passing highly creative yet extreme anti wealth measures while massively increasing spending.<p>Can anyone say life in San Francisco has improved in the last decade? By any objective measure it&#x27;s far worse.  Not just for tech but for small business in particular- the regulation, taxes and cost of doing business in the state are oppressive.<p>Yet we want to enact more policies to drive out the tax base? Brilliant.  The top 1% of taxpayers supports half the budget of the state.  Instead of speeding this exodus up, why not enact real reform.  The state needs a revolution- a massive reset in spending from ground zero- not a bunch of new taxes that force even more companies out.')
