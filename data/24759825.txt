Whilst I understand the reasons and generally approve of our COVID-19 response, a side-effect is that any activities outside of 5km from one&#x27;s home have been banned for the last three months (and with about a two week break in the middle, effectively the last six months.) Riding a motorbike within that 5km radius is not considered exercise, which is otherwise permitted. Net result - no riding for me... :-(<p>I miss exactly what you&#x27;re describing. It&#x27;s amazing how much solo time on a bike clears my head!')
