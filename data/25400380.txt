Item(by='hintymad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607798251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398576, text='Both FB and Twitter censored the news about criminal investigation of Hunter Biden before the election, citing &quot;misinformation&quot;, &quot;disinformation&quot;, or simply &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. And now MSMs are reporting the same investigation, even citing emails from Hunter&#x27;s laptop. If this is not censorship, I don&#x27;t know what it is. Or, per the left here, censor is totally justified if we label a piece of information as hate speech, disinformation, or whatever amoral in the left&#x27;s eyes? As for facts or discourse, who cares, right?')
