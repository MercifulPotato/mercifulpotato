That&#x27;s a distraction. These patents are on the formulae (the data transforms) and their use <i>itself</i>. You&#x27;re on the right track pointing out that it would be ridiculous to patent the discrete Fourier transform.<p>These kind of mathematical discoveries should not be encumbered, they should be free for anyone to use and implement.')
