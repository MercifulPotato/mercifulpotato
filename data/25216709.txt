And have about 1&#x2F;3 of the equity in the cap table.  They are very fair and the other two founders are great. We are trying to go by the book and I’m just curious how it would work with cliffs and vesting if I have provided material support in the form of cash infusions while also working directly. I have been involved long before VCs got interested and feel it fair that I don’t have as much of a cliff and a shorter vesting schedule considering I provided plenty of moolah. But I also want to stay and help them grow as best I can. That said I don’t want to do anything to upset upcoming VC meetings. Any suggestions or anecdotes from others with more experience would be fantastic. Thanks a ton, and happy almost Turkey Day :)')
