Itâ€™s in a small rural, Pennsylvania farming town - pop 2000. Somehow we got an amazing math teacher turned CompSci  and he turned out world class students - we always ranked high enough each year to compete internationally in ACSL.<p>A few years back when the teacher retired, we all gathered together to thank him, including Pat! World-class guy, and makes us proud! So great to share a story with students, who come from nothing, how you can leave our hometown and eventually be the CEO of Intel.<p>Wishing Pat the best of luck in his new role!')
