Now I&#x27;m limiting myself to just Firefox &quot;recommended&quot; extensions, under the <i>hope</i> that Mozilla is doing <i>something</i> to make sure they stay aboveboard, and a few non-recommended ones that I just can&#x27;t live without, like Vimium.  I lost some functionality due to disabling extensions, but so be it.  The browser is far too important these days.<p>For my remaining non-recommended extensions, all of which are open source I think, I am considering some workflow where I just clone their repos and install the extensions locally, updating occasionally when I can review the resulting changes myself.<p>(It happens that I had disabled Nano Blocker in my purge months back.  FWIW it never seemed to work for me.  For those uninstalling, don&#x27;t forget to uninstall the extension, the block lists, and the uBlock advanced &quot;user resources&quot; file.)<p>EDIT: Just realized I can turn off automatic updates for just some Firefox add-ons, so I did that for a bunch of add-ons.  I&#x27;ll update them when something breaks and I have time to review what&#x27;s changing.')
