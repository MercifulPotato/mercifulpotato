Like, &quot;Company X may revoke your access to this content in situations where your account breaches the terms of service outlined [here], or if the original rights holders of the content force us to.&quot; Not even full ToS, just something to inform people that its possible.<p>And to be clear, there&#x27;s a massive swath of digital content that needs regulation like this. Amazon movies, Kindle books, Steam&#x2F;Xbox&#x2F;PSN digital games, iTunes music purchases (though in situations like this, I think the word &quot;Buy&quot; is valid given that you&#x27;re allowed a DRM-free download, but I think the popup should still be required with the language changed to read &quot;...may revoke your access to re-download this content...&quot;).')
