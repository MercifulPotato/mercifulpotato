People have been building very cool high availability embedded Linux projects using the Nerves framework.  It’s very good for certain types of concurrent programs.<p>It won’t take over HPC simulation any time soon, but most of us aren’t working at Sandia, Oak Ridge, etc.  Its great for systems that should naturally scale out but don’t map naturally to a GPU.  For systems that want to scale up but are forced to scale out due to frequency limits, it’s not as good as C++ written with uArch in mind.')
