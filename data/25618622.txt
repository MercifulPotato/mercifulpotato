Which may have been true at the time, but then Git added commit signing. Now if you sign a commit, no matter how strong of an algorithm you use, the commit object references a tree of files via SHA-1. Git is currently undergoing an extremely annoying migration to support new hash algorithms, which could have been avoided.<p>Also, BLAKE3 is faster than MD5 and also far more secure, so if you&#x27;re saying &quot;It&#x27;s okay I&#x27;m using MD5 because I want a faster hash and SHA-256 is too slow,&quot; there are options other than SHA-256.<p>If the thing you&#x27;re trying to hash really really isn&#x27;t cryptographic at all, you can do a lot <i>better</i> than MD5 in terms of performance by using something like xxHash or MurmurHash.<p>So, even if it isn&#x27;t a security vulnerability, using MD5 in a new design today (i.e., where there&#x27;s no requirement for compatibility with an old system that specified MD5) is a design flaw.')
