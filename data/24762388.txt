And run water through Your floors to heat or cool zones. It is one of the most efficient ways to heat a structure and feels good as well.<p>I think&#x2F;thought radiant cooling is still pretty &quot;experimental&quot;. I think in certain climates it can cause the pipes to &quot;sweat&quot; a lot.<p>If you want to see some ultra high-end stuff, you can check out this YouTube channel: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OrG7oG8Tvp8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OrG7oG8Tvp8</a><p>Here&#x27;s their video on radiant cooling (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rPC0_LxlwIY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rPC0_LxlwIY</a>).<p>Not sure how to word this - but my understanding is that the stuff on his channel is pretty cutting-edge. Most builders use older&#x2F;time tested materials and methods. You may get weird looks if you start asking your contractor about the things you see in his videos.<p>Also, everything is very climate specific. Mini-splits won&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re building a home in a very cold climate, etc. If you have the money, there are HVAC engineers that will do a way better job than a local installer. If you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d just check reviews and go with a HVAC contractor with a good reputation.')
