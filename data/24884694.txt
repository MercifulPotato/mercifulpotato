If you&#x27;re building something novel that solves a problem, other people trying to solve that problem will find you.<p>For example, I fantasized about being able to program and work in VR or AR in order to have an unlimited number of application windows around me in 3D space. So, I started by building an app for Android and iOS called VR Browser (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.vuplex.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.vuplex.com</a>). Then, I started receiving emails from companies asking if they could license my technology to embed web content in their own VR apps and video games. Now I run a profitable business selling that 3D web browser functionality as a family of plugins for the Unity game engine (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuplex.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuplex.com</a>). Now that I have found product market fit, I just listen to my customers and they basically tell me (in aggregate) what to build next.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;startupideas.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;startupideas.html</a>')
