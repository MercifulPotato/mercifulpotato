If the channel from Earth to probe is encrypted, you do not reveal your command protocol.<p>And, in all likelihood, there is either a common command protocol or a family of protocols for all Chinese spacecraft. Designing a brand new protocol for each class of spacecraft would be time consuming and add complexity to space operations.<p>It is easier to have just one command protocol, or just slight variations thereof, and use it for connection with all hardware out there.')
