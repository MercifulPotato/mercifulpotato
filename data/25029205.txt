After all, in a normal decade the majority political party changes at least once, in both the USA and the UK. With or without my action, I <i>really don&#x27;t</i> know who would win an election that was called right this instant in the UK; I really don&#x27;t know which side I&#x27;m supporting by not undertaking political activity right now. The default state of affairs without my action is not &quot;continue as we currently are indefinitely&quot;; the default is &quot;every few years, change the government&quot;!<p>I do vote; voting is the system we have collectively landed on for aggregating preferences across the population, and I do have preferences. But if I did not vote (and am therefore implicitly &quot;voting for&quot; the majority), I don&#x27;t see how that could be reasonably viewed as a political act, because I don&#x27;t know who I&#x27;m &quot;voting&quot; for as I do it!')
