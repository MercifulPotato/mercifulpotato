From what I remember, the lipo battery required for 16hrs w&#x2F; no display would be the same size as the already chunky module itself, requiring wristband integration. Better to have a quartz oven and fire up the CSAC only once per hour as a reference, still yielding one factor of 10 in precision.<p>All in all it&#x27;s better suited for a nice pocket watch with a 10MHz out connector. Any takers at 15k$+?')
