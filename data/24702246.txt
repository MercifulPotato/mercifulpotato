This is market research if you like.<p>What resonates with me is the sheer persistence of these learners in the face of the rediculous complexity.<p>I learned basic at &lt; 10 yo but there wasn’t much to it i the 80s on a home computer. No browsers. No closures. No NPM. No errors because “Yer on Windows”.<p>You have people doing freecodecamp pushing arch other along, many self taught getting complex apps working with React. Starting from no experience.<p>So yes keep on going when you hit a wall, struggle through it, and the next thing, and same shit for the job interviews.<p>Persistence and a love of learning are essential and it’s horrible working with coders that don’t have this trait.<p>Also:<p>* team work<p>* emotional intelligence<p>* testing and quality<p>* understanding the business impact<p>* humility - it’s a skill!<p>* estimation<p>* pushing back<p>* job interview skills<p>* career strategy (I suck at!)<p>* going wide and learning lots of things<p>* going deep in some things<p>* communication<p>* inquisitiveness<p>* getting things done &#x2F; staving off perfectionism<p>* some ui&#x2F;ux awareness<p>* cloud architecture basics or sys admin basics<p>* and that’s not all! Etc. etc.<p>All of which you’ll definitely learn on the job so no need to stress :-)')
