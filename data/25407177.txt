That&#x27;s them implementing the PSD2 regulation [1], and they should have emailed you quite a few times about it.<p>But yes, PayPal customer support is hilariously bad.<p>[insert usual rant about their customer support] They&#x27;ve asked me to provide charity information for my personal account some months ago, and subsequently limited my receiving&#x2F;sending privileges.<p>Phone calls to them trying to sort this out have always ended up at some call centre in the Philippines, where the agents can only tell their users that the account limitation is &quot;for their safety&quot;.<p>That account of mine is still limited.<p>They&#x27;ve also limited the personal account of a friend of mine (who was interestingly enough ex-PayPal) before, also asking for charity information.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paypal.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;webapps&#x2F;mpp&#x2F;psd2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paypal.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;webapps&#x2F;mpp&#x2F;psd2</a>')
