The collective sum of all those funds in the US is probably in the billions, if not more. Futures contracts provide a more explicit way, with a stronger guarantee, of paying the price for security for specific assets &#x2F; resources rather than hand-wavy guesses of how much money should be put aside for the Black Swan case.<p>Sure, there are plenty of poor people who are so poor that they don&#x27;t have any savings at all. But surely you don&#x27;t think that rainy-day funds are just a theory?')
