It&#x27;s a great big smear that bleeds in and through itself unless it&#x27;s just one big scab with slightly different colours in slightly different areas.<p>The music I choose to listen to, both old and modern, both the new to me and also the familiar, is widely varying.  I feel like I have ADD when it comes to musical taste.  In creating a &#x27;playlist for right now&#x27; I&#x27;ll get bored of a song that&#x27;s up next because I&#x27;ve scrolled on to a different artist and already started playing their songs in my head and want to listen to them NOW instead of the song I choose three minutes ago.  World music, rock, jazz, blues, electronic, psychedelic, I love music crossing all these boundaries and want to fit them all in.<p>As such, I truly don&#x27;t understand the acceptance, by seemingly most of society, of the bland sameness (smear) of the &#x27;top 40&#x27;.  But it&#x27;s human laziness and &#x27;better things to do&#x27;.<p>&#x27;They&#x27; obviously don&#x27;t feel it in their souls like I do, like we do.  And I pity them what they&#x27;re missing.')
