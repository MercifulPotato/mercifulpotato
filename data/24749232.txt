ItÂ´s far better to have duplicate code around then to have to deal with poor generalizations that affect multiple independent modules, which in this case mean hardware support.<p>To put it in perspective, how many pieces of hardware would you require to re-test and validate if you decided to refactor bits of drivers that might share a common code path?')
