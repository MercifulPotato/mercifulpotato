Apple asked intel to make the chip for the iphone. If you partner with apple on this, then, together, and with billions of dollars, your entire ecosystem improves even if you were not originaly the best.<p>When you do this type of deal, you get to work with top class engineers and real major customer driving your power &#x2F; efficiency story.Intel at the time had the process node advantage as well.<p>What&#x27;s happened is Apple has SIGNIFICANTLY funded massive capital investment in the ARM ecosystem and in non-intel fab because now those non-intel providers are critical. Imagine all that money flowing to intel just on fab side.<p>Rumors around TSMC and Apple for iphones is that Apple funds some of the capacity at TSMC and pays for leading nodes.
