Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[24980771], score=None, time=1604362647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969527, text='&gt;I&#x27;m sure skeptics arguing against Galileo would have used string words like &quot;clearly&quot; to dismiss his ideas.<p>The fact that people dismissing Galileo&#x27;s claimed turned out to have been wrong does not mean people who dismiss COVID conspiracies or reptoids are equally as likely to be wrong.<p>People who believe in a conspiracy of globalist elite reptilian shapeshifters are clearly wrong. Clearly is a strong term, and it&#x27;s justified in the case of such beliefs. There is no danger that in the future those who hold such beliefs will turn out to have been correct in hindsight, as Galileo was proved correct in hindsight.<p>Reasonable people can agree or disagree on reasonable conspiracy theories. Did Epstein kill himself? Maybe, maybe not. Did Trump or his staff collude with Russia? Maybe, maybe not. Was 9&#x2F;11 an inside job? I don&#x27;t believe it was but it&#x27;s at least within the realm of metaphysical possibility. Are mattress stores just money laundering fronts for the Mafia? Probably not but it is weird how you can have, like, twenty of them on a single street. Who buys that many mattresses? How do they stay in business?<p>There is, however absolutely no need to give anyone who claims Bill Gates created COVID-19 as a pretext to tag people with mind control chips through vaccinations in order to harvest adrenochrome from their brains for satanic ritual orgies the benefit of the doubt. They. Are. Clearly. Wrong.')
