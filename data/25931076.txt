Item(by='volkl48', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611768759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929381, text='As far as I can tell, the group that seems to be the most influenced by the sea of disinformation is the people who grew up when that wasn&#x27;t how the world worked. I see far more of the middle aged&#x2F;elderly crowd getting sucked into conspiracy nonsense than younger.<p>I think among people who grew up with the internet, there&#x27;s less assumption that things are true just because someone said or wrote them. People can and do lie constantly on the internet and without evidence it&#x27;s not necessarily worth believing.<p>That there&#x27;s some &quot;news&quot; outlet just blatantly lying and making things up, even if it looks to be made &quot;professionally&quot; is not surprising to a younger person.<p>-----------<p>For personal anectdata:<p>I&#x27;m late 20s and had virtually unsupervised internet access and my own personal computer from about age 8 or so, as my father brought home old parts from work and let me tinker&#x2F;assemble something, and they didn&#x27;t watch me too closely. (early DSL adoption meant I wasn&#x27;t limited for long by speeds, either).<p>I pirated and played all the violent games, I downloaded lots of porn, and while I was never into &quot;shock&quot;&#x2F;watching real death&#x2F;gore, the nature of the internet was such that you were going to run across plenty of it if you spent enough time browsing, I certainly saw a lot.<p>I turned out to be a fine, reasonably well-adjusted adult, as did most of the friends I know who grew up similarly.<p>I don&#x27;t know all the details of their sex lives, but I&#x27;m not aware of any winding up with unrealistic expectations from porn. Always seemed like an action movie. Exciting, but not &quot;real&quot;.<p>Most of the shock stuff felt like it just made me more cautious. &quot;That guy got one whack in the head and he died!&quot; was a better argument against getting in a fight than the threat of parental&#x2F;school punishment is. Same regarding a lot of other potential teenage risk-taking behavior, like reckless driving or getting exceptionally drunk. Watch enough people die or ruin their lives at something and you&#x27;re a lot more cautious about it.<p>-----------<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s a net positive for kids to view those things at a young age. I&#x27;m just not sure that the harm is as large or uniform as people making moral panic claims often make, either.<p>Also, something like a third of people lose their virginity before 16 (although it&#x27;s declining) and the median age is ~17 in the US. A lot of your peers were having real-life sex when you ran across porn for the first time.  Worrying about them watching porn when plenty of them are having sex.....I don&#x27;t know it makes much sense at that point.<p>-----------<p>Looking back on that time, I&#x27;m primarily concerned with how easily I was talking with random strangers in great depth than the content I was watching. While there are some internet friends from old forums and chatrooms I&#x27;ve kept in touch with for 15-20 years now, that I could get to know random strangers like that as a preteen obviously had potential risks. Worked out well for me and I found great communities and interests, but still.')
