During the day I am (almost) a solopreneur and building shipit [1] - a tool for people to help visualize their product plans and connect these to company goals. There is a fair share of competition here, but all of the existing tools are extremely broad (think Jira vs Trello), and when you just start using these it&#x27;s hard to figure out what to do first. Trying to solve that issue by keeping shipit super simple and avoiding feature bloat.<p>While I try to keep the blog relevant to the target audience, every now and then a technical post slips in:<p>- encrypting sensitive data in the database [2]<p>- using checlists for testing the build before release [3]<p>- moving from software engineer to product manager [4]<p>To avoid burning out, in the evenings I also build a remote-controlled car that uses 4 independent motors and is controlled by PS3 joystick. I got inspired by the video showing torque vectoring [5] in Rimac, and wanted to build something like that too. There&#x27;s also an old project called Aelith [6] doing similar thing. I&#x27;m still in the early stages, and experimenting with 3D-printed motor mounts. When that is ready, will move to the software part.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;securing-data-at-shipit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;securing-data-at-shipit&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;software-checklist-testing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;software-checklist-testing&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;from-software-engineer-to-product-manager&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getshipit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;from-software-engineer-to-pro...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bD2Do1gAuog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bD2Do1gAuog</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ET1HEyqEQJQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ET1HEyqEQJQ</a>')
