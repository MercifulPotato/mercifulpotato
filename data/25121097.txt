Those 3% are, thus, applied to a large population comprised of everyone we interact ina daily basis.<p>Thus even if at most the likelihood that we die of covid is only 3% tops, the likelihood that at least one person that catches covid from us does is proportional to the number of people we infect.<p>With a 3% fatality rate, the likelihood that at least one person we infect will die can reach 80% if we spread it to over 50 people.<p>If we infect someone over 60, the likelihood that they will die from covid grows from that 3% to about 20%.<p>So unless you are infected while living in a bubble, the real risk is far higher.')
