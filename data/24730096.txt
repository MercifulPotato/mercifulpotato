A simple example is to track down the original referenced paper.  Another is knowing that at the time the video was created, VFX wasn’t good enough to fake the shot.  That’s not verification of say the amount of effort involved, as they could be scamming their backers or whatnot.  But, it does demonstrate the difference between being skeptical and a conspiracy theorist.<p>A skeptic looks for individual evidence to support every independent assertion, where a conspiracy theory is based on the assumption that individual truths are linked.  Using multiple different takes to make a video is independent of the accuracy of the experiment.  A trained crow would be able to fake what a crow learning to solve a puzzle does.')
