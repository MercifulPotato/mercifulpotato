However there is a comment on github that gets me thinking:<p>&gt; Local only mode (manual get devicekey)<p>&gt; I donâ€™t understand who needs it, but you never know. You must manually get devicekey for each device. Only works with devices on 3rd firmware.<p>I mean, he is thinking: why non-cloud access. While I&#x27;m thinking - having a power outlet depend on some 3rd party service, having internet access, having some app on android, which asks for location access to setup wifi and having account on manufacturer site just to control power outlet.........  I just cannot wrap it in my head and glad I did some googling before buying.')
