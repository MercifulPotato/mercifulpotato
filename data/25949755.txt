While great devs are great, it&#x27;s a lot easier to figure out if someone is a framework&#x2F;language expert than if they are an intrinsically great dev in an interview. i.e. (&quot;Do you know C# well?&quot; is easier to determine than &quot;Are you a good problem solver?&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s easier to grade multiple choice exams as compared to essays. But the former mostly measures how well someone can rote memorize.<p>&gt; 5. Most devs are searching for jobs in the ecosystems they like working in. But a lot of devs who can&#x27;t find a job get desperate and start applying to everything, which can bring down average quality of people who don&#x27;t have expertise.<p>Get a better hiring pipeline.
