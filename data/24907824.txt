And as a result there are three big effects: one is low-probability events turning out to actually happen sometimes (&quot;black swan&quot;), another is events you wanted to be uncorrelated turn out to be correlated (which blew up mortgage &quot;tranches&quot;), and the third is that other people&#x27;s action is market-driving information even if it&#x27;s irrational; panic selling causes more panic selling, bank runs are real, etc.')
