It will take at least a decade to switch around an industry this big, and people will have time to adjust.<p>Also, this means transportation will be cheaper and faster (computers don&#x27;t need sleep), which benefits everyone.<p>&gt; <i>No society where an average person - of average intelligence, average skills, average potential - cannot make a good living for themselves, can survive as a civilized society.</i><p>I&#x27;m actually also worried about this, but I think it&#x27;s a separate issue.')
