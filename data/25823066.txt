Additionally, I&#x27;m at the gym 5x a week. If you&#x27;re safe&#x2F;responsible, there is absolutely no reason you can&#x27;t do 99% of the things you want.<p>The reason I&#x27;m not doing those things isn&#x27;t because I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m at practically zero risk now that I&#x27;ve been vaccinated. The reason I&#x27;m not doing it is because I don&#x27;t want to be around people like you.<p>In 6 months from now, when there&#x27;s no excuse to not be vaccinated, that will be a different story. But people going about normal life right now as if nothing were happening are the reason we&#x27;re seeing 4,000 deaths a day in the US, and they are objectively bad human beings.')
