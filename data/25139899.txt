We started by looking at our Labs program, which was 8 weeks long, and thinking about how we could make it better. Labs is a simulation, and a good one!, but will always be simulated. The incredible value for students of Fellows it that it&#x27;s a &quot;real world learning experience.&quot; We now think the 1-2 punch is Labs + Fellows.<p>&gt; Have you done any legal vetting or anything along those lines? I like the idea, and I think it&#x27;s worthwhile, but I&#x27;m not interested if it means putting the company at risk.<p>Yes, absolutely! We&#x27;ve taken the legal side of this very seriously since we realize it has the potential to be interpreted as &quot;free labor.&quot;<p>In general, we do not encourage students to take unpaid internships. And if a student has the opportunity to take a paid position elsewhere, we recommend they do that.<p>As I mentioned in another response, our North Star for this program is an unparalleled learning experience for Lambda graduates. There are a few steps we&#x27;ve taken to ensure that it is a valuable learning opportunity for students:<p>1. We heavily qualify the companies we allow to host Lambda Fellows and require that they have a dedicated mentor in place, a meaningful project for the student to work on, a functioning team for the student to be a part of, and hold them accountable to provide and foster a positive learning environment. Companies who fail to meet these expectations, at any point, have had their Fellows removed.<p>2. As part of the qualification process for companies, we require that they have an open role for a junior developer that would be a qualified placement that the Lambda Fellow can apply for at the end of the Fellowship.<p>3. We remove the interview process for the students participating as Fellows and deploy them straight to the host company.<p>You&#x27;re exactly right: the law basically asks &quot;who is the primary beneficiary of that person&#x27;s labor?&quot; This was designed from the ground up as part of the educational journey of Lambda, and we&#x27;ve designed Fellows such that the student is the primary beneficiary of each step of that journey.')
