It gave them (us) permission to switch from the post-WW2 cooperative way of doing business to an extractive model: get the most you can from workers, suppliers, host communities and other stakeholders without shares. Externalize all the costs you can get away with fobbing off on others.<p>The Hayek &#x2F; Friedman &#x2F; Chicago School fanbois need to address the biggest externalized cost of all: disposal of CO2, methane, and other greenhouse gases. If the social responsibility of business were to increase its profits a century from now, maybe the Friedman Doctrine would be helpful. But, yeah, no. As it is, the Friedman Doctrine means &quot;take all the money and run.&quot;<p>Lots of plutocrats argue for a guaranteed basic income. Why? if Amazon &#x2F; FB &#x2F; Doordash &#x2F; Uber impoverish everybody, nobody will have any money to spend on Amazon &#x2F; FB &#x2F; Doordash &#x2F; Uber.<p>That&#x27;s all a consequence of the Friedman Doctrine.')
