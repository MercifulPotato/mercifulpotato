And then run expected value calculations of the unclaimed prizes vs the unsold tickets; if positive enough, go out and buy as many tickets as you can, process them and claim the winners (and enter any second chance drawings).<p>Of course, if people delay claimimg prizes, it makes the estimates inaccurate.')
