I&#x27;ve also been buying music on CD since 1993, and online for 10+ years and have over 120k tracks which will never &quot;become unavailable&quot;. My playlists will never disappear. I&#x27;ll never pay another cent for them this music for the rest of my life. The money you pay to rent music each month, I use to buy another 2 albums and a bunch of tracks, so my collection constantly grows in the direction I want it to.')
