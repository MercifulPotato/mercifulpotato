It&#x27;s a useless parlour trick to merge graphs and call them integrated, approximately as it is to put several CSV files into an archive or simply loading unrelated tables into one RDBMS.  Yes, you can run a processing engine on the amalgamation, but all the work remains to do in establishing a federating model within your query or processing instructions.<p>Over and over, we see that the real world problem is gated on human effort to negotiate about the models and to do data cleaning and transformation. And, the best results almost always require that modeling, cleaning, and transformation be done with an eye towards a specific downstream consumer or analysis. We get tired of having to steer leadership back to reality after they buy into the snake oil suggestion that integration costs can be avoided and unknown applications solved.<p>The claim that RDF solves federation more than any other serialization format for structured data and models is about the same as fixating on JSON versus XML or YAML or Lisp s-expressions.')
