Of course there are guidelines and decisions sometimes travel up the management chain, but the attitude of the first officer you meet can dictate the outcome.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: You decide spontaneously to travel to the UK from the US after having finishing a grueling contract. Your travel plans are a bit vague because of the short notice. You work on your CV on the flight with a view to your next job.<p>The border control officer finds your lack of detailed travel plans suspicious. He decides to carry out a search of your luggage and finds your CV. He claims you are coming to the UK to seek work. You protest but you have no evidence to the contrary.<p>You&#x27;re refused entry and you will now find it difficult to enter the UK for at least 10 years. You can expect to spend 3 or more hours at the UK border each time you try to enter.<p>Or, alternatively, none of this happens and instead the officer has a laugh with you about disorganised trips overseas and waves you in.<p>These sorts of scenarios are very common. People should be aware of the peril of crossing borders and be informed and well organised.')
