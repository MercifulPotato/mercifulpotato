Restaurants usually go for big thick patties, softer breads, and may go with more soupier sauces. A fast food burger is very thin, on a more serious bun and usually has less moisture on it overall. Even the actual burger meat itself can be different, with fast food being a fattier cheaper cut and restaurant burgers being a fancier ground beef.')
