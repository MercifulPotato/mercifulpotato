Btrfs has a lot of issues and some of them may well be of the not possible in Rust sort, but I&#x27;m quite sure most of them are not and there is nothing Rust can fix about them. Rewriting a 13 years old and very complex thing in another language is a massive effort and a big opportunity for introducing some more, possibly worse bugs along the way.<p>EDIT: also see panpanna&#x27;s comment')
