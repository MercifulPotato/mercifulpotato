It implements a Monte Carlo path tracing algorithm for global illumination. There&#x27;s a lot of features, including kd-tree mesh acceleration, physical material properties (microfacet BSDF with multiple importance sampling), HDRI environment maps, OBJ&#x2F;MTL&#x2F;STL files, depth of field, and particle physics simulation.<p>It&#x27;s also parallelized with rayon and available as a library on crates.io. The entire source code, including code for the above examples and more, is very short (\\~3K SLOC). We&#x27;re still looking to extend it with bidirectional path tracing and other features.')
