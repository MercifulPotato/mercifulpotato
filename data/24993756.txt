People say AMD has the best Linux drivers, but they&#x27;re wrong! Intel&#x27;s are feature rich and stable, and I think they&#x27;re better than AMD&#x27;s [1]. They&#x27;re just kind of ignored since nobody &quot;chooses&quot; to use an Intel GPU in their computer. You just get one bundled in your CPU, until now that is.<p>Intel Xe will likely be very poorly received because they&#x27;ll be compared to AMD and Nvidia&#x27;s best offerings and &quot;Intel is failing at everything&quot; is the big story now. But AMD and Nvidia are treating the low end GPU market as some sort of a backwater, and there&#x27;s a proper niche for people who just want a reliable graphics card with modern video outputs and modern video codecs. If it can run desktop 3D effects smoothly on multiple high resolution screens - like a better or less expensive GT1030 and RX550 - you can be golden. Not everything GPU is about gaming or high end compute.<p>[1]: Okay, AMD&#x27;s Linux drivers are also really good, but they can still have more hairy edge cases and lack of development than Intel&#x27;s.')
