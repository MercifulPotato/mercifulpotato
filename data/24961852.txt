If you own something you should have full control of it, to the extent that it doesn&#x27;t adversely influence the safety of the community. So yeah I&#x27;m okay with laws saying you aren&#x27;t allowed to store a pile of hazardous chemicals that could be a safety hazard to neighbors but I&#x27;m most certainly NOT okay with laws telling you how you&#x27;re allowed to landscape your garden or what color you can paint your house or what your fence or driveway looks like or whether you park your car in your driveway or garage. To me, owning means I make the rules, to hell with contracts, it&#x27;s not a rental.<p>Unless it&#x27;s in some historical district where we&#x27;re trying to preserve the historic look, that I&#x27;d be willing to make an exception for. But definitely not in random suburbs.')
