Item(by='XorNot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611287889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25856278, text='The point is that there&#x27;s a difference between medical doctors as a profession, and medical doctors by training engaged in research.<p>It&#x27;s <i>not</i> a homogenous demographic, and it doesn&#x27;t have a substantial overlap. So there is a very large (super-majority) of medical doctors who have absolutely no training in research, statistics etc. Because it&#x27;s not what they do - they are not scientists. Their training is about their obligations to follow current developments in best practice, drug prescriptions etc. (or the same but for surgical technique) and apply it. They <i>do not</i> do science, they don&#x27;t even necessarily particularly understand the scientific method.<p>So it is <i>absolutely incorrect</i> to imply that all medical professionals are &quot;the scientific community&quot;. They&#x27;re not. Those which participate in and publish research <i>are</i> but that is not even a significant fraction of their population.<p>Comparisons about what general population surgeons and medical doctors historically reacted to changes in practice does not say anything about the idea that these people represent a peer-reviewed scientific consensus, because they didn&#x27;t. They represent the equivalent of a mechanic rejecting manufacturer recommendations on fuel quality and complaining about it to their colleagues.')
