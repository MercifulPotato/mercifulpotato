Just because the AV says something is malware doesn&#x27;t mean you can trust its claim. From my perspective, they&#x27;ve undermined their trustworthiness in the area where you are indeed most likely to rely on an AV.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised they&#x27;re now flagging what is basically text and images as malware.')
