Just because the AV says something is malware doesn&#x27;t mean you can trust its claim. From my perspective, they&#x27;ve undermined their trustworthiness in the area where you are indeed most likely to rely on an AV. With the adware, ahem, ad-supported business model they were questionable to begin with, but throwing false positives on purpose just makes them worthless. It&#x27;s like ISPs making a stand &quot;we&#x27;re not the internet judge and executioner, get a real judge to order us to censor this website before we comply&quot; but then with more boot licking and groveling.')
