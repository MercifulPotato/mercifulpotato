It&#x27;s only a violation if you <i>sell</i> a security before the funds used to purchase it settle.<p>Margin accounts have a different legal definition and regulations.<p>Robin Hood is actually pretty unique in that its cash accounts are <i>always</i> restricted to settled funds; instead they decided to optimize for margin accounts that don&#x27;t allow for increased leverage. Which is not something other brokers optimize for that I&#x27;ve seen.')
