How many nanoseconds? How much is the lighting changing during that time? How still is the photo? How still is the person&#x27;s head? In DL a training example in a batch is perfectly defined in bits. Once you try to define a training example for a human you see that a &quot;single static image&quot; means totally different things. A human seeing a static image is the equivalent of training a model on at least thousands, if not millions+ of training images.')
