Then we fund coups in democratically run countries who just happen not to want to play ball with us, like Iran, Venezuela and Iraq. When it comes back to bite us, &quot;mea culpa, mistakes were made&quot;.<p>Americans really need to stay in our lane and learn to look after our own people instead of demonizing others.  We cannot even have peaceful elections, and until we fix gerrymandering we have <i>zero</i> moral high ground to talk about the fairness of foreign elections.<p>Come see an election in Turkiye. Turks dislike it, but thy accept the election results. During the last regional elections, I had friends and family members who were election monitors. Some of them stayed in those rooms, staring at the election boxes without leaving for two weeks to ensure the integrity of the election, and that is <i>not</i> an exaggeration.<p>Tayipp lost Istanbul and Ankara, and he did it fantastically. Istanbul&#x27;s initial margin was 25,000 votes.  When Tayipp had the election results annulled, Turks got <i>pissed</i> and he lost the second election by 800,000 votes.<p>Unlike Americans, Turks really care about their democracy.')
