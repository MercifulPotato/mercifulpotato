Most of the time you can default to the popular one if you don’t know how to evaluate it any further, but the README and API tend to make the decision trivial. The project with the best docs is an easy deal breaker as it’s a good signal that the engineers have put some hammock time into the project and they have attention to detail.<p>But also, just try multiple libraries out. Sometimes one library doesn’t even give you the results you want. I notice beginners in general are resistant to that and seem to think precious time is wasted if they don’t make the perfect decision upfront. I say spend an hour playing with various libs if you can’t decide otherwise.')
