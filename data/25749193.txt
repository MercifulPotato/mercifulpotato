If you believe in democracy then you should believe that a power structure derived from 1 person = 1 vote has the potential to be more fair and more just, for the represented individuals, than the alternative power structure derived from dollars.<p>I would love to see more innovation in this space: How can we design better charters for unions (or governments, really) so that the resulting power structure better represents the people?<p>Should there be some kind of justice system for large unions to ensure there is no corruption and that decisions are made fairly in the best interests of the constituents? Should we elect representatives based on say department as a re-creation of the principles of federalism, or should we be a direct democracy? At what level of scale do these decisions matter?<p>Many people study democracy, but I fear not enough people study the ongoing process of creating effective and resilient new democracies from scratch.<p>[0] Although, many modern tech companies have perverted this by creating separate ultra-powerful voting shares reserved for founders')
