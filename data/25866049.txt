This results in escalation to AWS support who barely understand it.<p>The big sell was easy deployment and cost management but the negatives outweighed that.<p>We tried Elastic themselves but the sales and technical process was a nightmare. It was virtually impossible to work out what we were going to have to spend. We needed X-Pack (RBAC and SSO) but the enterprise licensing is all over the place for it.<p>Ergo we didn’t bother and stuck with our DBMS FTE stuff. It’s crap but the ROI is better.')
