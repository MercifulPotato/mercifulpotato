These kinds of chats can easily take place via chat apps, informal real time chats, etc. In fact, I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re significantly better in those forums. Off the cuff few people have very well thought out ideas. Written conversation tends to yield more well-formed and careful communication. This may reduce the quantity, but likely increases the quality.<p>&gt; At some point it&#x27;ll become a forcing function to bring everyone back into the office.<p>Only at companies where this kind of thing is required for whatever reason (usually companies with old school or technologically impaired brass). If you don&#x27;t get offered a promotion or get to contribute to a project b&#x2F;c you didn&#x27;t have lunch with your boss to chat about some random idea that flung into your head and could only be shared in person, then I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s no place I&#x27;d want to be. Certainly others may prefer this type of environment, but I would view this as a company with misplaced priorities and inefficient structures.')
