Professional restaurant reviewing guides generally had reputable practices for decades.  Those came to exist because &quot;your&quot; dumb uncle always recommended the worst restaurants.  So the internet comes along and tells everyone&#x27;s uncle and their uncles terrible friends that their review is super special.  Voila we have yelp and google maps which are generally a combination of super fans or just terrible people with the 100 normal people that visit a restaurant each day completely absent.   Hooray outliers!!!!!!')
