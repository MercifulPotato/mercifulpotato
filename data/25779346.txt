I was working for a world leader in mobile space. The company was located in a place where there are lot of startups, big world leading local companies, lot of investment activity, US companies etc. The salaries are pittance in that area even though it is a major place of tech and innovation.<p>I will give you an example of what is the mindset of people(mostly HR) here. There were major changes going to happen at this company I was working for(we didn&#x27;t know at that time, but came to know much later). The usual trick HR plays in these types of cases is to increase some perks to keep all employees &quot;happy&quot; so that they don&#x27;t leave the company. So the HR of this company announced a perk via email, that the company will be providing &quot;fruit bowl&quot; to employees every day in the morning. Everyone was excited as there was no other means of eating at the office except for a small vending machine that delivered limited supply of sandwiches and a small coffee machine(did I mention that this company was a world-leader?). The day was announced for the &quot;fruit bowl&quot; perk. So on the day of the perk, when people came to the office they saw that a small bowl of fruits was kept in the &quot;kitchen&quot;. There were 2-3 bananas, 2 pears, 1-2 kiwifruit, one apple and a bunch of grapes. One senior engineer who was with the company almost since its inception sent an angry email to the HR and CC&#x27;d it to the rest of employees at the office asking them how on earth this fruit bowl was going to be shared between 50+ employees at the office. The HR&#x27;s reply was(again CC&#x27;d to everyone in the office) &quot;But there are grapes&quot;!<p>And I am not kidding you, I saw this type of &quot;perks&quot; being advertised in the country where I am. The perks are something like this:<p>&quot;We provide our employees with lunch on Fridays&quot; or &quot;We provide our Employees lunch on first Thursday on the month&quot; etc. What are engineers, beggars? But that is common in companies that are founded in the country where I stay. When I moved to an US founded company in my country, not only did my salary increase substantially(by local salary standards) but the perks were something like this:<p>Breakfast, Lunch, Pizza if had to stay late, unlimited supply of coffee, onsite postal service, onsite laundry, haircut, manicure, shoe-polish, ironing service, on-site shop for snacks, payment for car fuel(extra pay if the car was environment friendly), 24-7 access to free gym at the Marriot, discounted shopping coupons and the list goes on. And this was not FAANG!<p>The reaon this is happening is because(I learnt this indirectly), the local companies collaborate, in partnership with recruitment agencies, behind the scene to not only keep salaries low but to share the information with HR that someone is looking for a job or has interviewed at some other company.<p>In the US, if I am not mistaken, there was a very famous litigation that forced US companies to stop collaborating in artificially keeping salaries down and deliberately not hire from certain companies. This is not there in Europe I suppose.')
