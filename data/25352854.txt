Historically it&#x27;s easy to tell he has had some very dark traits, and also I think it seems obvious that he has learned to hide them better as he has aged, but look how much benefit for the world his work and everything has been doing.<p>So all in all, it&#x27;s not dark traits, but dark goals.')
