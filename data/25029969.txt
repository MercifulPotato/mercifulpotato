I have done so. I stopped doing it, because reinstalling every 7 days is an annoyance that no app was worth. I switched to Android instead.<p>As another comment notes, this also does not cover people who have an iOS device but no Mac. Which is definitely an overwhelming majority of iOS owners in general (just looking at iOS vs Mac hardware sales), though I don&#x27;t know about power users. I could see people who consider themselves iOS power users to also likely have a Mac, but at the same time I could also see them as wanting to use the Mac as little as possible.')
