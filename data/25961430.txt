What I like is it&#x27;s integrated in the browser, so you don&#x27;t have to install an app. Just tap a button and point your camera at the spot where you want to see the furniture.<p>It works reasonably well and gives you a general idea of how large the furniture is and how it would fit in the space. Surprisingly, they do a good job with the lighting on the object and if you unfocus your eyes a bit, it does seem like it&#x27;s in the room with you.')
