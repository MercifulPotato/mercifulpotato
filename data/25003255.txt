A lot of what CPU do on many programs is wait for an instruction to complete so they can use its result to chase some pointer - and in the mean time, find an instruction that doesn&#x27;t depend on it to execute. So many &quot;simple&quot; moves and register renames are practically free, as they happen in these waiting-for-result slots.<p>HPC code is most definitely not like that - but it&#x27;s only found in specialized parts of software (game rendering paths, maths stuff, some NumPy code, etc). But most code spends most of its time with the CPU waiting.')
