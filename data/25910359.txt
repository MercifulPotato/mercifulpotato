I’m not trying to cast aspersions on you or your employer directly... but it’s fascinating to me to see such a myopic take on a problem space I hope you’d agree is very much not one-approach-fits-all. I’m surprised to hear about their flow too, but my more charitable assumption is that their teams have tried different things and settled on an evolving process that works for them. They’re proud enough to boast it from the corporate blog, it can’t be entirely lark.')
