The Mall of America has about 40 million annual visitors so about a fifth would be able to charge their batteries 10% if the Mall doubled its (hypothetical) capacity, which would likely require at least some infrastructure upgrades since we&#x27;re talking about ~10 MW of extra power - and that&#x27;s averaged out 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365, in actuality it&#x27;ll be a much higher peak load since the mall isn&#x27;t 24&#x2F;7.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert but I doubt the property developer and power companies overbuilt by that much.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dsoelectric.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dsoelectric&#x2F;files&#x2F;My%20Business&#x2F;retail.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dsoelectric.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dsoelectric&#x2F;files&#x2F;My%20Busines...</a>')
