It&#x27;s been stable, pretty, lag-free &amp; fluid (60fps). Even though D2 is a shooter and would thus be particularly susceptible to lag, I found the experience to be practically perfect. That said, I have Comcast Business Internet which is stable, and everything&#x27;s connected over ethernet.<p>Stadia&#x27;s voice party system works well, and while I&#x27;ve been playing on a TV (Chromecast Ultra &amp; Stadia controller), I&#x27;ve run raids with folks playing on their phones, iPads, &amp; Chromebooks.<p>Maybe because it&#x27;s still a small and new community, but I&#x27;ve found it generally friendly and good quality.')
