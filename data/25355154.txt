But dang if they aren’t the heaviest and least comfortable things around (Compare to something like a nice pair of those seinheisers that everybody owns - those feel like you’re wearing a cloud and still sound 85% as good). To me the HE400s are very much “special occasions” headphones that I bust out for when I’m really sitting down to <i>just</i> listen to music. For everything else I need something a bit more... usable.')
