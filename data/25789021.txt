NTFS doesn&#x27;t care if the underlying disk is virtual or bare metal. In fact, it kinda runs on virtual disks already even on bare metal, i.e. disk partitions (maybe even with a layer of encryption in between). There could be potential issues of course where you could get NTFS to trigger some hardware bugs, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here,  instead it is about accessing NTFS $I30 attributes.')
