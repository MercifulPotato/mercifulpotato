With the latter, you can play games with your scaling, perhaps by shoving a hierarchical or replicated cache in front of your scaling bottleneck, and effectively buy time to build a solution with better scaling. (Or perhaps never bother with that, and just be acutely aware of your system&#x27;s scaling dimensions, like StackOverflow.)<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a system that truly scales infinitely, just systems whose scale limits exceed our imagination.<p>(Admittedly, most bugs of the form &quot;INT64_MAX overflow&quot; are generally a leak and not the result of growth :).)')
