If its the OP, based on what&#x27;s written and nothing more it sounds like a racket the non-technical founders are running.  I personally would identify the laziest path for you to exercise your rights to extinguish the entire venture, ideally with counsel, and then tell the other people what you&#x27;ve decided to do, let them name their price.<p>If things roll your way, maybe you resurrect the business later buying its assets out of bankruptcy.
