I still frequent comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.ada. Though they now have <i>tons</i> of spam in them so the interesting parts are somewhere in the garbage. I think most groups have moved to other discussion boards&#x2F;systems as their primary forum now, and newer groups don&#x27;t try to create a newsgroup. For instance, I doubt there&#x27;s a comp.lang.elixir or comp.lang.rust.<p>As a discussion system, it&#x27;s pretty much defunct at this point.')
