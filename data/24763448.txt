I don&#x27;t read it and have no experience with it.<p>Just a point here to note ...<p>There are health effects from RF as it stands but it&#x27;s usually localised heating, hence why some handheld radios are known as &quot;Chinese eyeball cookers&quot; but they tend to run +40dBm into an antenna with some gain thus ending up with 25W ERP close range strapped to your face - that&#x27;s another 4dB or so. Your average phone kicks out a max of 23dBm if it&#x27;s really kicking it out hard. That&#x27;s 125x less power. Your wifi router is half that again. That&#x27;s 250x less power than the eyeball cooker. And none of those emit ionising radiation. And your wifi router isn&#x27;t strapped to your head.<p>As mentioned earlier my Ryzen&#x27;s motherboard shows up bang on 800MHz with more ERP than my router...<p>Far far far more worrying for me is all the pollution and crap in the air I&#x27;m huffing up every day living near an airport.')
