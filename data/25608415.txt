Item(by='ufmace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609543435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25608069, text='&gt; In this case, I think the sufficient explanation for the phenomenon is that HOAs are good at protecting property values.<p>Uh yeah, that&#x27;s their defined purpose that everybody knows about and agrees upon. I&#x27;ve lived in several properties under HOAs, haven&#x27;t had any trouble, and don&#x27;t know anyone personally who&#x27;s had any trouble either.<p>IMO, HOA problems are of those things that&#x27;s extremely rare in practice, but makes for outrage-inducing stories on the internet that get upvoted heavily and widely viewed. Since this is well known and plenty of people will do anything for internet upvotes, I&#x27;d bet a significant number of the stories are either made up entirely or are highly exaggerated and misleading.<p>If HOAs were really that bad, you&#x27;d see a market for homes advertising the lack of them. We don&#x27;t though. The better analogy is internet free speech. In theory, everybody likes free speech. But if you create a new forum specifically for the purpose of not censoring anything, it tends to get filled with the worst assholes of the internet. Similarly, you can guess who&#x27;d be itching to move in if you advertised your housing development as not having a HOA.')
