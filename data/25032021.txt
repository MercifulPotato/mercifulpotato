It&#x27;s popular and a status signalling object - but it wouldn&#x27;t be if the core experience was bad.  Many people just follow tastemakers and don&#x27;t know at all why the thing they &quot;like&quot; is better or worse than anything else, that&#x27;s fine, but they&#x27;re still doing so ultimately because of quality.<p>The app store moderation isn&#x27;t the only dimension of the quality of the ecosystem, but it has a significant effect.<p>I have a mild preference for android, but it was more or less just luck which landed me on an iPhone for my current phone.
