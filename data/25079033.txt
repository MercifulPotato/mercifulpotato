Every time the service was actually up, some change or another broke the connection from the gateway to the internal system. It&#x27;s probably that. If it was just a bad push of a single component, usually you can revert it. If you push a bad gateway config, maybe the gateways are crashing so much you can&#x27;t  roll back.')
