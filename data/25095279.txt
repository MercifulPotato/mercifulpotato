Give me hot water.<p>(Though some kind of temperature sensor could be nice.)<p>My second rage inducing grievance is bad cleanability. All the places dirt, scuz, grime fill up. Nooks, crannies, crevices, shelves, dials, mounts.<p>My third grievance is bad cable management. WTF am I supposed to tuck away the power cable? How do I secure it for storage?<p>My Vitamix blender, mixer, hot iron, instapot, sawzall, portable fans and heaters, the pre-USB-C Mac power bricks... All piss me off on the regular.<p>The least cleanable product I&#x27;ve ever owned was a Samsung fridge. iFixit would give it a -2&#x2F;10 rating. I can only conclude its designers and product manager had never seen a fridge before. Or thoroughly hated all fridge-kind and were exacting revenge as part of some enduring blood feud.<p>PS- We need an iCleanIt product review site.')
