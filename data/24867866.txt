And obviously the pricing and permanent sale model are much more attractive than Adobe&#x27;s subscription model.<p>They do also have some almost unbelievable limitations, where what you&#x27;d expect to be entry-level functionality simply doesn&#x27;t exist, and they lack any sort of plug-in ecosystem and all the extensibility and customisation that brings.<p>But saying that, it&#x27;s not as if Adobe&#x27;s applications haven&#x27;t had bizarre omissions over the years, and they&#x27;ve had much longer to fix them. Hopefully Serif can keep up the momentum and community good will it&#x27;s built for the Affinity suite and in time they&#x27;ll close the gaps.')
