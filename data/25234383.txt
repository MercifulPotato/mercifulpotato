Item(by='blincoln', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606527858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232081, text='&gt; Hossenfelder doesn&#x27;t claim that all the experts are wrong.<p>&quot;In his book, Hawking painted a neat picture for black hole evaporation that is now widely used. [...]. It’s simple, it’s intuitive, and it’s wrong.&quot;[1]<p>When I read that quote, I originally took it at face value, because she seems like an expert in her field, and it certainly sounds plausible. But now, in the next writeup of hers that I&#x27;ve come across, I find a claim that the description of FTL and causality portrayed by every legit source I&#x27;ve ever encountered is wrong, and that FTL without violating causality is somehow possible within Einstein&#x27;s framework. That&#x27;s two incredible claims in as many writeups. Why haven&#x27;t I seen similar claims from e.g. Brian Greene or David Deutsch? Is it something specific to her own theories? Is it from some branch of theoretical physics that&#x27;s not accepted by mainstream physicists? Am I misunderstanding the claims? Etc.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;hawking-radiation-is-not-produced-at.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;hawking-radiation-i...</a>')
