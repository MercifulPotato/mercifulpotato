Every major thread on HN has at least one comment trying to force the America Bad angle into the conservation regardless of whether the discussion is about the US.<p>If the primary conversation - derived from the linked article - is about the US and about a topic having to do with something negative about the US, then it&#x27;s both interesting (as the root source) and makes reasonable sense that it should be in the thread.<p>Otherwise it&#x27;s nothing more than a political agenda - someone being triggered and unable to control theirself - being force-wedged into a conversation where it doesn&#x27;t belong and it degrades the quality of HN dramatically. As it would if the same treatment were applied to any other nation.<p>Imagine if every large thread had someone trying to force comments about all the bad things France or Britain have done. Every single major thread. Now apply it to dozens of nations. Of course that wouldn&#x27;t be allowed because it would be insane. It&#x27;s insane to allow it for the US just the same.')
