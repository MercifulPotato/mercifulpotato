I have smooth and young-looking skin, but it&#x27;s because my collagen is messed up. My joints come apart everywhere in my body, I get woozy from standing or even sitting for long, and I&#x27;m developing a host of spinal and nerve problems. I&#x27;m expected to need PT, braces and probably more for the rest of my life.<p>But I can walk, and I look young, so I had a hell of a time getting diagnosed. And I felt really guilty about using a disabled parking pass even though I knew I needed it.')
