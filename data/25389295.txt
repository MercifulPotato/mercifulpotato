The smaller the group, the better. And the group where values change constantly is bound to be very small.<p>Your assumption seems to be that these changes won’t be recognized. But they are very easy to recognize, e.g. by grouping the values by IP address. Same IP address but constantly changing random values? Yes, that’s a very reliable fingerprint.')
