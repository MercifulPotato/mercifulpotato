There&#x27;s some nuance to it: higher population density countries often use less energy to deliver the same quality of life are more dispersed populations. But in general the better life is in a country, the more energy it consumes. Here&#x27;s per-capita energy consumption plotted out on a map [1] and the correlation is crystal clear.<p>This part of why I think plans to decarbonize through the reduction of energy consumption are doomed to fail. People aren&#x27;t going to reject a good standard of living, and countries that don&#x27;t yet have a good standard of living aren&#x27;t going to stop striving to achieve it.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:World_Map_-_Energy_Use_2013.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:World_Map_-_Energy_Use_20...</a>')
