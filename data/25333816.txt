If by “the Democrats” you mean a 100% consensus of Democrats in the electorate and in office, maybe (though they couldn&#x27;t, even with that, guarantee a majority in the public vote required on a large number of issues, since the electorate is &lt; 50% Democratic), but no such consensus actually exists. If you mean like, literally, anything else, that’s a whole lot less clear, as universal healthcare indicates.<p>&gt; They&#x27;ve had 10 years<p>No, they&#x27;ve had a run of <i>four</i> years uninterrupted, or six of the last eight, with sufficient legislative majority for tax policy changes that include any increase of any kind (even if they are net cuts) with a 100% in-party consensus. And they haven&#x27;t even had ten years where they could pass a budget alone without tax changes, because the similar budget supermajority requirement was repealed by the people less than ten years ago.')
