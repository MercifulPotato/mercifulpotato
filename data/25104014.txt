And though I do not know much about Bulgaria, I doubt it&#x27;s because of the money. I&#x27;d assume Bulgaria has free schools and probably social support for financially struggling kids.<p>There are so many different nations in Europe, some with their nation states, many without. However, Roma or Travellers seem to have the same poor opinion almost everywhere - which is not really shared with any other people. Maybe it is not that fair to picture Bulgarians as the only source of the bad situation in this neighbourhood. Isn&#x27;t there a way for the community to organise anything, even some basic cleanup?<p>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the quote (from comments):<p>&gt;  I generally try to avoid Western Europe these days – along with most of the Western world, people their are (in general) just trying to convince themselves that the little bubble they exist in is all that matters.<p>A bit rich coming from an American, but anyway I do not understand what it that supposed to mean. I&#x27;d believe it&#x27;s rather Western Europeans that try to care for the world as the whole, rather than do the least immediately necessary.')
