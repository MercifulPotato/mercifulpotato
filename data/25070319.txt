My god, get it yourself, it&#x27;s just a ring, I won&#x27;t do like some friends who borrow on 5 years to buy one so big the girl is scared to wear it and put it in a safe...<p>I bought her a small 300 euros one, she found it almost insulting but after a month, stopped wearing it &quot;because it&#x27;s a bit heavy&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s just a ring, it&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot;. 5 years later, we&#x27;re still married with a child and she wouldn&#x27;t even remember where she put the &quot;diamond&quot;.')
