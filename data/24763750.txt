GCR is literally just a container that runs on demand (with scaling to 0).  Literally the only GCR specific part is making sure the service listens on the PORT env.  If I was so inclined, I could deploy the exact same container on any number of services, host it myself and&#x2F;or run it on my laptop for development purposes.  There&#x27;s also Kubernetes Knative which is basically (afaik) self hosted GCR.')
