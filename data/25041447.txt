DoorDash makes it abundantly clear who you&#x27;re buying your food from, that&#x27;s their whole schtick. I just looked at a few random Amazon losing and I couldn&#x27;t figure out who I was supposedly buying from.<p>Perhaps Amazon should let sellers brand their product pages. I just looked at DoorDash Android app and the restaurant name is prominently displayed on each listing in the search results and even includes their logo when I click in.<p>Amazon is doing their best to hide from me who I&#x27;m buying from so I can only assume they want me to think it&#x27;s them.')
