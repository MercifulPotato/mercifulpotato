Assuming what you say is true, I would still chalk up the shots&#x2F;cuts to the artistic direction of the director&#x2F;crew over anything to do with ADHD.<p>I think this falls apart even more when you compare Ghost Protocol to the most recent MI film, Fallout, which is the highest rated and grossing MI movie in the series.
