If your title starts with &quot;How to...&quot; you should SHOW, not TELL, and the article was a whole lot of telling. And the one example that was accidentally there - the image at the top - did not clarify if it was a good one or not (see discussion here, for example).<p>Others have found issue with the grammar and sentence structure of the article, I found it totally opaque.<p>Show me an example of a mental model (or the absence of one). Pull an excerpt from the Times or the economist and contrast it with another publication that is not clear. Wouldnt this help us &quot;understand, know and&quot; eventually &quot;do&quot;?<p>And given that the advice is to think about your audiences and communicate with purpose, please do ask yourself: What is the purpose of this article? If it&#x27;s to tell us to strive for clarity, please show us how, don&#x27;t just tell us to do so.')
