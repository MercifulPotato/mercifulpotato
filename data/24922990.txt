The UofC IRB has no influence on that.<p>If there is any evidence that CA&#x2F;SCL&#x2F;Kosinski said the data collection was affiliated with UofC, I cannot find it. And when Kosinski attempted to use the data in his research, the UofC IRB denied it.<p>In this case the data collection is by the NYU AdObservatory  project, meaning the data collection and its use (should) have to go through the IRB.')
