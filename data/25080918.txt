But computers are a very specific, highly specialized machinery that the vast parts of the population will never be able to directly understand or fix.<p>I started off with zero experience and learned more over time to throw your own words back at you.<p>I learned how to program on a computer when I was 10 years old (which was 28 years ago now) after my Grandfather (who was born in the 1920s) learned how to operate his own computer at home. We had manuals and trial and error and the library. It was much more difficult to learn back then because there was no internet, no youtube and almost nobody had a computer. Computers back then were a lot more difficult to use as well. So don&#x27;t give me this nonsense about it being so opaque it is impossible for an ordinary person.<p>Also most people will know a friend or relative that is handy with a PC or you could go to a local specialist for help. A large multi-billion company &quot;looking out for the plebs&quot; isn&#x27;t required.<p>Apple has been quite good it seems as selling this narrative.<p>&gt; I can drive a car but I don&#x27;t know the first thing about fixing it.<p>Plenty of people used to be able to work on their own cars in the past (and still do today). Most of them would be considered &quot;laymen&quot;. Plenty of people fix their own phones and computers, or go to a repair shop where people have taught themselves to repair electronics and turned it into a business. Just because you choose to be ignorant (which is absolutely fine) doesn&#x27;t mean other people aren&#x27;t able or willing to.')
