The article starts out with a very inflammatory title. If the author had any regard for effective communication, they would begin by explaining what exactly is a &quot;monitoring startup&quot;, but instead they assume that there can really be only one kind of &quot;monitoring&quot;. About 3&#x2F;4 through the article, it becomes clear they probably mean monitoring servers, and not, say, monitoring a physical location with cameras, or monitoring an assembly line or baby monitors.<p>Then, the meat of the article is basically saying &quot;everyone else failed, so you will too. Also, Google can do it better than you.&quot; It just sounds snarky and arrogant. IMO much of the point of startups is to be allowed to take risks. If everyone has a conservative attitude that risky ideas shouldn&#x27;t even be tried, progress never happens. What do you think this guy would have said when Elon Musk announced his plans to launch SpaceX? Good thing some people don&#x27;t listen to cynical asshats.<p>Also, two-sentence paragraphs. They convey a fundamental misunderstanding of how paragraphs are used.')
