This is easy on my end at least -- prices and prescription guidance are released in the BNF &#x2F; British National Formulary annually and are all made available in public. I have never understood the US system of &quot;co-pays&quot; and found the whole thing very confusing.<p>For a few &quot;popular&quot; random examples that I think HN might have heard of: one branded Epi-Pen is £26.45; Naproxen (the NSAID painkiller) is £4.29 &#x2F; 56 pack; and omeprazole (PPI used to treat gastric reflux) is £0.84 &#x2F; 28 pack.<p>A more expensive example might be the cystic fibrosis &quot;designer drugs&quot; lumacaftor with ivacaftor -- 112 tablets are £8000 (to be prescribed by a specialist, if the patient has the genotype to respond to it -- a total annual cost of about £26k). The US equivalent is $379,780 [1].<p>(NB: The price you pay as a British patient is usually £0, unless you are a working-aged and working English person -- at which point it is £9.15 per item [independent of its cost] or a fixed &quot;all you can eat&quot; prepayment certificate that works out at about £8.83&#x2F;month -- which is what I have. Oh, and plus the taxes, of course...).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jmcp.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.18553&#x2F;jmcp.2018.24.10.987" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jmcp.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.18553&#x2F;jmcp.2018.24.10.987</a>')
