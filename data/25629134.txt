He absolutely <i>is not</i> the person I&#x27;d be selling to. If it turns out that I can&#x27;t find customers selling what I think is the right product for the market <i>then</i> I might have to pivot to build what he wants, but until then he&#x27;s just someone who isn&#x27;t my potential market right now.<p>Startup sales is about getting the customer to buy in <i>before</i> the product is exactly right for them. Changing your product to suit whatever the person in front of you wants is massively distracting, often bad for the product, and doesn&#x27;t guarantee a sale anyway.<p><i>If he doesn&#x27;t think you&#x27;re worth the money..</i><p>The product not being what someone wants only means it&#x27;s not worth the money <i>for them</i>. That doesn&#x27;t mean the product isn&#x27;t worth it for anyone. You need to find the person who wants what you have right now despite it not being perfect, and who is willing to pay for what you have on the basis that it&#x27;ll become what they need in the future.')
