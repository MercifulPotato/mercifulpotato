I have 86 gb data on my google account and is trying really hard to export.<p>- the export size is around 176 gb. Mostly photos.<p>- it has the option to move to one drive or box. But 100 gb on Google will be 200 gb on one drive. Images are copied into multiple folders to recreate the albums. Note that google photos automatically create albums for family and trips.<p>- tried to use 2gb zip to split the files. We have to click and download 100+ pieces of zip files. Even if one file is corrupt we are done. All this shows in a modal window. We can&#x27;t download more than 5-8 files at a time.<p>- split it into 5gb zip files. Now download numbers are manageable, but the network keeps dropping and we have to download again. We can only retry 3 times making the entire set useless.<p>- no options to separate videos and photos.<p>- we only have a week to takeout and test the whole thing.<p>TLDR; it&#x27;s designed to make sure that we don&#x27;t actually take out the files...')
