Obviously not aimed at the hardcore Clojure crowd but still I hoped for more on the actual future. There was a mention of more resources with no specifics and reassuring comments on things not fundamentally changing as before [as in earlier announcements].<p>Things I&#x27;d ask:<p>- What are the new resources (for Clojure? or just Datomic?), how are they being used? Does Nubank have opinions &#x2F; direction on these resources.<p>- Has an open sourced Datomic been discussed? It wouldn&#x27;t seem to be strategic for Nubank and could be a big boost to the Clojure ecosystem. I&#x27;d read every line..<p>- Who owns the Clojure trademarks and IP going forward. Any talk of a Clojure Foundation?<p>- Alex Miller does an awesome job but boy he has a lot to cover. It suits Rich to have a small team of trustees for core (though boy its got small) but the community stuff could surely be advanced quicker. Old tickets in contrib and key libs etc..<p>- There was talk a few years ago of facilitating community involvement with a PEP type process, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0001&#x2F;</a>? Any further thoughts?<p>- Clojurescript has left Core. Is Nubank likely to want to get involved here?<p>I have no right to these answers, some may be commercially sensitive and of course Clojure doesn&#x27;t belong to me. However there is no harm in asking when answers to the questions are important to me in my future uses of Clojure. Indeed I think it would be superior - in terms of Clojure&#x27;s continued acceptance into industry - to know more of it&#x27;s future direction than has traditionally been the case. Hopefully Nubank provides the confidence needed for this to happen.')
