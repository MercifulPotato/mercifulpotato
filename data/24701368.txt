The end result is that Beanstalk gets stuck somewhere in the middle.<p>Beanstalk is a very capable and powerful service, and you certainly <i>can</i> set up a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline in the way you&#x27;ve described, but you have to set it up yourself using AWS CodePipeline or by using the beanstalk CLI... which is certainly not as developer friendly as something like Heroku, <i>especially</i> if it&#x27;s just a hobby app that you&#x27;re toying with on the weekends.<p>And to muddy the waters a bit more, AWS also has Amplify, which actually does have one-click-setup for a GitHub linked CI&#x2F;CD pipeline, but AFAIK it&#x27;s mostly meant for static websites or for mobile apps, so it isn&#x27;t exactly the same target use cases as Beanstalk.')
