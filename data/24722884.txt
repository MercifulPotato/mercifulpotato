Item(by='tshaddox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602185543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722768, text='&gt; Having 5% of your workforce quit over nothing more than messaging is a catastrophic failure in people management.<p>&gt; I think the CEO’s refusal to take a stance on whether Black Lives Matter is a stance in itself. It’s hard not to assume that he doesn’t agree with the organization or the statement, even if that’s not the case.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about the second part, but I disagree that it&#x27;s &quot;nothing more than messaging.&quot; Surely it <i>must</i> not be about &quot;focusing on Coinbase&#x27;s mission&quot; but rather that the Coinbase leadership feels that the Black Lives Matter issue simply is not important enough to take a stance on and thus potentially alienate some people. I strongly suspect that Coinbase <i>would</i> take a stance if they deemed the issue to be important enough. Would Coinbase take a stance if there was a current prominent debate over whether Black people should be allowed to vote? Or is that not related closely enough to their mission? What if the prominent debate was over whether Black people should be allowed to have bank accounts, or purchase cryptocurrencies?')
