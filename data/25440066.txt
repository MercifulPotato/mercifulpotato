I like integrating with graphql endpoints. But for endpoints I make myself for my own frontend, I prefer making exactly what I need. Doing it more general would be a waste of time (YAGNI etc), and since it&#x27;s often the critical path (not just data fetching) it&#x27;s nice to have it clearly laid ot what&#x27;s happening, without having to have knowledge about how the frontend happens to call it.')
