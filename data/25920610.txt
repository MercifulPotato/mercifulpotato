I have a Pi connected to my TV. I don’t use the official app, because I couldn’t figure out how to build it. From memory browser playback sucked or didn’t work at all. I settled on the Kodi plex plug-in which works pretty well - sometimes at the end of an episode it ‘double skips’ to next+1. The one thing that <i>does</i> work well with a Pi is CEC but that’s a double edged sword - I woke up to the plex turning my TV on a few nights ago, no idea why.<p>For plex, I would recommend looking into an Apple TV, a new Android TV (the one where you can use a remote, older ones only support casting) or a nvidia shield - I can’t fully recommend them but i suspect they suck less than my experience. Failing that, a decent (i5+) nuc may work but ymmv.')
