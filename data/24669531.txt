Whenever you go and read a book from your library, you librarian doesn&#x27;t keep a profile of who you are and judges your value based on what books you read. Books are still the best way to expose yourselves to new ideas and libraries are still the cheapest ways you could discover those ideas because your library is not earning by showing you an ad for each book you read and hence, its not in their interest to trap you in a bubble that echoes your own bias.')
