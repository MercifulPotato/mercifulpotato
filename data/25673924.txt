(I know they don&#x27;t have all their wealth in cash, which might change things a bit. But still)<p>Perhaps my imagination is lacking?<p>Edit: Also, I wonder how long before the ultra-rich start spending in truly extravagant projects, besides just bigger boats. I would imagine that by now someone besides Elon would be designing&#x2F;building their own personal space station or something like that..')
