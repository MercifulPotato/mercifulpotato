I think their ad placements are actually that valuable. Click-bait sells extremely well when it&#x27;s manipulative enough and displayed to a wealthy demographic. About 10 years ago you would pay $.1 to $1 for a click from a soccer mom on Fox News. That&#x27;s not search ads, that $1 per non-targeted display ad click. Which was insane back then, not sure now. I&#x27;ve also not touched ads for a decade so maybe I&#x27;m just behind the times.<p>Edit: I actually credit Taboola and Outbrain with being the enablers of actual &quot;fake news&quot;. There was a time when you could make a landing page that looks like the NYT, put an &quot;advertisement&quot; disclaimer in gray letters and 9pt font somewhere, and blast it on Taboola so people buy your supplements. Taboola was fully aware, just loved the money too much.')
