I do love git, and I think its simple mental model of content addressed commits and trees is fantastic. However I do often find myself annoyed by the lack of a &quot;change&quot; concept other than the immutable commit. It seems that this results in review tools bending backwards to add that on top and it makes backports and other cherry-picks harder to follow.<p>One of the show-stopper complaints that I had about Pijul was the lack of a version identifier. However according to this post that has now been resolved which is fantastic news.')
