Computer Scientist would be one term but people starts to assume that’s programming. If I say Theoretical Computer Science then programmers starts to understand the subjects spent learning (I was one course away from having that as my speciality). Even so I feel quite silly being irked about it because school was a long time ago and I’ve forgotten most of it and now I do remember a lot of git flags...<p>Any way, I’m rambling, my point is, Software Engineering as applied science does exist and thrive, you only need to look at some award winning research papers to convince yourself of that. The problem is that people assume they are training engineering when they are coding because the allure is so strong, when what they should try to do is write a research paper.')
