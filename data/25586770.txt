False imprisonment is a problem, but not at the scale of the crime in that city. Baltimore had 350 homicides and 2000+ robberies&#x2F;assaults&#x2F;rapes, and thousands more thefts and property crimes [1].<p>Let me pose a question to you: At what point do we start focusing on victims of crime again? All I hear is about police reform, and about criminal rights. Who stands up for the good people living in the violent neighborhoods of St. Louis, Chicago, Baltimore etc.? When will the focus be set on the victims in those neighborhoods? Do the people there have a right to not be victimized? Who enforces those rights? A 7 year old girl was killed by a stray bullet in Atlanta recently[2]? What is the ACLU doing for her, her family, and other such families?<p>&gt;working a tough beat does not excuse the malfeasance endemic to the Baltimore PD.<p>Maybe the fact that Baltimore cops are forced to deal with the worst of humanity in one of the most violent cities in the world plays a role here? Maybe you need to lower the crime rate before you can expect policing to improve?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crime_in_Baltimore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crime_in_Baltimore</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ajc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;crime&#x2F;latest-loss-from-atlantas-rise-in-deadly-violence-a-7-year-old-girl&#x2F;QBIZT7KZFBABRCGZQOHNGK5OUM&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ajc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;crime&#x2F;latest-loss-from-atlantas-ris...</a>')
