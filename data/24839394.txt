Just because the mechanism you describe is slightly different -- it&#x27;s not a third-party master key, nor a clipper chip, but instead some kind of protocol to request to the application requesting the message history -- doesn&#x27;t change that the end result is the same: unilaterally being able to obtain any message sent by any user <i>retrospectively</i>. Privacy activists are objecting to the end result, not the technical mechanism by which it is implemented.<p>Also such an active mechanism would be quickly thwarted by even moderately sophisticated criminals, either by not using backdoored communication software or by simply blocking requests for the keys. And if the goal is to only capture unsophisticated criminals, surely old fashioned police work is more than sufficient.')
