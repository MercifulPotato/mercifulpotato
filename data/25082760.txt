However, it&#x27;s only good because the whole system is bad (e.g. that labor has no power in the US). So the question whether the law is &quot;good&quot; is rather the question: What&#x27;s the alternative? For as long as there&#x27;s no alternative for Uber etc., the law is good. If there were alternatives (e.g. jobs that have benefits), it would be the worst. To sum it up: Poor people in America have no choice. The system is bad. You have to take what you get (e.g. a Uber Job) and be happy for it.<p>As an aside: all these anecdotes about people using Uber as a sidejob and enjoying it are missing the point: Uber might be a good sidejob for you&#x2F;your friends but that&#x27;s only because either they don&#x27;t get a fulltime job or their fulltime job doesnt pay enough. They don&#x27;t do it because they want to, they do it because they need to.')
