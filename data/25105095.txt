I love it and have been using it for the last 4-ish years. I know it&#x27;s not a lot, but I _am_ in my early 20&#x27;s. :D<p>I started coding only during my undergrad (computer engineer), so first editor&#x2F;IDE was Eclipse, and then moved to Atom -&gt; Sublime -&gt; CLion. By the time I reached my 3rd year, I was writing C&#x2F;C++, and took this course on Operating Systems. The course taught on the OS&#x2F;161 teaching OS [1], which (at the time) used BSD Make and other magic, and I had no idea how to configure my CLion IDE to handle it. The course professor was a Vim evangelist, and actually dedicated a weekend to teach Vim for anyone who wanted to learn. Since, then I have been hooked. (Point being: I haven&#x27;t existed for 40 years, let alone used Vim for that long, nor have I just been told. I think there is some comment in this post that compares learning Emacs&#x2F;Vim to learning foreign languages, which I definitely relate to.)<p>Why I like Vim:<p>1. I can separate my text typing with text manipulation (if that makes any sense).\n2. Cliche, but I love that I don&#x27;t have to use my mouse. I don&#x27;t necessarily care about the speed of it (I have RSI from using my keyboard too much, so I am actively slow) but having to switch to a mouse and then search for the button I want to click, etc. is a significant mental strain&#x2F;distraction for me.\n3. Command mode is not the same as keybindings in IDEs: I have used several IDEs (outside the ones I mentioned above) and I always found keybindings to not be intuitive and also involves having to press a bunch of unrelated keys. I think the reason why Sublime&#x2F;Atom&#x2F;VSCode have a Command Pallette is exactly for this reason, and IMHO, Vim does it better.\n4. And, finally, the most important reason: I don&#x27;t have to leave the terminal. I have a setup that uses Neovim and Tmux, through various high-quality plugins written by some really awesome people. It is seamless. I have latex compiling in the background, I can edit command line arguments to Clang without having to hop through multiple dialog boxes, and so on.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;os161.eecs.harvard.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;os161.eecs.harvard.edu&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: Forgot to put link to OS&#x2F;161<p>Edit: Found out that the original website for the course I took is still up at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ops-class.org&#x2F;courses&#x2F;buffalo&#x2F;CSE421_Spring2017&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ops-class.org&#x2F;courses&#x2F;buffalo&#x2F;CSE421_Spring2017&#x2F;</a>')
