Alexander Hamilton went on at great length in the early federalist papers about the fate of democracies. All failed rather quickly. We formed a republic with democratic elements BECAUSE direct democracy is so tyrannical and doesn&#x27;t protect minority groups leading to it&#x27;s downfall. Despite all the complaints, I&#x27;d love to see a country throughout history with better treatment of minorities. That country just doesn&#x27;t exist and countries making things better for minorities over time was even less known at the USA founding.<p>Finally, foreign affairs are much closer to anarcho-capitalism than anything which implies that anarcho-capitalism is the most free one could theoretically be (though the immediate fall into despotism would make the short-lived freedom of little value).')
