From that POV it&#x27;s kind of foolish, almost a fetish.)<p>That is a very interesting way to think about it!<p>However I disagree that it is foolish, simply because there&#x27;s at least <i>some</i> amount of belief on the part of scientists that computers can simulate physics to any arbitrary degree of precision. If this is the case, then it follows that computers can imitate all of human thought (not just one kind of it), since humans are physical beings.')
