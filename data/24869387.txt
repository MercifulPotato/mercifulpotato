I doubt that the people who would actually commit a public shooting are in the majority, and I strongly doubt that taking down their website is going to kill the group. If anything, it will just strengthen the beliefs of the paranoid people who frequent it.<p>What we should be doing is going after Youtube and other companies that are actively radicalizing people and turning them into Qanon crazies with their irresponsible recommendation algorithms. If Youtube stopped recommending conspiracy theory videos, Qanon and other communities like it would stop growing and would likely die a slow and uneventful death as people simply lose interest.')
