That&#x27;s a valid point.<p>There are CDNs you wouldn&#x27;t have thought to be actually CDNs. Most Wordpress sites (outside of WordPress.com) are actually being run on WordPress.com infrastructure, and even if not they are often shared installations such as from Namecheap or GoDaddy, which shares the same addresses. Not to mention alternative building sites like Wix, Squarespace, Carrd, or even GitHub (surprise!). Or independent shopping sites, most are actually just Etsy (operates on etsy.com) or Shopify (you can use a domain if you want to). And that&#x27;s scratching the surface of how changed web is now.<p>You have underestimated how <i>centralised</i> is the web now. This can be bad or good (despite comments from second-hand critics, the French Minitel was amazing for its time, and on the flipside Facebook).')
