It&#x27;s a shortcut that helps you shorten the learning curve by importing what you already know about language and the things you often say generically from another language. Learning a language is really really hard, so for many, without this shortcut, you&#x27;d barely get anywhere. That&#x27;s the only good it does though, because it will set you back from becoming fluent and will continue to prevent you from thinking in that new langauge.<p>The best way to learn a language is through mimicry, immersion, and repetition as you&#x27;re surrouned by people who only speak that language, who are also friendly, forgiving, and willing to talk to you.
