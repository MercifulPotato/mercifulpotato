The point is; while URLs _can_ be very loosy goosy ways to address code, they can also be made very strict - it will depend on the actual server behind it.<p>As a side note, npm is already pretty poor at providing those guarantees anyway, I find it interesting that it&#x27;s usually assumed to be a safe way to install dependencies.')
