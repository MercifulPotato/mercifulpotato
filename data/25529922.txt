When it first came out it was not perfect and there were lots of limitations to it but then Apple iterated on it with focus on Fitness based features and I finally ended up buying Series 5 version. I could definitely say the gamification (nudging you to close the rings and monthly challenges) has changed my habits and I am more active than ever before because of Apple Watch. It lived up to the hype for me!')
