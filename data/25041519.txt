The only real advantage of wrapping docker is that doing so ensures the docker cli works for introspecting containers.<p>The Docker folks don&#x27;t want people to be wrapping dockerd, because then those infrastructure folk complain about changes&#x2F;additional features in dockerd. Even dockerd is (glacially) moving in the direction of move heavily using containerd, for example using it to pull&#x2F;store images.<p>The longer-term intent appears to be for dockerd being more for implementing docker specific stuff like its networking, swarm&#x2F;stack, and various features needed by the front-end.')
