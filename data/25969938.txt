So it&#x27;s either uninstallable over top of a Play Store-derived APK, or if someone does install it who doesn&#x27;t currently have Element installed, they won&#x27;t be able to install a Play Store-derived APK later â€“ at least not without uninstalling first, and unless they do that with the right adb option, they&#x27;ll lose any app data they have.<p>Ideally you could set up reproducible builds and make sure that the version in the default F-Droid repo stays up-to-date, but reproducible builds may not be practical for you right now (I&#x27;m not sure). Barring that, as you mentioned in the blog post, setting up your own F-Droid repo with self-signed APKs is a good option.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet played with Matrix nearly as much as I would like, but I love the vision. Thanks for your efforts!<p>Also nice plug for F-Droid; they&#x27;re doing good work as well.')
