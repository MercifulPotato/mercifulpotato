It&#x27;s a convenient and easy to use tool for monitoring, management and migration of any IT infrastructure (cloud or on prem).<p>We&#x27;ve built it to solve our own problems with cloud infrastructure, mainly the lack of transparency, vendor lock-in and escalating costs of AWS, Azure, GCS and similar.<p>Adding Djuno to your toolkit creates an open and flexible &quot;portable IT environment (because you can take it with you and run on any infrastructure)&quot; for storage, processing, databases, compute, and HPC (some call it “Omni-cloud”) on top of the existing cloud and&#x2F;or on-prem resources.<p>The monitoring part aggregates all the operational and cost data into a single pane of glass dashboard. The automated management takes care of orchestration and recovery (less Ops more time for Dev).<p>Here is a link to a short product demo video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tA6WJc7PVig<p>I&#x27;m happy to send you a docker image if you want to install and test it. We can also assist in the installation and onboarding process.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you think.<p>here&#x27;s our website https:&#x2F;&#x2F;djuno.io&#x2F;')
