I have policemen in my extenden circle of friends, whom I like to keep at the fringes of &quot;extended&quot;, because they are anything but well trained or professional.<p>The police here fought a case all the way to the local supreme court that they should be allowed to harass people <i>based on the color of their skin</i> - no weasling around, trying to not say the quiet part out loud either, straight up &quot;black people are more prone to crime&quot;.<p>&gt; isnâ€™t that a sign that the police force in question has failed completely?<p>I don&#x27;t know about completely, but if the police aren&#x27;t there for everyone then it certainly is <i>some</i> sort of failure.')
