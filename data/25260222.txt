That being said I do know people in the creative industry that have Mac Pros with 1.5TB of RAM and use all of it and hit swap. For a higher end Pro laptop I would be happy at the 32GB range. However in something like an 8K display (which will be coming!) iMac I would like to see 128GB which will not fit on chip. They are going to have to go to a 2 level memory design at some point.')
