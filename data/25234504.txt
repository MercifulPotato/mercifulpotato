We have to invent better social networks, where scientists can be free to theorize and be connected with their peers, without getting false awards (retweets, likes).<p>In general as humanity we also need to be more aware of the nature of social networks and how they don&#x27;t always elevate the best content.<p>As for credentials, you have to realize that the mechanics of social networks are very good at finding and amplifying the few individuals with credentials that have something wrong (but interesting) to say. What you don&#x27;t get to hear about are the dozens of reviews of that theory, also by experts, that show how its wrong. Because thats just not interesting for a retweet, and its kind of a downer, too.')
