Didn&#x27;t expect to see my local town appear on HN today. One thing they don&#x27;t talk about is the customer service. I find Uber drivers are typically way more friendly and accommodating than the local firms. Not specifically Hart taxis, but one of their competitors in the area - Rushmoor Taxis - have been atrocious. Drivers making racist comments about brown people - their co-workers, drivers huffing and complaining bitterly if I dare use a debit card to pay, driver not even turning up and claiming it&#x27;s my fault I &quot;didn&#x27;t see them&quot; when I am standing out in the open. Our local cab firms need to up their game. It&#x27;s not just about price.')
