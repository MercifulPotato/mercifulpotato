In <i>ALL</i> scenarios they have written about, it&#x27;s been users pushing their content to the police.  The owner of the Ring camera is either specifying to share a specific bit of footage around an event to their local police OR in this case the owner is specifying they want to stream their Ring &#x2F; Security footage to some service which the police can use.  They always mention this as an aside like it&#x27;s not important.<p>I am so frustrated with the continued alarmist reporting from the EFF around Ring cameras.  Can&#x27;t we get information without all the fear mongering? Look at the title of this article and look at the comments.  People don&#x27;t read the content-- they just read the title.')
