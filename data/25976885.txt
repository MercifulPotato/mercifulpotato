All you need to do is make sure the developers who make those sites get rich. Find the sites and tell your friends about them. Subscribe to their work. Buy their merch. Click on the ads. <i>Pay them.</i> Then everyone else will see that sort of site making bank, and they&#x27;ll follow along with similar things.<p>The only reason the web is what it is today is because the money went to the walled gardens and social media sites. To change that, change where the money goes.')
