For those who haven&#x27;t come across this factoid, it actually wasn&#x27;t Plato, but Socrates who famously lamented the harmful effects of writing on memory and teaching. Socrates was a big fan of knowledge transmission through dialogue and discourse.<p>Socrates never wrote anything down, but Plato did, so ironically now we know about Socrates&#x27; disdain of writing through Plato&#x27;s writings (in this case, the Phaedrus). Quoting a paraphrase from Wikipedia [1]<p><i>&quot;... writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot be tailored to specific situations or students; the writer does not have the luxury of examining his reader&#x27;s soul in order to determine the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phaedrus_(dialogue)#Rhetoric,_philosophy,_and_art" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phaedrus_(dialogue)#Rhetoric,_...</a>')
