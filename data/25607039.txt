I&#x27;m a little older than the demographic here and sometimes see myself on this somewhat stressful hamster wheel of &quot;Okay I tired of x, now I should explore y.&quot; Then y becomes tiresome and I move on to z. Over and over. I wondered when that would end. I guess it never does. No one talks about what happens when your life becomes steady. You just get unsatisfied in other ways so then your hobbies take over. Worse, if you don&#x27;t do anything like this and just become a TV&#x2F;social media addict then you brain ages worse than being a productive forever learner. I think about the Buddhist idea of suffering and being forever unsatisfied here a lot and wonder if the meditation crowd has this better figured out.')
