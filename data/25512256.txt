It has nothing to do with the type of app and everything to do with how business works.<p>At scale you have huge enterprise customers with complex setups and they want to integrate your fancy todo list app into their setup and will pay you tons to do it. Your fancy todo list app suddenly needs to have all sorts of security certifications, needs to guarantee some type of uptime, needs to be able to integrate with all sorts of systems and other products (some of which none of your current engineers will have experience with). A new device will be released (think Apple Watch) and you&#x27;re leaving money on the table if you don&#x27;t hire some engineers to put your fancy todo list app on that platform along with the 5 or 6 others it&#x27;s already maintained on.<p>At scale, 1 in a million type bugs&#x2F;problems come up every day and you need more engineers to deal with them.<p>At scale, you are generating and producing (and thus need to be collecting and analyzing) an amazing amount of data, which should be used to better your product, learn about your customers and try to grow your business into providing other products and services your customers want &#x2F; need. All that data collection, storage, and analysis requires more and more engineers.')
