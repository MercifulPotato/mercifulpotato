Especially because you made it sound as if the rest of the 6 Million budget was not even used.<p>In reality, on top of the app development they spend 400k on planning, specification and coordination, 3.2 Million on other software (backend and admin, I suppose), 1.4 Million for deployment(?) and communications, and further maintenance and operations is not in fact accounted for yet.<p>&gt; hat&#x27;s beginning to be half of the relevant population in a country of 6 million, when you take out kids and people in old folks&#x27; homes.<p>Ah, nice moving goalposts there.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s a very successful project and everyone involved deserves praise. Yes, Finland spent less than Germany for very similar results.<p>But they didn&#x27;t spend 400k (let alone 150k) compared to 60 Million. They spent 4 Million compared to 20 Million, which is the overall development costs in Germany, with most of the rest going to the operation of a support call center (and that scales with population size, so legitimately more than 10 times higher in Germany than in Finland).<p>So why the 5 times higher development costs in Germany? Because they didn&#x27;t do a public bid like Finland did. They threw money at some big companies they assumed could do it. And for that they got an app 6 weeks earlier than Finland. It turns out that those 6 weeks happened to be a time of low case numbers so that they didn&#x27;t really matter. But that couldn&#x27;t be known at the time the whole thing was planned, and if the pandemic had developed differently, those 16 million could have saved thousands of lives.')
