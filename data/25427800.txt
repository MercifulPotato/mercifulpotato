Item(by='milankragujevic', descendants=None, kids=[25428448, 25428456, 25428027], score=None, time=1608016230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427761, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s an ISPs role to be fiddling with the application level services of someone&#x27;s internet.<p>It is not but it doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t do it. I am lucky enough to be unlucky enough to be using VDSL2, so I use my own CPE where possible, and often just disable the TR069 interface and CWMP functionality so the ISP can&#x27;t break into my modem.<p>The reason for this is they often factory reset the modem if their automated auditing scripts notice something &quot;forbidden&quot;, i.e. DMZ to my router, which causes me great inconvenience to have to log into the modem again and setup a DMZ. Same would happen if I was using (soft-disabled) Bridge mode.<p>So I just deny them access. On some modems I also download the config, change SSH and Telnet password (as well as &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;telecomadmin&quot; passwords for web UI), remove CWMP entries completely, and then restore the config so the modem won&#x27;t connect.<p>Best part is, if I have a problem that I have to report to the ISP, I first factory reset the modem, it pulls the config via TFTP on TR069 interface, resets again and configures itself according to their wishes - then I try to reproduce the problem, and if it is present, I call them to open a support ticket. If it is not present, I roll back to my config and try to debug the issue on my side.<p>No harm to the modem, no time wasted for me.<p>Sadly this is not at all possible for DOCSIS cable modems nor GPON ONTs for fiber to the home service. There you&#x27;re SOL if your ISP is being mean and displaying anti-user behavior.')
