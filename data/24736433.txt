Probably because of that, I still find SQL hideous. Quel was a lot more orthogonal and clean, but by now SQL has so many more features that they&#x27;re not really comparable. The first version of Ingres ran on a PDP-11&#x2F;70, and the different components (parser, query optimizer, query executor, etc.) ran in separate processes connected via pipes (this was pre-socket Berkeley Unix) because each process could only be 64K 16-bit words. It was hideously slow--ran a lot faster once it was ported to the VAX and everything could run in one process. INGRES originally stood for something like Interactive Graphics Retrieval System, IIRC because the original funding agency wanted a graphics database. Stonebraker wanted to build a relational DBMS so he just went ahead and did it, but gave it a grant-compliant name and wrote some bullshit about graphics to make the funding agency happy.')
