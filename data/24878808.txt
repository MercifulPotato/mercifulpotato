Item(by='newacct583', descendants=None, kids=[24883148, 24879945], score=None, time=1603542991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878240, text='Even state polling in 2016 was pretty good, historically.  The reason to think otherwise is that there was a specific error (non-college white voters swinging to R) that happened not to be tracked well (those voters don&#x27;t respond as well to polling) nor accounted for (most pollsters didn&#x27;t weight for education).  And it happened to be most concentrated in a few states in the upper midwest that were close to the tipping point.  AND it happened to be JUST ENOUGH to have predicted a very narrow (sub 1% in PA&#x2F;WI&#x2F;MI) win incorrectly.<p>To wit: 2016 was a perfect storm.  Swap any of those factors above and 538 would have been predicting a 50:50 race (instead of 70:30) at election day and Trump&#x27;s very narrow victory would have been &quot;correctly predicted&quot;.<p>Assuming that&#x27;s going to happen again seems a bit like magical thinking to me.  Remember that in 2012 the polls were &quot;wrong&quot; in the opposite direction (undercounting Obama votes by a bit) and no one cared.')
