AT&amp;T and Verizon are also large residential ISPs, and CenturyLink is another, and they&#x27;re a Tier-1 too. Comcast is effectively Tier-1 in the US, but they don&#x27;t have an international network (yet?).<p>b) residential connections are setup to be unbalanced flows, and peering policies at networks with restrictive policies generally require roughly balanced flows. Very few networks that do business with consumers are going to get balanced flows. Maybe a consumer oriented backup service can, if they mostly receive backups and don&#x27;t send a lot of restores; 1-1 messaging without persistent server storage should be pretty much balanced, but nearly everything else is pretty much never going to be balanced. Of course, tier-1 networks also won&#x27;t peer with you if you&#x27;re a customer or have been a customer recently; so if you do end up with appropriate flows to your transit provider, you&#x27;d need to switch to another provider for some amount of time before coming back to ask for peering, and they may increase requirements in the meantime.<p>Things were different when we had local&#x2F;regional ISPs (dial-up and DSL line sharing). As those got big enough to justify multiple transit providers, they would gravitate towards peering places, because you can pickup multiple transit providers easily, and also peer to reduce costs for both networks when connecting to other networks at the peering place. A local ISP doesn&#x27;t really care about traffic balance, they just want traffic off their transit link; and content networks don&#x27;t care about traffic balance, they just want traffic off their transit link.<p>If I had my way, we&#x27;d get mandatory line sharing for the last mile (and something for wireless?), so that we could have meaningful competition in IP networking at the local level again. Something where <i>all</i> the last mile infrastructure providers are prohibited from offering retail service would be best; they could keep their tier-1 ISP business, and their last mile business, but someone else would have to at least glue the two parts together.')
