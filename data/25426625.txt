They often have constraints on the solution such as that White must deliver checkmate in two moves (three ply). This is what I assume you&#x27;re referring to.<p>A position from an actual game (or that easily could have been) that demonstrates a tactic (or combination of them) is generally known as a &quot;chess puzzle&quot;, largely because the term &quot;chess problem&quot; was already squatted on.<p>Somewhere in between the two is the &quot;study&quot;, which is a constructed position, less artificial than a chess problem but still very carefully made to have a unique solution that walks a tightrope and generally requires absolutely exact calculation rather than working by general tactical principles.')
