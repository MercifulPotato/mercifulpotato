And, judging from this article, even hatred (anger without end) may be in fashion too.  I&#x27;ll offer a simple explanation.<p>The author talks about the connection of anger with memories of past wrongdoings.  In my personal experience, it&#x27;s hard to forget past wrongdoings when the person who did wrong seems like they haven&#x27;t changed or aren&#x27;t capable of changing.  Then, any restitution seems less meaningful because the harm might very well happen again.  In that case, I <i>do</i> agree that a grudge is rational.  That&#x27;s because forgiving and&#x2F;or forgetting actually might expose you to further harm.  However, I don&#x27;t recall the author really mentioning this take on it.  I may be mistaken, but it seemed that their argument was that the simple fact that any wrongdoing occurred to begin with is reason enough to hold a grudge and that this could somehow be considered rational.  That doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me.<p>That being said, I believe Trump is the reason we&#x27;re seeing such angry cultural trends.  In him, we have a person who has posed a constant psychological (or even not just psychological) threat to maybe as much as half the population of the US over the past four years.  He is a man who has done real harm to many people.  I also believe many people look at him and see someone who feels no remorse about any of his actions and, indeed, may even seem fundamentally incapable of remorse.<p>It&#x27;s completely rational to hold a grudge against a person like that and he has been inescapable for almost half a decade.  I think he&#x27;s been acting as a sort of psychological vortex that&#x27;s driving everyone towards the angry side of the spectrum.  I&#x27;m sure the effect has even bled outside the political sphere into other parts of society.  In my own life, I&#x27;ve often seen the way in which an unpleasant experience or emotion can sit in the back of my mind and color my perception of everything.  I&#x27;m sure everyone has experienced something similar.<p>It&#x27;s been telling to watch the way in which the world has taken on his pathologies.  As much as modern society has chosen to de-emphasize the importance of king-like figures, we humans are still psychologically programmed to take queues from people in positions of power.  In that sense, we&#x27;ve all unwittingly become members of one big, broken family with an abusive father.')
