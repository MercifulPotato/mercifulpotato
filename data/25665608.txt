Though they&#x27;ve put tariffs on more than just high-tech goods. This makes sense because even the manufacture of t-shirts or pencils fuels the economy of China and therefore its tax base and military so sanctioning all products of China makes a lot of sense.<p>&gt; So they have a single exit, to never buy again anything from the US but substitute everything with alternatives. Sooner or later they will succeed to do that and then the sanctions would not be efficient any more.<p>China can and should try to do this. Even with all the resources of the state China hasn&#x27;t yet built a reliable jet engine, let alone leading edge semiconductor plant.<p>Now they need to do all of this simultaneously. It&#x27;s very difficult and it&#x27;s not clear whether they&#x27;ll succeed at any of these endeavors.<p>&gt; Now all this formerly very successful US discourse has been exposed as a pack of lies, as it appears to have been just a trap conceived to ensnare other countries to become economically dependent on the US, in order to be vulnerable to economic sanctions.<p>From what I can tell most countries (like Vietnam and India) are trying to get closer to the US militarily and economically and further away from China.<p>The only exception is the European Union which was already very close to the US militarily and economically.')
