(It&#x27;s also not usually that bad, and it&#x27;s almost always a <i>dry</i> heat.)<p>The one time I visited Boston (for an undergraduate research program), it was <i>frosty</i> the first few days, and then hellishly humid every day thereafter. The dorm I was staying in didn&#x27;t really have temperature control, and I got the sense that AC wasn&#x27;t as common.<p>Your mileage may vary!')
