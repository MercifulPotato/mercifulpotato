Item(by='AnonC', descendants=None, kids=[25069163, 25069162], score=None, time=1605184170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060166, text='&gt; Mr. Son pulled his conglomerate back from the void with a sharp and surprising strategy shift, selling off holdings that have been central to his investment and operating blueprint, and buying back shares.<p>I somehow get the feeling that SoftBank and Masayoshi Son aren’t great at investing and have managed to throw a whole lot of money aggressively into ventures that any common person would doubt about returns, scaling, etc. At the same time, it has sold off what could continue to be profitable, like ARM Holdings.<p>I honestly don’t understand SoftBank’s business model and how it expects to generate great returns. It doesn’t even look close to the stock market advice of “if you get 6 calls out of 10 right, that’s great.” It looks like SoftBank has a lot of money (or had). Business sense and agility? Not so much.')
