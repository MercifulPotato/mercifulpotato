Instead of storing your passwords in a vault it derives your password on the fly from your master password and supplied realm string (for example, resource URL). This way you do not have to manage, backup or sync your password vault (or trust its management to a third party) as your passwords are available immediately anywhere.<p>Instead of having to install a binary on your computer I thought it would be nice to have a web-based utility. Everything is done in your browser, so nothing is sent to any other servers to process the request.<p>I&#x27;m definitely open to criticism, feedback, suggestions, etc..')
