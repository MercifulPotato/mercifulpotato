Item(by='smt88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609436006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590212, text='&gt; <i>This is a very misleading statement that I see thrown around a lot. Either it&#x27;s done in bad faith, or it&#x27;s ignorant of how corporate taxes work (and why).</i><p>So when people disagree with you, they are either malicious or stupid? There&#x27;s 0% chance that you&#x27;re wrong, even though you&#x27;re in the minority of everyone who looks at this and thinks, &quot;Wow, Amazon should pay more in taxes&quot;?<p>&gt; <i>If you don&#x27;t earn a profit, there&#x27;s nothing to tax. Amazon has been (to the credit of their extremely patient investors) funneling their revenue back into growing the company instead of giving it to investors and the government.</i><p>No, they haven&#x27;t. They have been turning a profit. If you reinvest your money in your company, it doesn&#x27;t show up in your income statement as profit.<p>The reason Amazon doesn&#x27;t pay taxes is because of friendly tax law. Part of the proposal from the left in the US is to tax Amazon based on the numbers in their actual financial statements, instead of playing lots of games with depreciation, stock compensation, and carry-forward losses.<p>So your argument here is somewhat orthogonal to the actual discussion, which is <i>how</i> to tax corporations, not whether corporations are acting within the law. We already know that what they&#x27;re doing is legal, we just don&#x27;t want it to be legal anymore.')
