(I am not the person who downvoted you, however.)<p>Both z&#x2F;OS and Windows NT use the word &quot;subsystem&quot; to refer to OS components, but the commonality is purely at the terminological and most abstract conceptual level, I don&#x27;t see any commonality at the level of technical details, and I see no evidence of any concrete technical influence from z&#x2F;OS on Windows NT.<p>&quot;Subsystem&quot; is a highly generic term used to refer to an OS subcomponent across many operating systems – z&#x2F;OS, OS&#x2F;400, OpenVMS, Windows, Linux, among others. The meaning of the term varies widely, and what counts as a subsystem isn&#x27;t always precisely defined. In z&#x2F;OS, &quot;subsystem&quot; is a quite precisely defined term – it is something which is installed by calling the &quot;IEFSSI REQUEST=ADD&quot; macro, and which then is displayed in the output of the &quot;DISPLAY SSI&quot; console command. By contrast, in Windows NT, the term &quot;subsystem&quot; is never clearly defined – for example, is Client&#x2F;Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS) a subsystem or part of the Win32 subsystem (a subsystem of a subsystem)? Is the Session Manager Subsystem an integral subsystem or a part of the integral subsystem? I&#x27;m not sure there is a clear answer to these questions, whereas the question of what counts as a subsystem on z&#x2F;OS is quite clear – is it visible in the &quot;DISPLAY SSI&quot; output?<p>(Slightly complicating the issue is that z&#x2F;OS has both subsystems and functional subsystems, which are different things despite the similar name – subsystems implement the Subsystem Interface (SSI), functional subsystems implement the Functional Subsystem Interface (FSI).)')
