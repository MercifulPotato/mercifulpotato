Can someone shed some light about refugee situation around NATO&#x2F;EU? While humanitarian aspects must be taken care of, I only see refugee situation in Germany as a negative thing. It brings nothing to the country, and in fact brings other nonsense such as religious fundamentalism. These people are not going to assimilate into German culture.<p>Edit: I know youâ€™re downvoting based on political stance. Would be great if we can engage in a discussion. Could you share your thoughts please?')
