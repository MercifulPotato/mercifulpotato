Certainly there are facts that are not interesting to a large majority, doesn&#x27;t mean that they are ignorant. Personally my brain does not work well with remembering specific facts, I always admire people who can recall so easily.<p>Anyway I do not want to take away from the thread, just a bit surprised at that sweeping statement, unless I misinterpreted it.')
