I agree with you, way more leg room, much less stress.<p>There&#x27;s a train that departs every hour in the day (and every 2-hours during midnight hours). I don&#x27;t even need to plan anything. Just walk up to the train station and go. If you do that with airplanes, your costs double or more.<p>-------<p>Once you account for the ~1 hour in airport security, you&#x27;re basically at the same speed as a train anyway. Then the significantly inferior location of LaGuardia vs Penn Station comes into play (you really can get to far more locations from Penn Station than LaGuardia).<p>--------<p>&gt; The trains are also more comfortable than [coach] plane seats by a long mile<p>I did take the higher-end Acela Express once, just to see what its about. The prices are way higher, but you get an entire table for you (and your family).<p>Its very expensive, but if I were ever going to take children to NYC, I&#x27;d probably consider it.<p>I found a review for the Acela, it matches my experience: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepointsguy.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;acela-business-class&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepointsguy.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;acela-business-class&#x2F;</a><p>When I took the Acela Express, families were out playing board games during the train ride. Train-level comfort is far superior to plane comfort.<p>I&#x27;d say Coach Train seats are comparable to Airplane first-class. And first-class Train seats are... well.. you can see the Acela review for yourself.')
