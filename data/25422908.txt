Is anyone going to turn this on other than bros? &quot;Bros&quot; like me with a VO2Max that is firmly in the &quot;high&quot; category for oldsters (or, to brag, probably any age group), but because we&#x27;re narcissistic we turn it on knowing full well (or at least hoping) we will never get a notification?<p>Or do there exist actual people with really low VO2Max measurements that need to be told by their watch that they&#x27;re out of shape, rather than letting huffing and wheezing up two flights of stairs being their guide? IOW, is this feature going to tell <i>anyone</i>, in shape or not, something they don&#x27;t already know?<p>Thing is, I hate to poo-poo what can be a useful feature. I look at it from time-to-time (VO2Max has been there for a couple of years(?), the notifications are new). Went in literally Christmas Day last year for surgery, the feature has been useful for measuring the road to recovery as I dragged my VO2Max out of the basement of sitting on my butt for a few months. But I suppose that if one <i>is</i> out of shape, it will be encouraging to watch the number go up. I just question the usefulness of notifications.')
