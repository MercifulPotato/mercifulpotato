Item(by='yazaddaruvala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602712904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779528, text='Yeah, that is a great question, and the only answer I have really is &quot;faith&quot;. Specifically, &quot;faith in Elon Musk&quot;. Which entirely depends on your risk profile and if your vision for the world aligns with Elon&#x27;s and you (like him) are tolerant that your investment might hit $0. And frankly, for me personally, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough for me to invest.<p>That said, given that TSLA&#x27;s startegy is much like AAPL and AMZN, i.e. vertical integration, I don&#x27;t feel they are &quot;dipping their hands into many fields&quot;, but I do agree with the sentiment that they are &quot;challenging an ever increasing number of incumbents&quot; and its unlikely they can outperform all of them at the same time.<p>We will need to wait for TSLA&#x27;s next 2 quarters to really know if they can sustain&#x2F;grow their EPS. Which will be the only real test of &quot;are they spreading themselves thin?&quot; (compared with &quot;spreading themselves thicc?&quot;).')
