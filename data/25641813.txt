However here are some resolutions to your objections;<p>&gt;How do you ensure that this classification of critical&#x2F;non-critical happens accurately?<p>Define &quot;accurately&quot;. We are playing the balance of probability based on the &quot;domain experts&quot; knowledge base. In some cases it would be obvious. For example take this mRNA research; this great article from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-story-of-mrna-how-a-...</a> states;<p><pre><code>  In the natural world, the body relies on millions of tiny proteins to keep itself alive and healthy, and it uses mRNA to tell cells which proteins to make. If you could design your own mRNA, you could, in theory, hijack that process and create any protein you might desire â€” antibodies to vaccinate against infection, enzymes to reverse a rare disease, or growth agents to mend damaged heart tissue.\n</code></pre>\nA moderately scientific mind can easily see the vast life-saving potential here (analogous to stem cell research promise but from a different direction) so why wouldn&#x27;t we label it &quot;critical&quot; and keep funding it until the breakthrough is found? Note the issue was not of Science but of Mechanism which is almost always solved with Time and Technology. UPenn failed this test miserably and completely.<p>&gt;How do you ensure that this &#x27;non critical&#x27; funding isn&#x27;t simply a waste of money? ... How do you deal with vaccine technology that is junk and will never produce a safe and efficacious product?<p>This is where the system has to absorb the losses when you do decide to cut the chord but this should not be based on imaginary &quot;market&#x2F;financial needs&quot;. Revenue generation from various sources somewhat guarantees that.<p>&gt;So unlimited funding for unlimited projects as long as they are critical according to some review committee? We might have a tiny problem doing that.. :)<p>Of course, this is nothing new; we are dealing with Humans after all. Just make your criteria for &quot;critical&quot; very stringent and the people in charge knowledgeable. This is how Science has always worked when the &quot;bean counters&quot; don&#x27;t get involved.<p>Think of it this way; in any project there is always the core&#x2F;essence&#x2F;kernel Science&#x2F;Technology&#x2F;Whatever which is the primary reason for its existence while the others are ancillary which exist only to support the primary. If you make the mistake of taking the ancillary for the primary, you will lose almost always (i put &quot;almost&quot; to factor in the role of Chance :-).')
