The product they care about is finished being launched in just 12 days. It is insane to me that email service providers like AWS and sendinblue actually require you to &quot;warm up your ips&quot; as though you were a spammer...<p>I&#x27;d pay thousands to actually get delivery. Is there some white glove VIP service somewhere?')
