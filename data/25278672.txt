[L]GPLv3 requires that people are able to replace the [L]GPLv3&#x27;d binaries in their own devices if they want to (so they actually take advantage of the code being FLOSS instead of some nice theoretical novelty - ie. it is nice that my router uses Linux and find it amusing that it comes with the GPLv2 printed out, but what is the point if i can&#x27;t open it up and fix&#x2F;change some things that annoy me?). Apple wants to keep the devices they sell you under tight control, so [L]GPLv3 rubs them wrong.<p>And so they avoid it.<p>Related: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tivoization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tivoization</a><p>It might also be about patents since IIRC [L]GPLv3 requires that if you use a [L]GPLv3&#x27;d program and that program infringes some of your patents then you are not allowed to sue others over their use of your patents in the same program.')
