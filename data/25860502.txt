Item(by='ultimoo', descendants=None, kids=[25860518, 25866997, 25865114], score=None, time=1611245945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25852438, text='&gt; &quot;blue all over&quot; = 0<p>&gt; &quot;blue at the extremities, body pink&quot; = 1<p>&gt; &quot;no cyanosis&quot; = 2<p>I wonder if they have updated guidance and training for scoring non-white babies. Brown and black babies probably don&#x27;t turn blue in the same way white babies turn blue. In fact, a brown baby that&#x27;s off color may appear to be a &quot;healthy looking&quot; - to the untrained eye - pink when in fact they should appear brown when healthy. I&#x27;d be curious to see mortality rate deviations for non-white babies vs. white babies (especially in non-metro areas that are more homogenous).')
