Moderating content in a manner they find acceptable is one thing, but moderating content in a way to make sure that everyone finds it acceptable is simply not possible and is only polarizing everyone.<p>I don&#x27;t think social media was intended to become the new Town Hall, but here are, and private companies are shutting down discussions and discussion platforms.  We need to shoot for federated social media that actually owned and ran by the user, not by a separate company.  I don&#x27;t trust any government with moderating speech, but I trust companies even less (they were not elected to).')
