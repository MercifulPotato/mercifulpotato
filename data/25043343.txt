Never have I ever understood concepts through repetition alone. Grinding problems is for building patterns via using different input sets, not unlike ML. It is true that it &quot;clicks&quot; sometimes after a threshold and you actually understand it, but usually what grinding does is reinforce the algorithm without actually understanding it - e.g. surely you know that c squared equals a squared plus b squared, you&#x27;ve probably grinded that enough to memorize that equation. Can you prove it or at least explain why that equation is correct? Because i can&#x27;t, not even after repeating it a million times. That&#x27;s the difference between memorization and understanding.')
