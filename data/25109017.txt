There&#x27;s no colored bathrooms and stuff like that.<p>At least in America now there are laws specifically disallowing discrimination against blacks and minorities. But it appears in Romania and the rest of Eastern Europe there is still widespread discrimination against the Roma.  Looks pretty barbaric to me!')
