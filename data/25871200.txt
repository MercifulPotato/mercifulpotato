Root shells on random sockets, &quot;accidental&quot; eval() in web UI elements, hardcoded passwords, actual processes just called `backdoor`. I especially liked being able to remove the IPMI password from a SuperMicro board I bought from eBay by making a HTTP request to a &quot;buggy&quot; endpoint that printed the root password back in plaintext.')
