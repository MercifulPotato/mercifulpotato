In general, if person A puts $5K a year into a 401k between ages 25-35 and then stops, while person B puts in $5K a year between ages 35-65, at age 65 person A will have a larger retirement balance despite having put in only 1&#x2F;3 as much principal. This generalizes to the rest of your net worth (salary+stock) as well.<p>I&#x27;m with you on the opportunity cost of money but I don&#x27;t see how it has anything to do with what we are discussing.<p>&gt; The economics of software are simply different. Someone good enough to start a business that brings in $10-20K MRR and barely survive is almost certainly good enough to get hired and paid $200K+ by any number of companies. If you&#x27;re not going big or going home, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to do a software startup these days.<p>This is not true at all. There are tons of FAANG engineers plotting their exit to start their own business for the reasons of freedom and impact. It&#x27;s not just about the money. Also, if you can reach $10-20k MRRâ€”that&#x27;s a lot more scalable than your salary at a company ever would be.<p>Don&#x27;t confound entrepreneurship solely as a vehicle for getting rich.')
