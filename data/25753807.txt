Chat channels area already a default compartmentalization but beyond that, chat services default to shared organizational structures like channels and threads.<p>In email each user must manage the conversations themselves through labels or what have you.  In successful chat systems, you can passively benefit from the organization of others.  Mailing lists help but aren&#x27;t enough in their current, aging incarnation.<p>It might be possible to disrupt the email space by recognizing and adopting these UX differences.')
