They have no legal obligation to do anything. They know this. So they pick their battles where they know they can kill a few people and get away with it. When it comes to actually having a chance at saving lives, they run away and hide, and get rewarded for it.<p>See the recent-ish school shooting in Florida where the on-duty cop ran away like a baby and let children die. Brian Miller. Still has his job. No one gives a shit.<p>Cops in the US are cowards who don&#x27;t deserve to arm with a super soaker.')
