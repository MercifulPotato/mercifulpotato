I did contracting work for hospitals, upgrading their infrastructure.  Strictly backend network stuff -- routers, switches -- but got to sit in on all of the IT meetings.<p>Oracle asked them for license count and a core count of their environment.  Newer IT guy sent them all of that info, asked for pricing for upgrades to a few newer Dell systems.<p>Oracle thought they were only using about 3&#x2F;4 of the machines &#x2F; cores &#x2F; licenses they were billing them for, and promptly demanded the hospital group pay for the rest of their usage, as far back as they could prove.  Lawyers got involved fast.<p>My work finished before it was resolved so I never got an exact answer but IIRC they paid something extra to Oracle.')
