Everybody swears it&#x27;s rock-solid, beautiful, and easy to configure. Then when you ask anyone to have a look at their specific setup, they&#x27;ll cover the screen with their bodies and panic, &quot;ah no, I kind of messed everything up recently, haha, but you can&#x27;t really blame the software for that, can you? Everyone else&#x27;s installation is super clean though&quot;. After working with ~10 different Jira installations, I&#x27;m still looking for one where that&#x27;s true.<p>I kinda feel this way about every project management tool, be it a personal or professional one. You&#x27;re always chasing the dragon for how clean it was when you originally configured it.')
