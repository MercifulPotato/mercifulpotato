For beginners working in high level languages it is an implementation detail they need not be concerned about.<p>Growing up with BASIC, I didn&#x27;t have any understanding of pointers or how memory worked. PEEK and POKE, which I only saw used in other people&#x27;s programs and examples, were black magic as far as I could tell. It wasn&#x27;t until I learned C that I actually understood them but I still managed to write a whole lot of programs without ever using them.<p>To be a professional programmer I&#x27;d agree though. If you don&#x27;t understand how pointers work, regardless of the language you&#x27;re using, you&#x27;re probably not good at your job.')
