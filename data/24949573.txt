Occasionally a package will require manual intervention to update properly. The manual intervention steps are generally pretty easy and documented on the Arch homepage, so if you haven’t updated in a while and are concerned, all you really have to do is check the homepage. But I don’t even do that. I just pacman -Syu and check if it failed. For the past few years this has worked out just fine. Most of the packages, I don’t even have installed, so I hardly ever hit a manual intervention step.<p>Of course, Debian doesn’t require manual intervention for most updates, but it also <i>isn’t rolling release</i>. If you want packages that are actually recent you have to sit on Sid, which is a lot less stable than Arch. And if you have a Debian machine that’s a couple years old and you want to upgrade it to the latest Debian version? Good luck. Some of that isn’t Debian’s fault, but whereas on Arch major, breaking package changes are rare but irregular, on Debian they tend to hit you simultaneously in one major upgrade. For home machines, I definitely prefer an occasional manual intervention and continuous fixes over major breakages every couple years where I often just give up and reinstall from scratch.<p>That said I use Arch a lot less nowadays as I’ve moved onto NixOS. Nix is clearly headed somewhere new, though it remains to be seen if the complexity of the approach is actually maintainable.<p>If I want to make an idiomatic Arch package, it’s usually easy: PKGBUILDs are intuitive and simple. Nix is much the same for most stuff, especially since most of the boilerplate for various build systems has been automated; though for a program as complex as Kubernetes its a nightmare, to be sure. For Dpkg though, it seems like so much complexity, and I don’t think I ever really had a good experience.<p>And honestly, I have no idea how to make an RPM package anymore.')
