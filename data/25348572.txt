It is not. And if you call more than 80% use (which we don&#x27;t even have) &quot;exceptional load&quot;, it still isn&#x27;t the same as &quot;close to collapse&quot;. Have you even looked at the charts? If you count the emergency reserve, there is still capacity for 15000 more beds. A &quot;doubling of cases&quot; would put 4000 more people into ICU, so it wouldn&#x27;t break the system at all. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intensivregister.de&#x2F;#&#x2F;aktuelle-lage&#x2F;zeitreihen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intensivregister.de&#x2F;#&#x2F;aktuelle-lage&#x2F;zeitreihen</a><p>As for nurses working overtime, do you have any data for that? Quoting some individual hospital managers warning of &quot;possible collapse&quot; is not really evidence. They can also be politically motivated (&quot;see, we really need more money for our ICU section&quot;). You can also find individual hospital managers saying everything is fine.')
