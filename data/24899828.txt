Even if ReactOS was stable and perfectly compatible with Windows, I doubt many people would switch to it<p>I see Microsoft leaving ReactOS alone until it starts biting into that pie. If manufacturers started making deals to have ReactOS pre-installed on machines, that&#x27;s when Microsoft&#x27;s going to go in.<p>I doubt they&#x27;re going to bother otherwise though.')
