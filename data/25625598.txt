Because we shared office (and I found them an intern), I got a very good look at how they&#x27;re working. What I&#x27;ve seen can be summarized as: people who have zero clue or interest in statistics writing &quot;reports&quot;, with &quot;graphs&quot; they don&#x27;t even understand beyond &quot;pointing up = good&quot;, proving positive ROI to customers - who also have zero clue or interest in understanding the numbers in the report, and not enough visibility into the whole funnel to independently check attribution. Both the agency and the clients were engaging in a shared and completely unjustified fiction of positive advertising return - and as long as both sides were happy, the money kept flowing.<p>I&#x27;ve been long since suspecting a lot of advertising on-line looks like that. Every now and then, I see evidence in favor. Like that good ol&#x27; Optimizely debacle, where it turned out Optimizely was structurally optimized to help people make invalid A&#x2F;B tests, that erred on the side of concluding the interventions were working[0]. And sure, big brands with some superstar ad teams probably do this right. But I think there&#x27;s enough slack in most businesses that advertising spend can get quite far detached from actual ROI without anyone noticing (and with plenty of people happily riding the gravy train).<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10872359" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10872359</a>')
