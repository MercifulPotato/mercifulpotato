Given this, I&#x27;d say this article is an interesting historical document that bears little relevance today. It&#x27;s one that would probably hold true if Microsoft had never reacted and still tried to drive their company mostly through Windows and Office sales.<p>The one point that I think still stands though is that &quot;No one is afraid of Microsoft anymore&quot; -- this is true especially because they couldn&#x27;t enter the mobile market like they intended and that&#x27;s where computing is radiating from today in so many respects (and especially those of which where Microsoft has traditionally often operated in).<p>But they&#x27;re absolutely alive and kicking!')
