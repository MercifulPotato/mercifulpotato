Transcoding doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference either. It&#x27;s a poor codec, but the bitrate is high enough that it doesn&#x27;t matter. You can ABX test it yourself if you&#x27;re so inclined, purely in software, with high quality wired audio hardware. I have. You&#x27;ll see the codec isn&#x27;t the problem.<p>So when your Bluetooth device sounds better wired than wireless, or works better with AptX or some other patented nonsense codec - most likely the problem is careless software&#x2F;firmware (or outright crippling to push patent licenses), not the spec being bad.<p>(I say this as someone who was gotten into flamewars over the quality of ffmpeg&#x27;s AAC implementation and found bugs in the Opus reference encoder; I can tell when audio quality drops)')
