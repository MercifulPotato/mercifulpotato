In this case, some of the traders decided to break the law because there is no real oversight at this kind of firm. When looking at reputable proprietary trading firms (i.e. the kind that don&#x27;t just hire random people and give them money to play with) this type of behavior simply does not happen. I agree that these types of places are extremely scummy (and are probably responsible for a ton of insider trading crap &amp; the like), but they are not representative of the HFT industry at all.<p>As for the comment on volatility, the idea behind HFT is actually to help reduce volatility. Outside of a few bugs (such as the Knight Capital debacle you mention) and the Global Financial Crisis, it seems like volatility is trending downwards in part due to HFT. In the same vein, liquidity has exploded thanks to HFT (which is why exchanges pay for HFT). It means that you no longer have to wait minutes or hours for your trades to execute and you can usually get the most up to date price very easily.')
