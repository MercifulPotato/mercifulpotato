Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603129153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822060, text='&gt;What an unintuitive result that being even a meter under ground breaks what is, up to that point, a fine model.<p>It doesn&#x27;t break it at all. The meter above you can be treated as a hollow shell, which surprisingly has zero net pull, and the solid sphere below can be treated as a point mass just as before.<p>Just remember these two facts, each provable with a simple integral calculation, usually done in high school physics or freshman college physics: a uniform sphere has the same gravitational pull on an object as a point mass at it&#x27;s center, and the net gravitational pull on an object inside a spherical shell is zero.<p>This all works under perfect spheres, uniform (at the spherical shell level at least) density... There are other cases it works, but this simple case is the basic idea.')
