These groups have ravaged local and independent businesses, driven out lawful citizens and generally destroyed any economy downtown Portland had. They’ve exacerbated the already worsening economic crisis due to Covid. The damage these groups have done, and the lives they’ve taken as a result of their actions far surpass the recent insurrection on the capital.')
