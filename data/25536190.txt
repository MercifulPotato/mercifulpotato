Space is harsh. Even just doing colonization within the solar system is hard to swallow. It&#x27;s not possible to live on most planets even if we assume that everyone stays in what amounts to a grounded space station. Since we have not yet unlocked fusion we will always have to stay close to the sun. Mars is already too far away. Venus has an extreme atmosphere that causes it to be extremely hot. If a crackpot said we have to build a 100000 person colony in space this century we would have to start on the moon even though there is no water there. The primary reason would be that we are still close enough to the sun that we can use solar panels to generate energy. Space colonization without fusion is simply put: a joke.<p>If space was easy then our galaxy would have been devoured by some grey goo AI (not life) a long time ago. Life has to build artificial habitats and live in them. AIs can just stay in space forever as long as they can gather enough resources.')
