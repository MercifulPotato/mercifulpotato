Because people don&#x27;t read? I don&#x27;t know. Why would people keep failing to make the distinction between &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;consequence free speech&quot;?<p>Free Speech is, in most societies considered to be a concept that applies to the <i>government&#x27;s</i> ability to censor people&#x27;s speech. This is well defined in the case of the US 1st amendment: it has zero implication on private entities.<p>Edit to add:<p>So in the example case, the US President has been banned from Twitter. People are claiming he&#x27;s been &quot;censored&quot; by twitter. The <i>government</i> has done nothing to stop him saying whatever the fuck he wants, on national television even.<p>The hypocrisy on this topic by right wingers is pretty crazy when you think about it: Apparently a baker can refuse to make a cake because he can&#x27;t sleep at night if two dudes kiss, but a social media platform can&#x27;t stop someone from posting violence inciting messages on their website?')
