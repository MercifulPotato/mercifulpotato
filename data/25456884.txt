There is a vested interest in convincing me of something as opposed to being as up front and obvious as possible.<p>They aren’t trying to teach me as much as they are trying to persuade me.<p>This ends up resulting in awkward doublespeak as you described.<p>I love GNU and truly want it to survive and prosper into the future. I feel like the younger audience is too aware of these tricks and the technique at this point does more harm than good. Instead or persuasion, it is losing trust. Which is sad because of all the organizations in tech(when you include for-profit companies) GNU is one of the organizations I can trust the most to act in my best interests.')
