Item(by='convolvatron', descendants=None, kids=[25308531], score=None, time=1607117743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307845, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builder.wescoboots.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builder.wescoboots.com</a>. I still have a pair that I bought 20 years ago that I have worn for a large part of that time (with yearly resoling). They have a deal where you can return a pair of boots and they will rebuild them (keeping only the uppers) for half the cost of new.<p>they are not stylish. they will last forever. you send them your measurements and they make a form (last) which they keep and you can order against again. that first pair had some minor fit issues, I sent corrections and the second pair was a perfect fit.')
