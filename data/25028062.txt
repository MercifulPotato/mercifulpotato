What&#x27;s special about emacs to do that vs any other scriptable editor? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used an editor that&#x27;s not scriptable since the late 80s. All the ones I&#x27;ve used could run script and those scripts could call out other programs. Is there anything emacs is doing here that they&#x27;s other editors wouldn&#x27;t do?')
