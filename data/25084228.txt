The parent comment is talking about a specific (long term) promotion that makes the decision very reasonable,  but a realistic fee might be:<p>- $15+2 for say, pad thai + taxes\n- $4 for delivery\n- $3 for tip<p>I&#x27;m not saying that paying 40% extra for food is a reasonable decision for most people, but (a) I can afford to pay $7 to avoid traveling across town for a specific meal I want, and (b) these numbers get even better with a larger order. If you&#x27;re the consumer that wants a single $2 bean burrito, the market answer is clearly that you should put a dozen in your freezer and microwave them yourself.<p>I also think the Doordash business model is not super valuable, but it clearly has <i>some</i> value. Restaurants make an increasing portion of their revenue from delivery (especially during COVID), and having to staff, manage, and route a delivery person themselves is not their core competency. Does signing up with Doordash marginally increase revenue? Yes.')
