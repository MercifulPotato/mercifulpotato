In the UK for example, engineering, especially software engineering is just fundamentally a low social status job, and people with high status running companies are fundamentally adverse to paying for it, and that&#x27;s unlikely to change for a generation or more.<p>If you try to recommend people pay more to get better engineers and stop them all going to the US so they can build bigger and stronger companies here you just get dead eyes back - they can&#x27;t comprehend why you&#x27;d give an engineer money.<p>At some point you need to look after yourself and go elsewhere.')
