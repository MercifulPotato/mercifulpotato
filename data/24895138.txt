Few months into learning Lisp, I bought a hardcover SICP and, for some reason, decided to do exercises in it on paper. Few exercises in, as I was writing Lisp code with a pen in hand, suddenly something clicked in my head - like my brain JIT-compiled a new processing module - and from then on, I no longer needed to mentally count or track the parens. I just knew how many and where they were, it dropped to semiconscious level. Ever since, I&#x27;m very comfortable with s-expressions; in fact, I prefer them as a notation to Algol&#x2F;C-like code.')
