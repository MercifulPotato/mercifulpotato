The camera came with an insert saying they would give you a &quot;free gift&quot; if you left a four or five star review. I contacted Amazon support with images and they said they would address it. They didn&#x27;t and the product still stands as &quot;Amazon&#x27;s Choice.&quot; I tried to leave a review saying the reviews were fake and got a warning (obviously seller initiated) that those types of reviews violated Amazon&#x27;s policies.<p>Amazon clearly enables review scams.')
