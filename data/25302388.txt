How do you choose between an ordered and unordered map? If you&#x27;ve implemented them even one time I bet you&#x27;ll have a clearer understanding of where each one excels.<p>If you couldn&#x27;t remember how to implement quick sort or merge sort that would be one thing, but if you had no idea or never considered how a fast sort could operate that&#x27;s another problem. I would never ask this in an interview but to use it as an example, it wouldn&#x27;t be recall of an implementation that I&#x27;d be looking for but seeing if the candidate can identify a divide and conquer approach to the problem.')
