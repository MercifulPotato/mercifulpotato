Unless you think it&#x27;s physically impossible for an officer to tase someone inappropriately (keeping in mind that tasers can kill people), you can see why this is a problem. The courts will not even entertain the possibility that an officer has done something wrong.<p>&gt; My point is that this seems like a case where the cops should have been (and maybe were) disciplined within the employment context, i.e. more training, suspension, etc.<p>They weren&#x27;t. What incentive would the department have to discipline them?<p>I&#x27;m interested in your thoughts on Jessop v. City of Fresno.')
