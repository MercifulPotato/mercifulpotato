What if the client cancelled the contract because of that, causing him to go out of business?  How does trying to sympathize with Microsoft feed his family?<p>No, the tech bubble is not more important than things that happen in the real world.  Windows has security problems?  Sure, all operating systems do.  But Microsoft shouldn&#x27;t shift its problems onto the users.  That&#x27;s just bad business, and bad ethics.')
