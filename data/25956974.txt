The topic is much deeper, but they appear to be constraining themselves to a single-timestep-state.  If they loosened up the state to include two timesteps then a <i>lot</i> more could be parallelized.  Since the simulation and graphics are in lockstep, this would add one frame of latency.  One frame of latency is hardly noticeable against the 7-10 frames minimum added in multiplayer but the payoff could be massive.  It’s hard work, without a doubt.  An example I like to point to is the minecraft mod “tickthreading”.  It was never stable, but the concept is there and sound.')
