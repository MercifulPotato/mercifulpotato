Or rather, the standard library and arrays bit is fixed; the underlying feature is not in stable Rust, and so other libraries still can&#x27;t make this work properly yet.<p>Variadrics are desired by some folks, but aren&#x27;t a particularly high priority.<p>Template template parameters are unlikely to land directly in Rust; GATs will be roughly equivalent. And specialization has a nightly implementation, and is highly desired, but isn&#x27;t done yet.')
