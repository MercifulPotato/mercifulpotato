REST APIs are a tiny part of all APIs.<p>You&#x27;re right that GUI&#x27;s aren&#x27;t completely analogous to commandline UIs or API UIs; every form of UI has its own strength, weaknesses, and different audiences. Treating APIs as <i>exactly the same</i> as GUIs would indeed be a mistake, but the main point is that they&#x27;re something a user interfaces with: that is, they&#x27;re a &quot;user interface&quot;, and it&#x27;s useful to think of it as such right from the start.')
