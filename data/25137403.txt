It will be much better known in some time, but it&#x27;s still not known at this moment. It depends on sterile immunizing properties of the vaccine, which are still unknown.<p>Edit: re the Moderna protocol mentioned in   \nsanxiyn&#x27;s comment below: even if they will measure sterilizing immunity (as one of their &quot;Secondary&quot; objectives), as far as I know, they still haven&#x27;t published something on that topic (1) From them we still have only data on the level comparable to those from Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech:<p>90 cases in placebo, 5 in vaccinated, 11 severe cases, all in placebo group. Where &quot;cases&quot; could simply be defined  &quot;those who were recognized of having Covid-19&quot; (as the illness). (Also see my other comment here for more general references about the primary objectives of all Phase 3 trials).<p>Here&#x27;s what Moderna only writes about their <i>secondary objectives</i> in the only release: &quot;Key secondary endpoints include prevention of severe COVID-19 disease and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The trial will continue to accrue additional data relevant to safety and efficacy even after an EUA is submitted.&quot; Meaning, eventually, we should be able to know more.<p>I didn&#x27;t know that Pfizer doesn&#x27;t even have that kind analysis written in  their protocol, thanks. I&#x27;d hope they can add that in some later phase.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.modernatx.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-details&#x2F;modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.modernatx.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-d...</a>')
