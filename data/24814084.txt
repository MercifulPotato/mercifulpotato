What in your experience is a sufficient timetable for diligence and discovery? I ask working for a company that &quot;grows by acquisition&quot;, and being in a middle management role I find myself often playing clean-up crew to some alarming things that <i>should</i> have been caught during diligence, but am growing increasingly weary being told &quot;we didn&#x27;t have time&quot;.<p>This is no attempt at malingering my duties, but I&#x27;ve lost one staff member already to the burnout from this, and am quite fearful I&#x27;m about to lose another. Both have told me &quot;it&#x27;s not you, you&#x27;ve been a great manager&quot; yet both have lamented feeling like their jobs have turned into playing the &#x27;janitor&#x27; role for messy acquisitions saying &quot;you did what you could&quot;<p>My own complaints up the food-chain have been returned with shrugs by a director who seems equally powerless in a process that is burning people out--and I&#x27;m considering looking for the door at the end of the year from it.')
