Also as recently as this summer I used to be able to set the whole house to &quot;the color loop&quot; this feature recently disappeared. The color loop slowly and nearly imperceptibly fades the colors from red to green to blue etc over several minutes. It&#x27;s technically part of &quot;hue labs&quot; but it&#x27;s a &quot;beta feature&quot; that&#x27;s been available in the product now for over three years so I would argue it is core functionality at this point.')
