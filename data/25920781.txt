Maybe it&#x27;s being drawn on a canvas, or composited with multiple layers, or you want only a part of it (all of these apply to Photopea, I believe).<p>I don&#x27;t like the way clipboard access is handled in browsers either, but the fact remains that if I&#x27;m using an in-browser image editor, select a part of the image and press CTRL+C, I want that portion of the image in my clipboard. How it gets there is an implementation detail that the average user doesn&#x27;t and, if it doesn&#x27;t affect security&#x2F;privacy, shouldn&#x27;t have to care about. And since it&#x27;s write-only, there&#x27;s no security&#x2F;privacy concern.')
