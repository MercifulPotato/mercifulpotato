I don&#x27;t know enough about the history of simplified characters in Japan, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that they are as widely used (with a few exceptions like 国) as traditional forms. Maybe someone knows the history?<p>Also, regarding this statement:<p><i>臺 (Korea&#x2F;Taiwan) 台 (Japan&#x2F;China)</i><p>In Taiwan, the latter form of <i>tai</i> (台) is used 99% of the time in colloquial, news, and signage. The complex form (臺) AFAIK is used almost exclusively in certain government situations (e.g. the name of a central government bureau) or on money. Street signs for famous buildings all use 台, i.e. 台北101, 台北松山機場, etc.')
