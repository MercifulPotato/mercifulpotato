Item(by='mimixco', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602860258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799940, text='This is a scathing review from someone for whom the device is clearly not intended. Most reviewers of the Surface Duo seem to come from an entirely different audience than the phone appeals to.<p>On the build quality, thinness, and &quot;work focus&quot; of the device, these are selling features that he downplays and dismisses. The magical hinge and its many ways to fold are huge upsides that simply don&#x27;t exist on any other device and are very much selling features.<p>High refresh rate, wireless charging, the latest processor, or a fancy camera are all features that this audience doesn&#x27;t care about, either. I&#x27;d rather have the thin, sexy device and the software that this phone has than those other features.<p>The extra wide screen is a huge benefit for people who work with documents like web pages or PDFs. The review totally discounts this advantage. Not having notifications on the outside is a big plus for me. I hate notifications. I don&#x27;t want the phone to bother me; its for me to decide when to use it, not the phone. MS sees this as a use case.<p>The built-in connection to your Windows PC is remarkably simple and just works. I can send and receive text messages, grab photos, or see those dreaded notifications on my PC instead of picking up the phone, which is often across the room. These are work-based advantages that a certain audience will love.<p>Having a single app span two screens in wide orientation isn&#x27;t a way anyone would use this phone. The reviewer points out that, turned vertically, a single document across two screens works wonderfully and has the advantage of a full screen keyboard at the bottom. Again, no other phone can do this.<p>Finally, his complaint about the bugs is somewhat true -- but the bugs come from the magic hinge and require some learning to make them work, like all magic tricks. The phone is detecting how you&#x27;ve moved it, using only its internal sensors and not requiring button presses for many instances of switching screens, switching orientation, and going in and out of fullscreen. To see the phone work is quite amazing, but you do  have to be somewhat &quot;intentional&quot; in how you fold and use it. This is not a phone you just whip out while you&#x27;re driving. That&#x27;s not a use case.<p>If you like the way of working that the Surface Duo offers, its actually a fantastic device. I think mine is the best phone I&#x27;ve ever used and it was worth every penny. Besides, software (bugs) are fixable.')
