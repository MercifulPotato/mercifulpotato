If people making tech salaries move to overlooked parts of the country, I wonder to what extent their wealth would trickle down to benefit their new communities?<p>It would be interesting if a bunch of people leaving the Bay Area ended up congregating in certain low-COL communities. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a sort of rural gentrification occurs in the handful of Midwestern towns that have gigabit fiber. Would those areas remain low COL? Would the existing inhabitants become a sort of underclass?')
