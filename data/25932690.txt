ISTM that the point of this law is to protect the ecosystems of the waters -- it seems to be operating on the assumption that leaving these structures in the ocean causes them to remain a disruption to the ecosystem. A sort of, you made your mess, now clean up after yourself, rationale.<p>But if leaving these structures in the ocean causes them to to become marine habits and is actually a net positive on the marine ecosystem, then the goals of this policy are at odds with its actual effects.<p>So now I wonder how hard it is to go back to OSPAR with evidence that leaving the structures in place is a good thing and getting the policy changed to allow that. Hopefully the OSPAR convention is less dysfunctional than the US Congress?')
