I did some quite extensive network performence testing last winter on those three CSP, and even if single queue TCP+gso performence can behave like this, I find the claim &#x27;GCP is 3x faster than AWS&#x27; a bit bold. It&#x27;s definitely possible to get 50G of TCP traffic in AWS, and a lot of things are in the balance (MTU, number of queues, drivers...) that make this claim a bit weird to me.')
