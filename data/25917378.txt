I try to stay away from such arguments because they aren&#x27;t productive.<p>I do now argue though that as an engineering team and code base gets bigger, you will <i>need</i> static typing to be able to continue to grow at a sustainable pace. Static typing provides a very strong safety net letting people make good, safe changes in code they may not be intimately familiar with.<p>If you have a small code base and&#x2F;or small team, then static typing becomes much more of a personal preference.')
