Very similar to HOA fees or FHA requirements of multi family units, and this would prevent local taxing authorities from low balling the tax rate and pushing the costs into the future. “Show me the incentives and I’ll show you the outcome.”<p>Don’t force people into highly dense housing, let them pay for sprawl if they want it and can afford it.')
