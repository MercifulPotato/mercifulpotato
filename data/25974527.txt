I’ve been asking myself ever since why I felt so sure at the time.<p>As for GME, there’s fundamental analysis and financial experts telling us it is only a matter of time before the price free falls. But there’s a serious behavioral dissymmetry here. The market is rich with GME stock buyers who don’t care to listen to any of these traditional buy&#x2F;sell signals. I’m not sure you’re wrong, but I’m personally a little bit less certain that the price will drop — at least soon — due to this reason alone. As this article points out, feedback loops can be extremely powerful. And I suspect they can play out over longer periods than we expect.')
