I&#x27;ll try it with the primary soon.<p>Podcasts... I set up gPodder (while docked, because the UI doesn&#x27;t adapt to the screen) and then use mpv to actually play the episodes which... is <i>surprisingly</i> usable. Next I&#x27;ll see if I can adapt Podbird or such. It should work, really...<p>I also find myself late-night hacking in vim (again, surprisingly usable with onscreen keyboard, with minor tweaks) at night-time. xD<p>In a nutshell: I love the project. It&#x27;s not &quot;there&quot; yet, but it&#x27;s making progress, and I&#x27;m finally happy again to get update notifications to my phone.<p>Edit: also chat of course. The reason I didn&#x27;t mention that is that I simply didn&#x27;t think about chat as an issue. 99% of my chats are on telegram these days and that works pretty flawlessly on the pinephone, since it runs the exact same (efficient) codebase as the desktop app. In fact, just resize the (Qt) desktop app to simulate how it behaves on the phone. :)')
