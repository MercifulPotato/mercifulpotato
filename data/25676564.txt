And news organizations may accidentally report incorrect information (hopefully they swiftly retract it when they learn differently).<p>But shouldn&#x27;t we not continue to consume sources that have made malicious mistakes? Even if the maliciousness was a bad outside actor feeding incorrect information to ethical reporters, isn&#x27;t it likely that such a source will make a malicious mistake again? When the consequences are on the scale of directing the country into a fraudulent war, how can we ever trust their reporting on anything of consequence again?')
