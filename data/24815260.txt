How did I draw this line? I saw the disparate impact machine learning has vs traditional media, by sheer measurement of friction. Traditional media requires intentionality on the part of the target: picking up a newspaper, turning on a television and tuning to a station. ML on social media exploits key weaknesses in human psychology combined with unprecedented data collection to nudge individuals to read&#x2F;believe&#x2F;buy. This is wrong, itâ€™s clearly wrong, and should be illegal.<p>The sort of slippery-slope arguments are necessary and important but should not paralyze us from taking action against it.')
