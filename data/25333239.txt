Native DANE code was proposed in Firefox and actually landed in Chrome, which later removed it, because it (a) didn&#x27;t work reliably on the actual Internet, and (b) in fallback mode, amounts to adding just one more CA to the pile of CAs Chrome already has to trust.<p>When a CA can be shown to have misissued a certificate, Google can (and has, as it did in the Symantec case) distrust it, nuking the CA from orbit. It has no such powers with a CA baked into the DNS; Google can&#x27;t distrust .COM. People should be careful what they wish for.<p>But not too careful in this case; DNSSEC is moribund, and unlikely to be revived.')
