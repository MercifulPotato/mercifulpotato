It&#x27;s very far from impossible.&quot;\nAnd go ask why websites are looking the same.\nDisclaimer: I am designer (real one). I have become frontend dev with time and moved in this direction naturally driven by challenges in implementation. At first challenge was to move away from table based layouts (xhtlm&#x2F;separation of content and presentation), next was AJAX,jQuery and now is React, Vue, Angular. In all of this mess I judge the final results. The Product is made to serve the user. In some point in time the incentive moved to &quot;technology serves developers and business&quot; first.<p>This is the real problem for me. I have found in my practice when hiring designers the problem is lack of proper design foundation, using frameworks and tricks is not design process, its design implementation.<p>I have suggestion: Obviously developers hate designers (I doubt that they have worked with real one - and reaction towards &quot;designers&quot; is right), do me a favor and eliminate design by building AI solution already. You have ton of historically proven quantitive data what the principles of visually good design are. Just throw it in GAN, use style transfer and do it. You can split test UX and UI and decorate the results with GAN data. Problem solved.<p>In design space education is broken, business owners and managers don&#x27;t value design highly so everyone will be happy. Designers will find what to do with their talents, don&quot;t worry:)')
