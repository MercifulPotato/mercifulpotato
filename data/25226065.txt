Actually, no. Lab studies have found that females of either morph prefer the tan-striped males. White-striped females, more pushy than their tan-striped sisters, grab the tan-striped bachelors right away, so these pairs form more quickly than the opposite combination. Males of both morphs tend to prefer the white-striped females, but those females quickly hook up with tan-striped males if they can, so eventually the leftover birds will form pairs consisting of white-striped males and tan-striped females.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audubon.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-fascinating-and-complicated-sex-lives-white-throated-sparrows" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audubon.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-fascinating-and-complicated...</a><p>Granted, the question of homo-zygotic white offspring viability is not even touched.<p>Edit: yet another article tentatively says the double-white sparrows to exist, but in far lesser number than expected, they suspect some genetic disadvantage.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(15)01562-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(15)...</a>')
