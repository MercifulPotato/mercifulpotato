What this means is that the DEcentralized Exchange (DEX) that you&#x27;re performing the trade on will have liquidity for the pair of assets and as you click the right button to select TSLA for USD, you&#x27;re getting TSLA. There is no mathematical way to get scammed.<p>For your example of FB marketplace&#x2F;Craigslist, you want an Escrow service with a way to have you or a 3rd party validate you&#x27;re not getting ripped off. That type of service exists via cryptographic primitives in both Bitcoin and Ethereum allowing a transaction to be blocked if there is something fraudulent.')
