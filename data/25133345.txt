There&#x27;s been 9 launches + 3 launches that are 5% not Starlink = 9.15 launches worth of non-Starlink revenue.<p>And even having this different argument you&#x27;re triyng to have, SpaceX&#x27;s margins are not so good that collecting 5% of nominal market price will put them in the black for that launch...  That&#x27;s just fantasy.')
