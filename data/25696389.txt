It has worn us out<p>I thought it ended and things would get better, but I&#x27;m not sure anymore<p>I used to like spending time with you... maybe a little bit too much time. But valuable nonetheless<p>You made me learn about selling onions[0], Cameras[1] and so much more useful stuff(mostly useful, sometimes not)<p>You told me my apps were not working before even my co-workers realised[2]<p>You were the first one to tell me great humans had passed away[3][4]<p>You&#x27;ve always put startups, science and knowledge first<p>You made me hopeful about the future we could create<p>You stood for the exchange of knowledge through civilised conversations, curiosity[5]<p>&gt; <i>Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate.

Who are we? What de we stand for? What have we become?<p>Is there a way we can go back? To when all we wanted was to feed our curiosity?<p>Maybe we do not try to understand each other anymore<p>We read posts and comments to answer. Not to learn, not to understand<p>Maybe we can pay more attention to how we formulate what we say<p>I guess it would at least be a start<p>We should take a look at what we have become, take a step back, to understand ourselves<p>Maybe only then will we understand -and respect- each other<p>I love you HN. Please don&#x27;t let me hate you')
