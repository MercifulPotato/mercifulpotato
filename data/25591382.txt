With infinite growth you can make your own resources without someone else loosing their resources.<p>There are still some resources that we are constrained with, like oil, but with science coming up with ways to stop using that resource and having reusable energy sources we can stop wars in places where oil is present.<p>Then if I can have $2 tomorrow for my $1 invested today because I see there is infinite growth I am willing to put my money into more ventures. If there would be no growth I would stick to my $1 and spend it only on necessities we would stagnate and would not have money to invest in things like renewable energy - which in turn leads to scenario with scarce resources.<p>Remember that not all people want to live peaceful life having their own farm feeding themselves, there is a lot of human predators taking advantage of others. So to have peaceful society we need growth or at least perceived growth so a lot of people don&#x27;t have to take someone else piece of pie.')
