Apple insisted that they offer IAP in the app, and ProtonMail is upset. Here:<p>&gt; &quot;Out of the blue, one day they said you have to add in-app purchase to stay in the App Store. They stumbled upon something in the app that mentioned there were paid plans, they went to the website and saw there was a subscription you could purchase, and then turned around and demanded we add IAP. There&#x27;s nothing you can say to that. They are judge, jury, and executioner on their platform, and you can take it or leave it. You can&#x27;t get any sort of fair hearing to determine whether it&#x27;s justifiable or not justifiable, anything they say goes. We simply complied in order to save our business.&quot;<p>Yes, as I said, ideally Apple would allow other forms of payment alongside IAP, but that&#x27;s not even the issue here. The issue here, as I said, was that ProtonMail was trying to avoid implementing IAP at all.')
