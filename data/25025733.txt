However, something that bothers me about this article is its emphasis on work-related productivity as the primary goal of mindfulness and focus. Cultivating this kind of brain change is a big undertaking, and I find it demotivating to think that the main beneficiary should be the capitalist goal of increased productivity in a workplace setting.<p>Think bigger! I prefer to think that the primary goal of increased focus&#x2F;mindfulness is increased happiness, joy, and life satisfaction. Any work-related productivity increase is a convenient side-effect. Work will come and go, but you have to live with your brain every day for the rest of your life. Imagine what it would be like to be able to happily focus on spending time with your child, or reading a good book, and really be present in that moment.')
