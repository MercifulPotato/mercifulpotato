I can’t think of a single Windows program that would wish was available to me on the Mac or Linux.<p>You never hear a company advertising that their product is only feasable thanks to the features provided in the .Net framework, or that their application takes advantage of the foundation provided by Windows.<p>I not saying that Windows is bad, it’s a truck, meant for business, and games.
