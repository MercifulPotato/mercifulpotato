However, in other languages it’s more normal to have these situations as they don’t have as many options to choose from.  One interesting thing is when you begin learn one of those languages, initially, one might feel that speech is filled with overused phrases, but when you think about it, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with using the same phrase to describe the same situation.  In English there’s a linguistic tug to use one phrase at beginning of a sentence and to end it with a synonymous phrase at the end:  “Be deliberate in your speech, avoid uhhms and ahhs; people notice those things and ding your speech, so avoid fillers, meaningless utterances distract listeners.  Your audience will perceive it and will discount your oration”<p>Ok oration is overwrought but you get my pint.')
