So to avoid bias, one should keep it around</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s what I was trying to say. I didn&#x27;t mean that including it mathematically in the equations necessarily requires one to adopt a non-zero value for it; you are quite correct that one shouldn&#x27;t do that unless one has observational evidence to back it up (and cosmologists in fact didn&#x27;t adopt a non-zero value until observational evidence required it).')
