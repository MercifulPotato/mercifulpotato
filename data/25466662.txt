What I mean is something like:<p><pre><code>  $ cat file.csv\n  CSV,quote=always,quotechar=&quot;,header=yes,delim=,\n  Col1,Col2\n  &quot;val&quot;,&quot;val2&quot;\n  [..]\n</code></pre>\nThen you always know what you&#x27;re dealing with, unambiguously.<p>There are other cases where embedding some &quot;metadata&quot; in CSV files is useful; for example the exports I create in my app are versioned by prefixing the first header with the version number. It works, but it&#x27;s not exactly great.<p>Of course, the downside is legacy software not being able to process it.')
