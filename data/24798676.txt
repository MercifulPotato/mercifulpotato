Without access to documentation or a compiler. In a room. On a folding chair. Without a break. I had two hours to do it in. I cranked out around 1,100 lines of code.<p>The interviewing developer was all smugness when looking through the code because he didn&#x27;t like my bracketing style, or my variable style, and so on, and pissed and moaned because I had a couple of syntax errors in the entire class.<p>I was offered the job. And I turned them down. I did it to prove I could do it. Then I walked away. That was pretty much my last ever formal interview.')
