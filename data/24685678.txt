Are we just going ignore people who had a complete personality flip?<p>Although.. some truth lies here. These plants and experiences can help attune you to your real nature. In your heart you might be softy, but a meanie in usual life. The plants can maybe help you express your softy side better and become more attuned to that nature, until it is your dominant expression. Which means the person might have had a false meanie personality expression for some reason (coping&#x2F;defence mechanisms to trauma&#x2F;abuse&#x2F;hard life).<p>I think maybe the whole point to these plants&#x2F;experiences are to teach us it is impossible to get clear cut black&#x2F;white answers that our brains so easily digest and accept. It might help us accept that we won&#x27;t have good answers for certain things and to accept certain things for what they are (broken family, disability etc).<p>I like the word &quot;attune&quot; when it comes to this stuff. I feel that we have an internal nature&#x2F;essence that wants to be expressed. We can attune our minds to resonate or be on the same channel as the inner state (or soul or god being or whatever you want to call it). The first thing I like to do when relaxing (without any substances (or with them)) is to try and shake off my personality and step into the attuned state - step into the shoes of the inner child&#x2F;being and feel it&#x27;s energy, and try and have a conversation with it, ask it how it is, does it need anything, is it happy, and tell it that you love it with all your heart and thank it for giving you energy and love. In that moment I&#x2F;you can become fully attuned with it and feel your power and creativity as cosmic being. While you are at it, imagine you and this being are made of light and that you are travelling through the cosmos together at light speed, that you feel the energy&#x2F;intent of the universe flowing over and into you and it makes you happy. While sitting, raise your hand and feel the cosmic wind through your fingers and feel them grasp through the fabric of reality...<p>Sounds silly, I know. But do it the next time while under the influence, and see what you feel. It might change your life to commune with your inner being.<p>fyi I&#x27;m not relgious, it&#x27;s just fun thought experiments that might feel nice.')
