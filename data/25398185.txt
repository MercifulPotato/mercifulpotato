Recently watched a presentation from the CEO of Nexon and it was pretty interesting.<p>The most eye opening part is the live game operations. They have multiple people who are monitoring the players and if someone is close to leaving or feels like they are going to leave the game (he is mostly talking about Maplestory) they give them a &quot;buff&quot; or some kind of incentive to stay. You get a better loot, or a better equipment. Basically they rig the rng in your favor. And he was talking how the AI and machine learning will change that in the upcoming years because it&#x27;s actually hard to do that manually (don&#x27;t give too strong buffs because the player with the buff get bored quickly etc.)<p>The part start here but worth watching the whole video <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LEqzZCmlzTk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1475" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LEqzZCmlzTk&amp;feature=youtu.be...</a>')
