But it is possible to use Parler&#x27;s PWA, and it&#x27;s been a bit hilarious watching folks try to explain to each other how to use it.<p>But there are plenty of other places for Parler to host, register domains, etc. There are at least dozens of hosting companies that can do cloud hosting at the scale they need (which isn&#x27;t exactly huge despite the hype), there are hundreds more that could be used in tandem to cover their needs. Either Parler&#x27;s inability to handle these moves is a result of them being incapable or unwilling to take slightly more effort in hosting than launching Amazon or Google server instances with a click, or there&#x27;s an unprecedented amount of unity in companies against Parler. The Gab is still up, Pirate Bay is still up, 8Chan still finds its way onto the internet.<p>The internet is still decentralized. It&#x27;s the super easy hosting part of the internet that is centralized. It&#x27;s the hosting that&#x27;s big enough they don&#x27;t notice or have any questions about what they&#x27;re hosting. Parler ran out of hosting companies they could quietly hide inside without someone noticing what they&#x27;re doing, and in order to find hosting again, they&#x27;ll have to have an actual conversation with a vendor that sees what Parler is doing and is OK with being a part of it.')
