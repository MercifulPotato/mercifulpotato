Just as I am sure most people who made Russian revolution didn&#x27;t really intend to have Gulag, Joseph Stalin, Hungary of 1956 and Prague of 1968. These things however have certain logic of its own, and gatekeeping tends to unfold into the direction of minitrue. That&#x27;s just the internal logic of the things - and we can see it unfolding right now. First it was promoting the rightthinkers, then demoting the wrongthinkers, then banning the wrongthinkers from a platform, then banning the wrongthinkers from all platforms, then banning all mentions of wrongthinkers, then banning services that allow wrongthinkers, then destroying all services that allow wrongthinkers... Pretty soon there&#x27;s just no place where wrongthink can happen, and how it&#x27;s different from minitrue? That it&#x27;s a trillion-dollar corporation that is doing it, not the government? DO I really care? The result is the same.')
