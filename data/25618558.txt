Why did I think of this thing that happened 70-odd years ago? I have no clue.<p>Way back in the early-mid 1950s, my brother bought a &#x27;home music studio&quot;. I have no other word for it. This audio machine was a record player for 78s, 45s and 33s, a record cutter using acetate blanks, and a tape recorder; all-in-one in a timber case with handle, about 2-feet square.<p>In today&#x27;s money, it must have been the equivalent of about 3 grand. I know my old man was not at all happy with my brother&#x27;s expenditure.<p>The machine used BASF tape in 7-inch reels. The tape deck was more triangular in shape than the Gramdeck pictured. If my memory is correct, this was called a &#x27;ByerCorder&#x27;, or maybe &#x27;BeyerCorder&#x27;.<p>Basically, it sat on the central spindle of the turntable at one corner of the triangle, and two other rubber feet sat on the outside of the turntable at the other 2 corners of the triangle. The turntable spindle directly rotated the rubber capstan of the tape-deck. That capstan was about an inch and a half in diameter.')
