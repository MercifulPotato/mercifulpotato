Without a mask, I coughed while probing the space around my face with one of my hands, at a distance of maybe 9-12 inches away.<p>I could easily feel significant airflow from the cough in a cone in front of mouth. Nothing to the sides (for purposes of this discussion, &quot;side&quot; means significantly off-axis from from the line down the middle of the cone, so includes above and below the face, not just left and right).<p>2. Same test, with mask. I either did not detect any airflow or just detected a bare hint of some at the same test distance as unmasked. (I&#x27;d need an assistant to tell which, since I can&#x27;t think of a good way to do a blind test alone).<p>There was definitely some airflow out the sides with the mask, as I could see by the coughs fogging my glasses, but it only seemed to be very close to my head.<p>3. I Repeated the above, but replacing &quot;cough&quot; with &quot;blow as hard as I can&quot;. Same results.<p>How does one escape concluding from this that if I&#x27;m infectious wearing a mask will reduce the volume over which my releases of air containing virus laden droplets spread? Or that this means my chances of passing it on to someone I&#x27;m only spending a little time with (clerks helping with a purchase, people standing in the same line for something, etc) will be reduced?')
