Frustration because I don’t understand how something can be downvoted without commentary or engagement ..sometimes..in literally seconds after posting.<p>Imagine if this happens in real-time conversations? When we talk to each other..as in face to face..what would happen to communication or civil discourse if we ‘verbally downvote’ before engaging or interacting?<p>Please consider eliminating drive-by downvotes as policy. Or at least institute a weighted system of voting wrt engagement level.<p>ETA: I can’t edit it now. But in my defense, English is not my first language. I don’t use any swear words in my language because that seems like it would be disrespectful&#x2F;impolite but in a learned language, ‘fuck’ is just as potent as ‘lame’ because it’s all English to me. Not having come to an English speaking country until after adulthood, it’s a language whose colloquialism I picked from books and movies. Mostly books. So it kinda..flows. But will try to be mindful.')
