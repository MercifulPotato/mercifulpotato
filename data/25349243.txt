That&#x27;s the main thing. And because the hosts themselves don&#x27;t all share APIs, the interop specific code needs to be written specifically to the host.<p>It&#x27;s a similar story for multi-threading and concurrency, some hosts don&#x27;t support it at all, or support a very different version like Actors only, so in those cases the Clojure features related to them are dropped or altered to match the host.<p>You can still provide multi-host libraries, by making use of reader conditionals you can have the code fork at the points where it needs to be specialized for each host. That in turn can be used portably afterwards on whatever hosts the library would have supported.')
