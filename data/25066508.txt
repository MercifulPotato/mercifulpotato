Give me K&amp;R every single time.<p>The problem is not the humor or the silliness, the problem is that for a newbie it is impossible to distinguish what it is important from what is not, what is an exaggerated truth for comic effect and what it isnt.

In a certain sense the concept is very simple, space bends according to the mass&#x2F;energy distribution like fabric under a heavy ball (maybe the bowling ball of your uncle Bob), so it becomes curved.... and that&#x27;s why you derive the Christoffel symbols from the Lagrangian of the equation of motion under  a given metric.')
