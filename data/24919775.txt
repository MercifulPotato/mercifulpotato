Spring invalidates refactoring tools and a lot of static analysis. It makes working on Java feel like you are working on Python or something. The traceability of errors is very low. You can limit yourself to a subset of Spring&#x27;s functionality (eg no component scanning, wiring up the beans manually) but it will not be idiomatic.')
