You should use HSL (hue-saturation-lightness) because that’s what CSS3 uses, and HSL&#x2F;HSV are colorwheels designed for representing RGB (what screens use).<p>HSL&#x2F;HSV attempt to mimic paint mixing. Hue is the color. It’s a degree because imagine all colors of the rainbow arranged in a circle, that’s the color wheel and each degree corresponds to a different color. Saturation is how much color (0% saturation at 50% lightness is grey), and lightness is how light or dark the color is (0% is black, 100% is a very bright color or white depending on the saturation).<p>Here’s a good article on HSL&#x2F;HSV with diagrams: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psychology.wikia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HSL_and_HSV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psychology.wikia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HSL_and_HSV</a>')
