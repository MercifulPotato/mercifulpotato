Whether its a medieval oath or a standard employment contract, the concept of &quot;binding agreement&quot;  sorts out moral issues of consent and creates a platform for further relations.<p>Reality is generally less fussy about categorical boundaries. It likes spectrum. Linnaean classification is an approximation. Biology isn&#x27;t strict about species, or even organism barriers. It&#x27;s the same with a lot of cultural stuff.<p>On one end of the spectrum, we can have a business agreement negotiated diligently and in good faith between equal partners. On the other end, we have take-it-or-leave it agreements: The T&amp;Cs stack a bank hands you when you take a loan. The wall of incomprehensible legalese we consent to when we use an app or website. An employment contract is somewhere on that spectrum. Employees may be able to submit &quot;red line corrections&quot; depending on their seniority and confidence, but generally its written by employers and treated as under their control.<p>In philosophy, contracts (including rhetorical ones like &quot;moral contracts) are a popular mechanism for problem solving. They certainly are in law. In normal human life, norms are much more common.')
