What is so sad is that it can still be avoided.<p>But the current situation where we simultaneously have a high number of active case and high number of vaccinated people over a sufficiently long time because of slow vaccination schedule, is a recipe for creating vaccine resistant variants.<p>As soon as we start vaccinating we are giving the virus opportunities to pressure-select against the vaccine. The more active case we have and the longer it takes the better for the virus.<p>I&#x27;m no epidemiologist, but with the apparition in a short amount of time of 2 variants which affects the spike protein, it seems the current level of active case we are entering a red-zone, where the virus is given too many opportunities to mutate. And we should try to contain it via the current measures (masks, tracking and lock-downs), before sabotaging our best card.')
