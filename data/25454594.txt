Also, on first glance, that looks like trivial integrations.<p>Ah, I also forgot to mention, what I&#x27;d like to see is more documentation on how to hide an imperative API behind a more declarative React&#x2F;Angular etc. API. That&#x27;s not always trivial but often what you want.<p>I think it&#x27;s especially important because while you often can find ready-made wrapper for popular pure JS libraries they are usually abandoned (and thus don&#x27;t keep up with the latest versions) or have some flaw that bites you sooner or later. My current recommendation is to write your own wrapper unless the wrapper is an official one of the authors of the underlying JS library. Naturally, that&#x27;s not always feasible for complex libraries, but matter of fact you don&#x27;t always need the full functionality of that library so you only have to wrap what you need.')
