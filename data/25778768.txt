Deep learning, and in fact all scientific breakthroughs, did not materialize out of nowhere. They&#x27;re a culmination of a long sequence of scientific papers (some more incremental than others), conference presentations, poster sessions, hallway conversations, even coffee chats.<p>It&#x27;s not some dude disappearing into the forest for a few years and coming back with a revolutionary idea (maybe in movies).
