They generally cover different styles of learning.<p>For example the official docs should probably contain a bunch of &quot;hello world&quot; tutorials for using the features they offer. But often times once you are combining a couple of different tools it isn&#x27;t clear if it should go into the official documentation for any one of them. ..and I especially don&#x27;t want the maintainers of the official documentation acting as gatekeepers for what combinations of tools are &quot;useful&quot; enough to be allowed into the one source of information.')
