By all measures, I haven&#x27;t been &quot;employed&quot; since the late 90s (when I was briefly an employee of an investment bank for a summer internship).  I&#x27;ve run my own businesses, helped others build theirs, worked as a consultant, and done nothing at various times for the past 20 years.<p>Rather than describe my state of being as &quot;employed&quot; vs &quot;unemployed&quot;, I always break it into &quot;working on a project for someone else&quot; vs. &quot;working on my own project&quot; (and sometimes both, and sometimes neither.)  Some of those projects generate money. Some of them don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s taken some time, but people get it!  I just refuse to play the game :)')
