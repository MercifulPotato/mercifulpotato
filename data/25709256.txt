If you&#x27;re controlling your calorie intake then that&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>Outside of that other claims seem highly questionable.<p>I push back a little on this, because most of the time I&#x27;ve heard people say diet soda is as bad or worse than regular it&#x27;s because of unsubstantiated woo. Is drinking only water better for you? I&#x27;d guess almost certainly.<p>Is diet soda particularly harmful? I doubt it - and it&#x27;s almost certainly better than regular soda (or all of those high sugar fancy juices). It can also be really helpful when losing a lot of weight as a zero calorie snack.')
