The tower itself is on a telephone&#x2F;power pole for lines that run alongside the property anyway, so that&#x27;s also not an eyesore.<p>We bought the house with the tower &amp; lease already in place, so unfortunately I&#x27;ve got no idea how they set this up; I&#x27;d definitely do it again in a future home if I could.')
