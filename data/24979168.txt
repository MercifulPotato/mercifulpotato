Those bombshells should have been included in the model. Fat tail risks. If the modeling doesn’t include the potential for dramatic unknowns that can DO happen, then the model is no good. In the Clinton&#x2F;Trump election, Trump is a showman and a name caller focused on ratings, Clinton a career politician with accusations of dirt, the model should expect “big things can still happen today, tomorrow, next week” and the absence if big events yesterday or last election holds little value relative to the probability of a big event happening in the next 24 hours.<p>Edit- I’m getting downvoted im guessing because I said Clinton has lots of dirt and called Trump obsessive, I’ve revised the comment to be less politically accusative. I’m not concerned with the politics, just interested in the obsession with these “predictions”')
