How many companies can that fund?  How much press can that get?  Over a few years, with new rounds being raised every year, will attitudes change?<p>With this press, is there a subset of female C levels and directors that want to work for a female CEO?  I am pretty sure there is.  Can this lead to companies that are female majority C-suite?  For sure.<p>Sure, you might start in more traditional female markets, making products targeting women, but it would spread.<p>The real win will be when there is enough cooperation to pull this off.  Women control a MASSIVE amount of money in the US.  A few billion is peanuts.  How hard can this be to put together?')
