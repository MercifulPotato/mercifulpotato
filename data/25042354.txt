Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604976092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040398, text='&gt; Recently I read the statistics on the frequency of journalists being killed. I was appalled.<p>Where? What are the stats?<p>&gt; I suppose I never thought deeply enough to conclude the torture and murder of Jamal Khashoggi is a manifestation of a systematic problem.<p>It&#x27;s not. And common sense says he was killed because he was a spy&#x2F;political actor, not a &quot;journalist&quot;. What &quot;truth&quot; was he killed for, if he was killed. Why was he targeted and not 1000000 other journalists around the world. If it was systematic, there would be a lot less journalists. If it was systematic how come there hasn&#x27;t been another khashoggi incident? There would be journalists being killed in every consulate around the world. No?<p>&gt; If nation states (even democratic in some instances) are willing to kill those who share the truth, is this something we should accept?<p>Of course not. But then again, they shouldn&#x27;t be killed for lying either.<p>&gt; I wonder to what extent we are entitled to truth, and why there is a war against it.<p>Ask the CNN, WaPo, NYTimes, Foxnews, etc why they are engaging in a war against &quot;truth&quot;. There is a war against &quot;truth&quot; because political&#x2F;financial interests are at stake.<p>An introductory class in philosophy would do wonders for you. &quot;Truth&quot; you will find is a very complex topic. But beyond the philosophical issues with &quot;truth&quot;, your problem is that your started with a false premise : &quot;Journalists give us truth&quot;. They do not. Truth doesn&#x27;t come from journalists. Truth is independent of journalists.<p>You sneakily confused &quot;right to free speech&quot; with &quot;right to truth via journalists&quot;. That&#x27;s journalist type of behavior. You see this all of HN and social media because of the amount of journalists wasting time on social media instead of doing actual work.<p>I believe in right to free speech. I believe journalists have the right to lie outright, spin facts, tell truth, etc without physical harm. Just like any american has the same constitutional rights. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s the journalists who are waging a war to censor americans so it&#x27;s hard to sympathize with these people. But certainly nobody should be killed for expressing their opinions.')
