Bangalore having 8 unicorns vs Delhi&#x27;s 11.<p>How much of that is related to government influence (the effectiveness of pushing Bangalore &amp; Hydrabad to be tech centers)?<p>I note that Bangalore&#x27;s population is 8m, while Delhi is 21m.   If it was &#x27;unicorns per population&#x27; then you&#x27;d naively expect a ratio of 8:21, not 8:11.')
