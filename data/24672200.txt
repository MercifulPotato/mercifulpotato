Item(by='sjrd', descendants=None, kids=[24672904], score=None, time=1601734373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671571, text='&gt; Some people view them as irritating annoyances that should be pushed to some forum like stack overflow though.<p>I maintain a fairly large open source project. We close &quot;issues&quot; that are support requests on sight, with a more-or-less automatic message telling the person that they should use Stack Overflow or Gitter for questions.<p>This is not because they are irritating annoyances. I in fact <i>do</i> support people on Stack Overflow and Gitter about the project. But there are at least two reasons for keeping things separate:<p>a) In terms of organization, I need the issue list to be about things that are actionable in the repo.<p>b) More importantly: only the core developers and some very enthusiastic people follow the GitHub repo. There are many more people available for and willing to support on Stack Overflow and Gitter. It is important that support requests reach these people so that support can be distributed. A lot of users even have more practical experience with the project than the core developers.')
