Later they went for SMS-based 2FA, I think they&#x27;re still on that nowadays.<p>One of the banks I use in India adds this grid to the back of your debit card. For higher value or non-usual transactions, they both ask for an SMS code and 3 values from the grid, in addition to the password to login to the netbanking site.
