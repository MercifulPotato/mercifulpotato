But coming from a 2015 MBP 13&quot; retina display, I can definitely tell the difference, and the MBP was much nicer to look at.<p>I opted fro the FHD+ instead of the 4K screen in my Dell for two reasons:<p>- 4K is *WAY* beyond Retina, which is already very dense for me.<p>- I was afraid the 4K would drain the battery (especially on Linux)<p>I really hope Dell will offer a sane ~3K display (i.e. Retina levels) in the future and remove the burden of choice for their customers (at least where it&#x27;s not needed).<p>Before you ask: no coil whine for me, but the thin rubber feet peeled off after exactly one year.
