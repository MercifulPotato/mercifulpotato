In particular the multi-threading solution to belt management is an interesting programming problem that many games just get wrong.<p>As to your assertion about the game play of Factorio, it is not mine, craft, and place like in a normal RTS. In order to succeed at the game you must <i>design</i> which is a far cry from base building in StarCraft II, for example. Blueprints are indicative of this design requirement.<p>There are games where you design ships and save templates for them. But playing Factorio all the way through is a much more complicated experience than movement and crafting. Unless your assertion is that complexity of gameplay is measured by input mechanics, which I think is demonstrably incorrect.')
