I appreciate your intention, yet it&#x27;s super important to be clear that the problem is the bourgeoisie and the capitalist system, as the means of production are monopolized in their hands. The most advanced form through which the bourgeoisie (in this case Apple) expropriates, creates enclosures and exploits&#x2F;oppresses, is 1) through the use of trade secret laws [1], which steals away new inventions from the commons and stifles learning and innovation, as well as 2) through the means-of-exchange money system that obscures relationships between people and places [2].<p><i>&quot;Zak Cope makes the case that capitalism is empirically inseparable from imperialism, historically and today. Using a rigorous political economic framework, he lays bare the vast ongoing transfer of wealth from the poorest to the richest countries through the mechanisms of monopoly rent, unequal exchange, and colonial tribute. The result is a polarized international class structure with a relatively rich Global North and an impoverished, exploited Global South.<p>Cope makes the controversial claim that it is because of these conditions that workers in rich countries benefit from higher incomes and welfare systems with public health, education, pensions, and social security. As a result, the internationalism of populations in the Global North is weakened and transnational solidarity is compromised. The only way forward, Cope argues is through a renewed anti-imperialist politics rooted in a firm commitment to a radical labor internationalism.&quot;</i> [3]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipwatchdog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;dont-fooled-patent-purge-elon-musk-just-another-hypocritical-tech-billionaire&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipwatchdog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;dont-fooled-patent-pur...</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikorizal.org&#x2F;Fromprivateownershipaccountingtocommonsaccoun.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikorizal.org&#x2F;Fromprivateownershipaccountingtocommons...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;43015121-the-wealth-of-some-nations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;43015121-the-wealth-of-s...</a>')
