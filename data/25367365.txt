Around 2014, I had a concept for a recipe app that I wanted to build to scratch my own itch: unit conversions, integrated timers, parallel flows (do X while Y). I had been hoping to work with an annotated recipe corpus to facilitate some of the work, but after some research, I couldn&#x27;t see how to pursue it meaningfully given my time and budget. I might have to pull that idea out of the heap of abandoned projects now.')
