Item(by='hadlock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607126080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25309807, text='I think of Reddit as a 21st century forum, whereas Facebook is a true &#x27;Social Media&#x27; website. Forums have different usage patterns and allegiances compared to social media websites. They can be roughly compared, but it&#x27;s a poor comparison, like trying to say if Excel (reddit) or Powerpoint (facebook) is better.<p>Facebook has groups which sort of function as forums, but they&#x27;re crudely spliced into your news feed, and rarely(!) sorted in chronological order. Forums on the other hand have dedicated threads about specific topics, are easily searchable and a two year old thread can still be relevant.<p>Social media sites tend to be more immediate, and comments on old posts may only continue for several days on average.<p>TL;DR Reddit and Facebook are very different products, with different usage patterns, and have different appeals to different segments of society.<p>It does not surprise me in the least that an internet forum would have a lower daily usage count compared to a social media service.')
