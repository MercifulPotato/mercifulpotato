I think the rest of the comment presumes that the only type of simulation we should conceive of is one that is an exact mapping of <i>some</i> external world, and that external world adheres the same laws that our &quot;simulation&quot; has.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - i&#x27;m not for or against the simulation argument, I just don&#x27;t understand the argument that a simulation of &quot;a&quot; universe would consume all the energy of some &quot;other unknown&quot; universe. Nor do I think that the simulation would necessarily have to map 1:1 for us to be in <i>a</i> simulation.')
