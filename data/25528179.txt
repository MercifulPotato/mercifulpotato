We have to educate them, which is maintaining them in an adequate context while guiding them towards finding what they want and will be good for them and not bad for others.  In my opinion our contemporary society very rarely offers such an adequate context.  Hoarding kids in overpopulated classrooms where they sit for hours with adults having few (if any) personal interconnection with them is apparently the most efficient way... and (IMHO) a recipe for disaster (diabetes and obesity getting out of control being part of it).<p>I didn&#x27;t wrote that my approach is simple and explicitly stated, above, ((that)) &#x27;It is, however, more difficult&#x27; than the usual &#x27;select a cure for the symptom and impose it&#x27;.')
