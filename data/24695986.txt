Item(by='Nitramp', descendants=None, kids=[24698545], score=None, time=1601975984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693490, text='&gt; The notion that Albright is a &quot;patent troll&quot; friend is incorrect. [...]<p>There&#x27;s the problem of possibly being too friendly towards patent trolls. But there&#x27;s also the problem of supporting and encouraging frivolous patent litigation overall.<p>Patent lawyers (and apparently now judges) don&#x27;t really care who wins. Their  business thrives if there&#x27;s simply more litigation around patents. They&#x27;ll see companies file more patents, need more consultation, and work on more cases.<p>In that light, whether Mr Albright worked for either side doesn&#x27;t really make a difference. The point is that his specialization is set to gain from more litigation. More litigation comes from more patent trolls, so questions regarding the impartiality are appropriate.')
