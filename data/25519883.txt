Right now for me it&#x27;s identified 6 sort of genres that I listen to.<p>It didn&#x27;t identify that one of them is hip hop, and the other one is dutch hip hop, which obviously to me are the same genre, but that&#x27;s alright.<p>It&#x27;s got a classical music mix, one for rock, one for soundtracks and one for electronic&#x2F;lo-fi.<p>It would&#x27;ve been cool if it knew to group electronic&#x2F;lo-fi, classical and soundtrack together as my background work music, but I&#x27;m not sure how it would&#x27;ve learned that as normally I have to pick one of those genres while working, I have no playlists that mix them.')
