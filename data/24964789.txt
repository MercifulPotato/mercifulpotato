For my other HLL of choice, pyrasite[1] works quite well. When using all of those tools, I encountered significant out-of-the-box usability issues until I learned what those debugger-esque tools were doing with regards to their &quot;target&quot; programs&#x27; (or their postmortem heaps) stacks, signal handlers, and allocators. Combining the understanding of the latter concepts with the former tools is a killer combo, and, while I can&#x27;t speak directly to your counterexample of the NodeJS runtime, I would be extremely surprised if tooling did not exist to perform similar debugging tasks with it.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmacken&#x2F;pyrasite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmacken&#x2F;pyrasite</a>')
