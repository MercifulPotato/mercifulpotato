I have yet to meet a person that uses the alphabetically ordered list of apps, which you cannot edit in any way. Not long ago I was in front of an old computer with Win2000. No, the advantages weren&#x27;t just habitual. You can control Windows without a start menu and this is what I basically do now.<p>So what would I do with a tablet? More painting. What else? Nothing. Apple is awesome for audio applications, but with MacOS please.<p>Not even browsing the web is fun because you cannot write angry comments anywhere without getting even angrier with your input device.<p>Some schools suggested getting touch devices for learning. I nearly ripped all my hairs out. Sure, you could attach a keyboard an all and a unified environment is easy to maintain.
