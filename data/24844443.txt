Two questions:<p>1) Does scaling a Supabase app basically just boil down to scaling a Postgres database? Firebase (Firestore) claims they can do like a million concurrent connections &amp; 10 megs per second of writes. Any idea of the scaling limits of Supabase? Totally understand if this isn&#x27;t on the radar yet, it is not really a concern for most applications.<p>2) Do you have a built in authentication solution? One of the pleasures of Firebase is the built in authentication that mostly just works by enabling it.<p>Happy that you are building an alternative to Firebase.')
