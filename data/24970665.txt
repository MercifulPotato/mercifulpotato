Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604338330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24964176, text='I sometimes wonder if my handwriting would be less bad if I used something other than a ballpoint. Not that my handwriting with a pencil is any great shakes, either. I literally got Ds in handwriting all through elementary school, on otherwise straight-A report cards.<p>I tend to grip too hard, press to hard, and otherwise fail to achieve the kind of smooth flow of people with neater handwriting. I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s something I could be trained out of, or if it&#x27;s something in my brain wiring or chemistry (perhaps in fine motor control or dysgraphia). My handwriting is tolerable if I write very slowly and very carefully, but that makes compostion harder and notetaking almost impossible.')
