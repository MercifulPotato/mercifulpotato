I&#x27;ve only got a background in undergraduate physics, but I&#x27;d say his description of his theory gives off huge kook vibes. I don&#x27;t really care about that: plenty of non-kook theories are still not reflected in reality, and if he has found an actual physical effect, then his kookiness becomes brilliance. Or maybe not, but even if his theories are wildly off-base, if he has observed a new phenomenon, that&#x27;s pretty big.<p>Of course, I suspect even his claim of observing a new phenomenon is a scam (a scam that he might have conned himself into believing), but someone should be able to reproduce it.')
