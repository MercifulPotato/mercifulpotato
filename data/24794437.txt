Item(by='giardini', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602798256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24794033, text='whimsicalism says <i>&gt;&quot;I think it is stupid to not vote for Biden over something like this. &quot;&lt;</i><p>IMO Biden&#x27;s likely to pass away <i>before</i> he&#x27;s elected and so I think it foolish to vote for him. He looks like a dead man walking - a paper cutout that Democrats move from one empty rally to another.<p>BTW who becomes the Democratic party nominee should Biden<p>a) die or fall very seriously ill before the election?<p>b) die on the eve of the election (i.e., halfway through  the voting, when some votes have already been cast for the deceased)?<p>c) die after the election but before he&#x27;s sworn in as President?<p>I see Biden&#x27;s health as <i>extremely</i> precarious.')
