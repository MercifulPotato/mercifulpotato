Why would my unfair coin have to abide by some norm of probability? If I were designing such a coin, it would obviously include a mechanism for tracking state such that if the last toss was heads the next would always be tails. For example, it could literally redraw the upwards-facing side to the desired outcome an instant before striking the table.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a great head for mathematics because it feels like most impossibilities arise from arbitrary constraints and definitions. Reading such proofs feels like:\n1) I&#x27;ve created an arbitrary universe with made up rules\n2) This condition does&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t break one of those rules I made up\n3) QED<p>For example, why on earth can&#x27;t a straight line in a rectangle have a 180 degree angle at its center making that rectangle an octagon too? It&#x27;s not clear why one system is epistemologically valid and the other is not. The proof of impossibility feels like a &quot;no true scotsman&quot;&#x2F;&quot;no true octagon&quot; fallacy disguised by a bit of added notation.')
