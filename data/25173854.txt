Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25177333], score=None, time=1606005721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173574, text='A quick search suggests that a semi truck <i>without</i> trailer weighs between 10 and 25 tons[0].  Those are usually 3-axle, so that&#x27;s between about 125 and 4800 units of damage.  That&#x27;s still a massive amount when compared to the 1 unit of damage for a sedan.<p>Add an empty trailer and you get 35 tons (5 axles, 2400 units of damage).  US max allowed is 80 tons, for a whopping 65,536 units of damage.<p>I don&#x27;t know how full they are, but I see 5-axle tractor-trailers on highways all the time in the US, and also locally doing last-mile deliveries to larger businesses like supermarkets and home improvement stores.<p>I guess the differences in allowed weights might account for why US roads are often in worse shape than many in Europe, though I assume vastly different maintenance schedules play a large part as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tcsfuel.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;truck-weight-classification&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tcsfuel.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;truck-weight-classification&#x2F;</a>')
