It would only take the addition of a few simple protections to make the equity a fair deal, even without divulging information about the cap table.  I&#x27;m sure other sets of protections could be devised which provide different tradeoffs. After all, there is no reason that employees couldn&#x27;t have a dedicated board seat!<p>- The employee equity participates at the highest prefered equity pool.<p>- The employee option strike price will always mirror the lowest 409A valuation while the option is open.<p>- Vested employee options are valid for 100 years while illiquid, and 7 years post liquidity event.<p>- Modifications to employee equity pools resulting in a decrease in option value as the result of a funding round must be accompanied by a tender offer of 70% of the pre-funding option value.<p>The above terms wouldn&#x27;t provide much value if employees didn&#x27;t understand that the companies equity is better than a competing employers equity.')
