Eng.) from a non-U.S. university and have lived in the U.S. on a J-2 (dependent) visa; my spouse was working as a researcher at a U.S. university. During that time, I worked (on an EAD) for a U.S.-based R&amp;D company, serving as a principal investigator on Govt. (DoD) funded research projects. I have publications, have served as reviewer for intl. academic journals, etc., but have not won any internationally recognized prizes.<p>(1) Given my background, do I currently stand a chance of getting an EB-2 visa via NIW?<p>(2) Would it all come down to the letters supporting my applications?<p>(3) Does my prior J-2 status (2-year home stay requirement; visa expired 1.5 years ago) have any effect on possibly getting an EB-2 visa via NIW?<p>(4) Would the prior J-1 status of my spouse affect her ability to join me on an E-21?<p>(5) Would applying to the Diversity Visa Program interfere with also applying for an EB-2 visa via NIW?<p>Thanks!')
