Item(by='afarrell', descendants=None, kids=[25929855], score=None, time=1611759050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928340, text='Honestly, this is the biggest reason I want UBI.<p>I want it to be easier to operate a profitable food truck in Flint, Michigan so that it is easier to find a job building software that solves food safety problems for folks in places like Flint, Michigan. Currently, there is not enough anticipated revenue from doing that. Poorer people get fewer votes on which problems (like being hungry for lunch) and metaproblems (like running a food truck) get solved by the free market.<p>UBI also would make more centrally-decided solutions like education easier to provide. Kids learn better when they have less-stressed parents and aunts who run local businesses.')
