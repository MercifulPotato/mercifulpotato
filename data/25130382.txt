This is my main problem with writing, since I have a very hard time to figure out what people expect. I also read a lot of books about writing, but none really helped. They always use these very abstract concepts which if you apply them blindly will also lead to an incomprehensible text anyways. What helped a lot was to just take a similar text which seemingly fulfills expectations, and, almost short of plagiarism, just exchange the messages which are conveyed. This is where AI could help a lot, because I would think that it should be able to exactly this task, if you provide it the message you would like to write up. Anyways, I donâ€™t know anybody (at least in science) who likes writing and I really hope that there will be a more practical solution than spending hours and hours of refining a text in the future. This time could better be spent on research.')
