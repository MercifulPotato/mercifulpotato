If you have too much supply, you aren’t making money because you have to subsidize all the cars without riders in them.<p>If you have too much demand and not enough supply, then wait times shoot up, and people return to your competitors.<p>Plus demand is non-uniformly distributed across time. If you have enough cars to handle peak demand, then they’ll be sitting idle the remainder of the day&#x2F;week.<p>Most people think that trains are busy, because most people ride trains in high-demand times of year. If the same is true of a TNC, then it’s much better to list your cars with a bigger network and let them keep your cars busy more than you can.<p>It’s much more expensive to properly balance the marketplace than you think.')
