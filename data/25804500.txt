Actually out of all my old protocol analyzers this one is probably the coolest from a technical perspective. It has six 68k&#x27;s in it, and is heavy as hell. Unfortunately I never get to use it unlike all my other one&#x27;s because it only has ISDN BRI interfaces, and most of my hacking involves PRI (T1&#x2F;E1) or V series interfaces.')
