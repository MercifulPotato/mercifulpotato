Google puts ads on YouTube, then out-competes actually-free software alternatives because they have money from advertising and for-pay alternatives because they don&#x27;t charge money to users. Hello surveillance capitalism.<p>The other is the Twitter problem. It&#x27;s harder to block (only) low-quality posts than make them, therefore Twitter.<p>I think the first one is just a coordination problem. We need a one-time expenditure to get the likes of PeerTube to a level of usability, reliability and performance equal to YouTube, and that&#x27;s it. Then  you don&#x27;t need YouTube anymore, or Twitter or Gmail or anything else that could be replaced in that way. It takes a one-time expenditure of resources to create the technology, so we just need a way to raise the money. Once it exists it&#x27;s a lot easier to raise the smaller amount of money needed for incremental improvements. (And really it&#x27;s already happening but it&#x27;s taking too long to get to the mass adoption phase for lack of resources.)<p>The second problem is harder, but maybe some kind of proof of work system for account creation. So there is a one-time cost of some kind for account creation, negligible for an ordinary user who will use it for ten years but costly to a spammer who will have their account blocked with all its posts removed in 30 seconds.<p>Also, in article about first commercial spammer:<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Siegel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Sie...</a><p>&gt; Occupation: lawyer (disbarred in 1997)')
