So they likely have a TV already. Switching  between different usages of the TV they have is probably doable. Use the computer connected during day time for work, and use the TV functionality in the evenings for recreation.<p>I agree tablets and laptops are more accessible. But I think when it comes to really learning how to use a computer and realize its full potential you want a proper desktop computer with mouse, keyboard, connection ports. I think it is useful to learn how to plug in different USB devices, monitors etc.<p>Unlike a Chrome book or Tablet, a &quot;real&quot; computer give you a chance to learn about how a file system works, organizing files into folders.  Using multiple programs to work on a collection of files. The single task orientation of tablets make them very user friendly and low threshold but that also limit you in how far you can go.<p>My kids started out on tablets but now I try to push them more onto using a regular computer.')
