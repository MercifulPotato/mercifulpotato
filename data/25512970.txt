They successfully and continuously targetted me on FB and the ad was effective enough to make me click. Now I see they got on HN which is hard for even legitimately deserving posts. They know their target demographic extremely well and knows how to get noticed. The ultimate give away for me was the fact that this cannot be good in-person class given such a huge marketting effort and potential enrollment that might be in order of 10s of thousands. Ultimately it&#x27;s no more than buying a lesson video.')
