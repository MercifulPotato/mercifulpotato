Item(by='ClumsyPilot', descendants=None, kids=[25567312, 25566344, 25566020], score=None, time=1609207948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564527, text='I disagree with the author right from the start, It appears the author wants an email service that is anonymous, free, and let&#x27;s him access it through a VPN. I don&#x27;t think that makes sence (how does the provider make money?) and I think it&#x27;s not what 95% of the public needs.<p>If you rely on your email for vital services your want email provide to operate like an (idealised) bank - store my private information with respect, and to be able to retrieve email even if my PC or account is stolen, and I am happy to pay for the privilege. Furthermore, handing over real money gives you standing to sue in the court of law if the provider doesn&#x27;t uphold their side of the bargain. I don&#x27;t mind providing real ID if it&#x27;s a trustworthy institution with a real address and a phone number I can dial for customer support.<p>By contrast if you Gmail is hijacked, there is no-one you can call for help and they can also ban you with no warning for no reason. You have almost no legal recourse on their misbehaviour because they can do anything for any reason and it&#x27;s free.<p>I was further surprised to read that the author sees no daylight between free Gmail, outlook, outlook Premium with your own domain (paid service), business office 365, etc. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to call them all data collectors and the difference between then are not trivial.<p>I am not claiming the author is misinformed or hasn&#x27;t done his homework - just that this take is from the perspective of &#x27;internet of anonymity&#x27; of 2000&#x27;s, not &#x27;internet of service I can trust my life with&#x27; that we deserve.')
