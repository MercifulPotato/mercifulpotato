Don&#x27;t defend it.<p>When yelp started replacing the phone number of restaurants with their yelp delivery service partner&#x27;s phone number to intercept the sales and use their own provider, everybody on hackernews rightly called it out as shit, but when google does the same shit its &quot;not everybody&#x27;s cup of tea&quot;.<p>No, you can&#x27;t divorce AMP from how Google uses AMP. Google made AMP and Google shaped the core foundations of AMP that lets them do this. You can&#x27;t just hand wave that away.')
