That is, the virus wakes up every so often, replicates (killing the host cell), infects another cell nearby, and then goes back to sleep. Blocking any one of those steps would eliminate the reservoir. There&#x27;s actually some pretty promising work that&#x27;s been done on how to wake up all the virus at once, because if you do that while the person is on ART, the reservoir would be entirely eliminated!')
