It&#x27;s fascinating mix of semi-solid speculation, dubious speculative and pernicious right-wing&#x2F;&quot;evolutionary&quot; arguments (IE, shades from sold game theory to incel-thinking and such). I like to survey it sometimes but I also actually would like it to die since some of the more interesting thinkers&#x2F;tendency might do better pulling out of it&#x27;s particular (and very toxic imo) &quot;rationality&quot; framework.')
