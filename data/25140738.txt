So you have to outsource it to someone you trust, find someone in your company that wants to moonlight as a sysadmin for 10-20 minutes&#x2F;day, or pay a full time employee to not do that much.<p>How much time you have to spend is generally related to how many servers you have.  In my experience, if you have automation setup correctly (1-2 weeks) you can average around 5 hours per month to manage about 30 servers.')
