It&#x27;s not really taught. As you pointed out later, it&#x27;s not just &quot;media literacy,&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;thinking for yourself,&quot; &quot;critical thinking,&quot; &quot;skepticism,&quot; &quot;reasoning.&quot;<p>While I also think it is true that we do a terrible job in general of educating people to think critically, it is not simply a failure of education—or at least, not in the traditional sense of “if you just force knowledge into someone, they will understand it”. I feel like there is real merit to the idea that media literacy may not be enough to save us from the firehose of the internet. Human brains are reckless and love to engage in motivated reasoning, filtering, and other cognitive distortions to protect us from information that threatens our core values.<p>I’ve known engineers with impeccable critical thinking and reasoning skills—but only when they were programming. On other matters, where any sort of emotional or value judgment was involved, they would uncritically accept false information which meshed with their belief of how the world is. For example, someone once told me that they didn’t think that vaccination actually caused the decline in measles rates because the MMR vaccine wasn’t developed until after infections started going down. OK, great, valid reasoning, except their next thought <i>should’ve</i> been that maybe there was a <i>different</i> measles vaccine that came first (because there was). They didn’t go there, though, because they have a deeply held belief that vaccines are bad&#x2F;scary, and their brain conveniently suppressed the critical thinking process that might’ve lead them to need to reevaluate their position.<p>You might argue that this person doesn’t have “true” critical thinking skills, and maybe that’s true, but I also know that I tell <i>myself</i> stories and avoid seeking out contradictory evidence in order to protect some of my most deeply held beliefs—even though truth and honesty are what I value above all else. Some cows are just too sacred.<p>&gt; Journalism has failed because it was bought out by corporate interests who have a vested interest in a particular narrative.<p>I feel like this is a reductive answer to a very complex problem. I think you’re spot on that the market is not incentivising high quality reporting, but there are many factors at play beyond “journalists got bought out” and “educational standards are bad”. There are <i>so</i> many diverse interests who don’t want people to think critically, including a lot of ordinary people! It’s <i>hard</i> to think critically all of the time. The world is unfathomably complex. You and I may be hanging on, just barely, thanks to genetic and&#x2F;or socioeconomic lotteries giving us slightly better hands in life. Most people don’t have those advantages and are highly motivated to pound reality into an uncomplicated place where there are only two distinct genders, or all cops are bastards, or it’s all the mainstream media’s fault, or we can save the planet from global warming by just planting a trillion trees, or whatever. There’s no one single source of this quagmire, and no One Simple Trick that will solve it.')
