I bought about $250 worth of bitcoins two years ago on an exchange. The exchange went bankrupt and the bitcoins are gone. At least with a stock broker your account is insured by the government up to a certain amount.<p>Yes, I know, run your own wallet, don&#x27;t leave your bitcoins on the exchange... Except again, with stocks, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that. I was personally hoping that a bitcoin exchange would have better security and backups than my home PC. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, storing bitcoins on your machine, with no insurance, is not much safer than storing gold bullion in your closet.<p>I&#x27;m just happy what I was wise enough not to put more money in bitcoin than I could afford to lose.')
