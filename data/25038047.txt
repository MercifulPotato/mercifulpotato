That’s a joke.\nA more realistic plan is the $3&#x2F;mo for 50 pages (still not much for an average printer owner, but not the joke 15 pages is). At that price your math is adding up in less than 2 years.<p>My highly used $30 Canon printer is in its 4th year, and 3rd cartridge. I’m well ahead of where I would have been with the HP (I print about 3-4 pages a day, so I’d probably have had to shell out for the $5 or $12 plan).<p>Also, much like most subscription services, even if the math works out, it only does until the next change in the pricing plan.')
