Instead of filtering by the domain where the article is hosted, I use the title and its underlying theme or subject as the filter for which article comments I will read. I&#x27;m not interested in every single subject posted on HN so I just look for the subjects that I am interested in. Reading the actual article can take time. For me, I find skimming some of the discussion in the comments as a quick proxy on what the article is actually saying or the value of the article.<p>With all filtering, there is always the risk of false negatives where you skip something that you would have found of value or really interesting.<p>I agree that some of the most interesting articles are from non-mainstream sources. For example, the recent article about weaving.')
