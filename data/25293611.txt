They help users avoid using the same password for every site, granted, but is that really good enough?<p>Consider that every time you go to login to Twitter you also expose say your AWS root password or any TOTP backups, etc.<p>Compare to Mooltipass, Trezor Password Manager, or Password Store + Yubikey which all decrypt a single password at a time with a physical touch on an external device.<p>If an adversary has malware on your system and wants to dump 100 passwords they must get you to physically consent 100 times on an external device.<p>Presumably you would notice.<p>Today I only recommend hardware password managers. Pay for the hardware once and there is no monthly fee or any such nonsense, as the client software is all local and open source. Also no company gets the list of services you use and analytics of how often you use them for added privacy.<p>All three of these alternatives let you backup your encrypted password database to a git repo or cloud storage of your choice.<p>For technical teams where sharing is needed I tend to setup Password Store which lets us set up per folder sharing permissions and the database is just a shared git repo.<p>There are multiple cli and gui front ends available for mobile and desktop.')
