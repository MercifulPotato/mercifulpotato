In every sane tax system, donations (even loans with lower than usual interest rates) are taxed just like inheritance. Of course, getting a million dollar loan at all makes a huge difference. But it&#x27;s still no guarantee to build a successful business. The point is to make it a lot harder to bequeath obscene amounts of wealth.')
