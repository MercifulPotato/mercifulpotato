Any sentient alien life we&#x27;d hope to encounter alive will need to exist at the same (relative) time that we do. The Earth is 4.5 Billion years old. Man has existed as &#x27;man&#x27; for about 5 million years. That&#x27;s 0.1% of the age of Earth. If alien species evolved in a similar manner, but 0.1% faster or slower, we&#x27;d miss them by millions of years.')
