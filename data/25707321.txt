The US is not threatened by China. The Pacific prevents any invasion of the America&#x27;s, and China cannot blockade the US given its two coastlines and world class navy.<p>2. China is threatened by the US. It&#x27;s ringed by US military bases and depends on oil shipping through the Indian Ocean.<p>3. China has no ideology of global expansion and conversion like the USSR, nor does it need more land and resources like the much smaller Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan. Taiwan (and frankly all of China&#x27;s other disputes) are limited goals of a nationalist ideology from the 1940s and losing Taiwan won&#x27;t trigger a dominoe effect of China annexing the rest of the world and threatening America or Europe.<p>In a future where Taiwan was annexed and the US has pulled it&#x27;s bases back to Guam or Hawaii, I can&#x27;t see any future flash points between the two nations. Rather, a much healthier and respectful relationship between two powerhouses that mind their own affairs instead of sticking weapons and provocations in each other&#x27;s faces.<p>However, this line of reasoning requires accepting that the US should not act as a global defender of democracy worldwide regardless of cost or strategy, and that encouraging a democracy to spring up in the path of a unsettled conflict wasn&#x27;t the wisest of choices.<p>Still, minority positions tend to be unpopular unless reality proves them to be true.')
