I did not know this at the time, but I then (and now to much lesser degree) had pretty significant sensory overload&#x2F;over-sensitivity issues particularly with light. I vividly remember being taken to Cary Town Center by my parents and for some reason feeling an overwhelming sense of relief, though I did not understand why at the time. Going back as an adult, I realized it&#x27;s because the place was a freaking cave.<p>I think even mid 80-90s malls had much more natural light, but Cary Towne Center was built in 79 and I think even if they turned the roof into a sheet of plexiglass that the layout would keep large sections dark. The food court for example is on the first floor and is lined with shops, preventing easy windows of any kind.<p>Maybe they can use a series of mirrors?')
