There weren&#x27;t any off-the-shelf solutions at that time that could come within an order of magnitude of that at a reasonable cost - the most viable solution we tested required a thousand EC2 instances to sustain that traffic.<p>Ended up hand-coding a load test framework in a few hundred lines of highly async epoll-based C. Scenarios controlled by a simple configuration syntax in a text file. Trivially generated enough load to break the load balancer in front, our service, and all the services and databases behind it - all this running on just a handful of instances.<p>Pre-existing tools are great, but often don&#x27;t solve the problem to hand. If load test frameworks aren&#x27;t doing it for you, don&#x27;t be afraid to write your own.')
