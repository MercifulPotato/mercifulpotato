He mostly correctly bashed a bunch of strawmen to great effect. Except they have more or less nothing to do with what he actually wants, which is his ability to continue to re-securitize loans he makes until he gets to the ludicrous self-fund rate of 1.6% on the loans and offloading most of the risk to the rest of society while getting most of the gains.<p>Nothing he complains about are infeasible with Basel III&#x27;s reserve rate of 8%. Peer to peer lending, ML analysis on spending habits etc, none of his &quot;innovations&quot; are inhibited by regulation. The only thing it&#x27;s affecting is the profit.')
