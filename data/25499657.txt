A person can buy the parts on their own and put them together in their garage.  It isn&#x27;t like they have to go get a pick axe and start mining ore to create everything from scratch.  Apple just needs to buy the components that already work, and then do what they do best and perfect that parts that haven&#x27;t been perfected.  In this case, the battery, the motor, the onboard computer, and the software.  And based off what Apple has built in the past, these are the things that Apple would be REALLY good at.<p>It isn&#x27;t like they have to invent tires and drive shafts.<p>I know I undersold the difficulty of making a car in this comment, but come one, Apple is 87 times more valuable than Ford.  They have enough cash on hand to buy Ford 5 times.  Money might not solve all problems, but it really really helps.')
