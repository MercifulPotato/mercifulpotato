The handshake still has to be performed by the application in user space, and the application then needs to call setsockopt() in order to inject the keys into the kernel. By contrast, z&#x2F;OS AT-TLS implements all of TLS (including the handshake), so the application doesn&#x27;t have to do anything. As far as the application is concerned, a TLS socket looks exactly the same as a plain one (unless the application starts calling the AT-TLS ioctl, which will tell it whether a socket is plain or TLS)<p>- The Windows &quot;kernel mode SSL&quot; is only for the built-in HTTP server. It doesn&#x27;t apply to clients, or to other protocols than HTTP. By contrast, z&#x2F;OS AT-TLS works for any protocol, not just HTTP, and supports both clients and servers<p>So nobody has built the same functionality as z&#x2F;OS AT-TLS in Linux or Windows. People have built some small subsets of z&#x2F;OS AT-TLS&#x27;s functionality, but not the generality that AT-TLS provides.')
