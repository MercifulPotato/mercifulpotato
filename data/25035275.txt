And I&#x27;ve also never known anyone who were still completely out five months after they had the flu, unlike a couple of young friends of mine who got Covid in March. One of them (&lt;30) couldn&#x27;t do <i>a thing</i> until October.\nIf my parents get the flu it&#x27;s extremely likely they&#x27;ll be fine in a week or two. Covid would be a completely different story.')
