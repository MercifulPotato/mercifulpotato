Also extremely fast in compilations.<p>The string handling are much better than C. Most is just automatically. You would not even encounter any difficulties until you start to interface with C libraries. And then it is still easy.<p>Due to this and strong typing and bounds-checking you automatically avoid most memory errors that you get in C. But you can make it as complicated as C, with pointers to pointers to arrays, disable bounds-checking&#x2F;type-checking, etc. \nThere are some limited parametric type possibilities.<p>The disadvantage is the absence of closures&#x2F;lambdas. Instead you have to make pointers to functions, like in C. Or use Objects like in Java. But with manual memory management.<p>The manual memory management and type declarations give extra overhead. Like in C. A lot would be avoided with inline variable declarations with automatic typing.')
