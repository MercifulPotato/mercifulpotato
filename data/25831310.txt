So I&#x27;d sorta just be, like, donating this money if I paid you for this thing, right?&quot;</i><p>But you know who <i>would</i> pay more if they prescribe Lexapro?  The manufacturer of Lexapro, and that&#x27;s who he should have pitched this to.  And they have the marketing muscle needed to make it scale.<p>That said, there&#x27;s all sorts of conflict of interest&#x2F;slippery slope issues going down that path, and I&#x27;m not sure they would buy this either, but they&#x27;d still have been his best bet.')
