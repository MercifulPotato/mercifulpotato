I can only speak for myself, but most of my Computer Science classes were nowhere near a cake walk, while I aced every single literature class, even the 300 level classes.<p>The only hard part about the literature classes was how much reading was assigned (often 300+ pages before the next class, per class, which might be 2 days later). But for the most part you could skim them just enough to take the pop quiz for the day and then get the parts the professor wanted you to know from the lectures, although I did my best to actually keep up with the reading. Tests and essays for lit classes were super easy for me, mostly just required parroting back what was covered in the lectures.<p>For Computer Science classes (in particular the programming assignments), if I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get something working, I ended up sitting in the computer labs for an extra 10-20+ hours until I could, because otherwise the best I could hope for on the assignment was a C. Professor&#x27;s office hours were usually a joke for me, I even got told once &quot;If you didn&#x27;t get it in class I can&#x27;t help you now,&quot; which I thought was the whole point of office hours. Didn&#x27;t have Stack Overflow or Youtube or even very many tutorials online back then either to help out.<p>Also I had several friends who pursued various humanities majors, and it never seemed like they were ever as busy as I was. I even thought maybe I picked the wrong major at one point because I was spending so much of it stressed out about classes (that&#x27;s actually the main reason I minored in English, I spent a semester only taking English classes, considering changing my major, but didn&#x27;t end up doing it).')
