The expenses due to sanctions and diplomatic conflict are 1000x of any profit. If there&#x27;s any profit compared to available imports from Russia.<p>4) It&#x27;s a country with past weaponization program.<p>We know what it&#x27;s really for.<p>&gt;They&#x27;ve made very clear what they mean by the statement.<p>Yep, very clear. Just examine their attitude to Israel which gets the same statement.')
