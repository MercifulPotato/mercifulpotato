Yes, the whole world is studying it 24&#x2F;7, and we really do not have a clue on long term effects. Science is pretty good, but some problems are pretty difficult too.<p>30 years ago, we could not have this ubiquitous testing capability and probably could not develop these tests at all. 10 years ago, we would definitely not have this vaccine  one year after patient zero. Today, we really have no clue on long term effects until they happen on a statistical scale. Science and biotech progress rapidly, but there are still a lot of things we can&#x27;t do.')
