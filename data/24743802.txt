Stork, Rambus Lab<p>TALK ABSTRACT: The central insight underlying the field of computational sensing and imaging is that the joint design of optics and signal processing to yield a final digital image or estimate of some property of the scene can relax the traditional constraints on optical elements need to make an optical image that &quot;looks good.&quot;  In our lensless imagers, binary diffraction gratings with special mathematical properties yield blurry, blob-like optical images that nevertheless contain sufficient information that a digital image of the scene can be computed.')
