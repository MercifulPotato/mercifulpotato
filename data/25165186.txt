It just seems strange to me that popular developer things like Go, Rust, Docker, virtualization of any kind are still months away despite these being super important use cases of the Mac. Maybe Apple just doesn&#x27;t feel that way, or have the numbers showing that my impression isn&#x27;t true, but it feels strange that they&#x27;re letting the community just figure it out by themselves now.')
