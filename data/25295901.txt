Isn&#x27;t it more like a &quot;look the other way&quot; policy, so that businesses in the industry still have to operate underground? If you make a business illegal, then only criminals will do it. In the US, marijuana has become extremely boring very quickly. The industry is now dominated by artisinal bud brands, IoT vape pods, and CBD smoothies, not gangs. Perhaps NL needs to legalize all the way.<p>Growing marujuana, as a business, is fundamentally almost exactly the same as growing any crop.')
