For example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;where-same-sex-marriage-stands-50-states-n109966" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;where-same-sex-marriage...</a> is a 2014 article that mentions that Missisipi had 14% support in 2004 and support went up by &quot;1-2% per year since then&quot;.  So _maybe_ it was at only 25%, as an absolute lower bound. But chances are it was higher than that even there.')
