No need for phone numbers anymore, just @handle, and it does multi-device encryption and backup. Its search is very fast, even for large number of messages. Good support for attachments and superb audio and video.<p>On the flip side, it&#x27;s not very customizable and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the more &quot;modern&quot; UX goodies like emoji reactions or threads. But it&#x27;s overall very good and I see no reason to change.')
