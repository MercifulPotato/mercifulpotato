I looked at the attempt out there to compile VLC to JS. I spent a few days and actually got it working, but it resulted in this monster 150 MB file. That&#x27;s just not feasible.<p>I was looking at different approaches to a in-browser Media Player for a while. It was only about a week ago that I found SourceBuffer.appendBuffer, in conjuction with FFMPEG -f segment that I thought there was something possible.<p>Then I finally cracked -segment_format_options which was the missing piece. I spent a whole day on that googling around, opening Upwork contracts trying to solve that problem. Could&#x27;ve been 1.5-2 days, I don&#x27;t remember.<p>Point is, it wasn&#x27;t just a 1-2 hackathon. There were serious technical problems that I solved.')
