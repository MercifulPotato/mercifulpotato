My impression is that if you own several websites and trackers, you can identify users by the specific combination of blocked and non-blocked trackers, plus data about their machine&#x2F;OS, ISP, screen resolution, and browser languages, as well as checking to see if browser permissions are turned on for notifications, location, and the like. I&#x27;m not sure you can prevent that with a javascript-based approach alone.')
