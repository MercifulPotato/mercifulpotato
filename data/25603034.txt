I did a quick search for privacy predictions (something I&#x27;m interested in) and found some interesting ones - particularly the first one below - it seems to be predicting ClearView AI - but back in 2010. Wow!<p>2010<p>-People become more privacy aware after an image search engine with facial recognition is popularized and they realize that any picture ever posted of them by anyone is in the search result for their name. People become less willing to let others take compromising pictures as if they become posted, the link back to them will be made.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1025787" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1025787</a><p>2011 - none\n2012 - none\n2013 - none<p>2014<p>2) Security&#x2F;privacy will become something normal people and businesses ask about, and ask fairly superficial questions about, during many transactions (e.g. people are going to stop being fucking morons and just relying on &quot;the cloud&quot; for sensitive data without questioning it; they may still end up using the cloud, but will want to make a more informed choice.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6994370" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6994370</a><p>I&#x27;d like to believe that we&#x27;ll be more privacy-conscious in 2014, but I don&#x27;t actually think that will be the case. I&#x27;d like to see more scrutiny of the data companies collect about users, particularly because they are now collecting more data than ever before. Some companies like Google have staggering amounts of user data. They&#x27;re probably salivating at the prospect of capturing even more precise user behaviour through an OS (Chrome) that potentailly captures everything you do online.<p>Far from the tech community (who you might hope would be most informed about this) actually raising concerns about the privacy implications of this, I think Google (and other companies) will continue to get away with barely any scrutiny at all.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6995005" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6995005</a><p>2015<p>2. More hacking scandals come to light and they are used as cover to restrict privacy and empower the intelligence community.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8823311" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8823311</a><p>Privacy still will be a target to crush for governments, and so any activity&#x2F;communication media&#x2F;etc that could affect that main objective.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8823103" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8823103</a><p>- Privacy will become more mainstream. After apps like DarkMail are introduced, Google and the other players will start to reconsider privacy and we, the people will gain.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8823303" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8823303</a><p>2016 - none\n2017 - none\n2018 - none\n2019 - none\n2020 - none\n2021 - none')
