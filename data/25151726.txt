I am not a radio astronomer but many of my friends are and have used Arecibo in the past. Losing this facility is just awful.<p>Its sad to see the facility decay, for sentimental and historical reasons; but is there any actual use for it? &quot;Any instrument can do someone some good&quot; surely, but can this one be maintained for what those users can pay?<p>I&#x27;ve already heard &quot;China sabotaged it so now they&#x27;re the only ones who can speak to the aliens&quot; ... Is there anything a single dish does better than say the VLA [1] many dishes configuration?  Long wavelengths would be better done with a herringbone so far as i know.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Karl_G._Jansky_Very_Large_Array" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Karl_G._Jansky_Very_Large_Arra...</a>')
