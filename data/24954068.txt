Perhaps I&#x27;m a bad driver, but I suspect this is normal, kind of in a low-attention mode most of the time, but if the car a lane over starts to change lanes too close, you go into high-alert mode.<p>I wonder if there are studies on how often humans need to do this sort of &quot;disengagement&quot; for lack of a better term?  Not sure how you&#x27;d measure it, perhaps with more eye movement than normal?  Dunno.')
