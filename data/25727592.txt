Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610364931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25723911, text='&gt; you may confuse me with a different poster<p>Whoops, sorry. I used to wonder why people make the elementary mistake of not noticing they&#x27;re talking to a different person. Now I know: it&#x27;s because the &quot;threads&quot; view shows the replies to your own comments, but not the comment you originally replied to. So there&#x27;s not enough context to notice that the usernames are different.')
