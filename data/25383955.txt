We can almost always get the answer with numerical methods. Yet, numerical solutions are good almost only for certain values of parameters.<p>Analytic solutions on the other hand provide more insight. It can be differentiated, integrated, compared and maybe (big maybe) transform to some other&#x2F;more familiar form. Finally it can be connected to whole body of mathematical knowledge. Analytic solutions are very satisfying for that reasons.<p>Closed solutions are small, very narrow subset of analytic ones, thatâ€™s why they feel special. But I suppose they become special only after some time spent with problems where closed form solutions are rare and unexpected. I suppose high school&#x2F;college mathematics makes us way too used to rare special cases, such as closed form solutions.')
