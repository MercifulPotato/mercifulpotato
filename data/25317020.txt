But a quick search for graphics-design displays yields several competitor products that have similar or better specs, at generally even lower price tags.<p>Apple does many things, but certainly not bleeding-edge innovation. Of course it likes to sell its products as such, but I guess that&#x27;s just how marketing works.')
