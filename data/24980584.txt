Or did you just mean on the frontend? I figured from your including it you meant something backend, like Express, which is probably the most popular in that space, and fairly minimal, but super easy to grab the middleware pieces you want.<p>As, yeah, if you&#x27;re looking for one giant &quot;does all the things&quot; framework, I don&#x27;t know of any. Even the ones that started that way, reconfigured their projects to keep them optional (i.e., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;actix&#x2F;actix-extras" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;actix&#x2F;actix-extras</a> ) ...and honestly, I feel like most frameworks are moving in that direction. Even ones that want to be like Rails (i.e., Phoenix for Elixir) tend to be very intentional in making the included pieces fit the middleware pattern so you can swap them out easily.<p>So you may be staying with Rails for a while if that&#x27;s important to you. I will say, comparing when I had to learn enough Rails to get something done, and having worked with Express, and Phoenix, and Gin, it&#x27;s generally no harder to learn the pieces you need than it is picking up any new batteries included framework. Oftentimes the same web search that would turn up the one bit of syntax you need for the batteries included framework (i.e., &quot;actix-web auth token&quot;)  will turn up the most obvious choice of middleware you&#x27;d need for the middleware approach. And the usage will be of similar effort, once you&#x27;ve installed one.')
