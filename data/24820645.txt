I&#x27;ve got my own little online multiplayer game I made for fun I&#x27;m pleased with. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yatzyonline.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yatzyonline.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;</a><p>At the start of lockdown I was inspired to make my own version of Yatzy (Yhatzee?) to play with friends. We tried to find somewhere to play Yatzy together and all the versions we found were full of social media signups and micro-transaction.<p>We wanted something simple to jump in and play in the browser. The <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.horsepaste.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.horsepaste.com</a> copy of CodeNames is a really good example of this done well.<p>It took a couple of days to make. There&#x27;s some bad development practices in there. Like heavy use of polling (I&#x27;ve since learned about WebSockets). And I wish I hadn&#x27;t made the frontend in JQuery. But I&#x27;m quite pleased with result. Its had a few hundred successful games finished through it and I learned a lot. Once I sort some of the awful code messes I&#x27;ll open source it.<p>Anyways if anyone&#x27;s interested its very easy to jump in and start a game.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yatzyonline.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yatzyonline.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;</a>')
