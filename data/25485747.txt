There are many others. Most of which have to do with being able to focus on the part of your code that actually does something instead of on infrastructure and integration. For example, not having to configure and maintain VMs, containers, or Kubernetes, off-loading a part of security onto the cloud provider, and built-in integration with supporting services like logging and metrics.<p>Serverless, like every design decision, comes with its own set of trade-offs. Whether those trade-offs make sense for your environment is something you have to determine. At my company we have seen a productivity increase and shorter development times using serverless. Of course, that was after the learning curve which is certainly not trivial.')
