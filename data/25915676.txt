Yet they seem naive, like they haven&#x27;t read about other communities. There&#x27;s a lack of vision about priorities or shared values.<p>Anyway, I can relate - we moved out of the city to raise our children, and never moved back. There&#x27;s a pump in the yard, an old cattle shed for storage, 80 acres of wandering paths among the bird-planted cedar trees and dogwood. A sometimes-creek wandering down the center of everything. Critters everywhere. A shop where things get repair or built.<p>And a basement computer lab where I do my remote consulting. Which funds the whole lifestyle.')
