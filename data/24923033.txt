In general, liability for failure to follow traffic laws and for manufacturers defects are strict liability, so how easy it is to understand the error doesn&#x27;t really have much room to play a factor in assigning liability, nor is it normally a legal component of assessment of damages once liability were assigned.<p>If we were talking about liability in a negligence&#x2F;recklessness regime, “hard to understand innocent errors =&gt; more liability awards” is a reasonable model, but in a strict liability regime, that an error is innocent (which being easy to understand makes more likely that a trier of fact, perhaps especially a jury, will find) isn&#x27;t a mitigation.')
