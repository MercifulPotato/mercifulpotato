I have been solving coding challenges almost every day, and revising common topics in computer science and topics that are specific to the sector I&#x27;m hoping to get a job in.<p>I can solve basic challenges on websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc. within 10 minutes with cleanly-written code; and problems with medium difficulty take me less than 30 minutes. I so do harder problems, too, I can either solve them (within a reasonable amount of time) or not depending on whether or not I can map onto something I already know. But whenever I&#x27;m given a coding tests I just suddenly don&#x27;t seem to be able to do any of that anymore. :(<p>Because of what you and others have said, I am starting to think that a time limit and the setting&#x2F;atmosphere is the trigger. I will definitely practise more!<p>I&#x27;m not too sure about interviewing at companies that I have no desire to actually work for because it feels like I am just wasting their time for my own gain. That&#x27;s just a personal opinion, and there may be mutual benefits I haven&#x27;t considered, and I would gladly change my mind if that&#x27;s the case.')
