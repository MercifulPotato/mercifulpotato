Otherwise it&#x27;s a  guessing game for what you want and creates unnecessary stress. If you planning to put people on-call (working under stress and time constraint) on their first day(no prior knowledge of the problem they may encounter) then its fine.<p>While I&#x27;m a decent programer, I perform terrible under these situations.
