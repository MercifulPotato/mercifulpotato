Some human mRNA vaccines were developed before COVID, but they didn&#x27;t do well in testing and none were approved. With no one needing to make mRNA vaccines in more than research and trial quantities, not many companies developed the capacity to make the prerequisites.<p>The issue then is not getting Pfizer to license their vaccine to some other company to make too. It&#x27;s that Pfizer is already making as much of it as can be made right now due to precursor availability limits.')
