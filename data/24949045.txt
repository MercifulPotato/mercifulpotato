I will, however, try to pitch in because I have had chronic intestinal issues and I&#x27;ve found a few hacks to make it feel better.<p>For me it helps to consider how many people have had it worse. It&#x27;s cynical, I know, but knowing that diarrhea killed more people than guns in the USA civil war is comforting. The Union soldier who died squatting over a pit while cannons boom and flies descend makes me remember how comfortable my climate-controlled bathroom is.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve learned is to not feel guilty when I&#x27;ve abandoned whatever I was up to before the pain started. I&#x27;m lucky to have a partner who is very forgiving when we are traveling or doing leisure activities and I have to rush to the nearest bathroom. It&#x27;s not your fault that you&#x27;re not doing what you were supposed to be doing. Don&#x27;t hesitate to curse your maladies for interrupting your life. It feels good to stick it to the man, even when the man is your own digestive system.')
