It would be much higher for a plasma but I couldn&#x27;t easily find a number.<p>At 100M degrees C, a single gram of hydrogen would have over 2 Gigajoules of thermal energy. 2 grams of hydrogen would have the same energy as a literal ton of TNT.<p>It&#x27;s not untenable, but its not really something that should be brushed off as &quot;its only a couple grams of fuel&quot; or &quot;it can&#x27;t have a runaway reaction&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;hydrogen-d_976.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;hydrogen-d_976.html</a>')
