I&#x27;ve been out of work before, but I never saw myself as a victim or powerless. I knew what I was worth and yes, it does take a lot of work, but I found work based on my own skills and merits.<p>America is increasingly growing into a nation where we cloth ourselves in victimhood as virtue. We are literally in a space where no-body is in the office today. You could pick up a $130 ~ $160k job anywhere and move out to a suburb in Texas. All you need is half-decent Internet, and you&#x27;d basically be living as if you were making the $200k you had in The Valley.<p>Stand up for yourself. If you only see yourself as a victim, that is all you will ever be.')
