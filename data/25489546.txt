For the most part, I think the article is right.  But there&#x27;s another reason why tech orgs and banks don&#x27;t want porn, which it completely ignores: the sheer quantity of bad actors around the industry.  Chargebacks, disputes, hacking, spam, money laundering, content theft, stalking, child pornography, and so forth are all endemic to the porn industry.
