The question is, would it be valuable to do so at scale?<p>If we had a good reason to mine an asteroid, knew we could get to said asteroid, and the asteroid has a composition we predicted. It’s probably possible to mine it to some extent.<p>However, in terms of economics... today, we haven’t proven we can mine an asteroid in a meaningful way.<p>Assuming we could, why? It would be cheaper at this point to just send up stuff from earth. If we prove our the mining tech, then it becomes cheaper to replicate, then it becomes more economical. However, first we need a use case that precludes an earth resupply (to force the major investment of tech). I suspect this will happen when we mine some super rare substance that is never found on earth (and&#x2F;or we are curious about what’s deep inside an asteroid)')
