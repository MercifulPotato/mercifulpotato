Sure, it&#x27;s an &quot;oracle&quot; server not controlled by PageSigner but still operated by Amazon.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tlsnotary.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tlsnotary.org&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tlsnotary.org&#x2F;wp&#x2F;?p=45" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tlsnotary.org&#x2F;wp&#x2F;?p=45</a>')
