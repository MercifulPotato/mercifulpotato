It seems like paycuts without cutting jobs seems to work better in Indian corporate culture as opposed to USA where companies will just cut the jobs entirely. The first pay cut seems to reflect that and isn&#x27;t surprising.<p>The next pay cut is surprising - the economy in India has been on recovery and global demand for Apple devices is not an issue. I&#x27;d keep eyes on the local company executives, many of whom probably walked away with large Diwali bonuses thinking they are kings for bringing Apple manufacturing to the area. They&#x27;re the ones to blame for not bringing on more HR resources.<p>Why yes, Apple does have responsibility for vetting suppliers, this specific factory seems to have gone sour very recently and the workers didn&#x27;t let them get away with it. Apple seems to have acted appropriately with a probation and the local&#x2F;national governments of India are also responding in a positive manner I believe will create stronger policies supporting tech manufacturing that properly care for staff and corporate oversight needs. I believe there will be closer eyes on the BMW driving corporate staff who hopefully will not continue behaving like kings.')
