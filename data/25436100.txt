Item(by='Mirioron', descendants=None, kids=[25438946], score=None, time=1608071274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433944, text='&gt;<i>My hypothesis is that in those who are introduced to Gacha games, you will see an increase in other &#x27;addictive&#x27; behavior, because the content they see will whittle away at their resistance to other addictive behaviors.</i><p>But we obviously tolerate this to some extent. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to limit smoking so that it doesn&#x27;t cause second hand smoking effects on other people. However, going further than that seems odd to me. If they&#x27;re only hurting themselves then I don&#x27;t see the problem with it. We allow people to do extreme sports, we allow them to drink alcohol, we allow them to do high stress jobs, we allow them to eat sugar, we allow them to do a long list of things that can hurt them, but we tolerate most of those because people should be free to choose how to live their life. Yet somehow on a small list of things we control people&#x27;s behavior. If they don&#x27;t follow it then they&#x27;re considered immoral. (We don&#x27;t call them immoral, but that&#x27;s how we treat them.)')
