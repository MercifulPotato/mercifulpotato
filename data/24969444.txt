Yet there was a legal case that said otherwise - so &#x2F;r&#x2F;environment jumped on that as truth. Legal precedence science does not make.<p>Thinking like that also makes it really easy to create new laws, e.g. that homosexuality is an affront to god and should be illegal. Then claim it as scientific fact for the opposing side.')
