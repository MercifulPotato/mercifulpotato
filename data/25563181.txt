I&#x27;m sorry, but that&#x27;s how it is. There is also a very easy solution.<p>I&#x27;ve done my fair share of hiring. We have hiring windows too, and have to close a candidate in a reasonable time. But when we started down this path, I made sure that we explained the time frames and where they came from up front, and agreed with the candidate on a reasonable window. At the time of interviewing, which is the crucial part.<p>That way everyone knew where they stood, and more importantly, the candidates who were in the middle of a lengthier interview process with another company could arrange the time frames to suit us. Most of the time 2 weeks was perfectly fine. Some of the candidates needed 3 weeks. One ended up requiring a month.<p>But because the expiration windows were agreed upon together with candidates when they were still early in the process, they were not caught off guard.')
