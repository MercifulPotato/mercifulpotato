In my social circles , with some friends, I might talk about this stuff.<p>On the internet it&#x27;s very easy to forget the human and start acting like a jerk.<p>I&#x27;ve also accepted I don&#x27;t need everyone to agree with me. For example I don&#x27;t use social media or online dating. These things weren&#x27;t good for me mentally. I don&#x27;t need to write 80 Reddit posts about how right I am.<p>That said, I have found Reddit to be much friendlier than Stack overflow for tech questions. On SO you get banned if you write too many subjective questions.<p>&#x27;What IDE should I use &#x27; gets flagged and 2 or 3 other questions like that and your banned.<p>As long as you aren&#x27;t straight up belligerent , you won&#x27;t get banned on Reddit for that.<p>It&#x27;s a careful balance. Once Corona ends I very much plan on deleting Reddit. Right now it&#x27;s an interesting distraction , but like other social media it can&#x27;t replace real human interaction')
