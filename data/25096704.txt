Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605397226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096182, text='Historically speaking, OCSP was invented in a world where almost all DNS requests were also in cleartext. So if an attacker can observe DNS requests, then it&#x27;s already &quot;game over&quot;, and the cleartext of the OCSP request is almost redundant at that point.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting a couple differences between HTTPS OCSP and Developer ID OCSP. First, with Developer ID, the only DNS request is for ocsp.apple.com, so the DNS request by itself doesn&#x27;t expose any information about the Mac app being launched, unlike with HTTPS.<p>Second, the caching of Developer ID OCSP responses tends to be much much shorter than for HTTPS. Prior to Thursday&#x27;s outage, the standard cache length for Developer ID OCSP responses seemed to be 5 minutes. (Apple seems to have raised it to 12 hours now.) In contrast, I just checked the latest response in my OCSP cache, which was for <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocsp.digicert.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocsp.digicert.com</a>, and its validity is 7 days. So the rate at which Developer ID OCSP requests are made seems to be much higher than for HTTPS, and thus there&#x27;s greater chance of exposure.')
