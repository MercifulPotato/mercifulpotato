It took me a few days to come across a bunch of pain points I was surprised had not changed; I do not like the install&#x2F;uninstall scatter-shot method, monthly reboots for updates, control panels feel like archeology digging older UIs for settings, the window freezes and I cannot resize&#x2F;minimize when the app is busy, I do not like Explorer or the windowing UI. PowerShell in practice seemed too verbose for interactive use and the learning curve&#x2F;adoption was too steep to be productive (everyone else on the small team was writing BAT files). I got tripped up by odd things like offline documentation and you had to wrap it in a BAT file to automate it. I also don&#x27;t like compiling stuff for Windows. I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone who likes Windows, but I have a very strong preference for the other OSes. I might have some of those details wrong, but that&#x27;s what I remember from the transition. I wished I had kept a diary because I forget a lot of it now.<p>WSL (admittedly v1) was a bit odd and hefty to install. The account&#x2F;permissions and locations of files was awkward. I found myself ssh-ing into a Linux box to do a lot of things.')
