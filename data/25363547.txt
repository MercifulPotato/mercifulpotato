Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=[25364400], score=None, time=1607543087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362652, text='I use UberEats fairly frequently, and while there have been a few bad experiences, they are usually fine.<p>The most common annoyance IMHO are restaurants not honoring the utensils option (i.e. not providing them even though you asked them to, or to a lesser extent vice-versa). The other minor annoyance is that they don&#x27;t update the status of the order correctly when you opt to pick up (it will often sit in &quot;preparing&quot; even after you actually pick it up, only changing to &quot;picked up&quot; 2 hours later.<p>The other thing that is weird is that while they make it fairly clear what the price breakdown is in term of food cost vs service fees (which I&#x27;d assume is the driver&#x27;s cut), they also have a mandatory tip for drivers (i.e. is the service fee not going to the driver then?)<p>I&#x27;ve had a few long delays, but this was because the restaurant was apparently slammed with some huge order, which is understandable. The weirdest one was when I placed an order, and it got marked as picked up before I got there to actually pick it up. Turned out they were a food court shop in a mall which closed for the day 10 minutes after I ordered (it was in some small town I was driving by in a road trip, I had no idea). I was able to get a full refund just by raising an issue in the app, without ever having to talk to anyone.')
