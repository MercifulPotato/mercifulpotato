In the end, (for the RIAA) it should be indifferent whether the source code can be accessed using git&#x2F;http&#x2F;smtp, whatever protocol.<p>So, in any case, it looks like the idea is not good to fight that issue (right now no one prevents anyone from sending his copy of the master of youtube-dl and letting other people reproduce it&#x2F;develop it).
