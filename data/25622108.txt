It has less eyes on it, requires more maintenance due to being out-of-tree, and coming from Oracle, it sounds like a legal minefield. Not that <i>I</i> personally risk anything, but I feel like btrfs is more future-proof (safer from being discontinued). Plus, it works OOTB on most Linux computers. Its ubiquity allows me to use it in numerous places. It is quite flexible and doesn&#x27;t require that much resources (I hear ZFS is quite RAM-hungry?). It isn&#x27;t perfect either, use what suits you!')
