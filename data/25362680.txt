In terms of usability, it&#x27;s important and that is as much an implementation detail as it is a design guideline detail.<p>Regarding the buttons, I agree they should elevate on hover and press down... with the animation for the click radial effect.  Touch interfaces with just the radial click indication.<p>For the survey&#x2F;study, I&#x27;m not convinced this is a bad thing.  Actually interviewing with people to determine what works best should be actively encouraged.<p>This also isn&#x27;t to say that I think google proper really cares all that much.  I&#x27;m pretty sure their UX designers are treated like second class citizens in their engineer focused culture, let alone those that cross between UI&#x2F;UX and engineering.<p>I also want to differentiate between &quot;Material Design&quot; the guidelines and &quot;Material UI&quot; the react component library.  It&#x27;s probably the single best component library I&#x27;ve ever worked with,  which isn&#x27;t saying too much as it&#x27;s not perfect, just better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen.<p>edit: the main point was that Google&#x27;s blessed implementation for their UI design framework is less used than a third party implementation for another framework.')
