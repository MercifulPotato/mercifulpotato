The animations, for example when you open the link menu (cmd+L), make it sluggish. And that&#x27;s on last year&#x27;s 16&quot; macbook pro without any heavy load, so it should not be slow.<p>Dev tools have improved, but so has Chrome. They still have a long way to go. I&#x27;m a frontend developer so I use these tools daily and I still use Chrome only because of the superior developer experience.<p>The touchid support is a neat feature, but 1password gets very close to it and I can use it in any browser. The only place where I was truly surprised with Safari was when you log to icloud.com, Apple pulls some 1st party magic there.<p>I&#x27;m now using Firefox in place of Safari, it feels faster and snappier. Checks all the boxes listed in the parent and then some, except native fingerprint support. \nI wonder if Safari is somehow performing better on big sur. I will test it during the weekend when I upgrade.')
