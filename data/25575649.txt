If your tires have aggressive enough treads they are just pushing the water away and making contact with the road surface.<p>If conditions are bad enough to cause a FWD or RWD car to hydroplane then there’s nothing AWD can do to help it given the same tires. Grip is all that matters when it comes to staying put on the road, and that comes entirely from your tires on normal road cars (most road cars aerodynamic profiles generate lift rather than downforce, so you aren’t getting any aero grip unless you are driving a sports&#x2F;supercar with aero elements).')
