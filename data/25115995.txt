I think humans have a desire to work with their hands and see the fruits of those labor. As more and more of us push paper and sling 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s, we&#x27;re losing that connection and seeing the outcome in things like &quot;Experience&quot; tourism and the romanticizing of hard work.<p>Look at what is popular on Youtube - &#x27;mustie1&#x27; fixes junk with his hands in 30 minute videos for nearly 500k subscribers. &#x27;Primitive Technology&#x27; replicate(d) societal development for 10.3M subscribers.
