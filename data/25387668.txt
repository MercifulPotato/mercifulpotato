I am actually baffled by the decision - what kind of applications did they thought was going to get tested - Todo apps?<p>Last I checked there was GH issue and they said that it will get addressed, I hope.<p>What they are also saying is that it is bad practice, you should send API requests from the tests that simulate the payment, for example. I find this BS, IMO the automation tests simulate user and user would not send API requests but click buttons on the screen.')
