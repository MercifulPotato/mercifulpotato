People change, business constraints change. Getting the right provisions in a contract makes sense in both cases.<p>Both people getting married and businesses striking a deal don&#x27;t enter the contract with the hope that they will have to break the contract.<p>Both know they can break the contract if needed, with effect somewhat known.')
