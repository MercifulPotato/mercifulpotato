Isn&#x27;t that obvious?<p>No, that&#x27;s an arbitrary conclusion you&#x27;ve made. There are multiple reasons why a project might be killed, even if it&#x27;s a good one. Canonical killed Ubuntu Touch but now it&#x27;s gaining traction again because we have things like the Librem5 and PinePhone. Premature if you ask me but it makes sense as a business decision.<p>If we look across industry, would you say killing Google Reader was because it was inferior to others? I wouldn&#x27;t.')
