I might not be old enough to remember something like this, even old times circa 1990s installments would let you have the item immediately, but be paid over time.<p>The PoS thing i am talking about was even before ecommerce was common was mostly decentralized through the seller. Overtime, banks started getting into this niche, and when you were paying with credit card, they offered you installments usually at 0% apr for few months. Eventually this moved to e-commerce with websites offering similar payments.<p>I also sort of remember in the US some credit cards (probably chase?) offered installments after you pay for the item - you&#x27;d login into your account, and pick a purchase to pay over time.')
