It seems this is a weakness across their product range.<p>AMD integrated graphics needs a bit of explaining to me is this the performance monster variety or Intel graphics is actually faster type of deal. How many external screens can I drive with this setup?\nMy main use case for this would be using Darktable. For the same reason I want a good HDPI screen. Otherwise, this would be a development machine (docker, misc jetbrains stuff, homebrew, some data engineering, and all the usual stuff). So looking for ram and CPU that is faster than what I have today (2018 15&quot; MBP).<p>My mac book pro is literally falling apart (keyboard) at this point and I&#x27;m not eager to jump on the ARM bandwagon yet as it will mess up my tool workflow short term (Java, docker, intellij, homebrew) and cause me compatibility headaches I just don&#x27;t need in my life right now. I am liking the performance though. All the software that I use runs fine on Linux. So, not a hypothetical option for me. I&#x27;d be up and running in a few hours with little to no loss of functionality.<p>I don&#x27;t care about legacy ports; USB-C dongles are cheap and effective and I have a few in my bag. Likewise with hdmi to usb-c. What I do care about is being able to connect my Thunderbolt USB-C phone, fuji camera, hard drives, external screen, etc. I&#x27;m thinking of adding a headphone to that mix. 2 USB-3.2 ports seems like it&#x27;s limited.')
