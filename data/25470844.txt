They know wtf they&#x27;re talking about because they&#x27;re the ones looking through the evidence while some officials pace back and forth while they write their statements and get paid 20x as much.<p>At this point, any evidence pointing to Russia will be met with responses like &quot;I&#x27;m still waiting for evidence that Russia is behind this,&quot; or &quot;I need to see this quote unquote <i>evidence</i> myself...&quot;<p>I gotta admit though, they have apparently really honed their English grammar.  Can&#x27;t use that technique to detect them anymore.')
