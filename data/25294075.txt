I believe the only provisions are service dogs and horses. But apartment managers, many restaurants, and general businesses are just ignorant enough of the law to not really push it. Some restaurants are starting to push back due to hygiene.<p>Now the new thing is to get out of paying exorbitantly high ($500) pet fees by claiming the pet as a support animal.
