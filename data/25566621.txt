The pop writer is different from the poet.  Poets don&#x27;t shy away from difficulty if it repays the reader&#x27;s effort in some way.  Poetry can even be interesting because it says or demonstrates something interesting about poetry itself.  (Code where people entertain themselves by solving simple problems in elaborate ways could fall into this category.)  That&#x27;s not what I shoot for.  When somebody reads my code, I want them to think, &quot;This is easy; any idiot could have done this.&quot;  My idea of a heroic achievement in software, which I&#x27;ve seen done but have only done in small, partial ways myself, is when a programmer tackles a really knotty problem that has been stumping their colleagues and comes up with a solution so simple that after seeing it, they can no longer understand why they used to think it was a hard problem.')
