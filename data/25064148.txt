There&#x27;s no &quot;it&quot; there in evolution.  Life is a chemical tautology, a molecular fever dream sandwiched between hard vacuum and magma, between cold sky and Sun.  There is no purpose or goal, so there can be no optimization.<p>I think it was Alan Watts, &quot;The way the oceans ways, the Universe <i>peoples</i>.&quot;<p>Since &quot;it&quot; has no goals, &quot;it&quot; can&#x27;t optimize for anything, even survivability.  That just happens.<p>- - - -<p>It&#x27;s a matter of wonder that this apparently meaningless gyration of agitated molecules gives rise evidently to teleological entities, you and me friend, who can have goals.<p>The question before us is can we optimize for survivability, if that is our goal, or, if not, harmonize our goals with that goal (for those who do not shall surely perish, eh?  Or do we take that on faith?)<p>How do you know what will work?  It seems naive to me to criticize the only example we have, that has been successful so far for nearly four billion years and counting.')
