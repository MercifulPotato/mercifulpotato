Faster to execute, it depends on what I&#x27;m doing, but it&#x27;s never a problem for me as my data is usually pretty small and quite messy. It doesn&#x27;t feel slow at all, at least. And obviously if you&#x27;re doing arrays you&#x27;ll certainly not run faster in Python&#x2F;R.<p>As for R&#x2F;Python it&#x27;s mostly familiarity with the notation (especially for python) and established popularity, with a large ecosystem as a consequence.<p>I mean, as a beginner in Python it just works (slowly). As a beginner in J, you cry... The interesting distinction is that Python&#x2F;R APIs can be quite convoluted and the rug may be pulled from under you without warning, while in J you learn the primitives and you&#x27;re off to the races. Also, J is much faster for its use case and avoids the need to write C in most cases where using it is relevant.')
