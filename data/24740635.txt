Item(by='perardi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602352587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740175, text='I get some wild forearm pain if I work too long on a laptop <i>(coffee shop, on couch with dog)</i>, or if I hold my phone too long <i>(Pokémon Go, there are literally dozens of us.)</i> In particular, it really seems to be in my brachioradialis muscles.<p>I tried out one of those generic massage guns at a friend’s place. I had scoffed at the infinite variations I saw advertised on Instagram, but I tried it on those small muscles and: <i>wow</i>. It helps me a lot. I can really massage out my forearms. There’s no way it&#x27;s strong enough to work on knots in big muscles like quads, but for those little extensor muscles? Seems to help me.<p>I’ve also been helped by what are called, broadly, “tennis elbow compression pads”. <i>(Linked to Amazon below—not recommending this particular brand, it’s just what I have.)</i>. I wear theses at night if I’m having pain, and it seems to help.<p>Now, the actual solution to my problem boils down to “use a full keyboard and mouse, and don’t bend your arms like a t-rex”, but, well, Pokémon.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Tomight-Elbow-Brace-Tennis-Compression&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B087B6YR9L" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Tomight-Elbow-Brace-Tennis-Compressio...</a>)')
