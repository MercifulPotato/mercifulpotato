Why don&#x27;t they come forward and say they also have a block for vaccine exports?<p>I am not following the argument. Are the UK government under any obligation to disclose that to EU?<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s binary: AZ can&#x27;t, or won&#x27;t, move stock from UK.<p>Let just say AZ demand a price increase for moving stock from UK, then what? When the contract for that price was signed, even though it did not explicitly state from which plant, the price are considered as a factor for production location. Hence the best effort. Morale issues aside this is no different to literally all supply chain in other industry.')
