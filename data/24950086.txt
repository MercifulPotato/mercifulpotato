Item(by='zokier', descendants=None, kids=[24951344], score=None, time=1604137396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948513, text='Just intonation is interesting, but it sort of explodes the composition complexity, because for each note the next (or concurrent) note can be based either on some root note <i>or</i> the current note. For example going up major thirds in C would be C-E-G#, but with just intonation you have to make the choice if that last note should be (C * 5&#x2F;4) * 5&#x2F;4 , or C * 8&#x2F;5. The magic of equal temperament makes the distinction go away, so things are simpler.')
