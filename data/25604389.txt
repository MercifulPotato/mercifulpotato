In fact I wouldn&#x27;t want them to think about the performance review. The goal is for them to rest, recharge, and not get burnt out,<p>I know you are trying to be considerate, but please do not ever assume people “are not taking care of themselves”, even if true. In the US, there is always a deeper story to it. Generally speaking 50% of the American population has a pre-existing condition. 30-50% of Americans avoid some medical care yearly due to the cost of care.<p>The third leading cause of death is believed to be preventable medical errors (caused by the for-profit nature of our system: our doctors and nurses have excellent training), and the vast majority of these victims likely had pre-existing conditions. We just don’t attribute “preventable medical error” as a cause of death on US death certificates like we should.

Pretty much every other industrialized and developed country is outpacing us in longevity.<p>The system is not meant to prevent disease and it is very ineffective at it. It profits on the already sick. It really is a grotesque system.

The neurological diseases are in remission, but I have to take a certain blood product, administered in a certain way, in large quantities, for life. It is known as subcutaneous immunoglobulin.
