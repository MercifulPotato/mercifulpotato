Niacin (vitamin B3) for example leads to diabetes and liver damage when taken upwards of 4g&#x2F;day. So I take 0.5 mg (nearly <i>a tenth</i> of the therapeutic dose, that too on <i>alternate</i> days, to reduce the potential for side effects even further). High dose vitamin B6 (&gt;20mg&#x2F;day, I take 3mg once every <i>5 days</i> for 30x reduction compared to therapeutic dose) can lead to lung cancer in men. So the b-complex pill¹ is taken once every 5 days. Vitamin D overdose can lead to hypercalcemia so that&#x27;s taken once a week (60000 IU) and some months I stay off it entirely as fat-soluble vitamins like vit. D tend to build up in the system. There are similar rules for other supplements as well.<p>¹The B-vitamins (1 to 12) + zinc + calcium are a single pill called &quot;Recobex-Z&quot;. These are generally called &quot;b-complex&quot;, it&#x27;s a combination drug.<p>Essentially the daily pill count is 2 in the morning + 1 in the afternoon + 2 at night, so 5 pills&#x2F;day. I also do supplement fasting days with no pills taken on that day.')
