No exceptions.<p>Is that entirely fair?<p>Let&#x27;s say you strip symbols to decrease size, but also in general don&#x27;t consider inspectability to be particularly important (which isn&#x27;t to say you&#x27;re against it, merely neutral). You might decide that providing a source map simply isn&#x27;t worth the effort, even if it&#x27;s minimal.')
