If you look for a product you get a whole load of dross back. It’s impossible to filter by spec, you can add keywords but this rarely gives you more sensible results these days. The products get lost in the noise.<p>Most of the time what would be better would be a structured directory of product information enabling you to zero in on the product you want without the crap. This directory would be independent of any specific vendor. All new products would be released into the directory so you can track all new products in certain categories to stay informed. Gaming of the directory would be policed ensuring equal standing of all products.<p>The only thing this doesn’t handle well is new product categories. But sure there’s ways to handle it.')
