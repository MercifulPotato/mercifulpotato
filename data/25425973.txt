You just need to do graphics-intensive stuff. WindowServer then shows up as the manifestation of graphics being processed.<p>In fact, Un-googled Chromium (without the autoupdater) easily causes load that&#x27;s displayed as WindowServer&#x27;s, for meâ€”when I open a Youtube video on my oldish Macbook with a shitty integrated video card. However there&#x27;s little chance that I would think this to be caused by something else.')
