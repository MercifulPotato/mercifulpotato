It is very convenient to be able to SSH into a host running emacs daemon and immediately have access to my existing session doing everything from irc and email, to editing scripts and tex files. X11 forwarding would be too sluggish and things like tramp don&#x27;t keep you connected to irc. I do accept though that emacs in the GUI is probably how the majority of users are using it, so not moaning, just giving perhaps an alt use case.')
