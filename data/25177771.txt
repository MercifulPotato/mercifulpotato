Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=[25179691], score=None, time=1606056050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177473, text='<i>&gt; Apple is now (primarily) a software-service company</i><p>They like to tell everyone that, but it&#x27;s still very much a lie. More than 50% of their revenues come straight from iPhone hardware sales. Services are barely under 18%, and that includes absolutely everything they can throw in there (icloud, appstore, etc). Everything else is hardware.<p>Apple is a hardware company that is desperately trying to ensure their future when, inevitably, they&#x27;ll get a few iPhones wrong and consumers will move on. It&#x27;s a bit like Persian Gulf countries investing in airlines and anything else to ensure they&#x27;ll have a future when oil runs out.')
