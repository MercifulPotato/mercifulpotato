Item(by='OminousWeapons', descendants=None, kids=[25650940, 25642674], score=None, time=1609807642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639504, text='It&#x27;s cost prohibitive for a small group to pull this off unless they are financed by a large criminal org. You&#x27;re talking about a small company&#x27;s worth of people to design the software, QA it, stand up and monitor the infrastructure, perform the follow on exploitation, manage the shells, parse discovered data from hundreds of targets, etc. That&#x27;s probably millions of dollars in salary alone.<p>The attack pattern also makes no sense for a criminal organization with this level of access. Why wouldn&#x27;t you go after resources you could trivially monetize or data you would want to know about like customer data, IP, financial resources, law enforcement, etc? Reading government emails seems like a waste of time unless you are trying to resell the intelligence to interested parties. Going after FireEye red team tools seems like a very high risk waste of time.<p>Lastly, you&#x27;re taking on American intelligence with above the wire capabilities. You&#x27;re telling me a group of this size has the opsec capabilities to evade the NSA? No one made a mistake?')
