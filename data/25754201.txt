Routing is layer 3.<p>I have several Unifi switches and a controller (running on an rpi) on my network but I use my own router. I can setup VLAN access ports and trunks all day on the switches no problem, but I can&#x27;t control the layer 3 routing between those VLANs with the controller, which is what you&#x27;re talking about. By setting up a gateway&#x2F;network on each VLAN from my router I can control routing. It&#x27;s just not as slick as having a USG where it&#x27;s all controlled via the controller UI.')
