Item(by='dreamcompiler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602395120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24742631, text='Higher octane means the gas has a better ability to resist knocking, which is spurious ignition not caused by the spark plug. Knocking can damage your engine if it happens often. Turbocharged cars have a higher tendency to knock, so they generally need high-octane gas. If you put low-octane in a turbocharged car, most modern engines will detect the knocking and detune the engine automatically to  prevent damage, but that means you&#x27;re not getting the power or efficiency the car was designed for.<p>So use high-octane in turbocharged cars and low octane for non-turbocharged cars. (If you use too high an octane in your car, it won&#x27;t hurt anything but your wallet.)<p>If you&#x27;re racing a turbo car you might need close to 100 octane, which cannot easily be bought but it can be made by adding toluene to your gas tank (google it).<p>Other than that check your owner&#x27;s manual.')
