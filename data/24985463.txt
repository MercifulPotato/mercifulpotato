ECP5 is pretty dated at this point, so I&#x27;m wondering if any of the development team is left to support it.<p>I wonder what the remaining life of the ECP5-5G is then. It would be really cool to have PCIe support on one of the reverse engineered FPGAs. I suppose project x-ray (Xilinx Series 7 reverse engineering) is coming along nicely, but at least ECP5 support is complete, even if everything about the SERDES isn&#x27;t quite stable yet.<p>As far as designing a board goes, it&#x27;s a bit hard to choose. While the Lattice parts with PCIe are close to being made to work with open tools, the official Lattice development tools for the parts with SERDES have no free tier (beyond the 1 year license you get by purchasing that versa board), whereas everything in the Xilinx Artix-7 series for instance supports the free tier WEBPACK tools.')
