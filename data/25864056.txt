There is no reason (hopefully) to reproduce the base image. Any changes to the base requirements (apt-get, pip, etc) requires a whole new build and results in an entirely different artifact.<p>And just to be clear, I&#x27;m not building (no human) the base image. The base image is also created within it&#x27;s own build pipeline that has all of the necessary things to track its materialization and lineage. Logs, manifests, etc...<p>Once the image has been thoroughly tested and verified (both by humans and verification scripts) each time a change is merged, the git repo is tagged, docker image is built and tagged and then pushed to the container repo.<p>Perhaps you could explain what you mean by the other way? Why would you ever need to recreate the base image? Perhaps if the container repo dropped off the face of the earth and had to be created from scratch?')
