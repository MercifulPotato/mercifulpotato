CNAs make less than amazon warehouse workers in my area. If I&#x27;m a nurse, it&#x27;s only natural I&#x27;m going to seek a less demanding patient population asap unless there is a significant incentive not to do that, especially given that every hospital in the country is hiring nurses at all times.')
