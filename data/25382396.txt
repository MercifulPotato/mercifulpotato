Take the famous line &quot;thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog&quot; - and think how you&#x27;d parse that out programatically.  You&#x27;d start at the start, reading each character in, comparing it against a dictionary, and when you decide you have a whole word - then you can split that word out - and then continue on to the next.<p>But you can&#x27;t really do this in parallel as the start for each word depends on the previous split already being known.<p>If it was simply law that every word in existence was 5 characters, you could parse this out with zero lookups, zero knowledge.  &quot;accurately&quot; isn&#x27;t so much the issue, it&#x27;s that you have to decode each instruction to know where the next starts.')
