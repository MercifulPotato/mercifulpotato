Most of the people in my community are non-technical and a couple barely understand what E2E encryption means. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t anticipate that the Element app would have significantly different menus between the Android and iOS apps, so I tried to consult the documentation... and couldn&#x27;t find any whatsoever on cross-signing. I tried searching element.io, the `docs&#x2F;` folders in each client&#x27;s repo, and to be frank I ultimately gave up and turned it into a verification party<p>I really think there needs to be more investment on this front -- as it stands, the onus is on operators to justify the overhead of E2E, and to figure out how to do XYZ on all the various clients from outdated blog posts, issue threads, and reading source code. Very rarely have I been able to find answers to questions in the actual documentation itself.<p>Anyway, again, I appreciate the work that you&#x27;re doing, and I&#x27;m confident this experience will improve given time. I&#x27;d love to help with it -- I&#x27;ve been building my own documentation as I go along, but not sure how to even get started contributing.')
