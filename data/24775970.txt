Unlike network television, space isn&#x27;t limited, so you can make a good show which will only appeal to 20% of the audience.<p>2. The amount people watch doesn&#x27;t affect revenue, just whether they renew or not. So it&#x27;s now better to make one show that someone will really love, than seven shows that they will be vaguely into, but see as interchangeable with seven others on a different platform.<p>If anything, I think Netflix originals are overoptimised for creating cult hits along niche audiences.')
