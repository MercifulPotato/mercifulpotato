The queen of england had reasons to fear her own subjects, and the &quot;intelligence services&quot; that supported her certainly viewed say 1&#x2F;2 of the English population as potential enemies.<p>This is their mindset. Nothing will change this state of affairs until the current ruling set is booted, once and for all. They&#x27;ve had a multi-century run. Time to take a bow.')
