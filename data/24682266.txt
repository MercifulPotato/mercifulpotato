I started researching the technical details of the console in order to try to make sense of what I was watching,  and within a few hours I had decided to try to write a NES emulator.<p>Now, the NES emulation scene is extremely mature, and so I quickly came across a number of warnings essentially saying &quot;the world has too may NES emulators, please don&#x27;t write another one.&quot; I decided to go ahead anyway, and after spending about 2 years&#x27; worth of afternoons and weekends, the result was just another bad emulator. It was slow, buggy, incomplete, and the code was a mess.<p>By your standards, I wasted 2 years of my life making &quot;yet another toy&quot; emulator instead of &quot;using [my] capabilities for a more useful goal.&quot; But I had a <i>ton</i> of fun, and the learning experience was absolutely invaluable. I learned in depth how a computer actually works at the hardware level (even though the NES is much simpler than a modern computer, the concepts and skills transferred over very quickly).<p>As a result, my practical programming knowledge today is vastly improved over where it would have been had I not &quot;wasted&quot; all those afternoons. Many of the career opportunities available to me so far have been directly attributable to the skills I gained working on that emulator.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xI3xZAn7r2A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xI3xZAn7r2A</a>')
