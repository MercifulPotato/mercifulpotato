The number of times I unlock my phone every day and the number of times I’m doing it somewhere that the government&#x2F;my employer&#x2F;my significant other&#x2F;a random hacker would find objectionable or lucrative to exploit... That’s with just me there (or an ex, or a former employee or prospective employer, or someone I met at a bar who turns out to be on some list...).<p>Turn this back around to the car I’m driving and it’s honestly slightly terrifying for me. It could be the next evolution of those devices insurance companies want you to plug into your OBD port so they can monitor how quickly you accelerate, take turns, etc. Except now Tesla (and whomever they decide to sell it to) know that when that innocent-seeming accident happened you seemed to be looking down, so now you’re completely liable for damages.<p>With the good comes the bad, but I’m terrified of the bad and the good doesn’t seem that much better than the current.')
