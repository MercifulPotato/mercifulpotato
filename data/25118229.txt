I scanned a couple of tidbits from the S-1:<p>- <i>Reducing full-time employee headcount by approximately 25%</i> (I&#x27;m curious from what&#x2F;to?)<p>- <i>Setting expectation for the potential of no employee bonuses for 2020 and reducing executive team member salaries for six months</i> (interesting that executive team _salary_ is getting reduced rather than bonuses, no? At this level isn&#x27;t most of your compensation not direct salary?)<p>- (to the above point) <i>, in May 2020, we announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately 1,800 employees</i> (So I guess they had ~9,000 employees?)<p>- Outstanding RSU obligations are quoted as ~$2.7B<p>It seems fair to wonder, given the timing during a pandemic, that there&#x27;s a need or desire to cash out by the investors and founders.<p>I wonder if their headcount downsizing wasn&#x27;t severe enough. 9,000 employees seems like a lot for an intermediary. A lot of these companies seem to get in the habit of thinking they&#x27;re the next Google long before they have the Google revenues to fund such pursuits.<p>The risks section reads as expected.<p>I do wonder if the tide is turning against home &quot;sharing&quot;. Unlike ride-sharing, there are significant externalities to deal with. People don&#x27;t generally don&#x27;t want to live near an illegal (in many cases) hotel and it&#x27;s not so easy for them to up and move. It&#x27;s classic tragedy of the commons.<p>What&#x27;s more AirBnB has (IMHO) a provable negative impact on the supply of rental units in many cities.<p>So cue the standard self-serving defense of AirBnB. I, for one, would not be sad to see it go.')
