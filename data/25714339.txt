Daniel&#x27;s model is product of his judgment. It&#x27;s his perogative and responsibility as a leader, and he&#x27;s well intentioned, etc, but his judgment is subjective. I am not familiar with the UK system but providing explicit criteria and an oppty for feedback seems like a step forward relative to the US. It&#x27;s a question as to what else would need to change in US industry for that approach to play well.<p>Pooling diverse judgments is a way to produce more robust predictions. An explicit model can help multiple people engage. Daniel did not mention discussing the re-designed org with any of his team. A less top down approach than his might have included seeking feedback about direction and team composition from members of the team itself.')
