I was extremely disappointed with stock brightness when I first turned it on.<p>Turned out windows power saving and battery settings actually capped my brightness. So my user-controlled &quot;100%&quot; (via keyboard) actually becomes more like 60%, depending on the power profile.<p>As soon as I got a new m2 ssd, I shelved Windows and installed Fedora WS, which has no such issue.
