Some hopefully constructive criticism:<p>&gt; Why would you not care about one of your human rights?<p>That&#x27;s essentially an <i>appeal to authority</i> or <i>appeal to the majority</i> argument. You haven&#x27;t shown why I should care about privacy, you&#x27;ve only stated that the current consensus is that privacy counts as what we call a human right.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s not that I have nothing to hide, I simply don&#x27;t have anything I would like to share, especially unknowingly.<p>Not really.
