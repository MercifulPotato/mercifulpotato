Oleg demonstrates this in (page 14)[0] with examples of reassociating binary expressions and double negation, so matching two levels deep is possible.<p>As for matching remaining terms, I don&#x27;t know the answer to that, would be interesting to investigate.<p>Yeah, having many typeclasses involved could be problematic. What sort of issues are you thinking of? One possibility is that so many constraints are involved no concrete type can instantiate a final term.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;okmij.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;tagless-final&#x2F;course&#x2F;lecture.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;okmij.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;tagless-final&#x2F;course&#x2F;lecture.pdf</a>')
