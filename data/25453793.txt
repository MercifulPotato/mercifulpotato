Or they can choose not to.<p>This part hits the nail on the head. Facebook is intentionally being misleading in this campaign. I’ve had the IDFA turned off on my phone for years. Now apps have to ask for it individually.  If apps have to prompt to access it, and this benefits small businesses so much, wouldn’t people agree to it with the right framing? Why doesn’t Facebook provide a method in its tracking SDKs that shows an interstitial about how this is good for small business before asking users if they want to be tracked?<p>Of course, Facebook would never do that. That’s because “informed consent” with adware doesn’t really exist... once people actually understand the scope of ad tracking networks... they don’t want it.<p>I’m not even against the concept of targeted advertising. Facebook’s first party properties are fine venues for it. I’m even (generally) ok with an advertiser retargeting me based on information they have about me. I wish that Facebook was prohibited from scooping up data in every other app I use and combining it with other data that they purchase. You can have targeted advertising without a massive surveillance dragnet.')
