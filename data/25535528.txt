But I&#x27;d say that resources are vastly more than people realize. The entire mass of the Earth is the available resources at our disposal. We just don&#x27;t have the tech to harvest them. For example, absorbing water from the air, the sea, melting ice caps etc, we can only harvest from fresh water sources but there&#x27;s no theoretical reason why we can&#x27;t harvest from these other sources. So I don&#x27;t really worry about finite resources, as long as tech improves there are basically infinite resources, assuming that we can&#x27;t get through the entire mass of the planet.')
