And to my earlier point, when you&#x27;re making 80% more than you would in Europe, you can save a lot of money to float you through hard times. Notably, I still don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be particularly well-off in Europe--European worker protection rights don&#x27;t help if your company goes under, and you won&#x27;t have a cushy savings account. I&#x27;m guessing unemployment is a bit better than in the US, and obviously healthcare will be better, but on balance I don&#x27;t think your average SWE would be any better off. Of course, this doesn&#x27;t extrapolate beyond the upper-middle-class and above; poorer Americans are almost certainly worse-off than their European counterparts (and I want to see that remedied).')
