Door locks, time clocks, and photocopy machines still worked, but all computers were down. We use paper records, but it was frustrating and inconvenient. We&#x27;re not allowed to pay due to laws. Corporate started slowly building us a brand new, but terrible, network 5 weeks after the old one went down. Definitely caused a little staff burnout, but not more than corporate&#x27;s relentless attempts to extract additional profit from us at the expense of our patients and our wellbeing.')
