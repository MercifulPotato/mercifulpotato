Item(by='dmos62', descendants=None, kids=[24874267, 24874092], score=None, time=1603485678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873302, text='&gt; end general purpose computation itself, or at least to make it more the exception than the norm<p>I&#x27;d argue, cautiously, that general computation is already an exception. That&#x27;s why I prefer Linux to Windows. On Linux I can issue a command from a general command interface (the CLI) to just play a video. If I only want audio, it&#x27;s an option away. I can script things together. Most of my tools are interoperable. That&#x27;s because I use FOSS, free protocols, free formats, free tech in general. Everything works together and everything augments each other. Windows, the popular workstation, is no that. It&#x27;s a system of systems, where everything is a monolithic closed box that you can&#x27;t get inside. It&#x27;s inside your computer, you use it, but it&#x27;s not yours. It&#x27;s on loan from someone else. Interoperability is virtually non-existent, and there isn&#x27;t such a thing as a usable CLI (an environment that would connect everything together). That&#x27;s not general computing, I argue. General computing involves ther power to generalize, use the computing technology in arbitrary ways. Closed software, customer lock-in and all that other corporate bs is the anti-thesis of that.<p>Longer rant than expected. I find it a frustrating issue. Mostly because I intimately feel like we&#x27;re paying a very high price for the greed of the few.')
