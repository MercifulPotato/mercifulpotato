Also wires in blueprints&#x2F;ghosts is nice. I&#x27;ll have to play with the ghost fast replace but I think this will be very nice once I re-train myself to trust the expected way you want that to work (vs knowing it doesn&#x27;t work normally and adjusting for it).<p>Overall I continue to be impressed by the Factorio team and consider it some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a video game. In terms of return on investment (time-wise) I think it&#x27;s got every game beat expect maybe Skyrim for me. (especially if you exclude my video game time from before I went to college and cut back drastically)')
