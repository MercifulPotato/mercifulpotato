In practise, you still need to test. There is always a small risk of something unexpected happening. Like the vaccine from Australia which has been completely abandoned - not sure whether it also was mRNA or some other kind of vaccine. It didn&#x27;t cause any health problem, but the vaccinated people were tested as HIV-positive. Of course they were not, but the vaccination caused those false positive. So while no direct heahlt impact, it is quite a disaster if one couldn&#x27;t test people for HIV any more.')
