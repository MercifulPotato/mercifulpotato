You would need some kind of configuration interface on what parameters to tweak like MSI.<p>So Docker or even Kubernetes yaml files are the “installation files”, which otherwise your static Go binary would lack or would be provided as either a README.md or your own custom configuration format, which you have to document.<p>Sure enough the single Go binary is nice and I use this often for some cli tools, but if you integrate your tooling with other people and have to communicate, it makes it easier to agree on a common language (not programming language), but “configuration&#x2F;deployment “ language, so that when you talk about: “this is a port”, everybody in the team can look up what “a port” is.')
