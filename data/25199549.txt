There are countless ways suboptimal metrics could be explained away.<p>E.g. in my role I don&#x27;t work with anyone in my workgroup. All my work is with other teams that have different reporting structures. By definition my intergroup productivity would be reported as zero, and my manager wouldn&#x27;t be surprised by that. And even if my role did involve working within my group, there are plenty of other measures that would trump any of these &#x27;productivity&#x27; metrics.')
