Item(by='librarydance', descendants=None, kids=[24678030], score=None, time=1601809057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677563, text='Awesomely responsive, great sharing model, very easy to use.<p>Drawbacks I saw (for my own use patterns):<p>- Not great for use with a pencil-based tablet: pencil vs. hand or other pointer are not distinguished. I don&#x27;t want my finger to draw, I want only my pencil to draw.<p>- Couldn&#x27;t find how to permanently set a different size for pencil vs. eraser. I want a huge eraser (and a large eraser didn&#x27;t work too well, independently of this comment) but a thin point pencil.<p>- No &quot;erase region&quot; or &quot;clear page&quot; functionality.<p>All of the above may look independent, but in fact are highly inter-related. If I wasn&#x27;t constantly smudging the screen with my fingers being confused for pencils, I wouldn&#x27;t need an eraser that much. If the large eraser worked well (and I didn&#x27;t need to reset the size every time I switch from pencil to eraser) I wouldn&#x27;t need the &quot;clear board&quot; functionality.')
