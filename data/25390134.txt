The citizenship test doesn&#x27;t even require that level of literacy. Incorrect grammar and spelling are considered passing so long as the person can read and write well enough to communicate. A good gauge of that could be whether or not they can study from a book. I would be interested to see what percentage of illiterate  people are voting now anyways.<p>The part of your comment that is a bit twisted is saying that we would be taking away someone&#x27;s fundamental right <i>under the current system</i>. I&#x27;m not suggesting we take away anyone&#x27;s current rights, but institute a new policy for future children to require the test for them. Under our current system the right to vote is only a right for <i>citizens</i>. As we wouldn&#x27;t be removing anyone&#x27;s citizenship, we wouldn&#x27;t be stripping anyone of that right. Not to mention that the current test is allows some immigrants to vote and others not, due to literacy constraints. So why not extend that paradigm to people who are born here.<p>Finally, it seems the most important part of what I have said is consistently ignored - citizens have duties and to be a citizen one should be capable of performing those duties. That&#x27;s a fundamental principle of democracy, as the people <i>are</i> the government. If being illiterate prevents one from being able to perform those duties, then they have have no reason to be afforded the privileges and specific rights from which they are derived (basic human rights would be intact).<p>If one can have all the rights and privileges of being a citizen without the responsibilities, why would they even want to be a citizen? What would being a citizen even mean at that point?')
