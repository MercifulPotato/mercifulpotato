However, the comments are not the only hidden state in pluto.<p>Beyond that, Pluto has a huge amount of state that&#x27;s hidden from you in that it tries to keep track of all the variables you define and where so that it can control which cells need to be re-run when you change something. This lets it avoid re-running all the cells when you make a slight adjustment.<p>However, yes I agree. As I originally said, they added state that makes it work more like it doesn&#x27;t have state. Or in other words, they solved Jupyter&#x27;s state problem by adding more state.')
