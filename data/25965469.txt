Discrete video cards have consistently been at the forefront of features like this, leading Apple by years.  The difference is, the consumer must decide to build a system with these features. If I want an HDR system, I buy an HDR capable discrete card, HDR capable monitor, etc and put it all together.<p>What Apple does is assemble it all in a base model, like a console, so that all models have the feature set as base.  And like other commenters have pointed out, PCs with HDR have been shipping long before, especially &quot;workstation&quot; machines.')
