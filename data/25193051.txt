I have tried to figure out why it’s a prescription drug in many countries (reasons could include it’s addictive, has bad side effects, could cause side effects with other drugs, etc), but I haven’t found the reason. Does anyone have any clues on this? I have taken it for a few years and not seen a doctor in that time who I could ask.')
