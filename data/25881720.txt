If they return their own dataframes then chaining follows naturally.<p>I know that isn&#x27;t how dplyr works, but it feels more Pythonic, and this solution isn&#x27;t entirely analogous to dplyr anyway.<p>This approach seems a little complicated, though I&#x27;m sure with some use I could learn to enjoy it.')
