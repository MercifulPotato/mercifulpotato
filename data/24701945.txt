This ends up with a stack of microservices that handle 1% of the total revenue generating traffic yet 80% of the infrastructure cost due to the additional complexity and adding 30% more overall latency due to the network hops and inflexibility of the service API. At the same time it doesn&#x27;t deliver enough productivity doing this so there is gas being poured into the burning monolith too.')
