Item(by='pmdulaney', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612116833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980066, text='There was an HN discussion from 2010 which is closed for comment, it seems.<p>Not to be prickly about it, but as a multi-generational American I take some umbrage at this characterization of Americans. We <i>do</i> walk -- and I think the author is trying a bit too hard to paint us in a bad light.<p>&quot;The closest activity to “taking a walk” that I encountered was two [non-immigrant American] people walking together and forgetting, for a moment, to talk to each other. The moment passed. One of them said something and they slipped back into talking rather than taking a walk.&quot;<p>And yet:<p>&quot;Middle-aged eastern European matrons strolling.&quot;<p>Are we to believe that these &quot;eastern European matrons&quot; were not conversing as they strolled? Or is the plural meant to indicate multiple observed occurrences of matrons strolling by themselves, with the implication that one cannot truly go on a walk with another person?<p>The English author C. S. Lewis perhaps viewed Americans similarly to the author. He sniffed at Americans for using the word &quot;hike&quot; instead of &quot;walk&quot;, as though we had to ruin the whole thing by making a big production of it. And I think that gets to the heart of it. I walk pretty often, but I do call it hiking, and rather than walk through my San Fernando Valley neighborhood, I take a 10-minute drive so that I can hike in the Santa Monica mountains or in the mountains on the north side of the Valley. Excuse me if I like to get out into nature on a regular basis.<p>And as much as I find America&#x27;s obsession with dogs off-putting, it&#x27;s not a zero-sum game: It&#x27;s not as though because you have your dog with you you&#x27;re not really &quot;walking&quot;.<p>But thanks for the reminder to get out and walk for walking&#x27;s sake.<p>Finally, see Rousseau&#x27;s Confessions for a man who really got walking. (I only wish he had come up with better ideas while he did so.) One of these days I will visit Chambery.')
