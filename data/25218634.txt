Not sure why I didn&#x27;t see it or it somehow didn&#x27;t work at that time, the information should have been available (I encountered the problem late last year).<p>It&#x27;s certainly misleading that the error message links to a bug, at least giving the impression that it is a bug, rather than a guide.<p>That said, IMO the underlying issue that Firefox doesn&#x27;t allow you to just install an extension from a source directory like Chrome&#x2F;Chromium does is much worse.')
