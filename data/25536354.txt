These funds do not recirculate do the velocity of money drops and inflation doesn’t materialize.  In fact the structural issues are so strong in places like Japan that deflation has will naturally result if the money supply isn’t increased with constant stimulus measures.<p>This creates a company store economy where the underclass or government has to perpetually roll an increasing amount of debt.')
