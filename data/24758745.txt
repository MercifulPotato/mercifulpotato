It presupposes that there is this one special, immutable state called Normal defined as &quot;exactly as life was right before the pandemic&quot;, and that we have to somehow get back to precisely that state.<p>It&#x27;s looking more and more like this deadly virus is going to be part of our lives for months or years to come, if not decades. So, instead of ignoring reality and trying in vain to get back to this idealized &quot;ISO standard normal,&quot; maybe we are going to have to change our definition of normal. We&#x27;re going to have to normalize things like WFH, wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding large indoor gatherings, instead of treating them as temporary measures. The world changes, and our concept of normal will necessarily change along with it.')
