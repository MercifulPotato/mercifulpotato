Some would say PoS chains is the second generation but its arguably worse than FBA (Federated Byzantine Agreement) and its first implementation in public blockchain came way after the XRPL (FBA) already existed.<p>There is Stellar which is kinda a re-implementation of the XRPL with many smaller changes but its also using a FBA.<p>There is Flare (only test net exists at time of writing) its the first Turing-complete Federated Byzantine Agreement blockchain. Kinda the ETH 3.0. but it a new project that just used the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) for code compatibility reasons.<p>Then there are DAG based &quot;blockchains&quot; but these are more experimental, as in no one really know if they &quot;work&quot; from a mathematical point of view. I would consider them to be the third generation if someone manages to fully implement it and run a public blockchain.')
