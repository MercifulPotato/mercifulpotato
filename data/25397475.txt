I posted this because the comment I was responding to said that 99% of users wanted the computer to sleep on lid-shut, and I thought I&#x27;d contribute to point out that&#x27;s the opposite of my use case (indeed, I pretty much want the computer to never sleep on lid-shut).  And i run linux as the primary OS on pretty much all my computers.  A lot of linux users are also probably coming from a background where computers didn&#x27;t sleep&#x2F;shutdown very often.<p>I didn&#x27;t use the word amateur.  I didn&#x27;t use the word professional.  I didn&#x27;t mention anything about using an OS that works as expected.  I listed my background and use case.<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything about any users being better than others.<p>I do think, based on all that,  you may have some sensitivities that made you interpret things in a particular light.')
