There&#x27;s always a period of fragmentation where everyone and their Aunt Lillian starts a new fork project to pursue whatever angle they want.<p>It&#x27;ll take some time for all the fragments to coalesce, likely with some T1000-ing into larger projects while others lose steam as developers settle on a single option. Unfortunately, in the meantime consumers of CentOS are left to look at the field in the crystal ball and try to figure out which project to place their bet on (or just move to something else for a while and have a pint while the whole thing blows over). The good news is that things don&#x27;t really become pressing until 2023, which gives some time for things to resolve.<p>It&#x27;s the Circle Of Open Source. :)')
