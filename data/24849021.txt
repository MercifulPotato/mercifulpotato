The former is because this was the era of exponential CPU growth, and the latter because as good as many of these language designers were, none of them were psychic.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure both Guido for Python and Larry for Perl were explicitly aware of the impossibility of designing for processors that wouldn&#x27;t exist for 20 years, though digging up quotes to that effect would be quite difficult.<p>A mantra of that era is &quot;There are no slow languages, only slow implementations.&quot; I, for one, consider this mantra to be effectively refuted. Even if there is a hypothetical Python interpreter&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;whatever that can run effectively as fast as C with no significant overhead (excepting perhaps some reasonable increase in compile time), there is no longer any reason to believe that mere mortal humans are capable of producing it, after all the effort that has been poured into trying, as document by the original link. Whatever may be true for God or superhuman AIs, for human beings, there <i>are</i> slow languages that build intrinsically slow operations into their base semantics.')
