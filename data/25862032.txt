A customer can cancel anytime. We also don&#x27;t retroactively charge you more for the past month if your revenues increased. We instead reach out to you and confirm a plan change for the upcoming month. If you tell us it was a blip and you don&#x27;t expect it to continue at that scale, then we will just keep you on the current plan.')
