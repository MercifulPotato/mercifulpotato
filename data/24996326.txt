This is their right, although it&#x27;s obviously evil.<p>It&#x27;s the media (tech magazines, youtube channels, etc.) that should be clearing up these misconceptions, but the sad reality is, people don&#x27;t care. If I try explaining to a non-IT friend why installing any random software is essential, they look at me like I&#x27;m wearing a tin foil hat. People don&#x27;t understand how quickly computation is turning into an important aspect of freedom.')
