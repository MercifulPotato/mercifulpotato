If they were not deployed there would have been no on-duty injuries.<p>&quot;The Bank security guard would have never been hurt if they just let people steal the money and take hostages.&quot;<p>&gt; Maybe you donâ€™t know that the police officer who died, died as a result of a blood clot.<p>This is beyond bad faith, this is insulting. And i&#x27;m not going to participate anymore. I just hope people like you die out before this country is irrevocably harmed, and your children don&#x27;t carry your sickness to a new generation.')
