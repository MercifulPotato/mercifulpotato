Add 2x brand new M2 2230 drives which cost about $20 apiece, and each node costs about $55.<p>&gt; What are you running on them?<p>Sharded databases and Ceph clusters mostly. Each shard uses very little power (and does not run hot) but has 2x nvme in mirror. With raid10 f2 on linux or zfs mirror on bsd you gain in read speed on top of the raid1 safety.<p>Sometimes I add USB external storage: tablets often have 2 USBC ports, so $100 gives an extra 8Tb for warm storage. For HDD, USBC is not a restricting factor anymore.<p>Now I am trying VMs: with a dedicated NVMe, IO performance is good, but there is not enough RAM yet. When 16Gb becomes the new normal, that will be much easier.')
