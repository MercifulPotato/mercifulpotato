They were mostly added for geopolitical reasons. The US wanted control of the Bosphorus, and that meant all sorts of concessions to Turkey. They were also more secular and more aligned with &quot;Western values&quot; back then. Today, Turkey is a very different country and with the AKP party, it&#x27;s questionable how much they align with the West, both ideologically and politically.<p>NATO was and still is a liberal democratic Western nations military alliance about standardizing military doctrine and protocol. If not NATO, something like it needs to exist as a bulwark against Russia and China.')
