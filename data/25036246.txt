He also built an 8-bit CPU from scratch on breadboards, as well as a 6502 based computer also on bread boards. He&#x27;s recently started the process of using the video card he made to output video from the 6502 computer.<p>His videos are interesting and informative, and while he does offer kits to build all this stuff from his site, the part lists are there should you want to source your own (not always easy if you try to do it on the cheap and get your parts from the likes of Ali Express and Ebay).<p>Overall his projects are fascinating for anyone with interest in retro computing or learning how computers work at the lowest level, and the videos are easy to follow and more than just a &quot;how to put this together&quot; tutorial.')
