Item(by='commonturtle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602446568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735883, text='I&#x27;m skeptical of these UBI experiments in general, because they don&#x27;t take into account that widespread, permanent UBI will change people&#x27;s behaviour in very different ways from a small, temporary experiment. How do populations respond when they are guaranteed $2k &#x2F; month forever no matter what they do? Do they simply start asking for $3k &#x2F; month after that? Does the median individual stop working and watch TV all day, or do they do amazing creative things?<p>One crazy experiment we could try: Give Finland (they&#x27;ve run a small-scale UBI exp before) $1.2 trillion to run a nationwide, long-term UBI experiment on their whole population(5M (pop. Finland) * $24k &#x2F; year (UBI payments) * 10 years = $1.2 trillion).<p>Make the decision about UBI based on what happens in Finland after 10 years. Not perfect, and it will never happen, but certainly would be a more trustworthy indicator of UBIs real effects on a society :)')
