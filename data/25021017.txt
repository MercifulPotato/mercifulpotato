I&#x27;m talking about the trial stuff that happens before it.<p>For example, whether any witnesses are called. In Trump&#x27;s impeachment trial they decided witnesses weren&#x27;t necessary (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;801589634&#x2F;sen-alexander-explains-decision-not-to-call-witnesses-in-trump-impeachment-trial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;801589634&#x2F;sen-alexander-expla...</a>).<p>Also, when Clinton was impeached, it was a Republican-majority Senate impeaching a Democratic president. So not really comparable to when it&#x27;s the same party for both as with Trump. Of course they went through all the steps in the trial for Clinton because that Senate wanted to impeach (and probably wanted as much damaging evidence to come to light as possible).')
