If you use GraphQL to power your REST APIs this is less of an issue. On the other hand, tightly coupling your database to a client doesn&#x27;t always have to be a bad thing. If you outscale a single Postgres Database with Hasura you can add read replicas. If that still doesn&#x27;t work you can add Yugabyte to the mix to scale further.')
