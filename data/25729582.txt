More like locked out for 5 minutes until she removed her tweet. She is doing perfectly fine with her 2.1 million followers right here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kathygriffin?s=09" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kathygriffin?s=09</a><p>I can&#x27;t find Steve Bannon&#x27;s Twitter account anywhere. Now why is that so? Can you find it for me?<p>Unless you are talking about a different Kathy Griffin she hasn&#x27;t been suspended.<p>As far as losing her job is concerned that is not something I was even bothered about. Since when did discussion on Big Tech censorship turn into resultant unemployment because of stupidity?<p>I don&#x27;t mind those terrorists who invaded the Capitol be tried and thrown behind bars let alone be put in no fly lists or be removed from their jobs. Insurrection has to have consequences. I just don&#x27;t want Big Tech&#x27;s ideological censorship. Because this emboldens Big Tech to do more ideological censorship not less. Let the law take its course. Let the insurrectionists face real life consequences for their treason including but not limited to loss of job, putting on no fly lists and even prison time. It doesn&#x27;t require Big Tech censorship to achieve those consequences. Or apply the rules to everyone in the same way. If you are going to ban Steve Bannon for beheading statements then ban Kathy Griffin for holding a decapitated head of the President. As simple as that.<p>If the Big Tech companies can&#x27;t do it then I&#x27;ll call them hypocrites. Then they have no moral standing when it comes to Parler. What is the difference between Parler and them? Nothing at all.<p>Notice how you completely skipped the part where I mentioned how Twitter enabled ISIS to operate with impunity for 2 years and only focused on my last paragraph? Yeah that shows where your mind is.')
