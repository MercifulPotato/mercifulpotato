I saw some color e-paper that was super slow to refresh and had terrible ghosting. No one would buy a color e-reader if it takes 15 seconds to turn a page, especially if it costs more than grayscale ereaders due to the &#x27;new technology&#x27;.<p>OTOH, store signage is a use case where refresh and ghosting is relatively unimportant.')
