Item(by='eertami', descendants=None, kids=[25345267, 25345614, 25345167, 25345552, 25345221, 25345227, 25345672, 25345297, 25345721, 25345355, 25345621, 25345211, 25345265, 25345384, 25345486, 25345337, 25345566, 25345635, 25345346, 25345180, 25345262, 25345481, 25345677, 25345235, 25345369, 25345365, 25345523, 25345191, 25345319, 25345465, 25345563, 25345335], score=None, time=1607436032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344762, text='$549!?<p>That puts it in the same price category as: Sennheiser HD660S, Audeze LCD-1, Beyerdynamic DT1770&#x2F;1990, Grado RS2e, among many many others.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t understand why you would buy these when there are a lot of established professional audio companies offering better sound at a cheaper price. At least airpods have a unique selling point in their portability and ux but I don&#x27;t see how this benefits over-ear cans.')
