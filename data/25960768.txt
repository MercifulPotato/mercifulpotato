Item(by='jakelazaroff', descendants=None, kids=[25965557], score=None, time=1611945868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960474, text='You don&#x27;t take a position based on a company&#x27;s business model, you do it based on whether you think a stock will go up or down. That&#x27;s it. Business model is one signal, as is the current stock price.<p>Hedge funds took short positions because in their model, given GameStop&#x27;s business and whatever other factors, the stock was due to drop. That&#x27;s valid, but it&#x27;s no more valid than the WSB model that the price would skyrocket because overexposed hedge funds would be forced to close their short positions. What is the fundamental argument that GME was overpriced at $20?<p>Also, &quot;unsophisticated investors&quot; are not the only ones participating for non-fundamental reasons. When Citadel pays for order flow from Robinhood and then gets out in front of those trades, they&#x27;re not trading based on fundamentals, they&#x27;re trading based on momentum. Is that not also interfering with the ability of the market to price GME efficiently?')
