China is no different. I&#x27;m talking about expats who were more permanent than temporary, foreign exchange students.<p>China still has a xenophobic culture. Has it gotten better?

Xi has come after that fact. I&#x27;m not even sure how what he did is relevant to our discussion since I&#x27;m pretty sure Xi supported it.<p>I have to ask. How long do you stay in China when you visit? Are you fluent? If you&#x27;re not, you&#x27;re missing a lot of context.')
