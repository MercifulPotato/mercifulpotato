I really regret that now because it ruined so much for me. I now have constant pain in my back and i cannot do the sports that i truly love doing (boxing and bjj) like i used to.<p>Now i have a much different view on the gym. I use machines to a greater extent and i focus more on training for health than lifting heavy barbells.')
