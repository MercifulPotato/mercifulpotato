If you have a robust model for defining and retrieving your data, the tools for working with that data can be iterated on independently from the data itself.<p>So let&#x27;s say your photos are in Google Photos, because your phone backs them up there automatically, but all your friends who you want to see the photos are on Facebook. Theoretically, &quot;Solid&quot; could be pulling those photos into a standard data specification, and provide easy tools for automating how they get shared into Facebook.<p>Then let&#x27;s say you wanted to edit some of those photos, so you open up PhotoShop Solid, and get editing.<p>But then you join Instagram, and you want to quickly show off your Photoshop skills. All you need to do is connect Solid.<p>The key aspect here is that you can use as many different tools as you like to work with your data, but it&#x27;s the same data, and if Facebook goes belly-up tomorrow, or you just don&#x27;t want your photos there anymore, Solid has your back.<p>One thing that I don&#x27;t think is well defined yet, but really should be, is how services will request access to your data. This needs some kind of standard interface, very similar to how phones let you customize app access. It should make it very clear what data you are &quot;selling&quot; to the Facebook, and what they are providing in return for that data.')
