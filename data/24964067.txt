It’s a perfectly valid string. I consider `executeQuery sqlString :: IO Result` to be an indication of impurity, since I can do `let x = executeQuery sqlString in “bar”` as a valid bit of Haskell but it’s clearly 100% pure.<p>If you want to think that sqlString is “impure” outside of the context of execution (i.o.w. a Monad...) then sure, that’s valid, but so is my assertion that it is pure since it is referentially transparent. It exists in the void as just another string until the programmer decides to make it into an IO value that’s executed for its impure side effects (the only reason we do anything in computing, right?)<p>I think you’re getting downvoted (I can’t) because of your first statement.')
