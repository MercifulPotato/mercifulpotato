Based on what we know, are there efficiencies to be found in storage or computation of the universe?<p>Because the smallest simulation of something incompressible is itself. Assuming the universe is incompressible, it&#x27;s impossible to simulate the universe in the universe. The smallest computer to simulate the universe would be have the size and energy requirement of the entire universe itself.')
