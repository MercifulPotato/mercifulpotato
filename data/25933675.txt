As things got complicated, instead of the couple of arguments seen in his example you need up with half a dozen or more, or variable argument lists, people passing callbacks with callbacks and all sorts of shit like that instead of just writing an object and context manager or two.<p>In a large codebase these rapidly become very difficult to reason about and are better structured as objects with a discrete set of operations.')
