To me, it&#x27;s still unclear why so many actually voted for him (it woke me up as to how a large percentage of the American electorate actually thinks, and for me that&#x27;s a worry).<p>You&#x27;re right, the chaos Trump&#x27;s created has seen a paradigm shift in the way politics is carried out everywhere, and that&#x27;s likely not a bad thing. Often things need to get worse before a wake-up call turns them around for the better. We&#x27;ll wait and see.<p>Trump&#x27;s initial success, the lemming-like addiction to smartphones&#x2F;Facebook mania, and the swathes and swathes of crazy, mad and irresponsible behaviour I&#x27;ve seen over the last seven or eight months in response to COVID-19 has truly shaken my view of humanity. I used to think we humans were smarter than we actually are.')
