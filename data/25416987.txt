Some read too diverse, scattered stuff, and some read just the same thing and lock themselves into confirmation bias and echo chambers.<p>The first need to focus more, the second need to focus less.<p>I could write a wide paragraph on how one needs to consume more than one kind of thing, how it&#x27;s healthy to to challenge oneself, like the unknowable forces in the wild nature, etc etc. Something majestic and grandiose like that.<p>Point is, wise advice is directional, and you cannot know from it which side you are on.
