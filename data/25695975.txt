I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with Twitter&#x27;s decision given the events of the last few days, but this undeniably strips Trump of a major source of power for him, and that merits a discussion of the role that private social media companies play in our discourse and presidential function as well.<p>edit: imagine trying to run for re-election without a social media presence. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that anyone could mount a serious campaign without it, let alone win.')
