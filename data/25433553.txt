Google stopped supporting that Chromebook so I needed to switch to Neverware&#x27;s version of the Chrome OS if I wanted to keep getting updates.<p>Neverware&#x27;s Chrome OS is a downstream version of the Chrome OS that you get on new Chromebooks.<p>I do hope that with this acquisition, Neverware&#x27;s product improves. One chronic problem I have with my pixel chromebook is that I had to disable some security settings to install Neverware&#x27;s Chrome OS, which causes some problems every time they do an update.')
