This works well for the kind of people police tend to favor.  If you&#x27;re wealthy and look the part or you&#x27;re an attractive woman this solution will likely work well for you, being white sure won&#x27;t hurt either.  The problem with this solution is unevenness of enforcement.  Anyone of demographics the cops don&#x27;t like (don&#x27;t be a young black male) or anyone that crosses the cops is really gonna get screwed by this solution.  It&#x27;s also worth keeping in mind that less work necessitates cuts to the police force.  Bored cops are an enemy of a free society.<p>Second you can solve it with the courts.  Let the cops pick up whoever they want and sort it all out in the courts.  Release people promptly and without bail, etc. etc.  The problem with this solution is that vulnerable people still get screwed hard.  &quot;The ride&quot; will still likely cost you your job in a high turnover industry.  Eventually the cops are gonna get tired of seeing the same damn bike thief at it again the next day and stop picking people up though if the court doesn&#x27;t actually punish the real criminals.<p>Thirdly you can solve this problem at the legislative level. You can not criminalize many things that boil down to minor instances of bad judgement and convert many nonviolent crimes into civil crimes, limit the circumstances under which police can arrest, limit the punishments the courts can inflict, require more prompt trials and releases, etc, etc.  The downside is that like every public policy there are losers.  There will be loopholes and certain kinds of crime are just gonna be below a threshold where anything gets done about them.  If you get unlucky and happen to live beside the obvious crack house that the cops can&#x27;t do much about then it&#x27;s simply gonna suck for you.  Furthermore people&#x27;s lives will be ruined by a tolerance approach just as much as by an authoritarian approach.  Criminals who have not yet crossed paths with the system to really get punished to the point of changing or thrown in jail will harm and kill people.  That&#x27;s just how it is when you relax laws at scale.  Is it worth it?  It&#x27;s a matter of opinion.<p>Bailing on cash bail targets the court system for the point of reform.  It&#x27;s not a bad thing and certainly every little bit helps but if we truly don&#x27;t want to over punish people for things society has to come to terms with the fact that it will need to cast a very coarse net and a lot of people engaging in behavior that you, yes you the reader, consider criminal will necessarily slip through (with the details depending on the part of the system in which you choose to make your changes as I&#x27;ve described above).  There is no free lunch here.  Make no mistake, I don&#x27;t think this is a zero sum game and I&#x27;m all for a very coarse net.  I just think a lot of people here are unprepared for exactly what it does look like and how long it takes to stabilize.')
