It isn&#x27;t waterproof as a Pebble, though buttons on my Pebble 2 disintegrated (I also had a Pebble 1 KS edition). Doesn&#x27;t have touch screen. Battery life 2 weeks (approx). Shows notifications, can control music, doesn&#x27;t have color. You can even put the smart display off, or customize it (slightly). It has 3 buttons. What I miss is an option to put Bluetooth off.')
