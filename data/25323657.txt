Item(by='zbentley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607264917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323043, text='&gt; Only politically correct, somewhat career-related content is allowed<p>That&#x27;s not my experience at all. The examples cited in the article (&quot;president Obama wasn&#x27;t really black&quot;) are, in my experience, the very tip of the iceberg. I don&#x27;t have to look too far in LinkedIn comments to find people posting ... pretty politically-incorrect shit. It&#x27;s more the asshole-uncle variety of shit (e.g. &quot;I don&#x27;t have gay friends because gay people always hit on me&quot;, or &quot;I couldn&#x27;t work for a woman CEO, they&#x27;re not cut out for it&quot;) than the facebook variety (qanon&#x2F;incohate rage at $phenomenon&#x2F;etc.), but there sure is a lot of it.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s an N of 1 so take it with a grain, but LinkedIn definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like a bastion of civility or professionalism to me.')
