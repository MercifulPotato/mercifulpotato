If passed, it&#x27;d face immediate First Amendment challenges. It&#x27;s exceedingly hard to pass a law that discriminates based upon the content of speech.<p>Second, it&#x27;s trying to overwrite parts of Section 230 and seems, at least on its face, as blatantly violating the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.<p>I don&#x27;t see this going anywhere.')
