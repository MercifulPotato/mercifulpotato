I’m sure that’s not what we need, but I’m also sure that there is no good way out of this mess.<p>I actually think that the reason we are in this mess is because there have been <i>zero</i> consequences for terrible behavior, so far.<p>Of all the terrible things Trump has done, it has taken inciting a riot, an attempted overthrow of our democratically elected government, for him to loose his megaphone. Why was incarcerating children at the border not enough? Or encouraging those &quot;fine people&quot; in Charlottesville who murdered a woman? Or one of the many other instances of him spewing hate?<p>We need more accountability. Actions have consequences, and it is long overdue that those people who take irresponsible, harmful actions, either out of desire for personal gain or sheer idiocy, start feeling the consequences.<p>The right is supposedly the side to which &quot;law and order&quot; appeals. Trump and his people are exactly the kind of people who need to know that they will get punished to the full extent of the law when they misbehave. That&#x27;s the only thing that will keep them in line.<p>Because it&#x27;s not like they have a moral compass to fall back on.')
