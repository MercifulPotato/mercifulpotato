Not everyone is fine being alone for 6+ months.<p>No, actually it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not a binary thing, where it&#x27;s either prevent you from seeing people or going out of the house, or zero restrictions. Sweden&#x27;s choice was to go with purely voluntary restrictions. The alternative is <i>some</i> restrictions. Where I live, we&#x27;ve had a mask requirement for quite a while and basically nothing other than that, and that is indeed an alternative Sweden could have chosen.<p>In addition, &quot;being prevented from seeing friends and family, and not being allowed to go to work&quot; was to a large extent dictated by the circumstances. When some areas got to the point that they no longer had hospital capacity, they had no choice. A simple look at the correlation between restrictions and health outcomes is a textbook example of bad reasoning for an intro statistics course.')
