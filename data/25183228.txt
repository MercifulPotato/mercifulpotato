Sure I agree but isn&#x27;t something better than nothing? We are not giving up rights to make future advancements by asking for a compromise that may be more within reach.<p>In particular, I think this idea of trading your data is easy to understand and communicate. Also, could it be the case that as soon as companies are forced to offer a price for your data a lot of the predatory data collection schemes may not be profitable enough as a result? I imagine you can&#x27;t just make a crappy app and start collecting user info en masse because it now incurs a real cost.\nAlso I think data should be traded precisely where every data point generated should be worth something. Not just as a one time thing.')
