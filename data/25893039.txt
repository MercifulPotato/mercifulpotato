If billionaries cannot launder their reputations through philanthropy, maybe that would be more careful of their reputation during the wealth-accumulation phase.<p>I think you are exaggerating the effect of it. Do you really those who do shady deals think about &#x27;laundering their reputation&#x27; when they are older - especially with the majority of their assets - as a big reason to do what they  do, to the point where they wouldn&#x27;t do those deals if they cant do  philanthropy later? Perhaps to a small extent but I seriously doubt it&#x27;s a big part of the picture. Definitely not enough  to overshadow all the good done through philanthropy.')
