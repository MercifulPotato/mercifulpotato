When and how do I prioritize? How do tasks and calendar entries correlate? Can they overlap? (Sometimes? Always?) Am I supposed to allot calendar time for every single to-do item? For some items? For none at all? (If not: how to ensure that I’m going to get things done?) What’s the lifecycle of the backlog? When do I decide whether and when to drop a task from the backlog? Are tags (or categories or folders) useful, or do they needlessly complicate things? How do I go about forming a habit for the review process?<p>From my experience, it’s all about the process, not the technology. The former is surprisingly missing from most to-do apps.')
