I didn&#x27;t vote for Trump. You seem to be assuming I did.<p>Biden was VP to Obama. Deficit under Obama&#x2F;Biden first term was much worse than Trump first term. Not sure why you think Biden wouldn&#x27;t just immediately shoot the deficit way up (assuming he has that power, which mostly the POTUS does not). Again, doesn&#x27;t matter if the trend is down if your first year is the all time high.<p>You still haven&#x27;t shown empirically what damage Trump has caused. As far as I&#x27;ve seen, there is nothing in the data that is very damning at all once you exclude COVID, which again, I exclude because it&#x27;s not just the US failing at COVID, it&#x27;s the vast majority of all countries on earth. There are literally only a handful of countries that have handled COVID very well. Unrelated to the black swan event that is COVID, stats are either the same, better, or no worse than they&#x27;ve been at other times in the past couple decades. Hardly seems like the end times if you actually are looking at the data.')
