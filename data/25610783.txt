Come here for a MS degree, and get hired. For many other countries, it&#x27;s not that easy. Some allow you to immigrate due to your advanced degree, but with no guarantee of work, so you need to have plenty of money saved while you look for work - something many cannot afford.<p>I have to disagree with this as an Iranian working in Germany who moved with an offer on a Blue Card.<p>After getting an offer, getting visa was 1 week<i>, I started working immediately, have changed job with only bureaucracy being involved is a small email to the Foreigners employment Office(LABO) to confirm my new contract looks good.<p>I think people have an unfair view of state of immigration in EU.<p>Regarding your other point about racism, that experience is not representative of the whole of EU. I am biased as I live in Berlin but I think you are also biased (probably) if you live in the multi cultural centers of US(SV&#x2F;LA&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;Seattle etc.).<p>I have not had any horrible racism experience neither my friends whom I discuss these things regularly. I am sure if I lived in a small town&#x2F;city, I will get racism behavior regularly, independent of EU, USA, Canada etc.<p></i> To clarify: Took 1 week from Turkey where I was living then, from Iran would have been longer due to German Embassy inadequate staffing, etc.')
