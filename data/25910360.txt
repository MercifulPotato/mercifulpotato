The author of that paper has discovered multiple CVE&#x27;s in Zcash (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;cve&#x2F;CVE-2019-16930&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;cve&#x2F;CVE-2019-16930&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;cve&#x2F;CVE-2019-11636&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;cve&#x2F;CVE-2019-11636&#x2F;</a> ).<p>There are very few unique source codebases which implement privacy coins, maybe a half dozen depending on how lenient you are (i.e. is DASH a privacy coin? Barely, but it could be considered one. Blockchain analysis companies make fun of the &quot;privacy&quot; of DASH.)<p>I believe when he says &quot;inventing a whole new field&quot; he means inventing a whole new field of attacks and defenses, just like the Phrack paper invented a whole new industry of attacks and then their defenses.<p>Taking these new kinds of attacks into account, all existing privacy coins are vulnerable. Monero is more vulnerable than Zcash Protocol, since it does not have Zero Knowledge Math. It uses Group Theory, which leaks metadata like crazy.')
