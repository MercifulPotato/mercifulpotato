There were exactly 2 (unarmed) &quot;security guards&quot; present who told my friend they obviously stood no chance if these people decided to charge. On another occasion 100 Kurdish protestors managed to break in to the building. But they just don&#x27;t want these places to look like Fort Knox.<p>In the end, a guy in buffalo costume fooling around on the senate floor is better than puddles of blood.')
