It is unclear what this even <i>means</i>. I mean yeah sure: If I surf your site you&#x27;re gonna apply your sites privacy rules, no surprise there â€” but they still should allow me to go away if I don&#x27;t want this or don&#x27;t trust them. The surprise however is that the privacy rules is a damned <i>PDF</i> that you are expected to download and open? No thanks. If that is how privacy conscious people are treated I will pass.<p>1) Not giving me the choice to know what I should agree to <i>beforehand</i> and making agreement implicit is not cool.<p>2) Making it hard to read the rules is a no go (the rules should be on the site itself)<p>3) Is the tracking&#x2F;data collection important enough to deface a site? I don&#x27;t collect anything on my own sites and don&#x27;t use cookies beyond what is technically needed, which is why I don&#x27;t have to ask for consent.<p>The rough serverside access stats are totally enough for me and AFAIK they don&#x27;t fall under GDPR as long as it is just aggregate numbers.<p>If you really want to do cookie based tracking and stuff, why not just make it a yes&#x2F;no choice? Stuff like this is about branding as well. If the first thing you tell your potential visitors is that they have no choice you are hurting your own communications.')
