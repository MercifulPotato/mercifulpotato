If we had 3-4 competitive alternatives in most markets (compared to 1-2 now) I think we&#x27;d have a very different conversation. For the record, I don&#x27;t consider anyone offering &lt; 10 Mbps service today a viable competitor. Maybe Starlink will deliver a well-deserved kick in the pants to this market.')
