Not just chat but also email notifications with previews. This has become something I actively consider before communicating by text instead of calling someone.\nIt would be great if teams, zoom etc could automatically and by default prevent any notifications from popping into a shared screen.\nAnd then thereâ€™s still the people who leave their mail and chat opened and just cmd-tab through them or leave them on screen while sharing... oh well :)')
