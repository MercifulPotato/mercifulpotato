Item(by='burkaman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608422794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482055, text='That is not an accurate summary of the study. Emphasis mine:<p>&gt; Limitation: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and <i>no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.</i><p>&gt; The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% <i>in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think any public health experts are saying &quot;wear a mask and you&#x27;ll be safe&quot;, they&#x27;re saying &quot;if everybody wears a mask, that will slow the infection rate&quot;. A study of a community with &quot;uncommon general mask use&quot; does not dispute this.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear that a randomized controlled trial is the best method to answer this question. Aside from ethical concerns, you can&#x27;t give someone a placebo mask. Shouldn&#x27;t we assume that people will behave differently when they&#x27;re wearing a mask?')
