Zig has little protection.<p>This is the most relevant part to me.  As someone who will probably never write a line of either myself, the way I will work with languages like this is thorough libraries or extensions of higher-level languages like python or ruby.  To that end, safety is the most important factor to me, with performance very much second.  While rust has unsafe operations, these are relatively easy to audit if the code is open source.  \nOk, so to the programmer, Zig may be more ergonomic than C or Rust.  But until Zig can offer the safety assurances of Rust, I&#x27;m still rooting for Rust to take over the world as the dominant and de-facto low-level language.')
