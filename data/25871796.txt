Item(by='sharpneli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611324724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871209, text='&gt; Using cheap labor, copying foreign products, and bypassing copyright worked for the US, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan when they were in their own economic rise, and thus far has been working for China.<p>That&#x27;s what makes the arguments from USA so amusing.<p>I mean they basically nicked, against British law, the designs how to mass manufacture textiles. Is US willing to repay, with interest, all the economic damage that did to British industry? Same with all the later patents. US basically started respecting patents of others when they got to the point that they had more of their own. So only when it was profitable.<p>It&#x27;s basically &quot;It&#x27;s fine when I do it but now that I&#x27;m the big dominant power everyone else must stay in line and let me stay dominant&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m happy that US did what it did. I&#x27;m also happy that the other countries did what they did, because in the end we all benefit more from the countries being more developed than being less developed by &quot;following the rules&quot;. Once China gets bit more R&amp;D of their own they will start following the rules simply because it&#x27;s mostly reciprocal.')
