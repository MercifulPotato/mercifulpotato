Much more preferable to deal with cynical political operators who don&#x27;t believe what they say. Those are quite rare, and usually more transparent, so would not explain why this sort of thing pops up so much online.<p>If that answer doesn&#x27;t satisfy you then call it observational humor regarding urban &amp; suburban neuroses. Not really sure what you&#x27;re driving at otherwise.')
