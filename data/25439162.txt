In a 30-minute commute you might observe 200 car-minutes (this is a total shot in the dark to be clear) closely enough to notice a mistake if it happened. So if you notice 1 mistake per commute on average, and you yourself make a mistake every 200 minutes of driving, you could estimate that you&#x27;re an average driver.')
