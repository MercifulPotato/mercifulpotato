I said rent, just like purchase price of property, can be negotiated. The appstore fee cannot be negotiated. There is no pretext that parties here will draft a mutual contract.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure why you&#x27;re attacking me and &quot;my feelings&quot; here, especially when it&#x27;s not that I &quot;feel&quot; that commercial rents should be negotiated, but that they can be and often are negotiated.')
