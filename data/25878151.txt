Here&#x27;s a quick example from New England in 2010:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=830" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=830</a><p>During &quot;peak&quot; hours they&#x27;re using roughly 17Gw total, and during off-peak, it&#x27;s at 15Gw so we&#x27;ve only got 2Gw total to buffer electric cars charging.<p>Feel free to tell me how my math is wrong, but let&#x27;s assume worst case scenario: a tesla charger lists 11.5kW max draw. There are roughly 14m people in New England, if we assume even half of them were charging overnight, that&#x27;s 86Gw of power draw.  Even if you back that off to 25% of the population and half the power draw from the charger, you&#x27;re at 21.5Gw of power, which is 10x what is available, and more than the total power usage during peak hours.<p>If someone else has some different math I&#x27;m all ears but I don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;re going to more than double the total power capacity in 10 years - even if you assume we can get there with renewables, the backend infrastructure can&#x27;t handle it.')
