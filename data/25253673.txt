I imagine it would be very hard for Mathworks to claim copyright over mathematical functions and established terms such as &quot;fft&quot; or &quot;rms&quot;.<p>On top of that, Octave isn&#x27;t even in competition with MATLAB. The much higher performance and capabilities offered by MATLAB that aren&#x27;t available in Octave (like C++ export including support for GPU acceleration) along with professional support are enough to keep the target audience from considering Octave over MATLAB.<p>Octave isn&#x27;t encroaching on MATLAB sales, so I don&#x27;t think such ruling would be an issue as I doubt that Mathworks would even consider legal action.<p>Even if they would for whatever bizarre reason, it&#x27;d be sufficient to just change the names and parameters of some functions - lots of work, sure but ultimately not too big an issue.<p>A script could be used to translate between the dialects and people using Octave over MATLAB would continue to do so, since their motivation for choosing Octave wouldn&#x27;t change due to this.<p>At least that&#x27;s what I think.')
