When you are ready to save, you can “snap” shot it, and leave a little message. And you can do as much of this as you want.<p>Then when you’re ready to merge it back to the primary database, then you can “commit” it.<p>The whole concept of pull&#x2F;commit&#x2F;push seems nonsensical to me. As a layman, I can’t understand the importance of pull vs. push in this context. And this makes it difficult to explain to someone non-technical.')
