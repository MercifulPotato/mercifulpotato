My biggest question is, should a new parent spend time implementing this solution?<p>More of a philosophical question, but from my POV if you&#x27;re spending time implementing this, you&#x27;re not valuing your time enough. For the creator (Fabio), it&#x27;s arguably time well spent: define a problem, use your creative muscles to a functioning solution, document it and show the world your creation. All well and good.<p>Tinkering to <i>implement</i> Fabio&#x27;s solution, now that&#x27;s where I see it being low-value usage of your own time. There&#x27;s an opportunity cost to it; you could be spending time finding your own problem and creating a solution you could display.')
