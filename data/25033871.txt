Why do you publish your work in the first place? To get donations? That&#x27;s not what open source was invented for.<p>If you don&#x27;t want people to use your work, don&#x27;t publish it. Publishing has the totally selfish goal of getting others to help you by trying things out, report bugs and improvements and some of them to contribute those things to you. Don&#x27;t publish if you don&#x27;t care and just want mobey out of it. Then open source is not for you.<p>You think Linus Torvalds wanted donations when he published Linux? Or that he was in a particularly philantropic mood? No way. He did it to get other people to work for him. And it turned out great for the project! That he is now making a living with it is just a side effect.')
