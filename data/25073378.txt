So any such law statement just assumes that any software you have didn&#x27;t needlessly add some of it.<p>A very real problem of framing complexity this way is that the article is very likely adding a lot of complexity to the software. That&#x27;s what most &quot;let me simplify it for you&quot; solutions do. And if you just state that complexity is constant, you won&#x27;t even think about checking this.')
