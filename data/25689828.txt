Either discourse works and you expect people can be made to come to their own sensible conclusions or discourse doesn&#x27;t work and every change from the norm must be subversive. I.e. tucking it away doesn&#x27;t guarantee it ends up less visible to people it just guarantees it will be less visible to the system tucking it away. People are still going to share ideas that don&#x27;t agree with the majority opinion but now those hearing have zero tools or experience for dealing with such claims.')
