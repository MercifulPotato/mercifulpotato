First month, payment processed fine as expected. Second month, payment didn&#x27;t go through (I had enough money in the bank). I call Chase, they say &quot;its fine, sometimes things take a few days&quot; Call Chime &quot;No, there are no pending transactions, don&#x27;t worry. Rinse, wash and repeat for 10 days. Today, Chase says &quot;we reprocessed the payment after Chime returned the transaction&quot; Chime says &quot;There have been no attempted transactions. I start a three way call, Chase says &quot;No, state law prohibits us from having 3 way calls. We need a written letter.&quot; We&#x27;re really going to preplan a 3 way call in the future after I send a letter? Fuck right off. Chime says there is nothing they can do. I tell both parties that I consent but they both can&#x27;t speak to each other and can&#x27;t even have a three-way call with me.<p>Banks are all dumpster fires of bureaucracy and regulation. I doubt any banks are &quot;great&quot;')
