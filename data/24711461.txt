I casually browse Blind sometimes and the overwhelming attitude there is that Amazon is the &quot;lesser&quot; FAANG and is where you work if you couldn&#x27;t cut it at Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Netflix. There&#x27;s a lot of negativity about things like &quot;Amazon doesn&#x27;t provide free lunch? why even work there? Google gives me free lunch <i>and</i> free dinner!&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also a <i>huge</i> emphasis in such circles on compensation, and Amazon supposedly has a somewhat lower total compensation for entry level engineers than Google et al. That&#x27;s a huge deal to status chasers who only measure their self worth in money.<p>FWIW I do not recommend browsing Blind because it is full of toxic mindsets like that, nor do I agree at all with it... I&#x27;m just sharing some context that such communities do exist.')
