Everybody slobbering Dan&#x27;s knob conveniently forgets that the second outbreak could have been avoided if the government hadn&#x27;t subcontracted out all the hotel security.<p>Australia&#x27;s neoliberal death march has yet to reach the brutal conclusion that America arrived at, but it&#x27;s trodding along. And smug complacency certainly won&#x27;t reverse that course.')
