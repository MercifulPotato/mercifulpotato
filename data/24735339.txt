Let me clarify: My sister was arguing with me that Breonna Taylor was a drug dealer. Which is as factually wrong as the &quot;Obama is a Muslim&quot; comments.<p>EDIT: Note that the warrant in the case was for Jamarcus Glover. I can accept Jamarcus Glover being a drug dealer (or having some connection to drugs), but seeing Breonna Taylor wrapped up in the drug charges is clearly misinformation.')
