I don’t use any other package manager on macOS these days, everything is Nix, fully declarative with a small script that basically does `nix-env --install` (but with the flags to replace my current environment wholly, and with some helpers around showing what changed). I can then just sync my config between my machines and run my script and get identical setups on every machine I use, and I can update all of my packages at once just by running `nix channel --update` followed by invoking my script again.<p>And there’s a bunch of utilities I use rarely so I don’t even keep them installed, since I know I can just `nix run nixpkgs.hello -c hello` if I ever want to run them.<p>And then for a work project I set up a custom derivation that I can use when I need to run the occasional scripts that require the custom ruby and python environment, so I can just run e.g. `nix run nixpkgs.my.env -c pod install`. This way I’m not even polluting my global environment with this stuff the way the work scripts expect. And I’m currently working on formalizing this into Nix derivations in the work repo directly (in an attempt to convince my coworkers that we should all use Nix).')
