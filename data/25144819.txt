The only way it can flourish is censored away into manipulative misdirection and secretive groups.<p>This is so false it&#x27;s bordering on the absurd. Anyone with even a little experience with debate and techniques like Gish gallop, which are widely employed, know that rational arguments simply do not convince most people of things. Humans aren&#x27;t purely rational beings. It&#x27;s dangerous to assume we can just talk away propaganda because all evidence points to the contrary.<p>More than 80% of Trump supporters believe the election was rigged against their candidate despite there literally being no evidence supporting this claim. We&#x27;re seeing propaganda succeed on such a massive scale because it&#x27;s so widely spread and so difficult to counter. You&#x27;ve got literally millions of people who have been conditioned to label everything that contradicts their views as &quot;fake news&quot;. There is a reason why Fox News viewers score lower on current information than people who don&#x27;t watch any news at all. Their propaganda works and talking about it and pointing it out isn&#x27;t helping at all.')
