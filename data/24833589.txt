There&#x27;s no technical reason you can&#x27;t use a different host on your end <i>per contact</i> in Matrix (for one to one messaging at least). It would be absurd, but you could do it provided that your client supported it.<p>If it&#x27;s really needed, federation combined with open source software means that tooling can be adapted to facilitate your particular security and workflow requirements. (Not that you should need it generally, but the freedom is always there if you do.)')
