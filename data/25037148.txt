But you might be able to hypothesize that eating a clean&#x2F;chemically free (ex: Round Up&#x2F;Glyphosate) food item would be better for you.<p>Comparing a factory farm pig that was fed GMO Soy it&#x27;s entire life and raised in conditions that encourage disease&#x2F;sickness to a pig raised in a clean&#x2F;organic pasture with no exposure to synthetics&#x2F;chemicals, I would imagine there is a noticeable difference in health.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be reasonable to assume that someone consuming this animal would benefit more than someone consuming the factory farmed pig?')
