The systems are designed to make getting support hard, because most people contacting consumer support literally don&#x27;t even have a problem that good support staff could solve.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make sense.  You are in favour of systemic obfuscation and low quality support to discourage people who don&#x27;t have problems from taking up the time of support staff?  Even though the barriers make life hell for people with legitimate problems like the guy whose $1.5m inventory was destroyed?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to handle both types of cases properly?<p>Instead of spending &quot;hours with mentally ill people&quot; (your terminology), why not perfect the art of triage and funnel people without problems appropriately?<p>If that&#x27;s an unrealistic expectation, could you provide more detail about how it is unavoidable to spend &quot;hours with mentally ill people&quot;?  You already provided details, but I can&#x27;t see how you end up losing so many hours!  There are techniques for handling these cases, my friend.<p>Your oscilloscope product looks fantastic, and the price and terms you sell it for tells me you are an interesting and valuable human being.  I&#x27;m just pressing you about the other side of your story because I feel there might be a better way to handle the difficult cases that you somehow aren&#x27;t aware of because you are too fundamentally helpful and an undiscriminatingly good guy.  Or something.')
