Or better quality goods that put out same amount of pollution, but you end up buying them not as frequently.<p>Let&#x27;s take a hipothetical sweater as an example.<p>Now I buy a €20 sweater every 2 years. Let&#x27;s say pollution tax would be €10. Suddenly it becomes €30 sweater and my €10&#x2F;year sweater budget becomes €15&#x2F;year. Instead, I could buy a nice sweater for €40 (+€10 tax) and wear it for 5 years. Now I&#x27;m back at original €10&#x2F;year budget.<p>Economy wise, most of the chain is now just making nicer stuff that takes more resources. Aside from truck driver. Who is now moving twice as much sweaters. But €10 tax ideally would go to environment-improving projects and some drivers will make a living in those new sectors.')
