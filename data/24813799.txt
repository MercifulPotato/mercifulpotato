Covid-19 isn&#x27;t to 300,000 (5x 60k) yet, but I suppose it could get there.  However, the idea of organs damaged, resulting in future fatalities, is not just &quot;unclear&quot;.  We could speculate the same about almost any virus, or for that matter any vaccine.  Until time has passed, we won&#x27;t know, but at this point neither northern Italy nor any other region that had early waves of Covid-19 have reported any such problem in even 1% of cases (not even 0.01% of cases, that I&#x27;m aware of).<p>If a vaccine is tested on 10,000 people, and appears safe, we call it good enough, without waiting for several years to check on the possibility of long-term affects.  It&#x27;s not like vaccines have never had problems, but at some point you need to go by what you actually know and have seen, and the same logic applies to viruses (or any other risk).  We haven&#x27;t in fact seen anything that suggests a widespread problem in people who recover from covid-19, and given past results with SARS, MERS, and the four other coronaviruses which cause &quot;colds&quot;, we don&#x27;t have much reason to expect it.  Could it happen in some significant percentage?  Sure.  The same is true of any virus, or for that matter any vaccine.  But we don&#x27;t gain anything from speculating on that.')
