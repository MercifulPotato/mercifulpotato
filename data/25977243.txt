The broken system Delloit developed is being replaced with Eventbrite in certain states, pen and paper in others. All the users needed was a simple scheduling system which shouldn&#x27;t cost anywhere near 40M to develop no matter how you spin it. Is Eventbrite works for this, why did no one actually think to just use that (or the many similar systems created for this kind of thing)? Pretty sure Deloit itself just wrapped something like Eventbrite around a skin UI and delivered that.<p>The only answer I can come up with, even after trying to be generous, is corruption. The fact that there was no bidding should be enough for that contract to be highly suspicious. People in the top are pocketing most of the 40M and everyone involved knows it.')
