Aside from small personal satisfaction to the few that will be able to afford them, how is revolving our infrastructure and culture around them any better than simply investing in public transportation by making it a more feasible option for people?<p>I&#x27;m not in the US, and while the public transportation system here is far from perfect, I&#x27;ve managed to get by this far without a car and don&#x27;t plan on buying one anytime soon.
