Hmm, there&#x27;s a thought.  So one challenge with designing a story to be told, is how to make it stable.  Else it becomes a source of misconceptions, rather than of understanding.  If the story is then passed on further, that becomes the telephone game, and stability... becomes even harder.  Status quo disinclination to pass on (pervasively flawed) understanding does have benefits.  So what if it were paired with a bit of traditional viral content, to provide a stable reference?  How might one get the two, oral storytelling and viral content,  to propagate together?  Perhaps if the setup for storytelling was itself the viral content?  Somehow search keyed so someone in receipt of only the oral, could recover the viral?  Or if the viral had additional value, perhaps compelling video, so there was incentive to present both?  Hmm.  Fun morning brainstorming - thanks!')
