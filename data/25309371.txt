Charity&#x2F;Thrift shops are packed to the brim with used clothing not to mention organizations that very specifically bring used clothing items to those in need.<p>I believe most people do not keep all their clothing items until they are entirely worn out. Changes in taste, body changes, getting rid of unused items, moving to a location with a different climate etc.<p>In most cases people are <i>donating</i> the clothes not reselling them.
