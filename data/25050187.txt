What do Thunderbolt-supporting ARM devices generally do with an eGPU?)<p>Instead, discrete GPU support (and off-package [hierarchically-managed?] DRAM support) is waiting for the M1X-or-whatever, the next chip. Along with that chip, they&#x27;ll refresh all the discrete-GPU product lines: the higher-end MBPs, the iMacs, and the Mac Pro.<p>(Personally, I&#x27;m betting that Apple will take this opportunity to get rid of <i>truly discrete</i> GPUs in their products, and instead partner with a graphics company like AMD to license IP cores to put in their higher-end SoCs. So you could see e.g. AMD&#x27;s next-gen Vega with their Smart Access Memory tech, wired to Apple&#x27;s SoC-internal UMA bus.)')
