The market generally doesn&#x27;t have an appreciation of that, P&#x2F;E was still nuts even before the release of Zen2 when AMD&#x27;s success was far less clear (Zen1&#x2F;Zen+ were far less appealing products and scaled far less well into server class).  It&#x27;s a lot of amateurs (see: r&#x2F;AMD_Stock on reddit) buying it because they like the company rather than trading on the fundamentals.<p>Right now the stock market is just nuts in general though, there&#x27;s so much money from the Fed&#x27;s injections sloshing around and looking for any productive asset, and tech companies look like a good bet when everyone is stuck at home, building home offices, consuming tech hardware and electronic media.  Housing is getting even more weird as well.')
