It was supposed to be for sale in 2014 and still hasn&#x27;t shipped yet (from what I can find in Google). The creators have been stringing along their backers for the better part of a decade.<p>As far as utility, it seems like more of a gimmick than something that would get regular use. I can&#x27;t think of a time when I&#x27;ve been working on a project and wished I had a 1&#x2F;2&quot; drive ratchet, a short pry bar, and a hammer but only had space in the tool bag for one of them.')
