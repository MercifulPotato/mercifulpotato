Asking someone to change their general-purpose containers is a big ask.<p>It looks like Array mostly consolidates functional features already available in standard libraries, and the main innovation is a redesigned swiss-army-knife API.<p>Good APIs are important, but my instinct is they aren’t <i>this</i> important. Using enhanced versions of built-in container types sounds nice, but do you really want to be keeping track of whether something is a normal list or an Array? Do you want to force people who read your code to learn this library to work with something as fundamental as lists? It’s not an impossible bar to clear (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Dask, xarray) but it’s a high one.')
