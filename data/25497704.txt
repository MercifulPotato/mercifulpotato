So many BBS&#x27;s a local-call away....<p>I moved to the Bay Area in the 90&#x27;s and Fry&#x27;s was still a destination for the hardware hacker â€” selling wire-wrapping sockets and Playboy magazine. (I know - wut?) Disk Drive Depot, Computer Literacy Bookstore, Weirdstuff Warehouse, HSC.... I would do the electronics-surplus run on Saturday morning and see the same HAM&#x27;s and &quot;home brewers&quot; picking through old alphanumeric LED displays, etc....<p>It&#x27;s definitely a different place now.
