They should not have been used for general parallelization of loops - although they have had some success in that.<p>GPUs have geometrically relevant vectors as basic data types. I wish language designers would realize the value in that, but they are too concerned with abstraction.<p>RISC-V vectors are meant for the abstract general parallel concepts, but could also help with graphics code.<p>There really seems to be a disconnect around which types of vectors are good for which uses.')
