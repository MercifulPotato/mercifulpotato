I would describe a situation where hospitals are overloaded to the point where they have to choose who gets to live and who has to die a collapse.<p>Sources in English are harder to come by about this, but for example in spring when Stockholm&#x27;s ICU beds were at full capacity it is implicit that people with better prognosis had to be prioritized. Seniors with severe cases of corona were instead given morphine and sent to die in care homes:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svt.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;lokalt&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skarp-kritik-efter-ivo-granskning-av-aldreboenden" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svt.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;lokalt&#x2F;stockholm&#x2F;skarp-kritik-eft...</a><p>Nothing like this happened in Sweden&#x27;s neighboring countries with more cautious COVID approach because ICU beds so far never reached full capacity.
