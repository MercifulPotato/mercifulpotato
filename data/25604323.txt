The EU has been engaging in massive subsidisation for decades and has little to show for it. In some places it seems to have led to  a hollowed out society in which companies that are supposedly startups spend all their time chasing grant money instead of building real products.<p>VC investment is hard work. The EU isn&#x27;t a well run VC firm even though it deploys more capital than such firms do, and it shows: they don&#x27;t really care what the money gets spent on as long as there&#x27;s a paper trail they can use to do ass-covering if it turns out the money was lost to fraud. So it creates this USSR-like culture of zombie firms that can&#x27;t really survive independent of state funding.')
