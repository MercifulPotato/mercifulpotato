Kodak support was above and beyond, and they must have shipped me 4 printers as replacements.<p>It&#x27;s a shame consumer pigment printers didn&#x27;t take off but I guess once Kodak realized the price wasn&#x27;t going to move the needle on consumer habits, they might as well get their slice of the ink cartel pie.<p>My current HP is maybe the worse printer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It is constantly inaccessible on the network despite being connected and the only solution is to power cycle it. If I hold the power button to power it off, it sits and spins &quot;Preparing to shut down&quot; literally forever. I&#x27;ve left it overnight just so see. So I have to pull the plug every time just to turn it off. It&#x27;s insane.')
