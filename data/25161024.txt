Lumberjack is just a rebadger so I&#x27;d expect it to be available elsewhere at similar prices.<p>It has 1&#x2F;2&quot; and 1&#x2F;4&quot; collets. It&#x27;s steel topped. Really prominent height, power and speed control on the front. Good Enough™ fence and extraction.<p>It&#x27;s one of those rare tools that is both cheap for what it is, and way better than expected. By no means perfect, but it&#x27;s knocking on the door of a £1k DIY system.')
