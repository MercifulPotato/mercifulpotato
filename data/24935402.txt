The idea of avoiding walled garden services has been a big topic for a while but the apparent rise in ideological censorship in recent years has added a new element to it. Previously, I thought a fine solution was to publish your content on your own site and then link to it in the various walled gardens. That approach is not going to be effective if your main concern is the censorship of the walled garden. I do not mean to bring up a whole debate about censorship on these platforms, just acknowledging the fact that there is a growing amount of people who feel their content and&#x2F;or content they wish to consume is being censored for ideological reasons by some of the walled garden services.')
