The rules themselves were expansive and went well beyond the existing status quo in a number of different ways.<p>As an example, the OIO had lots of carve-outs for what they termed &quot;specialized services&quot; in the text; however, what would be considered a specialized service in the future was ambiguous as the definition wasn&#x27;t governed by any principled approach.  Some of my colleagues more familiar with regulatory policy said it would be a minimum of 10 years before we even began to get a clearer picture of how the rules would work in practice.  To give a concrete example, we&#x27;re essentially in year 6 of Net Neutrality in the EU and we still have no clear guidance on how certain important aspects of 5G (such as network slicing) will interact with it.
