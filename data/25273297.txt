There may be corner cases where confusion reigns, and where Apple mistake someone for a fraud, but I would presume they need to be very rare – otherwise Apple’s reputation as a buyer would suffer and people would sell to other buyers who cared for their reputation better (and every vulnerability sold to a third party has a high expected cost to Apple. Edit: on second thoughts maybe the cost to Apple is fairly low - certainly the maximum bounty size says that).<p>Edit: I agree that Apple stating a maximum payout is hardly helpful. I presume third party buyers indicate a minimum value they will pay depending on the value of the vulnerability to them. There is a market here, and it isn’t clear that Apple is willing to pay market prices, perhaps because too many people&#x2F;teams give their vulnerabilities to Apple for $0 (e.g. projectzero!)')
