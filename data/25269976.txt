If you don&#x27;t just intrinsically adore babies, you&#x27;ve just got a whole lot of work with no immediate payoff.  Sleep deprivation has a way of making everything worse, too.<p>There are fun bits later, and some people will insist childrearing is &#x27;fun&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t think so.<p>It&#x27;s loads of work, but fulfilling, interesting work, getting to know a new person.  It is full of joy.  Fun &#x2F; contentment?  Not so much.  The amount of work decreases as the kids get older, but the complexities of the problems that present themselves increase, too.<p>In some ways, you could view it as an <i>increased</i> opportunity for individuality.  You&#x27;re not just doing you anymore, but creating your own miniature culture around you.  You&#x27;re choosing who you are and how you&#x27;re going to pass it on to a new generation.  Hopefully, you start to take a really <i>intentional</i> view of the structure of your life at this point, too.<p>I&#x27;m not really looking forward to my kids growing up and having my individuality back.  Though I do sure wish there was a chance to take a couple weeks vacation each year. ;)')
