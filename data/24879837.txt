Especially for junior engineers who get a lot of their information from angry comment sections on HN and Reddit, there&#x27;s a growing desire to view engineering as the core of the company and expect all other departments to serve engineering. This results in a lot of pain when they&#x27;re dropped into a real company where they have to work side by side with other departments to generate revenue.<p>If you want to be successful, it&#x27;s important to accept that communication, relationships, and rapport are just as critical to getting anything done as the engineering work itself. It&#x27;s not office politics, it&#x27;s just the nature of working with other people. The longer people resist this idea, the more time they waste fighting reality instead of finding a way to make things work.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t take much effort to build relationships and rapport within a company. You&#x27;re going to have a long, painful uphill battle if you spend all of your time resenting and fighting it, though.')
