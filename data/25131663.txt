So that&#x27;s 4x younger.<p>For another, Mozilla has never really tried to &quot;market&quot; the license. It&#x27;s hard to make something gain traction if you don&#x27;t really try.<p>And then nobody really cares <i>that much</i> about licensing so if something is &quot;good enough&quot; and does what they want it to then they&#x27;re going to stick to it. Especially if it means they get to avoid doing research about licenses.<p>And people that do really care about licenses tend to fall into camp permissive or camp copyleft with not a whole lot of in-between.')
