At a glance it looks like it uses a lot of Prolog semantics, so that’s also got Logic Programming heritage which is yet another paradigm exploration opportunity.<p>I’m not sure it’s something I’d want to use in production, but I certainly might play around with it at some point to get some brain juices flowing in different directions.<p>I went from JS -&gt; Clojure&#x2F;ClojureScript -&gt; TypeScript, and that progression taught me a lot. It probably improved my programming skills many times over. I learned how to much better reason about state (Clojure&#x2F;FP) and interfaces&#x2F;contracts (TS&#x2F;static types), which pays off constantly.')
