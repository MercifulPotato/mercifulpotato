Only someone without kids would design a catalog with parental locking that cannot filter locked content.<p>My wife finds the aggrandizing of violence and cruelty found in American television to be distasteful, and I find it boring; and so we often find ourselves looking elsewhere after loading Netflix and finding mostly violent content.<p>We do enjoy their cooking shows; but we&#x27;re having better luck with Disney+ and Curiousity Stream for general family entertainment.')
