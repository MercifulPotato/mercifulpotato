The “us” culture here is just that people don’t come up with insane, I’m-smarter-than-the-experts conspiracy beliefs. The government says wear masks in public and people do it, because the simplest interpretation is that the government is trying to prevent an epidemic. The guy who recently caused the only local transmission in over 250 days is probably the most hated man in Taiwan right now because he selfishly disregarded the health of others in order to enjoy himself. In the US, he’d just be behaving like the average person.<p>I also believe that most of the Taiwan model’s success is thanks to smart policies and responsible governance, but there is something to be said for the cultural aspect, and it’s not a totalitarian hellhole sacrificing a few by welding them in their homes to save the many.')
