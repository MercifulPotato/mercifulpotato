The 2008 collapse converted large populations of young, rural and urban middle-class people into wage slaves, while both the Bush and Obama administrations printed money to prop up the financial institutions whose behavior caused the collapse.  This propped up the stock market nicely, which kept retireees happy, but inflated away any assets and wage growth younger people might have seen.<p>The real trick, though, was the MSM and social media using bubbles and doubletalk to convince those angry un-&#x2F;under-employed urban and rural folks that they should blame each other.<p>From that, you got the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street and (the angry seeds of) the alt-right and the populist left.')
