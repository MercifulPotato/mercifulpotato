The objects (blobs, trees, etc.) are sorted for similarity, <i>completely ignoring the graph of commit history</i> and <i>completely ignoring filenames or directory structures</i>, then delta compression is applied. This allows git’s storage to be smaller than version control systems that use a storage structure that preserves history or filenames.')
