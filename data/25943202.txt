As is obvious from my comment, I did read the resolution and agree with Protonmail that it does not provide sufficient evidence.<p>More substantially, we clearly disagree about the interpretation of point [4]. I would in particular question whether it calls for a ban on end-to-end encryption - at the very least you have to accept that it does not do so explicitly! And one could, for example, interpret it as a call to force suspected criminals to give up their passwords or some such.<p>I would therefore also propose that your claim of &quot;Orwellian&quot; is only fully justified once we find an actual proposal in front of the EU parliament that bans encryption. At the moment we are rather far from this, and - without further evidence - I correspondingly think that your claim is rather far-fetched.')
