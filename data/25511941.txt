Item(by='dkersten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608675234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511782, text='Well, I do think the game has some very big problems (aside from the bugs; see my other comments), but most of the story is very well written in my opinion and the characters are great. There were some moments that really hit me hard in the feels. There were some little details (ringing Jackie&#x27;s phone for example) that were just fantastic. I&#x27;m upset with CDPR management for lying and for not giving the dev team the time needed to finish it properly, but I&#x27;m not upset that I bought the game. I got my moneys worth and had a good time with it (yes, the game did crash regularly and have lots of annoying bugs, but I was mostly able to ignore it and continue anyway -- on PS4 too!)<p>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like Silverhand at all, I haven&#x27;t really seen any Keanu movies since The Matrix so had zero buy in with him being in the game, and at the start he was such a dry character. However, as it went on and as V and he interacted more, he grew on me and I guess V did too, so the V&#x2F;Silverhand blend at the end became something I actually cared about.')
