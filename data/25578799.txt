Many games containing violence are probably made in poor taste. For example, it would be a red flag for me when meeting someone if their favourite video game studio is Rockstar Games and that&#x27;s all they like to play. It&#x27;d be like saying their favourite TV genre is reality TV and they&#x27;re proud to watch it constantly. It&#x27;s OK once in a while, but I hope they often expand their horizons. Rockstar&#x27;s modern games certainly have some value, but relative to many other games they feel like technically-impressive immature time sinks. My snooty point aside, violent video games seem not to correlate with aggression, but I suspect they at least correlate with some annoying personality traits. Some artistic masterpieces worth consuming contain a lot of violence, I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the norm, so it&#x27;s easy for outsiders to lump &quot;violent games&quot; together as a threat.')
