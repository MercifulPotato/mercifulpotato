The only information that I found was traditional families, where the grandparents and relatives take the responsibility for the education too.<p>I lived some years in South American, and I was impressed how many middle class families have their Nanny taking care of their kids (bringing to the school, cooking, controlling home work, taking care while they were sick, etc).. could be that be seem as &quot;collective parenting&quot; too?<p>&gt; There&#x27;s still collective parenting in places of the world that don&#x27;t have that same desire of individualism.<p>Would provide more data here? I&#x27;m interested to see how they are doing.')
