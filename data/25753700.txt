That would not change the outcome.<p>But then you will involve slippery slope and day: but if it happened in Georgia, then it probably happened elsewhere... but that’s BS, you need to show the evidence elsewhere as well.<p>Then even if you accept all the bullshit, there is maximum only absolutely max: 2 million votes in “question”. Where Biden won by 7 million votes.\n So you Are still relying on the bs electoral college that has no democratic justification to say you won...<p>Honestly, if you want to stop the steal, get rid of that... but the problem with that is, you wouldn’t have had a Republican President since the 80s...<p>So keep making up rules until you can get minority rule. Filibusters, electoral college and failing that just kick down the doors... how can anyone think they are protecting democracy with this stuff!?')
