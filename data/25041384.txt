The worst parts were all very human - they sent me the wrong link for the test, shared incorrect information about the allowed materials (IE: scratch paper, a 4 function calculator, etc), and then I waited for more than 20 minutes for the proctor to finally show up. Then of course there&#x27;s the problem that the test provider has wonky weird software, including forcing you to install their &quot;secure&quot; test software. Which then yells at you for having a browser open that it necessitated to start the install process.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m really saying is - I find it funny that this is deemed &quot;secure&quot; when really I suspect most people taking a test have the same emotions as myself - we just wanna get to it and get it done.')
