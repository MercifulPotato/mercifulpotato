Personally, I find it disappointing Clojure and Julia have not ended up being the same language. Both have lots of common design principles, and at the same time features I miss on each other.<p>Clojure piggybacked on the JVM to bootstrap its ecosystem, but long term I&#x27;m not sure this strategy offers a good growth path. Julia chose to go the LLVM route, and despite being a dynamic language performance is incredible. Multiple dispatch + AOT compilation on specialized methods works wonderfully well. Clojure also has multiple dispatch. They also both rely quite heavily on macros.')
