Item(by='NoOneNew', descendants=None, kids=[25510000], score=None, time=1608663980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508777, text='Hi, you can apply current corporate surveillance issues under any type of economic or government system and still have the exact same discussion of, &quot;oh woe is us, how terrible the people are up there&quot;. Or you can utilize the tools that capitalism offers everyone, even the poor.<p>We set as either public practice or into law that people own their personal data, which is not a hard stretch. Think about that for a moment. What does it mean to <i>own</i> something in a capitalist system... think... think hard... YOU CAN SELL IT! Actually license in this case, but you get the point. If you&#x27;re in the back of the class or still on the short bus, what I&#x27;m saying is this: a company can collect and sell YOUR data... for a fee. You get a percentage (or flat rate if that&#x27;s your jam) of whatever they make, in perpetuity. Let&#x27;s even classify your data as copyrighted content, just like books and other media. You do &quot;create&quot; your own data. After your death, your estate (children, etc.) get that fee as well for... I think it&#x27;s 75 years after death, or is it 50... I don&#x27;t remember how long book copyrights are. Exact number doesn&#x27;t matter, but you get the point of where I&#x27;m going.<p>But nay you say! Nay I say in return. Companies do this already. As a fond and active capitalist, I&#x27;ve made it a habit to get paid to learn new skills to great success. I&#x27;ve even held in shits so I can make sure I get paid to shit (only a few times and strictly so I can truthfully make this comment, again, you get the point). Anyways, companies do this by licensing their own data out to other companies. Now, since companies get taxed&#x2F;treated as &quot;people&quot; (USA), there is ZERO reason actual people can&#x27;t do this. Oh wait, I know why. &quot;People&quot; are better educated in the sex lives of celebrities, memes and what&#x27;s the latest pop culture, superhero show&#x2F;movie.<p>The tools to solve this issue are built into capitalism and basic western governance in the last 100 years. Hell, it&#x27;s also a decent way to redistribute wealth in a very fair method that&#x27;s hard to argue in a capitalist society. No one is &quot;overburdened&quot; by letting someone else coast on someone else&#x27;s work. Everyone thus has a &quot;product&quot; to sell in a mass format just like book publishers or movie streaming services.<p>But hey, I&#x27;m the asshole that likes real world solutions that are based on centuries old established working principles instead of unicorn fantasies that have never worked, like communism.')
