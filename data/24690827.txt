Most people I know, don&#x27;t have a traditional sound setup at home anymore and instead just use a bluetooth speaker. But the ones made for outdoor use look pretty ugly indoors, whereas the smart speakers are more designed to disappear in the home decor.<p>Personally I think, bookshelf speakers with bluetooth functionally would be a better option for most, but from what I have seen people are often not even aware of their existence and the ones with good audio as well a modern look (in case you don&#x27;t like the classical black or brown boxes) tend to be in higher price classes than the smart speakers.')
