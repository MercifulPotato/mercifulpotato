Are there politicians who are relatively honest? Sure, but while they may have loyal grass-roots support, they tend not to be the most successful and they are most definitely in the minority.<p>Most any person with a sense of political history could provide a litany of examples just for recent politicians, not to mention past eras.<p>I don&#x27;t think the main difference here is Trump&#x27;s ability to lie, though he does have an impetuous manner of speaking that makes it hard to sustain elaborate lies. I think the main difference is the willingness (or lack thereof) of people in respectable positions to cover for his lying, because he is not considered respectable.')
