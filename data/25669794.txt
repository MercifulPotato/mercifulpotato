I sit about 60~80cm away most of the time from my bigger 4K screen (due to the space needed for my Cintiq when I&#x27;m drawing). I tried several resolution after your previous comment and found 2048x1152 to have the best balance between real estate and readability at my viewing distance. I should give this a try for few days. Thank you for suggesting to have a look at the resolution!')
