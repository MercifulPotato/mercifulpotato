Very similar story to this and others shared in this thread: Use an S3 bucket for user uploads - and Google then marks the bucket as unsafe. In our case a user had clicked “Save link as...” on a Google Drive file. This saves an HTML file with the Google login page in some cases (since downloading the file requires you to be logged in). The user then proceeded to upload that HTML file. Then it was automatically marked since it looked like we were phishing the Google login page.<p>It should be noted that Firefox uses the Google banlist as well so switching browsers does not work!')
