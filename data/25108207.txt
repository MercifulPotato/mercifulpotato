Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.<p>To me this was the most curious part of the entire situation. The post briefly mentions CRLite and bloom filters; they rely on the list of all if not most valid certificates (which were impossible before CT) and it&#x27;s understandable that they are not yet widely deployed. But Apple does surely know the list of all developer certificates and can simply publish a (probably compressed) list of serial IDs of revoked developer certificates that would be otherwise valid. I don&#x27;t see a good reason to use big moving parts like OCSP here especially given the soft-fail behavior.')
