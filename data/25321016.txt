The issue is that most people wouldn&#x27;t know about it until they actually try to reproduce those results (if they can at all in the first place).<p>It is a huge issue now that machine learning has made its way into every field of research, while almost nobody has adequate training to even gauge what is and isn&#x27;t questionable. Even the grad students who end up doing all the &quot;hard work&quot; usually don&#x27;t have much of an idea of what exactly they hacked together and how to access its validity.<p>The crazy thing is that, despite all of this, you can still get ahead if you have know just slightly more buzzwords than others and have a paper or two (don&#x27;t have to be first author) to show for. At the end of the day, I suppose all of this is nothing new (machine learning practitioners are the new SEO consultants?), and I&#x27;m just venting my frustration for not being able to accept this is how things work.')
