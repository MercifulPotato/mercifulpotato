You can have markets that are almost ‘free’ but never actually ‘truly free’. There are a couple of reasons why though the most fundamental would be entropy generation.<p>There are always frictional losses for even the smallest of transactions, and if all participants have to accommodate for these losses ahead of time, or pay the penalty if not (eventually), then there is in effect path dependency to any possible market behaviour. Really, a global maxima solution of ‘truly free’ anything is unobtainable in the real world. (And even if it was achieved by happenstance, how could we tell it’s the global maxima?)<p>I imagine the actual trade off wouldn’t be the simple one dimensional spectrum either, since the problem space is obviously multi-dimensional, the ideal solution would almost certainly require multi-dimensional optimization.')
