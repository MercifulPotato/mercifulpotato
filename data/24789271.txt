I read a lot of books that aren&#x27;t from Amazon on my Kindle. I do a lot of highlighting, which I like to export to readwise.<p>In order to do this I have to plug in my Kindle. Mount it. Find the clippings file. Upload the file to readwise.<p>The best I came up with was a script that detects when I plug-in my Kindle and opens the finder window and opens the readwise page. Pretty lame.')
