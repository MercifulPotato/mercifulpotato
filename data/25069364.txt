I am looking forward to some real world numbers for different tasks in the next few weeks and months as native apps become available.<p>Jonathan Morrison posted a video [0] comparing a 10-core Intel i9 2020 5K iMac with 64GB RAM against an iPhone 12 Mini for 10-bit H.265 HDR video exporting and the iPhone <i>destroyed</i> the iMac exporting the same video, to allegedly the same quality, in ~14 seconds on the iPhone vs 2 minutes on the iMac! And the phone was at ~20% battery without an external power source. Like that is some voodoo and I want to see a lot of real world data but it is pretty damn exciting.<p>Now whether these extreme speed ups are limited to very specific tasks (such as H.265 acceleration) or are truly general purpose remains to be seen.<p>If they <i>can</i> be general purpose with some platform specific optimisations that is still freakin&#x27; amazing and could easily be a game changer for many types of work providing there is investment into optimising the tools to best utilise Apple Silicon.<p>Imagine an Apple Silicon specific version of Apple&#x27;s LLVM&#x2F;Clang that has 5x or 10x C++ compilation speed up over Intel if there is a way to optimise to similar gains they have been able to get for H.265.<p>Some very interesting things come to mind and that is before we even get to the supposed battery life benefits as well. Having a <i>laptop</i> that runs faster than my 200+W <i>desktop</i> while getting 15+ hours on battery sounds insane, and perhaps it is, but this is the most excited I have been for general purpose computer performance gains in about a decade.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xUkDku_Qt5c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xUkDku_Qt5c</a>')
