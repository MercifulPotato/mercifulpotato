For Indian food..the transition was super easy from pressure cooker to instant pot.<p>Our neighbor who moved to the East coast sent me a bag of wild rice from her state. I made a wild rice and mushroom soup in less than half an hour. The same would have been a production earlier as wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice. I was also able to make it a larger batch and freeze it for later.<p>I am used to flash freezing having worked in restaurants and I am not a fan of freezing left overs in a home freezer and probably won’t be doing this again if this fails the texture test.<p>The smaller instant pot was perfect to make a nice roux for thickening and it doesn’t burn. And clean up is a breeze.')
