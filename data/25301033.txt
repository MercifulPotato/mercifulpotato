MacOS renders fonts in a weight-and-form-correct way which makes them look blurry however. Windows renders fonts in a weight-and-form-incorrect way, which however makes them sharper and easier to read on screens, especially with resolutions below 200dpi.<p>Now if you use a high-resolution monitor and print-optimized fonts, MacOS will look better.
