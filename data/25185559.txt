We shouldn’t place one on our privacy, either.<p>You do place a price tag on a lot of your freedoms, that&#x27;s what your employers pay you for. And it&#x27;s not like people are going to be <i>forced</i> to give their data, or even forced to give all of their data, it&#x27;s entirely voluntary.<p>We either put a price tag on all user-generated content (including private data) or we abolish all intellectual property laws and copyrights.

There&#x27;s nothing else. If anything this will force companies to compete and pay them more than $0.<p>&gt; Facebook is a massive, global company with billions of users, but each user only offers Facebook a modest amount in revenue.<p>Plenty of websites would be kept alive if they could earn $28 &#x2F; year from each one of their users (hell, i &#x27;d be rich), and in fact it shows why such a scheme would be beneficial for the web and the world as a whole.<p>Privacy and attention are currently being grabbed , stolen and sold in marketplaces nowadays . It&#x27;s just so wrong to try to convince people to keep doing so.<p>This isn&#x27;t 2003, and the price of &quot;free services&quot; is no longer high enough to justify giving our data for free (by law). I don&#x27;t even understand what&#x27;s the motive behind this post, and why Hailey felt the need to support such abuses')
