The designers should have gone with classical exceptions like other languages, but instead went for fashionable-at-the-time error codes <i>and</i> added Go-style panics, which can do different things depending on a compiler switch.<p>The overall result is that everyone pays the cognitive cost of exception (spelled &quot;unwind&quot; in Rust) safety, pays the syntactic and runtime costs of error code checking, pays the runtime cost of unwind tables, and still can&#x27;t actually rely on unwinding to actually work, because anyone can just turn panics into aborts.<p>I hope for a language with Rust&#x27;s focus on memory safety but without Rust&#x27;s weird fashionable-in-the-2010s language design warts.')
