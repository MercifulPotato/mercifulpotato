But &quot;Let&#x27;s break loose from the monarchy&quot; was hardly a common public opinion before a combination of a series of writings made by an absolute handful of individuals in the group and a series of publicized bad tactical &#x2F; strategic calls made by the representatives of the British government in the Colonies.<p>(It may be difficult to tease apart cause and effect on this topic, however; consider the possibility that there are fringe thinkers pulling in <i>all</i> directions, but as circumstances change, an accident of incidents may bring some of the fringe thinkers to a position of being less fringe. People were saying police in the US were too brutal to minorities for decades before combination of ubiquitous smartphone cameras and multiple disconnected high-profile incidents that common folk considered brutality started to bring public perception around to that way of thinking. We&#x27;re in the middle of a cultural fight right now, but if policing as it&#x27;s done in the US <i>does</i> fundamentally change, history will probably record a story of Black Lives Matter leaders bringing about that change. And if it doesn&#x27;t change, this era of US history will probably hold a place in history books similar to the one the LA riots hold).')
