Workers are paid for their labor power, not the value they produce.<p>&gt; If it makes economic sense for you to pay me $100k, making that conditional on where I live is just a jerk move.<p>Like laws of motion, the economic system we have naturally leads to exploiting this disparity.<p>&gt; In practice I wouldn&#x27;t do this. I&#x27;d simply walk away from a company that uses this offensive hiring practice on me.<p>Extend this to the labor pool at large. Some people have the ability to walk away from these practices while others don&#x27;t. Ask yourself who has this ability and who doesn&#x27;t and if this is the outcome we want.')
