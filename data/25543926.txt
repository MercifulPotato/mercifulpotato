The quote is pulled from the final paragraph of this EFF blog post:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;googles-amp-canonical-web-and-importance-web-standards-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;googles-amp-canonical-...</a><p>That post also doesn&#x27;t really explain, but justifies its position by linking to the AMP blog:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.amp.dev&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;13&#x2F;amps-new-horizons&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.amp.dev&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;13&#x2F;amps-new-horizons&#x2F;</a><p>That page is basically trumpeting the massive adoption of AMP.  So my read here is that the author is viewing this a bit like Flash: yes, we could kill it, but it would take years, because of the billions of pages that use it, as well as the custom markup it uses, along with the unique caching structure discussed in the EFF post.<p>I don&#x27;t find that particularly compelling, but I can see the reasoning. It may be a case where it would be possible to just redirect all traffic away from AMP, but that would kill page speed, and therefore search ranking, for those using it.  Theoretically possible? Sure. Practical? Possibly not.')
