Fellow JS developers, please, for the love of all that&#x27;s good, stop using const for everything. If you want a strongly typed language with immutable variables, just go use another language already. Just use let unless you actually need a const.<p>(I don&#x27;t care if I get a million down votes, I really don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re all misusing const and you know it. It&#x27;s a shitty hack turned into a fad by someone who didn&#x27;t understand the language.)')
