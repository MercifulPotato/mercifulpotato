If you take a contract for $500, whether you pay 15% or 25% depends among other things on whether you take a totally different contract with an independent party which pushes you into a higher bracket. It makes every transaction depend on every other one rather than allowing them to be independent, and requires a corresponding invasion of privacy to ensure compliance. Compare this to where the taxes are deducted by the employer without even having to disclose who the employee is to the tax authority, and a total elimination of tax paperwork on the part of the employee.<p>It also creates arbitrage opportunities to minimize the rate, e.g. hiring your nephew who is in a lower tax bracket and then deducting his wages as an expense from your own taxes even though the money remains in your family.')
