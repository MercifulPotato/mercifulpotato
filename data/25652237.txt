Item(by='Simulacra', descendants=None, kids=[25653034], score=None, time=1609886534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650224, text='My father tried to introduce me to programing when I was 12, BASIC, but it didn&#x27;t go well, nor did it go well when I tried to learn every subsequent language. Being ADHD I needed instant gratification with minimal effort, to pull me deeper in so I wouldn&#x27;t bounce to the next thing. Programing was chaotic, hard to keep straight, and frustrating because my ego wouldn&#x27;t let me say &quot;hey, you don&#x27;t have all the answers, let&#x27;s go figure out what we&#x27;re missing.&quot;<p>So my advice: Help him to understand that when an answer to a problem is not visible, it doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s dumb, etc. It means he doesn&#x27;t have the right puzzle piece of information, and needs to find it first. (i.e. a formula, code block, etc.) Be ok with not knowing the answer, and be ok that he will need to learn in order to apply knowledge (like puzzle pieces) to the problem.')
