This nudges Haskell libraries in a slightly different direction, e.g. making more use of control structures like monads, arrows, continuations, etc. which authors in other languages wouldn&#x27;t reach for so readily. This has an effect on the ecosystem, since people want their systems and libraries to be compatible with each other&#x27;s APIs.<p>The result is that &quot;the Haskell way&quot; can seem a little more intimidating than the more &quot;pragmatic&quot; approach of MLs.<p>(I write this as someone who writes a lot of Haskell, and dabbles in StandardML!)')
