The odds that there&#x27;s some trivial win that will accelerate the code by huge amounts is fairly decent.<p>I&#x27;ve found that a profiler isn&#x27;t even needed to find significant wins in most codebases. Simple inspection of the code and removal of obviously slow or inefficient code paths can often lead to huge performance gains.')
