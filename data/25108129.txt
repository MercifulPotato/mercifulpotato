Item(by='trevorishere', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605502077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104828, text='The article is obviously old and out of date (i.e. MAX_PATH, given you don&#x27;t mention Office...) and at times incorrect (i.e. NT kernel performance where async I&#x2F;O has historically been better than the various Linux implementations -- io_uring excluded as I haven&#x27;t seen any comparisons).<p>I&#x27;ll give my highly subjective experience. I used Fedora 3x on a X1 Carbon gen 7 and it was not awesome. While I had a highly customizable UI via KDE Plasma, the font always felt off. I had issues directly attributed to Wayland (screen sharing in apps), though I could have gone back to X11.<p>Eventually I switched to Gnome and the UI was just frustrating from a UX standpoint. The UI lacked so many options to make it more flexible, though some frustrations were taken care of by extensions.<p>For either DE, if I didn&#x27;t want to use Firefox, many types of media were unavailable, including certain videos in YouTube due to lack of included libraries. Some of those libraries were available in 3rd party builds, but given the security sensitive nature of browsers, that felt risky.<p>Performance was fine and the apps I needed were available.<p>Overall, application in each DE felt more crash-prone. This was true of the updater for the Gnome app store, too.<p>More than a couple of times I would have odd graphical issues occur in both KDE Plasma and Gnome. A couple examples were font-related issues (incorrect font despite being set correctly in settings) and window-color issues. The Gnome app store window was in dark mode while the rest of the DE wasn&#x27;t. Oh and lack of DE-wide mouse scrolling on windows was a bit frustrating. I had to get a plugin for Chromium but never found a DE-wide solution.<p>I was tired of Windows on a laptop, so I did end up buying a MBP, which was my first Mac since my PowerBook G4. MBP does everything I need for personal use and as a development playground, plus generally stable apps. I still use Win 10 on a P1 for work and of course have a desktop for gaming, primarily.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see from a DE is to be highly integrated into the system. We&#x27;ve seen successful implementations via Windows and Mac (classic and OS X&#x2F;11), and perhaps the not-so-commercial success, BeOS. Many of the Linux DEs &quot;feel&quot; tacked-on.<p>With that said, I run unbound and haproxy on a handful of Linux VMs where they work wonders and I&#x27;ve had zero issues with stability, etc.<p>All-in-all my Fedora 3x experience was just OK. It felt rough around many, though not all edges. App crash was more than I&#x27;d see using the same apps on Windows (and now macOS).<p>There were other things that irritated me; lack of fingerprint reader support and lack of a Bitlocker-style solution (no password on boot) available.<p>Again, my experiences, my impressions. They could all be wrong.')
