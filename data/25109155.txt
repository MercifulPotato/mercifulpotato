Not that a single number can define how smart a person is relative to another, but instead how my own cognitive ability is doing.<p>I had been using the game of 2048, but given the random element and how easy the game is, it&#x27;s just not a great measure anymore. I have recently started a different diet and I want some measurable way of knowing how well my own brain is affected by it.<p>The only real problem with chess as a measurement is that if you do the online games for example you get cheaters, etc. Does this detriment your ranking or do people generally find this not to be a problem?')
