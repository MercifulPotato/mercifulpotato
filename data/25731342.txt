Item(by='bArray', descendants=None, kids=[25731499], score=None, time=1610383035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730145, text='One reason not to trust TLS is that it&#x27;s one system that you want to be secure for all your users - indefinitely. If in the future there was some method to crack the TLS or the appropriate keys&#x2F;certs were leaked, any recorded traffic could be retroactively cracked.<p>Remember also it wasn&#x27;t so long ago we were talking about things such as POODLE attacks. For all we know, some bad implementation of TLS 1.3 could default to some crappy easy to crack algorithm.<p>I believe there was a paper (can&#x27;t find it now) that speculated about the cost to crack a specific TLS setup to be about $10 million USD in processing, going back some years. (I think it was in reference to some half of VPN traffic at the time using the same keys.) If Moore&#x27;s law still applies in any sense, that cost likely halves every two years and people only really change their passwords if they have to.<p>Another reason is that it reduces risk server side if you are never handling user passwords - at worst an attacker gets a temporary hash that&#x27;s valid for a short time, specific to that server. Maybe they can do some harm during that time, but you can ultimately revoke that key and undo the changes to the user&#x27;s accounts.')
