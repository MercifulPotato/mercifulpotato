I have zero regrets for the time I spent there. I met a lot of great people. It was a great place to start out in my career because of the abundant job opportunities. The weather was fantastic.<p>Of course SF is not to everyone&#x27;s taste, and maybe you are indeed better off for never having lived there. But for all of its recent problems, there were good reasons that people continued to move there in droves.
