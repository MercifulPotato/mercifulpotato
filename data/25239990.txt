I avoid Electron based apps like the plague, and with being able to run iPad&#x2F;iOS apps on the M1, I&#x27;ve been able to cut down even further since things like Authy are way faster to launch when they aren&#x27;t large Chrome based hogs.<p>iOS apps on the Mac are a game changer for me. The UX isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, but it sure is better than web apps, which are very often slow, resource intensive and kill your battery. I haven&#x27;t touched the Twitter web app since I&#x27;ve installed the iOS&#x2F;Catalyst app on my Mac. Even with its iOS-optimized user interface, the better performance of the iOS app makes it so much more enjoyable than the web version.<p>I&#x27;m very much looking forward to seeing other iOS apps arrive on the Mac, to replace their web variants.<p>There&#x27;s really something to be said about how web developers have been killing the performance of their websites with their bloated frameworks or whatever. I know web apps will always be at a performance disadvantage compared to native apps, but the performance regression has gotten absurd. Using Reddit via the Apollo iOS app is a quick and buttery smooth experience, meanwhile the redesigned Reddit webpage is a laggy stuttering mess on my MacBook Pro.')
