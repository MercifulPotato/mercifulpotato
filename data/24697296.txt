The classic example comes from the origin of derivatives - to forward-hedge risks in commodities.<p>Say I am a farmer. I buy seed and 9 months later wil harvest my crop and sell my produce.  So I am very exposed today to the price where I will be able to sell my crop at this future point in time. In ancient Babylon they came up with the idea of what we would today call a physical commod forward to hedge this risk. The farmer sells a contract today promising to deliver the crop they will harvest in nine months time. This gives them price certainty so they are able to invest today in the seed to grow this crop.<p>Most derivatives have a similar real-world risk mitigation function and to compensate people for taking the risk, the other side of these trades has a speculative profit potential.<p>There have been numerous studies on the effect of derivatives (and the absence of derivatives) on the markets in the underlyings.  Generally the presence of a derivs market tends to reduce volatility in the underlying. For example in the US futures trading in onions is not allowed (for historical reasons) so there are studies comparing the market in onions to similar agricultural products with a derivs market.<p>Edit: note I&#x27;m talking about &quot;normal&quot; derivs here, ie derivatives of Equities, fixed income, currencies or commodities. I don&#x27;t have any experience of cryptocurrencies or derivs of them nor do I have an opinion on the value of derivs of cryptocurrencies.')
