So I&#x27;m happy to buy equities at a discount!<p>I&#x27;ll be less happy when I&#x27;m in the selling phase of my investment life(i.e. retired), but by then my % in equities will not be as high as they are now, so it won&#x27;t matter as much if a crash occurs as I&#x27;ll have much better downside protection(i.e. safe assets).')
