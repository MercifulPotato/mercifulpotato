They are a useful design pattern that is utilized in Java.<p>A separate factory type means you have to write twice as much code for no real benefit. In most languages you&#x27;d just use a first-class function (and in post-8 Java you can do the same: rather than a FooFactory you accept a Supplier&lt;Foo&gt; and people can pass ::Foo . It&#x27;s still more cumbersome than in most languages though). Or, in a lot of other cases, the factory is just a clunky way to achieve named arguments.<p>&gt; My anecdotal evidence is that I have never seen the over-engineered &quot;Enterprise Java horrors&quot; OP is talking about despite working in the Java EE (now Jakarta EE) space.<p>Have you worked on a reputable codebase in a low-overhead language like Python or Ruby? If you don&#x27;t recognise factories as bloat then you may well miss the other cases (famously, the majority of the Gang of Four patterns can just be replaced by passing a function).')
