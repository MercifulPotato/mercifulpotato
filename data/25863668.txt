The world is pretty unjust at a basic level and if you&#x27;re waiting for someone to acknowledge your excellence and land a big payday in your lap you&#x27;ll be waiting for a long time.<p>A big piece of career advice I have for any folks that feel like they&#x27;re in dead-ends or are just getting started is that, in modern society, you should be constantly expending time and energy to ensure you&#x27;re in the most personally rewarding position - the world is a cruel place where the socially awkward and introverted have a constant uphill battle to not be exploited.<p>Oh and we&#x27;re all super lucky to be in tech because in a lot of other fields there is just no way to advance yourself.')
