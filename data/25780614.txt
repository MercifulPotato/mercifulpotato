For example, would PG suggest changing HN&#x27;s rules so that Sci-Hub is a first-class source of articles? This very submission notes that it is not just from &quot;twitter.com&quot;, but from &quot;twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&quot;, so there&#x27;s no technical obstacle to this functionality. Similarly, would PG suggest changing HN&#x27;s rules so that links to paywalled sites are automatically replaced with links to unpaywalled versions?<p>FWIW I am in favor of all of this, but I am not really sure that PG actually wants to follow through; rather, this is a bland partisan position statement meant to allow PG to say in the future that they have always been a big supporter of Sci-Hub.')
