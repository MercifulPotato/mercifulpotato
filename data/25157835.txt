Make the project open source will help me in a future job application. In my country (Spain), companys value more your personal projects than whatever you made in your four years of college.<p>The app will be part of my final college project so, badly or well I will have to do it. However, the app may not be used by the organization, but I want to produce an useful app in case they want to use it.<p>Thanks!')
