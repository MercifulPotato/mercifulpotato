Just prohibit anyone from restricting users from using alternative app stores or sideloading their own apps. It&#x27;s the opposite of making it a utility -- it&#x27;s ensuring that competition exists.<p>&gt;  I don&#x27;t think it will come from &quot;the smartphone&quot; market which has already been won. It will come by some disruptor that eats into adjacencies: AR, VR, wearables, etc.<p>You also have the problem that the successor need not be any better. If one of those things replaces the smartphone, but the new incumbent still restricts users in what apps they can install, unseating the old incumbents hasn&#x27;t actually solved the problem.<p>&gt; Alibaba group, Facebook, Valve, Tencent, Huawei, Amazon, and Microsoft.<p>Microsoft and Amazon already tried and failed, and none of those others are as big or even making an attempt.<p>&gt; I think most users are broadly aware that Apple control things and take a cut.<p>They&#x27;re vaguely aware that it happens, but not of what that means to them. The opaque and arbitrary criteria they use for rejections, or the implications for app price and quality of transferring wealth from small developers to the world&#x27;s largest corporation. So it feels like somebody else&#x27;s problem. And when Apple and Google both do it, something they have no meaningful choice in regardless.<p>&gt; So does every other platform provider though. Publishers and retailers can&#x27;t discount Nintendo switch games unless Nintendo approves it. This goes back 40 years to Atari.<p>And they should prohibit the lot of it. It was never different, it had just never been big enough to matter this much, because before it was only games and not <i>everything</i>.<p>&gt; I think the bigger issue is if users actually <i>prefer</i> the current curated arrangement.<p>Which we could find out if the vertical integration was removed and the users could choose a curated store or not, independent of which phone they buy.')
