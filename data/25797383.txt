Every single other language I use starts at 0.<p>But what I have seen is that, starting from 1 felt weird to me for approximately 1 hour, tops. After that, it was no more or less of a switching challenge than switching between semicolon languages and non-semicolon languages. In other words, no big deal. And, once I got over it, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I actually have <i>fewer</i> off-by-one errors in Lua than I do in other languages. Because the author is right: No matter how much professional experience I have starting with 0, starting with 1 is still the more innate way of thinking.<p>Also, my single biggest all time source of off by one errors is translating between mathematical notation and code in a 0-based language. That fact alone is cause for me to hope that Julia might one day supplant Python for data work.')
