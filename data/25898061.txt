In most cases, these mappings are a direct reflection of the associated domain objects, so the result is a bit verbose but still works nicely because you can easily version them as your model definition evolves over time.<p>I was under the impression that having an interface between models and JSON serialization was commonplace, given the popularity of marshmallow library in Python. Is this not the case in other languages and ecosystems?')
