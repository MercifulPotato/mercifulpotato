I would routinely email him, both as a bit of CYA, but also because his schedule didn&#x27;t jive with mine.  Owner would come out sometimes and get irate that we were emailing vs &quot;just talk to each other - you&#x27;re sitting right here!&quot;.  But... I didn&#x27;t want to interrupt the other guy.  In fact, I got better results by emailing - more details, could follow up as needed, and he would respond with &#x27;done&#x27; so there was an actual log of the interactions.  When I&#x27;d just lean over and interrupt him, everything was slower and worse.  The &#x27;2 minute&#x27; things rarely were 2 minutes, and would take away time from what he was doing.  If we met in the lunchroom... yeah, I might say &quot;hey, I&#x27;m going to need X&quot;... and he&#x27;d say &quot;email the details&quot;.')
