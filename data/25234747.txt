Instead you can have a horrendously complex product with all A-Z features, or you can live without some features.<p>To address this, I&#x27;ve been developing a framework I call Web Widgets. These are mini web-apps that run completely in the browser, but send data back to SQLite files on the server. Because the server is pretty simple, it can host a wide variety of apps, so users can build their own tools using only JS+HTML code. I&#x27;ve used Widgets for fitness, diet tracking, personal productivity, mood tracking, and even learning Chinese characters. I am now opening up the system so it can be used by other people, if you are interested check out this page:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danburfoot.net&#x2F;widgets&#x2F;main.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danburfoot.net&#x2F;widgets&#x2F;main.html</a><p>I am offering free accounts, free tech support, and even free development for early adopters.')
