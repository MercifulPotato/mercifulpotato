By the 1840s, however, it became clear that the answer to transportation was going to be the railroad, and terminating at the Ohio River made no sense; the real target was the western entrep√¥ts such as Chicago.<p>From the perspective of the major NE railroads, the New York Central traveled through the same Mohawk Gap that the Erie Canal uses, and then travel along the south bank of Lake Erie. The Pennsylvania Railroad followed the route of the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal system, that traveled Philadelphia-Pittsburgh via Altoona.<p>The B&amp;O (originating from a state that had no access to the Ohio River) tried playing off Virginia and Pennsylvania against each other, but Pennsylvania stopped playing ball when it committed to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Virginia forced the B&amp;O to pick Wheeling over Parkersburg to make it harder for B&amp;O to bridge the Ohio River and push on to Chicago. (The B&amp;O would eventually reach Parkersburg, cross the Ohio there, and continue to Chicago, but this happened a generation later).<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike was based on the route of the South Pennsylvania Railroad, which was never built.')
