Semicolons can be used at the REPL to suppress printing, but actual Julia code does not normally use semicolons.<p>I personally like the &quot;end&quot;s because I like the symmetry and they&#x27;re prettier than curly braces. Also, there are some syntax color themes that color the &quot;end&quot;s in a darker color in order to de-emphasize the &quot;end&quot;s, which can be nice depending on your taste.')
