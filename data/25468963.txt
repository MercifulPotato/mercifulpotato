At the point that a strike is happening Iâ€™m not sure the union is having much success negotiating with the hospital over something that should be basic, obvious and mutually beneficial.\nOne of the big complaints that people have about Unions (under US law) is that they do not really care so much about employee welfare as much as some specific set of bargaining points. The union just adds another large bureaucracy that you personally have minimal bargaining power with. (Last unionized job I had actually negotiated a salary decrease for us but claimed some ideological win over facilities). I feel like something closer to employee ownership&#x2F;cooperative business models are a better approach to providing for human needs, and to that effect the NLRA should really be reworked.')
