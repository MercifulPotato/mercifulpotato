However I don&#x27;t need them. What I need is screen sharing in Slack, Meet and TeamViewer and that works with X. I also occasionally need Skype, Webex, Zoom, Jitsi and Teams. They also work with X. I&#x27;m confident that any random system my customers throw at me will work with X if it&#x27;s advertised to work on Linux. Not so much if I were running Wayland.<p>If X would stop working this morning I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to go back to Windows, after 11 years, and use WSL2. Not a future I&#x27;m looking forward to and not something I&#x27;d thank the Wayland community for.')
