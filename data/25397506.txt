Didn&#x27;t know you can limit memory to processes. Ubuntu doesn&#x27;t handle out of memory at all. The whole system just locks up and freezes (at least on 20.04)<p>Like you say, it doesn&#x27;t release memory so I need to restart periodically. If I forget then I need to do a hard restart when the system locks up (sometimes loosing work :&#x2F;)<p>It seems strange.. it used to handle hundred of open tabs just fine and now it&#x27;s completely crippled. My guess is that in making the browser faster they cache more and more - and Firefox devs prolly run on fancy machines with tons of RAM.')
