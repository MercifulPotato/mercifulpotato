Our election system is far too decentralized to allowed for large-scale, coordinated election interference to be viable while also being covert.<p>I also believe that there was likely an uptick in rule-bending across the board. This was in no way a &#x27;normal election&#x27;, given the mass-adoption of mail-in voting, and heightened polarization of our political environment.<p>Unfortunately, the US has shown a remarkable lack of historical introspection with respect to election integrity, so it&#x27;s impossible to tell with any certainty whether this is truly the case since it&#x27;s I believe it&#x27;s safe to assume a low level of fraud in an election at the scale of the American federal election, with so heavily federated a system.<p>The doubts people have aren&#x27;t entirely unfounded, and YouTube making an executive decision to perish the thought on their platform only adds fuel to the fire.')
