See my other response upthread.<p><i>&gt; they will always be able to observe the external universe</i><p>But the light coming to them from the external universe will be more and more redshifted, and they can calculate from the observed redshift when they have crossed the horizon.<p>Also, they will only see a limited portion of the future of the universe; anything that happens later than a fairly short time after they cross the horizon, they will never see, because they will hit the singularity inside the hole before light from such events can reach them.')
