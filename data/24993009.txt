It&#x27;s also hard to see anyone see this guy and how he presents himself and think, &quot;wow, what a cool dude! I wish I could be more like him!&quot; Like on a purely personal level, there are people in the tech world who think this is someone who has done well at life and they&#x27;d like being friends with him and spending time with him if only they could. This guy is and always has been the Icy Hot Stuntaz of the hacker world and it&#x27;s super revealing when people seem to default to being on his side because they think he&#x27;s like &quot;one of us&quot; or whatever.<p>I have no problem with people arguing about the pros and cons of copyright law and where the lines should be drawn and who&#x27;s responsible for what, but it&#x27;s really hard to take anyone seriously who thinks Kim Dotcom of all people seems like a pretty cool guy.
