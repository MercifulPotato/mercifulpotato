We are not a software company so we do not use deep algorithm testing as part of our evaluation process.<p>Most applicants (probably 80% or more) have a computer science or information systems 4 year BS degree.  The other 20% typically have a STEM degree with some programming courses or experience.  Probably 20%-30% have some type of graduate degree as well - we sometimes have career changers who have picked up a MS in computer science from some coursework-only MS program at a small school.<p>My experience has been that of that candidate pool, we will have 3-6 candidates with well documented programming projects or job experience.  These tend to be the candidates we interview - we use a simple rubric with yes&#x2F;no for 5-10 categories we evaluate.  The categories are broad (&quot;Has this candidate written code in either personal projects or previous employment?&quot;) and minimally skill-specific.  We do tend to have some bias towards database (SQL) skills and some hands-on experience with Linux, but not specific &quot;hard&quot; requirements for either (don&#x27;t care if MS SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, or Debian vs Ubuntu vs CentOS, etc).<p>We have had success with non-traditional candidates - we have team members with backgrounds ranging from BS in History to PhD in Bioinformatics, so we aren&#x27;t super-credential sensitive.<p>All these details seem to add up to a rather stark observation - there is <i>NO</i> shortage of highly qualified applicants for these types of jobs.  Our geographic region has many tech employers so we aren&#x27;t the only option for job seekers.  We probably aren&#x27;t even in the top 25% of employers for salary in our area.<p>Candidates with only three months of training are just not going to be successful getting to the front of the hiring line in the deeper pools of applicants we get.')
