Item(by='notahacker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611760327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928777, text='The original comic is pretty clear that it&#x27;s the <i>repeated</i> attempts to engage with someone clearly uninterested in debate &quot;Aha! A whole day has passed and you have provided no evidence of the superior performance of Ruby on the other thread.&quot; that marks the sealions out. The other side to the comic is that the original throwaway remark sounds a bit hard to justify, <i>until we see the sealions</i>. Anybody who&#x27;s ever made a throwaway remark about how X is like a  cult or Y has obsessive fanboys and got bogged down in replies from people politely insisting <i>actually we&#x27;re completely normal, now please refute all 27 points about why X and Y are better</i>  can relate...<p>Also its a Godwin-law type internet regularity, not a cast iron behavioural rule. Sometimes making comparisons to Nazis or calling out serial posters of provocative statements is actually appropriate')
