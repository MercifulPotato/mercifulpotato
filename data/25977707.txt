The average person can not run anything because software is black magic to them. If you meant the average knowledgeable computer engineer (or similar, as opposed to a large org), then you are simply wrong.<p>I&#x27;m running a Synapse instance for ~25 people (friends and family). We are federated and joined to many large rooms. Synapse is using about 400-600M memory (RSS, varies depending on circumstances) and about 8-10% CPU. This is all on a 2 core Hetzner VPS which costs less than 20 USD per month.')
