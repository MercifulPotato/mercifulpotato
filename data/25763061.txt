Some of it was doubtless Intel convincing themselves they could make it work. But they were also under a lot of pressure from Microsoft who didn&#x27;t have confidence that they could do SMP effectively--at least that&#x27;s what a certain Intel CTO told me. (Ironically, multi-core didn&#x27;t end up being nearly the issue a lot of people were wringing hands over at the time thought it would be for various reasons.)')
