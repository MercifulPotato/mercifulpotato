The article actually hints that this is default for many people whether they realise it or not, because of newspapers and books.  When was the last time you read a book with pages wider than they were tall?<p>On my screen, side-by-side terminals snap to 69 columns, but I can easily have 132 columns take up the whole width, and just use top-by-bottom to compare.  As it is, I don&#x27;t have a huge monitor, anyway, so I tend to use workspaces to give me more room, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there as far as this argument goes.')
