And anyone can vote on answers. Quite often a better answer will get more upvotes than the approved one, and readers (should) definitely skim for that. Sometimes the best piece of info is in a comment, and even that is quite OK visible as long as people vote for it.<p>The karma system also rewards upvotes more than approved answer in practice, since just 3 votes will be more karma than approved answer.')
