None says it was developed by the foundation.<p>&gt; Developing yet another Ethereum wallet when there are so many on the market would be a waste.<p>&gt; It’s better for the foundation to provide a list of high quality wallets that already exist.<p>What would you think of me if I raised $18M to build a non-profit children&#x27;s hospital and then used it to instead build a website which lists children&#x27;s hospitals which were built by other people, most of which being for-profit companies, some even proclaiming themselves as registered in shady tax-haven countries, and most not even clearly showing where their company is registered?')
