It&#x27;s only when the electorate is split this evenly and the stakes are this high that people begin to pay attention.<p>The voices that are being suppressed for example on Youtube are not fringe radical conspiracists; they&#x27;re more mainstream conservatives (who are nonetheless tarred unfairly as &quot;fringe&quot;), people like Mark Dice, Anthony Brian Logan, Candace Owens, Tim Pool, and many others.<p>I suppose when a platform gets a billion views a day, it can afford to piss off some elements and the bottom line will not be affected.  But it is creating ill will, calls for boycott, and eventually an echo chamber effect that does not bode well for dialogue and tolerance.<p>Look what Reddit did, for example:  they shut down TheDonald which was the largest, or one of the largest, subreds with 800,000 participants.  The participants dumped Reddit and forked their own reddit-like site, TheDonald.win which began small but has grown enormously.')
