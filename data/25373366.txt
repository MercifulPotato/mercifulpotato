They&#x27;d been trying to fill it all year. They&#x27;re now going to hire for it in their UK branch office (not London). By having the role in the UK will breach the EU regulations for the role in question - I don&#x27;t know what their medium-long-term plans are though. It&#x27;s a shit situation when you literally &quot;can&#x27;t find the staff&quot;.')
