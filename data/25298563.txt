I&#x27;m not sure if they went there to die because Yahoo! didn&#x27;t know how to grow them further, or because, as cool as they were, there wasn&#x27;t actually that great of a business in the first place. Maybe being courted by Yahoo! should have been the sign to take the Google deal because Yahoo! being interested in you isn&#x27;t a good sign.')
