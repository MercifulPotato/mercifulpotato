This leads to very annoying cookie consent popups. Is anybody else here frustrated by them?<p>I&#x27;m semi-seriously considering launching an EU citizens&#x27; initiative to fix this. Here&#x27;s how it can work: The EU directive responsible for the cookie popups is (afaict) 2009&#x2F;136&#x2F;EC, par. (66). It says cookie acceptance can be a browser setting but does not give details. The EU initiative could extend this to say web operators must respect the &quot;Do Not Track&quot; header.<p>Do Not Track is a special header that browsers can send to say &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be tracked&quot; or &quot;I agree to being tracked&quot;. It already exists in some browsers - but hardly any web site honors it. If the EU directive would mention that DNT must be honored, then web sites would have no further need to display their consent popups when the header is set.<p>My problem is that such an initiative would likely require a huge time investment. It needs 1M signatures. That would likely be very hard work.<p>If the response here is overwhelmingly positive, I might be more inclined to throw myself at this problem. Please upvote or comment if you think this might be worthwhile.')
