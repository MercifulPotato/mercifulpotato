It has a peak of 120kw which is 161 hp. For comparison, the engine in a classic mini is 40hp or less.<p>Iâ€™m not super involved in the mini scene, but own a classic Beetle. These old cars are super lightweight, so 40-60hp is pretty peppy as it is (although top speed is limited due to the 4 speed transmissions). 107 hp is gonna be crazy in a mini.')
