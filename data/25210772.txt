At the same time I find political topics all the time on the front page that are deemed fine as long as they stay away from the above topics or are leaning &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s been three weeks and I still can&#x27;t use Instagram. They are still blocking #hashtag-recent-lists with a banner:\n&quot;Recent posts from all hashtags are temporarily hidden to help prevent the spread of possible false information and harmful content related to the election.&quot;\nThe hashtag I used to check is #handtoolwookworking. Very political indeed.')
