From what I&#x27;ve heard the Nexus 10 perhaps is a notable exception where the available alternate batteries aren&#x27;t very good; mine needs a new battery but I don&#x27;t really use it enough to justify one plus it&#x27;s a somewhat more involved process than just popping it out.<p>I&#x27;m still using a Note 3 from 2013, it&#x27;s on its third battery (though the second probably could have been fine another year or more). I also recently upgraded it to Android 10 (LineageOS) -- the last supported Android OS was 5. It&#x27;s a small pain to backup and restore, it&#x27;s nicer to have a simple OS upgrade that preserves apps&#x2F;data, but it&#x27;s a viable option for many old devices. It&#x27;s enough choice for me to decide between trying to limp along with outdated software (many random app crashes went away after upgrading), upgrading the OS yourself, and buying a new device.')
