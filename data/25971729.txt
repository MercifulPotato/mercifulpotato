I purchased over $200 worth of product from corsair.com with free shipping, but one item was defective (RGB mousepad regularly kills my entire USB stack every few hours - it&#x27;s either defective or incompatible with my motherboard) and the cost to return it from Georgia -&gt; California via USPS for RMA&#x2F;refund is nearly a third of the item&#x27;s price since Corsair doesn&#x27;t pay for return shipping.')
