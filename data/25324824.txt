Either this would have to be fairly high power, i.e. physically large, or it would have a high gain antenna (also large). If the power is low, it&#x27;d have to be close to the victim, like in the same room. The other problem is how do you hide the antenna? It can&#x27;t sit in a van because the metal exterior would attenuate it.')
