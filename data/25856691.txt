Item(by='MrPatan', descendants=None, kids=[25856721, 25858425, 25861491], score=None, time=1611217339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25850739, text='This is HN, I&#x27;m going to kill a joke instead:<p>There is the classic:<p>There are only two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things... and off-by-one errors!<p>Ha ha ha<p>I hate this joke.  It takes one of the most insightful things ever said about the profession, makes it into a joke that isn&#x27;t even that good, and now the only thing you rememebr about it is the punchline.<p>Let&#x27;s break it down:<p>- Cache invalidation: State management! Distributed systems! This really gets to the core of what&#x27;s hard. This is <i>the</i> only technical problem.  For everything else you will have all the information you need at hand and it&#x27;s a matter of getting the machine to do your bidding.<p>- Naming things: Communication! Dealing with people, whether it&#x27;s you in the future or somebody else in the present is not a technical problem, but it is an even more important problem.  It&#x27;s unsolved.  You will need to practice, think, fail, try more, and it&#x27;s not even guaranteed to succeed. People are like that.  It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>So there you have it.  Probably the most insightful thing said about our job in less than fifteen words, and if you hear it, the &quot;joke&quot; immediately makes you think about the punchline, robbing you of the opportunity of reflecting about it.')
