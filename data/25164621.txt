It&#x27;s why cars and bikes have suspension. What do you think pushes against a gas shock? Vertical force. This wheel captures that force in a spring and dissipates it through torque instead of just compressing gas in a cylinder. I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>This dude just reinvented the wheel.<p>My only question is how effective it actually is. 30% is a lot.')
