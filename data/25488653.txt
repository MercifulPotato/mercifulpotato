It seems to work well. Depending on how resource intensive the video analysis is, you could have several cameras being analyzed by a single mini computer (Atom based $100). That might be slightly cheaper than a single Pi per camera.<p>Also, where are you finding those PoE switches?! I was looking for 8 port ones just a few months ago and they were about $50 for cheap ones and at least $80 for brand names.')
