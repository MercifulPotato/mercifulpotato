Now people are more privacy conscious (which is a good thing). Personally I like to get my analytics from AWStats[0] which offers a really raw look at your visitors and even allows you to see each visitor along with attached metadata like useragent, timestamp etc. I like the fact AWStats is not a traditional analytics application, but specifically a log-file-analyzer and it even captures those users who have JS disabled who are trying to avoid analytics scripts.<p>As for the privacy of AWStats: people are going to leave behind logs, no matter what you do to avoid that. It&#x27;s a fact of life of the web. What is more invasive of privacy would be recording the mouse or keystrokes using some JS; that&#x27;s where I draw the line.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.awstats.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.awstats.org&#x2F;</a>')
