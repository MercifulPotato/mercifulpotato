I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’re going to the Capitol,” said Mr. Trump. “We’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;trump-tells-rioters-i-know-how-you-feel-draws-bipartisan-condemnation-11609977209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;trump-tells-rioters-i-know-how-...</a><p>I&#x27;m going to presume the WSJ did their work properly and you can watch him say those words in this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8X0KIYInLHc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8X0KIYInLHc</a> - that&#x27;s a 70 minute long speech claiming (not in the exact words) &quot;we have been defrauded!&quot; and then saying those words. Make a less-than-intelligent, not-shy-to-use-violence (should I cite the demographics of Trump voters for you?), crowd mad and then tell them &quot;We&#x27;re going to go there and give them a piece of our mind.&quot;, geez, what do you expect was going to happen?<p>No, he never uttered &quot;I want you to go there and beat up the cops with anything you find, break the windows, vandalize the building, and terrorize those lawmakers so they put me back into power.&quot;, he&#x27;s smart enough to never explicitly say things that will get him in trouble, just like the 11780 phone call or asking Comey to back off from Michael Flynn.')
