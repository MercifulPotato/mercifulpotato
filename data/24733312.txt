Let&#x27;s say that all of the major social media platforms ban any discussion of raising their taxes, or enacting more regulation on them, or let&#x27;s say they straight up ban major politicians from the platform.<p>Oh, and also there is no other significant competitor that matters, and it is unlikely that any competitors will pop up anytime soon.<p>Are you just OK with that? You are just going to say &quot;well, I guess it is their platform, and they can do what they want, and it doesn&#x27;t matter that no competitor has any significant chance of being successful&quot;.<p>&gt; They only control their one platform, they don&#x27;t control the internet<p>Ok, now what is almost all of the major platforms do it, and there are no serious competitors?<p>Let&#x27;s expand this out even further. What if Walmart did the same thing? Along with multiple other grocery stores.<p>You want to raise their taxes, well sorry, you probably aren&#x27;t going to be able to buy food from any major grocery store.<p>Or how about if common carrier laws were removed and your power company did it?
