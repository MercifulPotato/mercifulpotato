Item(by='herewulf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604169164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951311, text='&gt; although the SVG format has an excellent support for hatch patterns (anything can become a hatch pattern, even bitmap images), the Qt implementation of the SVG format lacks support for it (it has its own system but it&#x27;s not very practical to make that compatible with SVG). Therefore at the moment we have no clear idea of how to go further.<p>This makes me sad. I&#x27;ve worked on quite a few commercial engineering projects over the years where one GUI toolkit has been taken up after another and then discarded because of various limitations, particularly the difficulty of solid integration with 3D viewports. Most of the projects have been research projects that only lasted a few years but we&#x27;ve been through wxWidgets, WPF, Qt, JavaFx, now React &amp; friends and none of them have left us saying &quot;hey, let&#x27;s use that same one next time&quot;.<p>I wonder if these types of engineering applications would be much better off going the Blender route and rolling their own GUI, or using a GUI which puts rendering first. I&#x27;m reminded of the article about using Godot for GUIs posted on HN early this month[1].<p>The main complaint seems to be accessibility which seems silly to be discussing for inherently visual applications.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24043427" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24043427</a>')
