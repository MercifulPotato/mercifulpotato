All land is not suitable for building. So we take the best soils that had taken centuries to build its top soil and we pave them over. It’s a tragedy and a travesty.<p>More numbers = more water. We don’t live near water and that has to be bought to where people live. Do you know what we have to do get water to people’s taps so it’s water on demand. Potable water.<p>We have to dig for rare and precious metals. Build more factories to make our cars and steel roofs and pipes and plastic thingies.<p>For every person born, their foot print is not just the home they live in..but water, land for food, everything from their daily porn to their smart phone to cute teapots and our recreational activities and schools. I mean... let’s make a list. From cradle to grave, what it realLy cost to assure basic living foot print for every individual.<p>So.. no. We are way past our carrying capacity. We need to be 2-3 billion to achieve. Carrying capacity. In 1975, population of the world was 3.5 ish billion. Roughly half of what it is now. That’s a good goal.<p>We should incentivise people to live quality lives and not focus on quantity. Only church and state needs more and more lives and people for souls to save and taxes to collect. If we remove the blinders, it is human nature to want to procreate and give the best lives possible to our children who are nothing but extensions of ourselves. But we are leaving a compromised and crumbling world. And robbing them of a future and defeating the chances we have of our species perpetual survival by depleating our resources, habitats and  environment.<p>What we are doing is not unlike sitting on the top most branch of the tree of life as an apex predator and saw off the trunk underneath us because we have been made to believe by church and state that ‘it’s all fine’.<p>No. We are not fine. That’s all.')
