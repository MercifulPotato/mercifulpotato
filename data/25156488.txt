For example, it&#x27;s unsettling to repeatedly hear about these super spreading events where individuals who know that there is something not right with their health, they do feel sick, they are coughing and show other symptoms, yet go into e.g. the elderly homes for visits or other places with many people and infect everybody.<p>To me this seems to be a cultural issue that could have been educated out of people. Just as in Asian countries masks were a everyday sight before the pandemic but in western societies not, as they integrated it into everyday culture and we didn&#x27;t.<p>And I am also talking about other cultural issues, such as your mentioned refusal of science. We know from the past that measures regarding personal safety such as e.g. masking (or seat belts!) form loud counter-protest movements, see e.g. the Anti-Mask Leagues [1], which can undermine efforts to stop a pandemic. Yet, we did not work towards dealing with these cultural issues and anticipate or prevent the existence of these movements since the last pandemic.<p>This leads to further impacts. I am wondering if there are any analyses about how the inability of governments and people to deal with the Spanish Flu impacted the susceptibility of people to fall for totalitarianism which eventually lead to WWII.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-Mask_League_of_San_Francisco" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-Mask_League_of_San_Franci...</a>')
