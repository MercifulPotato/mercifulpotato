Also it is best if you can have a book explaining and walking you through the codebase. To that end i can suggest the following from my own experience;<p>* To study OO expression of C++ via Class libraries&#x2F;Frameworks i recommend a study of &quot;Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library&quot; paired with the book <i>MFC Internals.</i> The code is available with the installation of Visual Studio.<p>* P.J.Plauger&#x27;s <i>The Standard C Library</i> and <i>The C++ Standard Template Library</i>(with Alexander Stepanov, Meng Lee and David Musser) will teach you excellent C and C++ Generic programming skills. Code available with the standard C++ toolchain installation.<p>* The Boost libraries paired with the book <i>C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond</i>.<p>* The FXT library of Algorithms by Jorg Arndt (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jjj.de&#x2F;fxt&#x2F;fxtpage.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jjj.de&#x2F;fxt&#x2F;fxtpage.html</a>) along with its book <i>Matters Computational</i> for writing optimized C++ code.<p>I would also suggest reading the following two classics to learn designing in C++;<p>* Multi-Paradigm Design for C++ by James Coplien.<p>* Scientific and Engineering C++: An Introduction with Advanced Techniques and Examples by Barton and Nackman.')
