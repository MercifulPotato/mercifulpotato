Tools like type-checking and automated tests aren&#x27;t a magic forcefield that will shield you from any and all runtime bugs. But they do protect against a good percentage of them, and as another commenter pointed out...70% type-checking is better than 0% type-checking.<p>The point of type-safety is to be able to describe more succinctly what the _programmer_ expects out of the code. As you said, when you get to production, &quot;all bets are off&quot;. This still applies with any type-safe language. Types don&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re compiling to machine code, either.')
