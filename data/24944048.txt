Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[24944525], score=None, time=1604076056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943675, text='I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an expectation for an exact recorded output, but in this case, it&#x27;s known how the arcade system draws the levels in ram, how the video output chip works from the ram, and if things show up on screen inconsistent with that, but consistent with how an emulator outputs video, that&#x27;s pretty fishy for contest that&#x27;s supposed to run on real hardware.<p>It&#x27;s also an indication that the emulator isn&#x27;t totally accurate at all times, even if it might be during gameplay.')
