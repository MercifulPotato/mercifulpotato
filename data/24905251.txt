The US military has already tested Starlink and it&#x27;s been publicly announced. SpaceX is already a military contractor in other areas, of course. But the consumer market is bigger. It&#x27;s not an afterthought; it&#x27;s the main event.<p>And AFAIK SpaceX&#x27;s funding for Starlink is a combination of their own revenue from launch services, and private VC. So it&#x27;s not correct to say that the military is &quot;bankrolling&quot; Starlink, except to the extent that they buy unrelated launch services from SpaceX.')
