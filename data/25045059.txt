Will paraphrase it and spare you the expletives.<p>&quot;You cannot control an entire country and its people with tanks, jets, battleships and drone or any of these things you believe trump&#x27;s citizen ownership of firearms.<p>A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners. And enforce &quot;no assembly&quot; edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3am and search your house for contraband.<p>None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Those weapons are for decimating, flattening and glassing large areas and many people at once and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrants in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington DC into glowing green glass they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of [excrement].<p>Police are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why is a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while civilians are unarmed.<p>BUT when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out of the window because now the police are outnumbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.<p>If you want living examples of this look at every insurgency that the US military has tried to destroy. They&#x27;re all still kicking with nothing but AK-47s, pick-up trucks and improvised explosives because these big weapons you talk about are useless for dealing with them.  &quot;.')
