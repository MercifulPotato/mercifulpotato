We had a customer one time who sent us $20k via ACH via Stripe. The customer insisted they sent the money, but it was nowhere to be found in our Stripe account. It took months to track down the money working with Stripe support (Stripe indeed received it, but failed to actually payout to our account)<p>After that experience, we pull customers out of the Stripe ecosystem as soon as they want to pay by any method other than credit card. Also saves on fees.')
