Item(by='esja', descendants=None, kids=[25363701, 25363963], score=None, time=1607542645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362968, text='My concern is that <i>you as an individual</i> have used your personal judgement to come to the conclusion that these cases are batshit (as have I incidentally), and in this specific case you are most likely correct. But had Google prevented you from seeing this information, you would not have been able to form any view at all. And that is the direction all these platforms are moving in.<p>I also have absolutely zero trust in Random Googlers being capable of determining truth and falsity <i>in the general case</i> (which is where this is heading), or in managing this power in such a way that is a net benefit to society. If they didn&#x27;t have monopolies on information consumption I would be a little less concerned.<p>A different example: Google could have stopped people seeing &quot;false&quot; information about COVID earlier this year. Twitter and other platforms labelled this &quot;misinformation&quot;, and Google could have censored it from YouTube, searches, etc. The tech companies anointed the WHO as the arbiter of truth, yet the WHO was wrong for quite a while about several important things. I would prefer to live in a world where individuals are allowed to see all the contested facts and arguments, and decide for themselves.<p>One last example: Ignaz Semmelweis would have been censored as &quot;misinformation&quot;. Ditto Galileo and many others.<p>I suppose the real solution is to break up the information monopolies, then let them do all the censoring they want.')
