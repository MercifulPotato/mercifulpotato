Imagine a society where it&#x27;s possible to sell yourself into slavery -- you start out free, but in a moment of desperation you lose it forever.<p>Enemies of a free state use the state&#x27;s freedom against it by exploiting this asymmetry. A moment of naivety by a voter or someone in power, or a traitor&#x2F;spy, can dramatically undermine freedom.<p>The only solution is vigilence, which is hard to keep up forever. The Bill of Rights helps, but at some point we need to reject the politicians that are too naive to defend freedom.<p>EDIT: The socialist movement in the U.S. is of grave concern. Especially the Bernie Sanders brand, where he&#x27;s a nice guy but somehow can&#x27;t even recognize a failing socialist state a few years before it fails (Venezuela).')
