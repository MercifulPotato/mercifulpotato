Gut also has its own limitations - Daniel Kahnemann has documented this very well in Nobel Prize winning research. So what should one do? An organisation has to be self aware that there are no &quot;perfect&quot; metrics. Therefore, one should clearly state the limitations of a metric(s). Then, make a qualitative judgment based on the metrics and their limitations. You make the limitations, assumptions transparent and communicate the risks, uncertainties. Metrics are an input to decision making, they aren&#x27;t decision makers themselves.')
