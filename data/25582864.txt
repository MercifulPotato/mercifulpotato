In fact it seems like exactly the opposite - they are putting hard numbers on the level of risk they consider tolerable. They are making that available to everyone so they can debate and dispute it.<p>If anything, this is <i>removing</i> the illusion of control. The illusion of control would be to say you would <i>never</i> trust self-driving cars. Saying you will trust them at a level of 5x measurable safety criteria above human drivers is totally different.<p>Now we can make actuarial arguments about whether it should be 5x vs 2.6x vs 0.9x and debate how to measure the safety criteria - that’s a completely different world from one where people “feel like” human control of the car is safer.')
