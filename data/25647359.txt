Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609865216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645860, text='&gt; Spinning up your own git server is not a huge effort though even for a startup.<p>At a previous job we self hosted Git and it worked fairly well. At my current job we use GitHub and while we could migrate away, it would hurt.<p>Personally, I think GitHub&#x27;s value is more about the fact that it integrates so well with so many other services. Without GitHub we would lose:<p>- Most of our PR&#x2F; Code Review flow<p>- Integration with Pivotal (our ticketing&#x2F; story system)<p>- Integration with our Travis server for CI<p>- Integration with our hosting service for automated deployment.<p>All of this stuff can be done independent of GitHub, but most of it takes a lot of time and effort you could be spent delivering the product you are trying to ship. You also lose a lot of flexibility.')
