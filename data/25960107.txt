Item(by='franklampard', descendants=None, kids=[25960379], score=None, time=1611942454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959826, text='I will not argue with you about what Robinhood did to any of the margin accounts, if people borrowed money to trade stocks and Robinhood think that&#x27;s risky, they have the right to close positions as part of standard risk management.<p>But I am against what they did to the cash accounts (and margin accounts not borrowing money to trade). It seems that you think it&#x27;s a small portion of all of the accounts, which I disagree.<p>Even if it&#x27;s only a small portion, what Robinhood did to these cash accounts was unprecedented and unacceptable as a broker.<p>For point 2, I think you are referring to the clearing process. Brokers were liable to cover if clearing houses do not[0]. But that is Robinhood&#x27;s liquidity issue and not does justify Robinhood disabling cash accounts from buying stocks.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>')
