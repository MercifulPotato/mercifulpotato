I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re actually so good that they&#x27;re worth 3-4x the price of other options, but the cost isn&#x27;t that absurd.<p>Gaming chairs definitely are not ergonomic though. That&#x27;s why some of them come with pillows for your head and back. I&#x27;ve yet to see one that doesn&#x27;t have a very stiff, flat back. Not to mention most of them are a rip-off. They&#x27;re private labelled chairs marked up 3x.')
