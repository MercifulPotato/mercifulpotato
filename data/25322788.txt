I have a feeling it&#x27;s the most classic example of &quot;design by committee&quot; where all decisions lie with admin staff who never ever have to use the software. They just approve whatever has the biggest list of features. They earn so much money from tuition fees and care so little for usability of basic tools its astounding.<p>I&#x27;m not in education software myself but it seems to me a solution of sorts would be to push for standardization:<p>- open data exchange formats<p>- open communication protocols<p>- open social identity platforms<p>This doesn&#x27;t fix the problem but at least it gives power to the people to do so. However, it won&#x27;t happen on its own because it&#x27;s not in the best interest of anyone currently in position to do anything about it.')
