That&#x27;s most of what I watch on Youtube.<p>Youtube recommends stupid crap based on what other people like.<p>If I watch one stupid video not in incognito, ALL of the recommendations become stupid videos because those videos have better metrics. Youtube actively guides me away from educational content.<p>Even within educational videos, if I click on a click-baity channel once, that channel dominates things I&#x27;ve watched MANY more time. It seems to all be about click-through metrics.<p>I&#x27;ve never had Youtube recommend really upscale educational content like Zach Star before. It&#x27;s quality stuff, but you gotta find it yourself.')
