It&#x27;s $2.50&#x2F;mile, but not less than $0.50&#x2F;minute. Pricing is normally by distance not time, but to protect the driver in the event that heavy traffic prevents them from covering much distance, there is floor on the charge per minute. Nothing special happens when you accelerate past 12 mph.')
