A bitcoin block can have 0 transactions and still need the same energy to produce.<p>a) Sending payments is not the only purpose of the network, it&#x27;s issuance, it&#x27;s security, it&#x27;s to make the ledger immutable.<p>b) No one&#x27;s buying a burger with bitcoin. Bitcoin&#x27;s production is a monetary base.
