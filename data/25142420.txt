Tailwind classes are simple enough to manipulate that you don&#x27;t need to know CSS.<p>After a while, you get the amazing benefit of simply being able to copy and paste HTML from one place to another - since the class names are common, you can copy HTML directly from a design mockup into your application, with only minimal extra work in templating. This is <i>much</i> more efficient than trying to figure out pixel-sizes in a PSD, then trying to figure out which combination of CSS classes will succeed in reproducing the visual appearance (most of the time, in most browsers...)')
