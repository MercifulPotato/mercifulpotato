If the first logician did NOT want dessert, then they could safely answer &quot;no&quot;, because then it would not be the case that ALL of the logicians want dessert.  Since they do not answer no, we can assume they do want dessert.  The same follows for the second logician. The third (who also wants dessert) has heard their colleagues answer, and knows that if either of them did not want dessert they would have answered no, and can therefore now answer &quot;yes, we would all like dessert&quot;.')
