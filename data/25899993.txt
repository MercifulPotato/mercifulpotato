As a side project I have created something that I would like to ask you all to get your feedback and if that is something you would be interested in using.<p>It&#x27;s a remote phone instance running in the cloud where I install and use all apps that may be leaking private data such as geolocation, activity time, microphone, gyroscope and what not. In principle its an Android instance which I access with VNC client from my iPhone. Everything on the server side is based on AOSP (Android Open Source), encrypted and in a Docker container with all of its security features. The only downside is that when I&#x27;m in a rural area the VNC can get laggy and it&#x27;s pretty much unusable.<p>I was thinking about releasing it as a service to the general public for a small fee lets say $10&#x2F;mo to cover the server cost and making some fancy integrations like Zadarma to use separate phone number, VPN to hide the server location, or a dedicated mobile app to optimize traffic data (VNC can be data-heavy).<p>What do you think?')
