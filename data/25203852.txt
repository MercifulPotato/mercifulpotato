(Or used to... people have been throwing rocks into it over the years so it is not so impressive anymore.)<p>In any case, there is a little monument there with a wifi password and a solar panel. If you sit next to it on a sunny day, there is enough power to run the wifi and a web server which will give you some basic historical and geological info on the place.')
