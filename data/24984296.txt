You are right that the VAT or similar financial matters require a very high degree of precision and accuracy. Physics simulations and similar computations even more so. These applications have a very LOW tolerance for error and -- rightfully so -- tend to have a lot of attention paid to their backends.<p>I contend that most applications are not these. I&#x27;ll put it forward as professional experience that even financial adjacent systems have a surprising degree of error tolerance. Our engineers&#x2F;scientists are constantly striving to improve correctness because that&#x27;s what engineers do but it&#x27;s plainly not a priority for our bottom line. Countless errors have been caught in the last year that made individual results quite questionable. But on the whole, the system and its results are accurate enough that we have plenty of customers and business keeping us busy.')
