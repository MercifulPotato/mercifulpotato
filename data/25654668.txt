I built this service over the last week during my time off.<p>To use the service, click a resolution template or create a new one. Define the metrics you want to capture about the resolution - for example, if you are trying to stop smoking, you can configure an email to ask you how many cigarettes you smoked each day, and whether you resisted a craving. You can also configure emails for your goals, which will come in an email reminder after a certain number of days.<p>This is my first Show HN and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions from the wonderful HN community!')
