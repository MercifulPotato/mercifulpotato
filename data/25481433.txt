I work on a 20 year old massive enterprise app and there is lots of “not my job”, but <i>someone</i> would see it.<p>Also, it would likely (or hopefully) trigger a static analysis warning in the build as soon as it’s added. For such a sophisticated attack this would be too much of a weak point. It would be much better to have access to a point in the build system that enabled you to inject that code in or after the compilation, e.g by tampering with the tool chain on the build machines.')
