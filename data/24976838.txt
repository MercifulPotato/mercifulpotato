I loved touring the US parks while doing remote work, and I miss the freedom of being able to wander around anywhere and sort of ignore roads, but I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to live in many of the areas that I adored.<p>One thing that people underestimate about the US is its vast size. When you live in a city, you have at least a dozen grocery stores within an hour&#x27;s drive. When you live in a rural area, you drive at least an hour into &quot;the city&quot; which has a Walmart and a Kroger.<p>There are exceptions, like Utah which is basically one giant city&#x2F;suburb&#x2F;church running along the Great Salt Lake with a half-dozen national parks to the South. But I would lean towards this being a temporary trend for most people.')
