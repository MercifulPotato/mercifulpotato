Why not have everything be a green thread from now on?<p>If Java threads are not OS threads, can be paused for any amount of time, and there&#x27;s no reason that network calls or db calls or file IO should be treated any differently, then I&#x27;m not sure why the old Java Threads shouldn&#x27;t be deprecated.<p>Can you shine some light on that? After Loom drops, when would I ever want something other than a green thread?')
