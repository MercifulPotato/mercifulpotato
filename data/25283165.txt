(Oyakadon translates to &quot;parent and child donburi&quot; which somehow makes eating a combination of chicken and egg a little less appealing).<p>Looking at reviews today, people apparently see the food as a mixed bag - some are clearly disappointed. In my opinion, it was excellent, with the signature dish having balanced flavors that seem to have been refined for generations. I found it endlessly fascinating that a humble lunch place with a simple dish could survive for 250+ years - but it also makes perfect sense that simple things last.<p>My colleague (a local in our Japan office) told me that emperors of old had ordered the dish to be delivered to them, well before Japan had even been &quot;opened&quot; to the world. Perhaps the stories were apocryphal (he was a sales guy after all), but still entertaining and gave a sense of the history behind the meal.<p>Tokyo is an amazing city, though it can be very lonely for an expat.')
