They only allow 1,000 characters, which is just not enough for most cases. \n3) staff the team so you can reply within 48 hours. Currently, the average seems to be about 10 days.\n4) Have a way to see the takedown reason I&#x27;m the developer portal. If you appeal, see the appeal was received and is in process.<p>None of these things take materially more resources from google. Some junior PM should be able to make this better, and it would save google a lot of antitrust concerns. Something like 1M a year would probably do it.')
