In Norway, in my experience at least, this is free.<p>But the reason I have a handful of paperweight mobiles is not that they are locked but that they are no longer useful.  They have low resolution cameras, little memory, small screens, obsolete operating systems, etc.  I sometimes try to sell them but no one wants them even free.')
