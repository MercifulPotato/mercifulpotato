I think the title of &quot;47 events&quot; is greatly misleading. While the simulations are definitely incredibly valuable, it&#x27;s misleading to use the figures from simulations in any argument for how careless Waymo is. In fact, I think the heavy usage of simulation to model realistic events should be a plus, rather than how the title makes it seem like a bad thing.<p>Secondly, If you read Table 1 [1] of the paper, you&#x27;ll see that there was only <i>1</i> actual pedestrian event (and I guess 2 simulated events), and that was a person walking into a parked car (it&#x27;s funny that they could measure the walking speed of the person at 2.7mph).<p>Lastly, in Table 2 they enumerate all the events that &quot;were the fault of the other human driver&quot;. Most of them are &quot;failure to yield&quot;, for example-- &quot;failure to yield to a vehicle approaching from the left while making a right turn at an unsignalized intersection.&quot;<p>This touches on your bit on driver&#x27;s responsibility. While it is <i>true</i> that Waymo isn&#x27;t at fault, it makes me wonder how much &quot;defensive driving&quot; Waymo is including in their models. In the case above, without video&#x2F;full context, you don&#x27;t fully know whether it was an avoidable accent or not by, say, swerving to the other lane, or if that option wasn&#x27;t possible due to another car. It&#x27;d be incredibly interesting to know the exact number corrective actions taken&#x2F;attempted and number of probable accidents avoided.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;sdc-prod&#x2F;v1&#x2F;safety-report&#x2F;Waymo-Public-Road-Safety-Performance-Data.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;sdc-prod&#x2F;v1&#x2F;safety-report&#x2F;Way...</a>')
