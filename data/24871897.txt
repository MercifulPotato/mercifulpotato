The data the underlies the reconstructions requires massive averaging of individual objects as part of the tomography (see Radon transform for the core approach). In addition those objects&#x2F;particles need to have the requisite symmetry&#x2F;similarity&#x2F;regularity in structure (not universally applicable), or the population of them needs to be completely homogeneous (hard to achieve). I suspect that there are now better techniques for detecting outliers so homogeneity might not be as important.')
