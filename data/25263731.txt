We used the collision rate to estimate the total volume of tweets going through the system.<p>We also determined ID assignment was determined by three servers in a round robin load balancer and load was distributed based on modding of a 32 bit integer, so two servers were getting more load than the other since you canâ€™t evenly divide a 32 bit integer by 3. They fixed that bug after a couple months of observation. I forget if we let Twitter know or not.<p>I love stuff like this.')
