That is, if the authors had called the sets &quot;cooperative words&quot; and &quot;aggressive words&quot; instead, the result would still be interesting.<p>I suspect the authors chose masc&#x2F;fem to describe the words because that makes for a more click-baity headline for the paper. Not so that it would peg the irony meter of people who notice that they are using gender stereotypes to characterize words in a paper ostensibly written to help reduce sexism.')
