It was like tickling&#x2F;scratching deep in my ear canal, and left my ears uncomfortably sensitive, painful, and itchy for 24 hours; fortunately I didn’t get an infection. My companions at the salon had no such issues. Other commenters have remarked on genetic differences in earwax consistency; perhaps that’s the reason I found it so awful.')
