Then got to the bottom of the page thinking, &quot;Hmm, It really would have been helpful if he included an example video...&quot; Then scrolled back to the top and through all the content again to see if I missed something. I tried hovering over the &quot;gif&quot; and then realized it was a link to YouTube.<p>Long story short, I think it would help the reader to have a &quot;play button&quot; or small icon overlayed on the image to indicate that it&#x27;s a playable video, or (better?) embed the YouTube video directly in that space so the user doesn&#x27;t have to leave the page.<p>Hope this helps, but open to feedback if I&#x27;m just an outlier. You can try the change in an A&#x2F;B test, and see if the conversion rate goes up for people who visit the site AND watch an example video.')
