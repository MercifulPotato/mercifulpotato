I can&#x27;t speak to the same level as MisterTea (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25429901" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25429901</a>) but coming from a city with a history of heavy mob activity, Philadelphia to be specific, you hear the same kinds of stories from family and very infrequently, you still encounter groups of 2-3 guys at a bar or restaurant where you think, let&#x27;s give them a wide berth.<p>I might as well tell my two stories.<p>A relative who works in finance took some clients out to a restaurant in South Philly in the 80s.  The 80s were a violent time in the Philly mob and also the FBI was starting to make major inroads in their fight.  So 4 guys not from the neighborhood, in suits, at a restaurant in South Philly.  And this relative, he noticed a guy at the end of the bar, eyeing them hard and so he asked the bar tender, &quot;hey, is that who I think it is?&quot;  And the bar tender: &quot;I dunno, who do you think it is?&quot;  Relative: &quot;Well, I think I know who it is.  Just tell him we&#x27;re not the feds, we&#x27;re just a bunch of bankers out to dinner.&quot;  The guy at the end of the bar was the leader of the mob at the time (his name escapes me) but he nodded to them and bought them a bottle of wine.  You hear a story like this and you understand the mythology, it&#x27;s almost like it was a pleasant time.  But that was just a veneer.<p>My one personal story on this topic speaks more to the mythology.  A few years back, I was went to a 76ers game with some out-of-town (from the mid-west but not Chicago&#x2F;Detroit&#x2F;Cleveland, like far mid-west) co-workers.  The 76ers play in South Philly and so I took them out down there after the game.  I don&#x27;t know how we got on the subject but one of my co-workers asked, &quot;This is South Philly, you know the show the Sopranos?  how real is that?&quot;  I said something like &quot;First off, that&#x27;s the North Jersey mob, so you don&#x27;t really have to worry about them down here because this is the Philly Mob&#x27;s turf.  That being said, I think they&#x27;re allies because they both work in Atlantic City and...&quot; and then tried to explain how the different crime families interact, and how they have apparently fallen on hard times.  Anyway, there&#x27;s nothing really special about my story however I did take from it that, the American mafia experience can be a very regional thing.  I had never realized that there are parts of the country that didn&#x27;t have this shared history of organized crime.  I just kind of assumed the entire country was under their control for 30-40 years.  That&#x27;s some mythology.<p>Best mob movie: Casino.')
