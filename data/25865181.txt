I&#x27;m half Polish and I know that there is a perspective that women do really well in science&#x2F;STEM, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen them participate at equal rates as men. And when I talk to tech companies in Poland these days, they say their engineering teams are predominantly male and they&#x27;d like to change that (which is one reason they want to partner with Manara!)<p>EDITED: Also, when I worked at Upwork as a PM, most of our software engineers were from Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc) and we had almost no women on the team.')
