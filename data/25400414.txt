For a simple static site you could pay 300$ a website-builder-thing or you can build an app inside a docker container and your host will reboot it for you if it crashes. I use a docker-compose.yml file and I was able to quickly download an open source service that automatically renews my SSL cert. But yeah it depends on the scope, and the project, and what skills you have freely available or wouldn&#x27;t mind learning.')
