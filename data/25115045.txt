One kind of fanatic does not excuse another, <i>nor have I claimed it does</i>.<p>There’s no need to list Apple’s faults. I’m aware of them and support a large part of Apple criticism in the Tim Cook era (and not just technical[1]), including most of yours.<p>Where we disagree is in the insinuation the author is a fanatic simply for defending Apple. They’ve written a technical post and gave their conclusions, which may indeed sound apologetic but are far from rabid fanaticism.<p>&gt; Fuck Apple.<p>In sum, it’s fine to decry the company but I disagree that people who like it and accept its tradeoffs should be immediately labeled as extremists.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24738345" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24738345</a>')
