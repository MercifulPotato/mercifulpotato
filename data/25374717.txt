I don&#x27;t like <i>most</i> billionaires because they invariably have huge egos and think they&#x27;re gods great gift to capitalism. When you&#x27;re using your power to promote business practices that hurt people who aren&#x27;t receiving lavish compensation, it isn&#x27;t a benign thing.<p>I was just musing about how strange it is that people love him despite his sketchy business practices. The OP was about him forcing a plant open and having a bad record on workers rights. That&#x27;s what I objected to, not all the money he&#x27;s making.<p>I do understand my comment didn&#x27;t really explain that, so I understand the downvotes. I guess I thought it was clear from the context, why I had a problem with him.')
