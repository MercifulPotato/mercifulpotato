Either someone else solves them for you, or you have to solve them yourself.<p>I mean, yes, there is a part of the solution-space in-between these two extremes â€” a point where there&#x27;s a batteries-included thing that someone else built but then <i>gives away for free</i>, perhaps as an open-source project you just have to run on your own infra. So it&#x27;s mostly solved for you, and then you just do a little bit to &quot;get the solution running&quot; for your use-case. <i>That</i> point in solution-space is conspicuously absent for web data sync.<p>But, in domains with essential complexity, that middle-ground part of the solution-space is <i>usually</i> conspicuously absent. Because it takes continuous dedicated effort (i.e. labor; capital expenditure) to solve the complex problem in a cleanly-abstracted way. And it&#x27;s very rare that anyone&#x27;s going to go to the effort, unless they expect a return on their labor investment (by e.g. keeping the solution proprietary, and building a SaaS business around it.)')
