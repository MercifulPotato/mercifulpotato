Item(by='ThePhysicist', descendants=None, kids=[25219896], score=None, time=1606392892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218050, text='Last year, I wanted to buy an additional lightweight, portable computer that I could use for office work, as rebooting my Linux machine to work on Excel files (without breaking them in Open Office) became tiresome. I tried the iPad as well as the Surface Pro (6) and eventually decided for the Surface.<p>My main reason was that the Surface is just a normal Windows computer that can run any software (I even run Linux on it via WSL for when I need to do some light development work), while the iPad is a strongly locked down device where I have to rely on the app store to get and install software, and where I don&#x27;t even have a real file system to work with (though I hear they improved this with iPadOS).<p>That said the UX and performance of the iPad is much better than of the Surface, which will often show stuttering and input delays if I open too many apps. In terms of productivity it rocks though as I can do all my office work and some development work on it (and it has a pretty decent keyboard as well).<p>So I agree with the author that there&#x27;s so much potential for the iPad, I don&#x27;t think Apple will want to unearth that though as they&#x27;d probably cut into their own Macbook revenue by doing so. Hence the iPad remains more of a &quot;toy&quot; or leisure device that&#x27;s (IMHO) intended more for media consumption than actual work.')
