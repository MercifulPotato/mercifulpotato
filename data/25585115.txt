Everything is very fast, and the fact that this machine is completely silent and doesn&#x27;t get hot is phenomenal.<p>Right now, I&#x27;ve downloaded the Parallels Desktop preview and installed Windows 10 ARM on the machine. Amazingly, I was able to play some video games through Steam this way. My family likes playing Lego Lord of the Rings, which is a 32-bit Windows game. Runs at 1080p Medium-ish settings on Windows 10 ARM through Parallels fine, which is incredible for how much virtualization and translation is going on.<p>(For anyone else installing Lego LOTR, I had to install DirectX 9 because Windows 10 ARM doesn&#x27;t come with it, but then it worked fine.)<p>Also, this whole virtualization thing works so well, I completely forgot just now that I was replying on HN using Microsoft Edge... on Windows 10 ARM on my Mac. :)<p>EDIT: My Windows 10 ARM install had a new build to install, and to my shock it installed the entire new build of Windows 10 in less than 4 minutes. Complete build. At the beginning, it even went 0%-&gt;30% followed by a reboot in 5 seconds flat, which caused my jaw to nearly fall off.')
