Just use the resolution that&#x27;s configured: if I wanted to change it I&#x27;d change it.<p>Non-native resolutions look awful on LCDs anyway, so apps really shouldn&#x27;t change it.<p>Actually though, the easier way to support linux is just to run on windows mode with no chrome -- I can just fullscreen the window myself and that&#x27;s it.<p>Games that try to detect screen resolution themselves very often screw up picking the right resolution when you have multiple screens: but again, the problem is they&#x27;re trying to do too much.')
