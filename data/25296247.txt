At least with those you can still talk to your friends but with movies you have to sit in complete silence with just about zero interaction for over an hour. Honestly the whole thing felt like an almost complete waste of time.<p>Yeah you get a shared experience out of it but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s any better than just independently watching the movie')
