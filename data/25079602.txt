Microsoft is already a strong contender the in the development tool space and there&#x27;s not that much competition left.<p>Or maybe JetBrains is just not available for them. There can be something going on between JetBrains and Google considering Google decided to partner with them on the Android development tools.<p>Or maybe Microsoft feels they are doing well enough with their current tools. You can&#x27;t really fit the JetBrains nicely to the &quot;big picture&quot;. Microsoft needs VScode, because they want IDE running inside browser. They also need the big old Visual Studio.
