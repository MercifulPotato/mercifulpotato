It&#x27;s a big employee benefit where otherwise employees are stuck with illiquid stock that they can&#x27;t sell if they need to buy a house or car.<p>We wanted to quantify how a recurring liquidity program can increase employees&#x27; liquid comp so we built this calculator.<p>If the company makes a certain percentage of an employees&#x27; shares available to be sold, say 15%, and the company is growing quickly enough, employees can make liquid comp on par with FB within 3-4 years and still have the upside of the equity they hold.<p>Would love to get thoughts&#x2F;feedback on this!')
