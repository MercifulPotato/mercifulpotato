That we still read our kids stories about how great princesses and kings are is evidence of how strong this feudal propaganda is.<p>Especially at software companies, the hardworking engineers are why the company can exist at all. How many times have engineers deeply cared about things such as quality of the code base, giving back to open source communities, or even things like ethical treatment of coworkers and users?<p>But we have been trained to treat CEOs and &quot;leadership&quot; like divinely ordained kings. Sure the VCs and Founders have laid out the capital to run the company, but capital alone does not make the company.<p>Have you never worked at a company where software engineers are forced by management to make very bad technical choices? Have you never been in a room where everyone working on the project sees clearly it will be a disaster but has absolutely zero say in the decisions around it? Have you never seen your company do questionably illegal or unethical things, where everyone working on the project wishes that they could stop things, but no individual wants to handle the risk of being a whistle-blower and having their career destroyed?<p>Imagine a startup or large tech company where collectively the engineers had a voice on par with the c-suite. Where they could say &quot;I know that we have quarterly goals to meet, but we refused to ship new product until we have our infra in a least a semi-stable state. This will allow us to ship faster in the future and it&#x27;s important for the company&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;We strongly believe that while this current feature does generate slightly more revenue, it is intentionally deceptive to users and ultimately harmful to them and our product, so we would like to see it changed or removed&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;X,Y and Z Open source products have saved us tremendous amount of capital, to continue to keep these ecosystems we depend on healthy, we demand that N hours a month be actively devoted to giving back to these projects&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;I know you are unhappy with employee 123, primarily because they have openly questioned the decisions of management. However they have no records of outright insubordination and are considered a valuable member of the technical team, so we will fight your request to fire them.&quot;<p>Labor having a voice is about far more than just salaries and benefits like it is for factory workers. And if you think the solution is just that engineering management needs to better represent their teams, then you likely haven&#x27;t worked in management.')
