What makes it worse is that you have no other choice - it&#x27;s the only complete tool for administrating G Suite.  There are APIs for some things, but quite a lot is only available in the GUI, and new features always show up there first (if they ever make it to the API at all).<p>There isn&#x27;t even a way to import&#x2F;export settings, so you have to painstakingly document everything and reconfigure it manually if you need to create a new instance.  It makes things pretty painful from a compliance point of view.')
