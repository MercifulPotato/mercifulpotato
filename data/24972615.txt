By obvious I mean almost 100% of the time it&#x27;s a lie and people fall for it<p>-------<p>I played maybe a hundred games of among us (they can be very short). The game is about one or more imposters trying to murder the rest of the crew but you&#x27;ll have to be discreet and get&#x2F;find people alone so you don&#x27;t get voted off. When a body is found a meeting happens and you can lie (text chat)<p>One problem is you don&#x27;t want to accuse someone when you&#x27;re an imposter because you immediately become suspicious. Most games will tell you if you voted off an imposter or not so they&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re lieing right away once game tells them they voted a non imposter. Most of the time you want to accuse noone, play dumb and act like you&#x27;re everyeone else and saw nothing.<p>I lost count when a guy doesn&#x27;t accuse anyone for 20+seconds, get accused then claims the guy who found the body is an imposter and all these things he did that are suspicious. (why didn&#x27;t you say it right away?!). Like 90+% of the time the guy being accused is the imposter who waited so he can feel the situation out. It&#x27;s <i>extremely obvious</i> but maybe 70% of the time literally <i>every player</i> but me and the guy reporting the body is fooled. Which is far too many players at a far too high fool rate. It&#x27;s so painful because it&#x27;s so obvious. 90+% of the time in that scenario the reporting guy is telling the truth.')
