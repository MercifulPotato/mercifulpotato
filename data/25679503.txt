If anyone has your bank numbers, they can initiate ACH withdrawals from your account, which is something I didn&#x27;t know. There are protections on ACH transfers, which is why you can dispute things, but it also means a lot of your money could be in limbo for a long period of time, which is scary.<p>As for 3rd parties, most landlords I&#x27;ve had since use services like ClickPay and AppFolio (there are probably dozens, but those are two I&#x27;ve had the option of using with past landlords). They have automatic payment options, but they won&#x27;t charge payments without your approval.')
