Traditional Mac OS used completely different key combinations (command left arrow instead of control-a, for example). Because of that, Carbon apps didn’t support readline-like key combinations (but system input fields did)<p>The two could happily coexist only because the Mac originally didn’t have control keys (it only got them for supporting terminal programs, as part of trying to make Macs sell better in business), so none of its navigation keystrokes used the control key.')
