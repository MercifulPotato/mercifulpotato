Pointing out fallacies allows you to <i>defeat</i> any other argument, but it does not allow you to take a position <i>for</i> anything. It is the perfect tool for allowing you to entrench yourself in your original view, by handily defeating those who would assail you in a fully general way that applies however correct you are. Merely saying &quot;but to do so is to commit the fallacy fallacy&quot; doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it happens extremely commonly.<p>It&#x27;s the &quot;when used appropriately&quot; that&#x27;s the issue. A list of fallacies is probably a good thing to have access to <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve somehow had epistemic humility installed in you. But epistemic humility does not come naturally to most people, and must be taught.')
