It’s just that node tries to be convenient by providing access to things that would need in a non-user context (like filesystem and C interop), thereby breaking the sandbox. Deno tries to give you the best of both.<p>Running this stuff in the browser is still “just running on V8”, but with extra steps. If you don’t like the npm ecosystem, I get it, but then running nodejs without any packages is comparable to what you’re describing in the link, isn’t it?')
