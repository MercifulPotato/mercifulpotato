That&#x27;s better than I paid for my Pentium 200Mhz CPU.<p>On the other hand, I paid less than $30&#x2F;core for my Ryzen 7 2700X. Now Zen 3 cores are better, so let&#x27;s compare with consumer chips.<p>Ryzen 7 5800X is supposed to mainstream (though there have been availability issues) and that&#x27;s $450 for 8 cores or $56.25 per core.<p>Really paying for the higher I&#x2F;O and overall high core count. Does anyone have a chart illustrating the scaling of cores per dollar?')
