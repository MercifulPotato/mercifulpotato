It now has 265,000+ miles.<p>The key with owning a BMW is to do all of the maintenance yourself. That brings the cost of ownership back down to planet Earth.<p>I&#x27;ve replaced the water pump twice, high pressure fuel pump once, and the radiator. Plus a few odds and ends.<p>If I had paid the dealer for this work, I&#x27;d be totally in the hole.<p>One thing I will give BMW is that they know how to design a chassis. The car has all of the original suspension components and the steering is still as tight as the day I got it. No clunking, no rattles, no bouncing, etc.')
