Similarly, if you want to change jobs or launch a startup, health insurance isn&#x27;t the thing that&#x27;s holding you back from that.<p>With the ACA, things are at least a little better than before: individual people can at least buy insurance, which wasn&#x27;t the case before if you had a pre-existing condition and didn&#x27;t live in a state with a subsidized program (like Oregon&#x27;s OMIP).<p>A criticism I&#x27;ve heard of Canada&#x27;s system is just that it&#x27;s under-funded.  They could raise their taxes a little and divert more money to health care, and it would improve some of these wait times.  I don&#x27;t know how true that is, though, and how much of a legitimate problem it is.  Canada definitely pays far less per capita for health insurance than the U.S.')
