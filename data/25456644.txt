It should live separately from the render &#x2F; view code<p>If that&#x27;s your preference React is probably the wrong tool to begin with. React is just the view in MVC. Plenty of frameworks exist to help build an MVC with react that provide their own structure and guidelines.<p>React is incredibly flexible and can be used in many ways. All this shows is the need for strong architecture decisions and guidance because React is so hands off in making recomendations of how it should be used or what tools it should be used with.<p>That&#x27;s a strength. It absolutely requires more up front work on yours and mine part to construct an architecture that fits our needs, but it gives us the ability to completely tailor the solution which is the best part.')
