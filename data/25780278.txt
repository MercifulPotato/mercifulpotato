Maybe the rules are too articulated, over-specified, or maybe it&#x27;s just too clean and modern.<p>In any case, Dungeon Crawl Classics[1] is like a mainlining RPG nostalgia.  It&#x27;s the one product that put me in the back of the bus with my 4th grade buddies working their way through the Caves of Chaos.  The art, rules and just general vibe are so Old School metal, you can practically hear Zeppelin playing in the background.<p>Magic is uncertain and rare, and death in DCC is the natural result of real danger. Encounters are not gradually scaled to fit the current Challenge Rating of the party.  Can&#x27;t say enough about how much fun this game is.  Great community too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodman-games.com&#x2F;dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodman-games.com&#x2F;dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg&#x2F;</a>')
