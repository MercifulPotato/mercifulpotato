Join a small and agile team in our beautiful office in St. Katharine Docks. If our US location tickles your fancy, you get to help a sunny satellite office too. For the time being, thanks to Covid, we are in fully remote mode.<p>Smarkets develops a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We&#x27;re also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]) and Javascript for React &amp; React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and Kubernetes. We use REST where we can, and gRPC where we can&#x27;t. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.<p>Production environment is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.<p>We are looking for engineering talent all across the board: frontend and mobile, infrastructure, data science, trading engine, security - and of course generalists, those yet to find their calling.<p>If you like the idea of flat structure and practical engineering approach, see our jobs at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarkets.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarkets.com&#x2F;careers</a> .<p>---<p>ß: to pre-empt questions on why C++ or why not Erlang - our exchange team have promised to put together a proper write-up on the tradeoffs, design constraints, performance needs, etc. In fullness of time, that is, when the most painful (and probably interesting) migrations are behind them.')
