Item(by='fpig', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605540727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094637, text='Improved the performance of a rendering system from 10000 objects per second to 100000.<p>Super vague, means basically nothing. Maybe it should be written with a bit more detail about what kind of rendering system this is. Still I would be interested, and in the interview I would ask them to explain the system and what they did. However, if it was something stupid (the original code was just super bad) then they would look dumb for bringing it up. Basically, if you put something like this in your CV, it should be something you&#x27;re proud of for a good reason, not a result of trying to think of <i>anything</i> where you can reduce the impact of your work to a number.<p>The impact of most work cannot be reduced to a number, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine to not have any &quot;measurable successes&quot; like that in your CV. In my experience, 75% of people don&#x27;t, and 75% of people who do have stupid ones that just make them look worse (ie they read online resume-writing advice and put in something like the example this discussion is about). So there is no point in actively trying to think of something like that to put in your CV. If you <i>have</i> something, put it in, if not, that&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s a pretty good way to decide whether to include it: does imagining your interviewer reading it make you feel proud or embarrassed?<p>But what if you implemented the same rendering system from scratch? If you put in a number, it will mean basically nothing. You can just describe what you built. You don&#x27;t need to reduce your work to a number. This is simply incorrect advice in the linked blog post. The people hiring you are not judging you based on numbers which claim you contributed to the business in a measureble way. This is simply not true. Ideas like this are usually pushed by people who are not even in SD and are instead self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; in the field of &quot;finding jobs&quot; or whatever and are painting all industries with the same brush.')
