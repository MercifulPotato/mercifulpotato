The theory was that the assuming that there is life other than earth&#x27;s in the universe, the probability of it being within ±10,000 years of current human development (i.e being similar to us now ± 10,000 years) is very very small. Most likely, life outside the earth will be 20k, 30k or even 50k, or more years in the future technologically, socially and medically advanced.<p>Think about, how a human now would look like to a human 50,000 years ago.  Or how humanity would look like in 50,000 years.  For all I know, we will be able to replace every organ (lab tissue growing), live for a LONG time (Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, metformin) and other unimaginable things.<p>So, if we encountered &quot;space traveling&quot; aliens, their frame of reference would be completely out of our understanding.')
