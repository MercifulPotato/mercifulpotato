The NY Times, WaPo, NPR and even CNN have not let much get past them. It&#x27;s a meme that they&#x27;re terrible because they made a few mistakes in thousands of pages of reporting. For the most part, they have dug deep and gotten tons of information to light. Information that amateur opinion writers on platforms like Substack can&#x27;t match. Even the slightly outsider orgs like ProPublica or The Intercept are doing their work via professional newsrooms with editors. I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing a major story be broken by a blogger or newsletter writer.')
