I certainly wouldn&#x27;t apply this standard to RIAA lawyers suing kids.  I judge them to be worms even though I never worked with them.  And don&#x27;t even get me started on politicians, I&#x27;ve never worked with one but I certainly feel entitled to have harsh opinions about some of them.<p>If the advice is limited in scope to professional peers, then I have to disagree with it; having double standards for people like yourself isn&#x27;t great advice.')
