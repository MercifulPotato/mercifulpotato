Like humans, pigs do not all look alike! Audio recognition detect symptoms such as coughing and breathing difficulties while infra-red technology is used to detect the pig’s temperature. In addition to identifying the pig, the facial recognition camera also monitors the pig’s movements and can detect whether the pig is becoming lethargic or not eating. Each pig has its own archive file, which includes key details such as its age, weight, breed, exercise frequency and its feeding habits, often a good indicator of a pig’s health.')
