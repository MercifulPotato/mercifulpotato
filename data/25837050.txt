At some point, they reached out to me about the trademark infringement.<p>They were nice about it, I did not get a legal notice or anything, just a contact from a MySQL employee pointing me to their policy (as in my response to your example: I could have called it ha-for-mysql), and requesting that I changed the name to make it compliant. I ended up with a full rename (called it highbase) and they were kind enough to give me a one year free subscription to MySQL Enterprise as a token of appreciation for my change.<p>In way that I think is interesting regarding the AWS and Elastic situation, what MySQL&#x27;s trademark policy intended was to avoid the situation in which a third party could be confused by a product or project name (mysql-ha in my case) as to believe that MySQL, the company, was behind the offering. So any use of the trademark that made it clear they were not involved (as in the &quot;X for MySQL&quot; vs. &quot;MySQL X&quot;) was ok.')
