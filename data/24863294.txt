Calling it &quot;false promise that will be exploited and unfixable&quot; is not supported by the evidence.<p>That is to say, WebGPU is working with IHVs indirectly via Khronos, Microsoft, etc, and is putting pressure to introduce the safety features at the driver&#x2F;hardware level. We&#x27;ve been arguing for more defined UB in Vulkan specs, initialization of workgroup memory, device memory ownership, and other things.')
