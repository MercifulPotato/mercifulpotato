It&#x27;s not disturbing that the pig teapot is not realistic, or that the dragon cat is missing a leg. This kind of problem is very disturbing on realistic pictures of human bodies.<p>Eventually it will get there, I guess you could make an AI to filter the pictures to see which of them are disturbing or not.')
