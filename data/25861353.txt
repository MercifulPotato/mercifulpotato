We looked  at the existing solutions before starting Finmark and we couldn&#x27;t find any that were simple yet powerful enough to warrant using over excel. Liveplan, Quickbooks cashflow, and others, don&#x27;t give you the granularity to accurately forecast a business. For example: you cannot build revenue drivers based on sales hires or marketing spend nor can you forecast itemized expenses. \nIts for that reason we wanted to reimagine what the software should look like. I draw a very similar parallel to Carta. Before Carta (or e-shares) there were a number of companies that tried to tackle cap table management. None of them really hit the mark and so everyone still used excel until Carta came along. Today, everyone still uses excel for their financial modeling and we&#x27;re hoping to change that.')
