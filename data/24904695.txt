However as for the parsering stage, that course goes as maximum as to SLR(1) which is pretty &quot;toy&quot; parsing mode. That&#x27;s the problem with a combined &quot;compilers class&quot; -- one simply can&#x27;t put everything, and everything is becoming slightly superficial. That&#x27;s why I have Parsers and Garbage Collectors class as separate and fully specialized course.')
