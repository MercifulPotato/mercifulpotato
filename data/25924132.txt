Whenever I need money, I go to the nearest gamestop and ask for my money back on a game I don&#x27;t want and make a withdrawal. The lines are shorter at gamestop than at the bank and I can trade in old games and have money go straight to my savings account. Gamestops are just as prevalent as banks in my town and I work at a mall so it&#x27;s even more convenient than running an errand to the bank or using an ATM and getting charged<p>The gamestop people are starting to catch on that I&#x27;m just moving money around and only buying one preordered game a year, if that, but there isn&#x27;t shit they can do about it. The best part is, since I always preorder every game coming out I&#x27;m still guaranteed to get all the exclusive content whether or not I&#x27;m sure I want a certain game. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re rewarding me for banking with them.&quot;')
