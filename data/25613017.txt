This is actually insane (as in mentally unwell) levels of arrogance and negligence.<p>Secondly they covered up the outbreak. Had it been reported a few weeks earlier apparently up to 95% of deaths could have been prevented. That is really insane.<p>The lab side of it is interesting and it seems just so much of a coincidence that the lab was right next to the oubreak, of all the places in all of the huge country of China.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt they were motivated to study bat coronaviruses, of course they were and there was in fact very big competition with the US.<p>The problem is China is such a corrupt country where health + safety + following protocols is something of a joke, as with most communist&#x2F;totalitarian systems people always try to get away with as much as they can that I have zero trust in their BS4 lab being properly constructed and procedures followed correctly.<p>They also covered up the discovery of a very similar virus some years ago (they actively anonymised records around it after covid19 emerged) in a bat cave (no pun intended) which already appeared to have bat-human transmission.<p>It is something like 96% similar to covid19 though some scientists say it isn&#x27;t feasible that it evolved into covid19 except in nature. However I wonder whether some form of natural evolution of the virus was experimented on or encouraged in the lab or whether this assumption is in fact correct.<p>So the lab thing is definitely up for debate, however the general attitude from much of the media and certainly China is to dismiss it as a crackpot theory. Absolutely don&#x27;t think it is.<p>Also I personally do not believe at all that any of this was intentional. I think it&#x27;s a mixture of negligence, cover-up and face saving.<p>Keeping in mind the next virus might not be a 0.4% case fatality rate that mostly kills the very old, it&#x27;s deeply frightening.')
