Conversely, this mainstream culture is also the source of the visceral disgust some people have for lawyers, journalists, activists, and other people who affect being underdogs so they aren&#x27;t held to the standards of honest people, and then antagonize others using those dominant rules as a cover. The same can be said for trolls. What it comes down to is this calculus of self permission to act like a piece of shit because you identify as the underdog.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not the platforms, it&#x27;s the single idea that identifying as an outsider, resister, pariah, defender, or challenger, justifies cruelty because being &quot;good,&quot; is defined by your chosen bugbear. The reality is the mainstream is not &quot;good,&quot; the public sphere is an open sewer, and the only things that float in it are turds. It&#x27;s not a right&#x2F;left thing, it&#x27;s a conflict between people competing for mainstream power and people trying to find freedom from that mainstream&#x27;s domain, with some of each self-identifying as beneath decency.<p>What a great insight.<p>My opinion is that this comes down to the fact that we cannot be good in public.  The more &quot;in public&quot; we are, the more dishonest we are.<p>The private sphere -- family, close friends, personal intimacy, etc -- is where people are at their best.  We can be honest there.  We can show weakness, we can apologize, we can compromise and we can forgive.<p>The internet has made lots of things public that used to be private.  It is also taking things that were public and making them more public.  This is making the world worse.<p>Since I know you&#x27;ve read Hannah Arendt, this matches up well with her assertion that &quot;in politics, love is a stranger, and when it intrudes upon it nothing is being achieved except hypocrisy&quot; and &quot;hatred and love belong together, and they are both destructive;  you can afford them only in the private&quot;.  She insisted on glory -- not goodness or justice or love -- as the sole criterion for political action.')
