The number one thing I use my phone for is checking bus routes (second is store times which can be very odd, especially with the pandemic). I know some routes off the top of my head but not the majority. Plus although I always plan where I&#x27;m going before hand so I know the streets (although many are missing signs), what time things are open, if the buses are actually working (apart from strikes, sometimes a bus line might be diverted due to construction&#x2F;protests), often I end up going more places than I plan and end up needing to take a different bus than I had planned back.<p>I mean if I get my phone stolen or something I&#x27;ll still be fine, but I don&#x27;t get how having to hunt down road signs and depending on others to tell you the right info can possible feel liberating? I have navigated the city before it&#x27;s bus app was built and internet was reliable, and it was not fun. Plus recently I&#x27;ve had problems with my contacts and because I can&#x27;t stand my full prescription in glasses I can&#x27;t see far away so it&#x27;s been even more liberating to have my phone. I can quickly glance at google maps (even without internet and just gps on) and see where I am. Extremely useful in buses where I&#x27;m too far to see the road signs at all. I would hate having to ask the driver all the time to drop me off at the right street.')
