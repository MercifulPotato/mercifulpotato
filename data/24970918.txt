The machine learning approach is really the variational approach but using very expensive (lots of parameter) functions instead of cleverly choosing your fitting function so that it has parameters which are physically meaningful and significantly fewer in number.  The first helps with building a meaningful story of the underlying physics while the second means you need fewer data points.')
