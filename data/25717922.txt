I think everyone in the SSB maintainer community feels the same way.<p>My hot take: Scuttlebutt should be something that you can implement yourself in an afternoon. I&#x27;ve done this a few times, using Python, Node.js, and Deno, but I&#x27;ve only implemented the message type. (Not Multiserver, MuxRPC, Secret-Handshake, Box-Strean, Private-Box, or any of the other protocols that are associated with SSB.)<p>&gt; It feels like Git.<p>You got it. You could express an SSB chain with Git and a pre-commit hook (to verify messages), but using Git as your database is even harder than learning the toy database that SSB uses.<p>Various links:<p>- My SSB data expressed as a Git repository (outdated): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;ssb-git-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;ssb-git-data</a><p>- My speedrun SSB implementation with SQLite, using HTTP for replication: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;http-ssb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;http-ssb</a>')
