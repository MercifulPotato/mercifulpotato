If a company is able to create self driving cars, what&#x27;s the value add provided by Uber and Lyft? Having a middleman TNC platform skim some profits doesn&#x27;t really make sense from that perspective.<p>Compared to achieving reliable and cost effective autonomy at scale, building a ride sharing app is trivial, and customers have indicated that they&#x27;re willing to install another app if the fares are cheaper. The complexity of getting a self driving service is high enough that there probably will be only a few entrants in the market, unlike the current value add provided by the TNC apps that match customers with a large pool of individual providers.')
