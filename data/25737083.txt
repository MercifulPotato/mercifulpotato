As the term of the elected government was coming to an end, so were the terms of 5 of the justices in the Tribunal. However, two of these terms ended within the elected government&#x27;s term, and three after it ended. As a result, the ruling party (PO) had a clear right to nominate 2 justices, and hardly any right to nominate the other three. It decided to nominate all 5 nevertheless.<p>The party that won the subsequent election, PiS, refused to recognize any of the 5 justices nominated by PO, and nominated 5 of their own. What happened afterwards you can read in the Wikipedia article.')
