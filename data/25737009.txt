It is a drag and drop data munging tool for datasets up to a few million rows. It runs locally on Windows or Mac. You should be able to install it and start transforming your data within a few minutes. It doesn&#x27;t have a built in scheduler (yet), but you can run it from the command line.<p>Excel Power Query is also quite lightweight. But is pretty klunky in my (biased) opinion.')
