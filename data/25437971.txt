What kind of digital death would that be as you would NEVER be able to recover your accounts, at least for most people who don&#x27;t have 2FA.<p>An interesting problem - I have a gmail address, and also one on my personal domain (which uses g-suite for email). The personal domain&#x27;s backup is a gmail address, and the gmail&#x27;s backup is my personal domain. When I set that up ages ago, I genuinely never thought about what happens if gmail itself implodes.<p>I guess I&#x27;m setting up a... icloud??? backup email for a bunch of stuff shortly.')
