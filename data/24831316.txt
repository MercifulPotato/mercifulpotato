That point where it gets hard and you force yourself to keep going even through.the parts you don&#x27;t enjoy.<p>School forces you to do this, if you&#x27;re teaching yourself something, you need to force yourself to do this.<p>I can&#x27;t count the number of times i&#x27;ve heard someone say something like<p>&#x27;I tried learning&#x2F;doing this new thing and it was fun for a bit but it ended up being way harder than I thought.&#x27;<p>And that&#x27;s usually the point where they&#x27;ve given up or moved on.<p>But that&#x27;s usually the point where learning breakthroughs happen and getting through the grind tends to cement those new facts or that new activity better.<p>That&#x27;s usually the point where it starts being fun again too, until the next hump to grind through.<p>It&#x27;s like an old nintendo game or something. One of those really hard ones that forces you to replay the same thing over and over again just to gain the tiniest bit of progress. Even though the game&#x27;s probably fun, that&#x27;s the point where people start throwing controllers and stuff. Yet when you get past those hard sections and make some progress. Suddenly, you feel good and have fun again.<p>Learning things is very much the same process. Even things you enjoy. The secret is to push yourself through the less fun parts.<p>Just quickly too, more of an aside, I feel like modern games lack this aspect and i think it&#x27;s a big part of why many people complain about modern games. They don&#x27;t stimulate and teach you through failure and repitition, there&#x27;s usually no consequences, you have no breakthrough &#x27;Aha I can do this now&#x27; moments, there&#x27;s no learning or lessons to be had. Just mindless progression that never really feels like progress.')
