As I write this it occurs to me that an Artist (Shakespeare) and the King James Bible, had a significant effect on consolidating what became modern English.<p>If computer languages follow natural languages then a continuous evolution of existing languages will occur over time whether we like it or not. I think we can see some evidence for that in the oldest computer languages that we have. It would also follow that some languages disappear over time ...<p>In natural language development I have read that it takes about 1000 years for a language to become unintelligible if separated from its mother tongue.

A human can&#x27;t understand the code?<p>There might be some room for cross discipline research here.\nEnglish faculty and Comp.
