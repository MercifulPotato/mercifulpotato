Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610121611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685139, text='&gt; Russia Today etc is a little more factually flexible.<p>Russia Today is a state-run propaganda outlet specifically structured to engage viewers and shift perspectives outside of Russia about Russian behaviors and affairs.  It&#x27;s essentially the Russian government pulling a &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;[1] against the US, and it&#x27;s no surprise that RT has become a darling for conspiracy theorists and right-wing trolls in the US since.<p>Calling RT &quot;factually flexible&quot; is hilarious and far too charitable.  The grandparent has a point that their green sources tend to be biased towards a pro-West point-of-view, but pointedly they&#x27;re also all sources which exist (for better or for worse) as editorially independent from their governments, and have a strong history of criticism of their own government as well as governments around the world.  The sources considered yellow aren&#x27;t merely biased, they have a history of being shills, choosing not to run stories or to outright lie when it benefits their government or political agenda.  Many of the red sources could only be quantitatively considered &quot;fake news&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not a mistake that US&#x2F;UK based sources are more reliable than sources elsewhere, and while it likely is somewhat influenced by the bias of the people making the list, it&#x27;s also heavily influenced by the reality of the situation.  Most of the world, especially the developing world, does not have a true freedom of the press that has been established in the West for far longer.  This situation is shifting, to some degree, but we&#x27;ve also seen backslides.  Honest journalism and press freedom isn&#x27;t something we can take for granted, we must actively fight to keep it and to hold journalists and governments accountable as a people.  It was just in 2018 that Hungary (an EU member state) had it&#x27;s &#x2F;last&#x2F; opposition non-state media outlet shut down under threat, and now has all of its Hungarian-language news completely beholden to the state.  This isn&#x27;t a case unique to the developing world, it&#x27;s happening in parts of Europe too, and we&#x27;ve seen dangerous shifts in the US.<p>I think the grandparent&#x27;s complaint is honestly more biased than this list, and reveals that they hold resentment towards the West and believe (rightly) that the world is dominated by a Western narrative as an outcome of the US global hegemony.  What they fail to admit to themselves is that this also is the driving force behind press freedom increasing globally, because the natural state of affairs is for media to avoid stepping on toes, and they must admit that most of the outlets they&#x27;ve listed, including the Times of India, have taken blatant actions that would call their reliability into question.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_Free_Europe&#x2F;Radio_Liberty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_Free_Europe&#x2F;Radio_Libert...</a>')
