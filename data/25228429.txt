When the natural environment is changing, there is a bigger need for contrarians because there is a possibility that the changed environment is detrimental to the population or there could be better opportunities because of the changes to the environment. However, in stable times, contrarians are a nuisance or even a threat to the stability of the society. It&#x27;s much more valuable most of the time for most of the people to do what you know and keep it at that.<p>As a contrarian, I am fortunate enough to be in the current time and place where I&#x27;m less likely to be executed for my &quot;wrong&quot; views because some of it is applied in places where it is very useful and I&#x27;m a net benefit to the society. If and when things become stable again, our kind will be silenced and curbed.<p>I would want to have a future where it is understood that the human population is bigger than the individual... and these variations exist because it is beneficial to the the population in the long term... and these differences should be celebrated... but maybe the effort required to maintain this understanding in the population is not worth it overall over getting rid of us by silencing or executing us. So, my kind will make do by understanding that this is happening and learn to shut up and stay low until when things change and we&#x27;re needed again.')
