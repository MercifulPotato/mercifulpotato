I&#x27;m happy to help! I just had a similar issue this morning, and I asked in the Ruby on Rails Link slack [1]. They&#x27;re pretty helpful in there.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my issue was that Heroku was running `rake assets:precompile` without node_modules being installed. This was because `yarn install` failed. I looked closely at the logs and saw an error about the yarn file needing to be updated (the lockfile pins exact versions). So I ran `yarn install` locally to update it, redeployed, and it worked. So far I&#x27;ve been able to use node modules with sprockets this way just fine (in JS and Sass). Webpack-generated JS bundles work well too. Anyway, happy to help in there, just tag me :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rubyonrails.link&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rubyonrails.link&#x2F;</a>')
