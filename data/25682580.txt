Can that be a fact?<p>Here&#x27;s Congress already asking the same questions, and a few more facts supporting surprisingly bad and out of character police behavior [2]. This is only 1 day after the event - give it a few to see if it takes off.<p>The statements by trained intelligence professional are not facts? Sometimes by looking at evidence and seeing there is likely more going one leads one to dig and find more facts, right?<p>Many in law enforcement have called what happened ridiculously surprising. Assuming it was all just random bad luck and not investigating it in detail is a sure way screw up again, whether it was bad luck or had some component of insider issues.<p>Certainly Congress has fired some people over it, some have resigned, and it looks like Congress is certainly going to investigate.<p>Just a few months ago capitol police certainly had multiple layers of police around the Capitol building, so it&#x27;s clear they can do that. This time they didn&#x27;t, despite being given ample warning many in the crowd have been posting for weeks they will storm the building.<p>So I don&#x27;t know either way, and neither do you, but these questions are from reputable sources, not some far out left wing rag, so it&#x27;s worth looking into them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.syracuse.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;national-guard-troops-noticeably-absent-as-pro-trump-mob-swarms-capitol.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.syracuse.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;national-guard-troops-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;lawmakers-demand-answers-outrage-explodes-us-capitol-policing&#x2F;story?id=75120929" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;lawmakers-demand-answers-outrage-e...</a>')
