There are too many cram schools which teach you how to pass a hacker rank test and many junior developers will beat the crap out of seniors just because they know how to game the system. It ends up optimising your hiring pipeline for people who have time to cram.<p>The same problem happens with take home tests. It pretty much optimises for people with more time on their hands (i.e. people who don&#x27;t currently have a job, people without kids etc).<p>In both cases a lot of good people will be filtered out. Some people think it&#x27;s good to avoid bad hires at all costs but I don&#x27;t think wasting people&#x27;s time is particularly ethical.')
