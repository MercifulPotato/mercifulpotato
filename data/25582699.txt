Item(by='searchableguy', descendants=None, kids=[25582993, 25582932, 25582883], score=None, time=1609343617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582289, text='&gt; if Amazon won&#x27;t police (and they have problems with commingling counterfeit brands, too) then Walmart and Target will jump ahead.<p>I think they are solving this differently. Amazon introduced their own brands for almost all daily necessities. Amazon basic, amazon pharmacy, amazon fashion, amazon elements, amazon pantry, amazon echo and few more. They generally have average or above average products at an affordable price and good support.<p>You can buy AC, fridge, vacuum cleaner, clothes, baby food, dog food, dog bed, multi-vitamin, ramen, TWS, carpet, blanket, swiss army knife, solder machine, and a lot more from amazon itself now.')
