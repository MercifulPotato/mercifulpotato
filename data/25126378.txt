These terminate at a “package” which contains the chip on which the superconducting qubits are located.<p>The disks (we call them plates) are different temperature stages for the refrigerator, with lower stages being colder than upper stages. The  last stage has operating temperature ~10-20mK. Then 100 mK, 1K, 3K, 50K and lastly room temperature. Most of the other things on the refrigerator are involved either in signal filtering, thermal anchoring, or thermal isolation. When operational, all of the stages are enclosed in multiple cylindrical thermal shields. The outermost layer is the “vacuum can” which is airtight and allows for the whole thing to operate under internal vacuum.<p>Edit: This is just one type of quantum computing device. Others, such as trapped ion or neutral atom rigs would look radically different. Larger vacuum enclosures, different ways of performing control&#x2F;read operations (lasers!), etc.')
