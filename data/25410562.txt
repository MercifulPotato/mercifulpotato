The street combat that led to the NSDAP&#x27;s seizure of power was closely tied to fear of foreign communist influences. I really don&#x27;t know how you would argue humanity needed either of them... even one in opposition to the other (with the added caveat, I know, that the Eastern Front was where the substantial proportion of German casualties occurred -- how much is Stalin? Impossible to say, futile to guess in my view).')
