Item(by='rileymat2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610747646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796523, text='I don&#x27;t particularly want to go on hate sites to find examples at this moment.<p>But the gist is, there are statements that are not falsifiable, like that &quot;inferior race&quot; that is not fact, it is the conclusion, but it is not falsifiable easily because there is no clear metric being used for that judgment.<p>If you look at U.S. race based hate sites that are easiest to find now, you will see things like accurate references to crime rates and such. The number is true, but it is missing all kinds of context and correlations and such.<p>For example, I have seen many references to lower IQ scores for certain groups.  There are many ways to interpret this, but the racists use it as evidence.  The &quot;number&quot; is true.<p>Also, the anecdotes they tell are largely true, but to pick and choose emotional one off examples is misleading.<p>By warping &quot;true&quot; things, you maintain credibility.<p>Look at some of the election stuff. For example, if someone said &quot;They were bringing suitcases into the polling place&quot; (I can&#x27;t remember the exact details) There is video it is true, but it is not nefarious.  But it takes a long time to rebuff the implication and explain proper procedure.<p>Now, I may have overstated &quot;best&quot;, because the best is emotional, and a lot of that is art, nothing to do with fact, and portrayal of the enemy. You see this in a lot of the Nazi imagery. It has nothing to do with facts, true or false.')
