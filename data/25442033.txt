I haven&#x27;t personally seen this, but I guess that doesn&#x27;t really mean it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>What I <i>have</i> seen is pretty horrific abuse of Linq (i.e. repeated lookup of `things.Where(t =&gt; t.Id == query.Id).First()` as if it was a dictionary) which might stem from the same root cause - not thinking about what your code is actually doing and why it might be inefficient. It doesn&#x27;t help that there&#x27;s that there&#x27;s those oft-quoted Bentley&#x27;s Rules of Optimization which gives people an excuse to not care :-&#x2F;')
