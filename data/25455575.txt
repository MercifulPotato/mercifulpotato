A developer wants to develop&#x2F;test against an x.y release that only changes minimally (major bug and security fixes) for an extended period of time.<p>2.) The point release model where you can decide when&#x2F;if to install upgrades is just &quot;how we&#x27;ve always done things&quot; and a lot of people just aren&#x27;t comfortable with changing that (even if they effectively already have with any software in public clouds or SaaS).<p>I largely agree with your other points.')
