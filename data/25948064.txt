What’s your least favorite definition of the term that you see in these stories?</i><p><i>Yann LeCun: My least favorite description is, “It works just like the brain.” I don’t like people saying this because, while Deep Learning gets an inspiration from biology, it’s very, very far from what the brain actually does. And describing it like the brain gives a bit of the aura of magic to it, which is dangerous. It leads to hype; people claim things that are not true. AI has gone through a number of AI winters because people claimed things they couldn’t deliver.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;automaton&#x2F;artificial-intelligence&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;facebook-ai-director-yann-lecun-on-deep-learning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;automaton&#x2F;artificial-intelligence&#x2F;...</a>')
