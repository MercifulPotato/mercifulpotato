Last year it was so little snow (until it suddenly was a lot, but then it was covid...). With home office and all those routines now, I&#x27;m dreaming about cross country skiing during an extended lunch break and then going back home and work some more. Would be nice actually seeing the sun, not just ski in the evening with a head mounted light.<p>While I think other commenters are right that it&#x27;s nothing unique about the Nordics to be outside, I think Norway is a notch above Sweden (and many others) in going outside no matter the weather. I commute by bike all year, and during winter I would like to cross country ski X times a week, no matter the temperature or conditions.')
