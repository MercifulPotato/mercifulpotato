I’ve noticed an innocuous post today only a minute old already downvoted. “RMS” and “nutcase” were in the post, but not in a derogatory context. Sub-120 second action is an improbable level of attention from human moderation, and the action would seem quite capricious. However, if there were some sentiment-analysis algorithm (which can’t contextualize words well) processing comments and “moderating” as they are posted, then that sort of thing makes perfect sense.<p>It’s social media. Nothing is on the up and up. Everyone has an angle, puts a thumb on the scale and talks their book. Just don’t take it too seriously.')
