For instance, how does your bootloader know how to mount an encrypted boot partition, load whatever needs loaded, and then mount other encrypted disks as necessary. Where do you even _store_ your bootloader if the boot partition is encrypted? Which specific encryption method do you use?<p>I&#x27;ve been using Linux since 2010 and when I went through this process, it took me several evenings to get it right as well, but now I have a much better understanding of how my system actually works under the hood. It&#x27;s a valuable exercise, but comparing it to the polished install experience that e.g. Ubuntu or Fedora have, it&#x27;s a pretty fair amount of work required.')
