Hard, if not impossible, to catch up as a competitior, especially when you have trillion dollar companies backing them.<p>However, if you cannot trust those products then you cannot use them.<p>Remember, this thread is about Github blocking an entire company due to one employee due to American politics. If a non-US company risks to lose it project management&#x2F;code management (Github), its infrastructure (AWS) or its documents (Office 365) on a whim due to American policies then they cannot use those products.<p>If a big enough chunk of the world can&#x27;t use the American offerings, then there is a market for alternatives.')
