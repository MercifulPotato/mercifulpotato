Conspiracy theories, like cat pictures, are perfectly legal, there&#x27;s no reason why there should be legal consequences for allowing them on the site.<p>&gt; <i>they can remove anything they like because they don&#x27;t want to promote it while calling it a baseless conspiracy theory, also with no consequence</i><p>Yes, when you own a website you can pick and choose what appears on the site, that&#x27;s just how property rights work. If I decide I want to create a social network that adheres to a policy of explicit partisan bias I should have that right, the users will decide if that is something they want to use.<p>&gt; <i>This is an extremely influential position that is created by law and gives them extraordinary latitude at shaping perceptions.<p>You can&#x27;t legislate influence, it&#x27;s not something that anybody owns, it&#x27;s freely given by individual users and can be trivially revoked at any time. This dynamic is exactly the reason why YouTube is so sensitive to social issues, their influence among target demographics will suffer if they fail to appease certain values. Consider the recent collapse of Fox News&#x27; influence as another example of this effect on the opposite side of the spectrum.<p>&gt; </i>Well those are political issues. I agree that &quot;literally anything&quot; can be framed as political, I don&#x27;t agree that my criticism lacks practical meaning as a result*<p>Yet they&#x27;re not inherently political, the efficacy of masks and vaccines are well established from a medical perspective. The reason why it lacks practical meaning is because there is no agreed upon definition for what meets the standard of political.<p>&gt; <i>race, sex, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, religion.</i><p>The protected classes are discrete personal qualities of the individual, &quot;political leaning&quot; is an abstract idea without clear boundaries. You might as well say &quot;I&#x27;m against discrimination of people based on their ideas&quot;, the concept is just too nebulous to be meaningful.')
