Bing wouldn&#x27;t accept it. DuckDuckGo wouldn&#x27;t accept it. Qwant probably wouldn&#x27;t, for that matter. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and HN wouldn&#x27;t (in fact, Reddit actively lobbied against the EUCD).<p>The publishers went after Google because it&#x27;s both the biggest mark and also the most unpopular.<p>If they wanted to be principled, they&#x27;d apply the same law to Bing, Facebook, Reddit, etc. Except they won&#x27;t, because Bing, Facebook and Reddit would simply remove any links to French news sites, and they would be hard pressed to make a case for monopoly power when every single content platform reacts the same way.')
