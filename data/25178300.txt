I don&#x27;t think both could continue to grow and thrive without each other though.<p>Android, Youtube, Google Search, Gmail and Google Maps feel like the only things that keep Alphabet relevant.<p>Google search ads appear to be a losing battle with uBlock, pi hole, etc. I also think a significant portion of their users have trained themselves to skip the results marked as Ads altogether when looking for results. The saving grace in this space has been the mobile landscape where they can be gatekeepers to prevent ad blocking.<p>Alphabet&#x2F;Google has already been walled out of most social spaces, Tiktok, Snapchat, Instagram (not entirely), WeChat, and WhatsApp.<p>Youtube is fairly unique with the ability to embed the ads within the video stream itself.<p>It is technically possible on the technological side, but at what time and effort cost? It would be a lot of effort to break apart all of the infrastructure that YouTube has that is general Alphabet infrastructure.<p>My understanding would be their costs would both go up as well because their volume would decrease as standalone entities.<p>It would be a bold &amp; interesting change but I don&#x27;t foresee it in the near future unless DoJ breaks them up.')
