After the yellow vests events certainly the gov wants to reestablish it&#x27;s place.<p>That aside, I&#x27;m not in a big city. I&#x27;m in the suburbs. I&#x27;m talking about the local park and such. My morning run is through a local small university, currently closed. I see more deer than people some mornings. In that context, I&#x27;ve seen people from a distance walking alone with a mask on. It&#x27;s 8 am. No one else around. There&#x27;s no scientific reason for a mask.<p>I believe masks are important. They are essential. But that&#x27;s no justification for unnecessary masks. In fact, we should be conserving masks. Not wearing them when they&#x27;re not necessary.')
