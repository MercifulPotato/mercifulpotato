Not a democracy.)<p>If the equal protection clause can justify protected classes applying to private business, then inherently, political view <i>must</i> be protected.<p>If we were talking about a diner, it wouldn&#x27;t mean I could stand up and lecture other patrons on politics. It <i>would</i> mean the diner couldn&#x27;t refuse service based on my politics.<p>The difference with social media is: the entire purpose of it is to share and distribute the speech of users. Therefore, being denied service, or receiving different treatment, based on the content of that speech becomes discriminatory.<p>This is before you even begin to consider &quot;public square&quot; aspects of the platforms. Similar to how Company Towns were not allowed to infringe on the speech of employees, even though the company owned the streets and town square. \n(Marsh v. Alabama)')
