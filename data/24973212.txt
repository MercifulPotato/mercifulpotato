This can be used to produce summary tables in a variety of ways, which I usually cleaned up a little before plugging into an invoice (typically monthly or by project, sometimes more often).  They don&#x27;t have to be pretty, just accurate.<p>I&#x27;ve also used an accounting system like xero which will generate invoices and give payment options, but that was more about the back end matching an accountant&#x27;s system.')
