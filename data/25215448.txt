I don&#x27;t think this question has any meaning without being qualified.<p>Assuming you are saying as an investment, I think a plausible worst case scenario is that a major government, let&#x27;s say the US, makes it illegal to move their currency on to crypto exchanges and kills all legitimate on ramps.<p>Bitcoin would survive this but I would guess it&#x27;s price would go down somewhere between 10 and 100x .
