The sport. Fans, parties, passion, excitement for race results.<p>2. Advertising showcase of engineering prowess for companies selling cars or car-related parts.<p>3. A testing ground for future production car technology, send your best engineers to learn under the pressure of F1.<p>With commoditized electric cars taking over the road car market, this no longer works because the interests have diverged. By trying to continue to do all three, F1 is just imploding.<p>Personally I wish F1 would focus on #1 and let Formula E be the proving ground for street car tech.')
