Banks can also shut down your account at will; they have to give you your money but they don&#x27;t have to continue providing any services. And banking is private but social media is public. It&#x27;s reasonable that if a social network closes your account they should give you a backup, but forcing social networks to continue hosting offensive material in public because the user &quot;owns&quot; their account sounds untenable, especially since the user doesn&#x27;t pay.')
