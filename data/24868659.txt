I think his theory favours the latter by far. Instead of increase quantity by writing bigger articles, write lots of articles.<p>I do agree with your latter points about bad practise. I think this works best for forms of output where bad work has relatively little downside for the individual. It&#x27;s harder to get bad habits that dampen your growth in things like writing, art etc and so this system works great for those types of activity. Maybe a good way to think about it is that you need a base level of skill to then improve. In writing most folk will have the base skills from school (spelling, grammar etc), whereas in software you first need to learn the basics (syntax, high level incepts like classes and functions, debugging etc) and then this theory will work for you.')
