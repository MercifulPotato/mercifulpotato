They included multiple datetimes, such as the scheduled departure&#x2F;arrival time and the real departure&#x2F;arrival time of a flight.<p>The first bottleneck was JSON deserializarion&#x2F;serializarion. At that time we solved it with ujson, and now there&#x27;s the even more performant orjson.<p>The second bottleneck happened to be datetime deserializarion. And we solved it with ciso8601 - luckily, these datetimes were in ISO8601. But this bottleneck later repeatedly occured in the other components and became an inspiration to write dtparse :)')
