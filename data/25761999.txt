I&#x27;ll use the 2000 election as a concrete example to avoid a more charged recent one. Presuming that 270 electoral votes worth of states had signed up for the compact before the election, and then a couple of them had defected &quot;too late&quot; for the other states to react, the end result would still be in keeping with the goal of the compact. At worst, a &quot;partial compact&quot; has no effect, and at best it still accomplishes the goal of the &quot;full&quot; compact.')
