Climate varies from region to region and the past 150 years in California were unusually wet.  This is for California, not the whole world.  100 years ago, when you say California&#x27;s fire management was working well, California&#x27;s climate was unusually wet.  California is naturally more inclined to burn than most other parts of the world, up there with Australia and Siberia.  Most of the rest of the world is not nearly so imperilled as California and it&#x27;s not because everybody is is better at managing forests.')
