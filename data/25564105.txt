There&#x27;s easy parts (ie. publicly traded equities) and hard parts (eg. art collections).<p>I&#x27;ve been skeptical of skepticism (lol) of the wealth tax mostly because the easy parts dominate the hard parts. Most wealth is in the easily identifiable areas (ie. equities and property) not the hard areas. Even with private companies like some startup, surely the shares have some known valuation right?<p>My point is though that we&#x27;ve already built a bureaucratic apparatus to evaluate wealth in our property assessment system so surely it&#x27;s possible to extend this.<p>A possible implementation would be to mostly ignore the &quot;hard&quot; sectors of wealth (eg. car collections&#x2F;art collections) or do random audits of the tricky parts just to keep people honest.')
