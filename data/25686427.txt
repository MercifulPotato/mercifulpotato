You can read the report here. [0]<p>&gt; While the allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission (FEC.gov) guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots (.0008 percent), ASOG’s forensic analysis observed an error rate of 68.05 percent, which is a significant and fatal error in security and election integrity.<p>&gt; In the ASOG audit, all log entries for the 2020 election cycle were found missing in the Dominion equipment they analyzed—meanwhile voter adjudication logs for previous years exist. Removal of these log files violates state laws and prevents a meaningful audit, even if the Secretary of State’s office wanted to conduct its own audit.<p>&gt; The ASOG audit also discovered software changes on Oct. 23, 2020, and then again on Nov. 5, 2020, just after the election. In accordance with the Help America Vote Act, this violates the 90-day Safe Harbor period which prohibits changes to election systems, without these systems undergoing recertification.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;20423772-antrim-county-forensics-report" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;20423772-antrim-cou...</a>')
