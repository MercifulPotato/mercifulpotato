It&#x27;s hot, humid, comes with tornadoes, you have to drive everywhere (and everywhere is set up on the assumption you will drive). Plus, I will never forget the clerk at the licensing office who, after the rules changed to require &quot;proof of legal status&quot; to renew a driving license, gave my wife shit for having &quot;married up to America&quot; when she presented her green card as proof of status.  (Never mind that my wife had been a permanent resident for years prior to us meeting.)<p>Everywhere has its upsides and its flaws, but at least where I live now has the benefit of the vast majority of people and culture here doesn&#x27;t want to throw my loved ones out on their ear.  Perhaps some of the new arrivals moving there will change that culture.  I hope so.')
