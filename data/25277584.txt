Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=[25279529], score=None, time=1606924864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25275275, text='That&#x27;s the kind of explanation you get from anyone breaking the law and claiming it was because the law not conducive to the greater good. Every regulated sector could get the same characterization from entities failing to meet said regulation making all of it in effect invalid. Uber has deep enough pockets to lobby for changing regulation but that would apply to everyone and they would again have to fight on a level playing field. They broke the law for profit.<p>Robbery is illegal even if you steal from a criminal, or if people are BEGGING for someone to do it. Sure, when it&#x27;s a social movement it&#x27;s still breaking the law but has a different moral value. As it stands the value now is in Uber&#x27;s pockets.<p>&gt; The solution to this problem is not &quot;make Uber follow the tax regulations&quot; which seems to be what you are suggesting<p>No. Not only did I literally start my comment with &lt;I never said (or meant only) &quot;tax loopholes&quot;&gt;, I also ended it with:<p>&gt; &gt; The solution to an industry being crap isn&#x27;t to allow someone to bypass existing regulation, it&#x27;s to create a set of effective regulations that can be applied equally to everyone.<p>I&#x27;m trying to assume good faith but replying to me while completely ignoring the content of my comment or twisting my words to imply the exact opposite of what I said is disrespectful and disqualifies your opinion in my eyes at least. Pretty sure also in the letter and spirit of HN&#x27;s guidelines. Makes it seem like you don&#x27;t want to be part of a conversation but rather throw your personal ideas out there everything else be damned.')
