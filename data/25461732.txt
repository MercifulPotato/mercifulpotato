Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[25464889, 25464842], score=None, time=1608246584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461550, text='&gt; Why did you skip the Swedish example?<p>Because I don&#x27;t know anything about Swedish language :)<p>&gt; This is English speaking folks that have adopted a Spanish word and are now making it gender neutral by skipping the last letter.<p>Which is silly, because &quot;Latinos&quot; is already gender neutral in its actual use, both in Spanish and in English. It declenses in Spanish using masculine form, but as the above example of chair and desk, grammatical gender of a noun doesn&#x27;t have to say anything about gender of whatever it refers to. It does in the case of the word &quot;latinos&quot;, but it only says that the group is not all-female: this is the gender neutral form.<p>&gt;  They are under no obligation to keep following the the original language&#x27;s grammar.<p>Sure, there is no obligation. They could also decide to just call all groups of people from Latin America &quot;Latinas&quot;, or just do away with that stem altogether, and just use &quot;Hispanic&quot; instead. Of course, in the former case, the Spanish speakers would be very confused that Americans keep insisting on only referring to females, and in the latter, the Brazilians might get confused why they are now called Hispanic. But, they&#x27;d be wrong to have any concerns about this, because languages are completely arbitrary, and Americans are under no obligation to have their language make any sense or be consistent with anything else.<p>The above is, of course, absurd, just like the word &quot;Latinxs&quot;. Just use the word Latinos, which is already gender neutral, if you happen to care about it.')
