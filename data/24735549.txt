Item(by='W6uNIlLti0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602287323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735422, text='&gt; It&#x27;s kind of sad that you imply that people who just live according to their culture are &quot;less good&quot;, or &quot;cheaper&quot;, or &quot;less experienced&quot;.<p>Not sure how you got this from what I wrote. \nI was responding directly to -<p>&quot;..The culture is totally different and IMO not conducive to innovation, critical thinking and constructive feedback - it is the opposite...&quot;<p>I was trying to say don&#x27;t look down condescendingly on other cultures and expect to develop a great working relationship. Experience with different teams and people gives you cultural awareness, where you learn how to motivate, communicate with different people effectively.<p>Anyway, all I can say is I have worked with multiple teams from different countries and cultures, and haven&#x27;t had the challenging experience you mention. So, when you use your personal experience to make a generalized claim, I feel its inaccurate.<p>So, felt compelled to leave a comment. I am not looking to change your opinion though.')
