A thought just popped into my head on this topic. There&#x27;s apparently a podcast called Troubled that specifically tackles this topic. I have no idea if it&#x27;s good or not, but it was also suggested to me. I didn&#x27;t get around to it because I don&#x27;t really listen to podcasts often. You might find some interesting people on that!')
