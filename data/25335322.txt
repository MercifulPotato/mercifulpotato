Sure, any tech worker can work remotely for any employer... In theory. In practice, timezone distance is becoming the new relevant measure of distance.<p>The further you are (in TZ distance) from an organization’s management, the less opportunities are available to you in that organization, because the degraded communication will make it impossible for you to fully participate in the decision-making process.<p>So I think that the most skilled tech workers over time will gravitate to areas which combine 1) high quality of living and 2) minimal timezone distance from management.')
