How often did you go out running in the rain in the last five years? How much more often would you run in the rain if you had those shoes?<p>If you end up paying $20 extra for the watertight shoes but only end up running 2 or 3 extra hours in the rain and wear the shoes out the normal way... sorry to tell you, but they scammed you plain and simple. If you use the expensive shoes only when raining and keep another pair for regular use... you may get the worth of your money back after several years, but then you have to consider if the opportunity cost of those $100. Did buying that offer was [one of] the best thing you could have done?')
