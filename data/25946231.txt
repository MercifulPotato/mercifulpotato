I&#x27;m not leveraged. The whole bit about &quot;protecting the retail investor&quot; is absurd. There is nothing to protect and they face no harm from me since its not margined. I can lose all my equity and that is it. I am the one who faces harm -- because I cant actually get out of the trade of a lifetime.<p>Second thing -- I think there were many things going on and many cohorts on WSB.<p>- Cohort 1: possibly pump and dump (though, this happens all the time with hedge fund managers also trying to move their position...)...or perhaps 22yos excited by GameStop, not that hard to imagine. GME has been a huge discussion on WSB for months.<p>- Cohort 2: 22yos YOLO&#x27;ing their weekly stipend and stimulus check. No real though about pump and dump and more so just silly gambling.<p>- Cohort 3: Intelligent investors seeing an opportunity, not manipulating any more than a hedge fund manager does (see: Infinite Gamma Squeeze notice: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3e54f&#x2F;gme_infinite_gamma_squeeze_gap_in_option_market&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3e54f&#x2F;gme_infinite...</a>)<p>- Cohort 4: Downtrodden retail &quot;investors&quot; looking to stick it to the man: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;inactivist_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354537152445521923&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;inactivist_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354537152445521923&#x2F;p...</a><p>- Cohort 5: Onlookers on WSB (im a frequent reader, never post) looking to hitch a wagon to the runaway train.')
