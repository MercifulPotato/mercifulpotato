Sort of a crowd-sourced ifixit for anything broken. It would be hard as hell to get good content, but if you could I think it would be gold.<p>It would be so hard to maintain repair guides with how frequently products update these days.

The doors look identical, but the internal latch works differently. Overall that would have been fine, but I got blocked on the door part because the procedure didn&#x27;t work and I assumed I was going to break it if I tried something else, haha. Turned out I just needed to push in and slide down.')
