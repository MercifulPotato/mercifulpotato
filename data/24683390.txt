Item(by='gus_massa', descendants=None, kids=[24687128], score=None, time=1601857282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678980, text='&gt; <i>Everyone in the discussion is well aware that the 2nd. law</i><p>Probably not, but it is good to know that you are.<p>The paper is not about a device that harvest energy from the thermal variations of the environment. There is no mention of macroscopic thermal variations in the press release or in the abstract of the paper. Also, the graphene is inside a ultra high vacuum chamber, that is a weird place to put a device that that depends on the macroscopic thermal variations of the environment.<p>From the abstract:<p>&gt; <i>However, there is power dissipated by the load resistor, and its time average is exactly equal to the power supplied by the thermal bath.</i><p>My interpretation is that the resistor is dissipating some power (from the graphics ~1pW), but it is also absorbing the same amount of power due to the 2nd law. It is not a Carnot engine that produces work from heat.')
