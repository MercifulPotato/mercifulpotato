In addition to the number of destination registers, you do, to a more relaxed extent, care about source operands, but also things like ‘does this fit nicely in a single pass through the pipeline?’ and even just ‘is this materially beneficial?’<p>Lots of cores (but not all) can write two registers from a fused instruction, given the right conditions, and sov does rerun the addition, so add-sov fusion sounds very doable to me.')
