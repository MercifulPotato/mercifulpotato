At what rate does the heated exterior of the car conduct heat into the interior?  Etc.<p>I don&#x27;t know these quantities myself.  As I wrote the above message, it seemed <i>possible</i> that the effect could turn out to be very small and not worth bothering about; I vaguely remembered reading that it might be a few degrees.

When we measured the interior temperature after a few hours, ... The black car’s cabin measured a scorching 130 degrees Fahrenheit, while the white car’s interior registered only 113 degrees.&quot;  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autotrader.com&#x2F;car-video&#x2F;car-color-test-are-black-cars-really-hotter-sun-video-242940" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autotrader.com&#x2F;car-video&#x2F;car-color-test-are-blac...</a>  Ok, that is substantial.')
