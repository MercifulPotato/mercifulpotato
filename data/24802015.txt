Is it the cost? I imagine it must be high enough because then they&#x27;re gonna have to fight with this very criticism later on: RCT ended prematurely, therefore it is not as reliable.<p>A question to you and grandparent post: what are the things that distinguish a high quality RCT from a poor one? The number of participants, the design study, etc.? Any links&#x2F;resources that discuss this would be appreciated.<p>edit: ok, I found a paper on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3429837&#x2F;#:~:text=Randomized%20controlled%20trials%20(RCTs)%20have,of%20medical%20treatments%20(1)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3429837&#x2F;#:~:tex...</a>.<p>I am super curious now about any discussion that reveals why the WHO study was less-than-stellar, and why the original RCT was considered high-quality.')
