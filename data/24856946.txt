Item(by='malikNF', descendants=None, kids=[24857003], score=None, time=1603366597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24856584, text='&gt;&gt;change some laws and regulations.<p>but then we are in another loop where people who don&#x27;t understand technology will bring in laws that both fix an issue but creates a whole set of new issues, that might even hinder progress. So I am not a fan of politicians getting involved with things they don&#x27;t have a good idea about.<p>Personally I choose to believe in the whole decentralized internet idea that&#x27;s starting to taking off. 10 years ago bitcoin, smart contracts, decentralized payment systems, decentralized video platforms etc were not that popular or didn&#x27;t exist and now there&#x27;s so much progress made in that direction. So I believe there&#x27;s some good that will come out of the blockchain space. Problem is, only time will tell ha.')
