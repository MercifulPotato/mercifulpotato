Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25003353], score=None, time=1604607924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998196, text='&gt; loss of DMCA Section 512 expedited takedown privileges<p>No such privilege exists, so I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to mean.<p>I suppose that you could put violators on a list where, for parties on that list, a 512 notice didn&#x27;t require a takedown to stay in the safe harbor but triggered some other (new) process, like (for instance) notice to the user and defined-in-law period for the user to submit a counter-notice with a takedown only required to retain safe harbor against the copyrightbholder if no facially-valid counter-notice is received within a specified period, and the safe harbor against the user isn&#x27;t applied if the takedown is done prior to the required opportunity to respond.<p>But that gets tricky to administer correctly (how long does DMCA-penalty-status last, how does it apply when third-party copyright agents like the RIAA are filing notices on behalf of copyright holders, is it the agent or the copyright holder that receives the penalty, etc., etc.)')
