Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607492968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25353635, text='&gt; there continue to be threads full of arguments that amount to &quot;It should be possible for &#x27;good&#x27; network admins to intercept traffic from devices that don&#x27;t trust them, but &#x27;bad&#x27; network admins shouldn&#x27;t be able to intercept traffic from devices that don&#x27;t trust them&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what I see at all.<p>I see people pointing out that DoH hurts privacy and reduces control for end users by providing a convenient turnkey solution for device vendors to bypass filtering at the network level.<p>I also see it pointed out that DoH could have been specified in a way that facilitated filtering for the local network. Given that it&#x27;s so obviously possible, the fact that it wasn&#x27;t speaks volumes.<p>Note that (IIUC) your ISP can still see which sites you visit because TLS still transmits the FQDN in plaintext (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;86723" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;86723</a>). Even if that stopped happening tomorrow, the destination IP would still be visible (not <i>quite</i> as bad but still reveals a huge amount of information). On top of all that, DNSSEC already exists which allows you to verify the authenticity of the query result. As such, the argument in favor of DoH would seem to be limited to preventing your DNS resolver (but not your ISP or VPN!) from tracking which sites you visit. I don&#x27;t find that to be very compelling in light of the immediate downsides.')
