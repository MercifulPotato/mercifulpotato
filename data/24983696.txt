Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24984174], score=None, time=1604435838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983015, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s dramatically different for Twitter (or Facebook or Google) deciding to block the New York Post than it is for Comcast to do so.<p>If Comcast decides to block the New York Post, <i>you can&#x27;t see it at all</i> until you change your Internet provider. That may involve breaking a contract, and will certainly cost you time and money. And that&#x27;s if you have a choice at all - large swathes of the country have only one ISP. Many apartment buildings only have hookups for one provider.<p>If TwitFaceGoog don&#x27;t show NYP links you&#x27;re free to type in their domain name in your web browser and go to the site directly.<p>Suggesting there&#x27;s no difference between the two is dishonest.')
