Yes?<p>That seems both ingenious and very, very straight-forward. What is the reason behind us not having deployed massive amounts of search indices into the world that were built using this method? Has the drawback of this method been too great?<p>The drawback to me seems to be the amount of computation needed to produce such an index.')
