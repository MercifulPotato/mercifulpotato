Food is definitely something you want to have in surplus. &quot;Two years&quot; isn&#x27;t a great length of time to be hungry.<p>That&#x27;s not to say our subsidies are targeted well. Not only do we have surplus to export, we have surplus to cram into our own mouths, causing an obesity crisis. We&#x27;d be well advised to tune the subsidies to healthier foods. We would still have a wide surplus against a crisis, while eating better.<p>But unfortunately, long-term dependence on subsidies and some historical accidents of politics have given the existing beneficiaries a very heavy thumb on the scale of decision-making in agricultural policy.')
