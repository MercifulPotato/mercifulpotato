They then pissed off a huge number of those retail customers with a surprise and un-announced change to their trading rules (no more buying GME) in the middle of those retail customer&#x27;s massively successful effort to make a bunch of money using their product. Their customers then pretty quickly lost a bunch of money.<p>Regardless of where the fault lies that seems like a recipe for pissing of a lot of your customers, and from there it seems reasonable that the customers would be pissed at the company who sold them the product (as opposed to one of their vendors&#x2F;customers).<p>In that light, and particularly w&#x2F; a finance app, it might seem even weirder if their angry customers _weren&#x27;t_ mad at Robinhood and were willing to accept &quot;it wasn&#x27;t our fault&quot; for any reason.')
