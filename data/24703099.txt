As long as Sonic is at the mercy of AT&amp;T, infrastructure issues can crop up. In the late 1990s, which was pre-Fusion, my Sonic DSL service stopped working. After a week of no Internet, Sonic informed me that AT&amp;T had used my active circuit for another customer. The DSLAM was over subscribed and AT&amp;T took a reseller circuit and used it for a new, non-reseller circuit. Because the DLSAM had no capacity, I was SOL. I switched to Comcast.<p>I had another issue when I lived in my last apartment a few years ago. When Sonic came out to service the line, they put a quality cable in the building&#x27;s wire closet. Well, AT&amp;T decided they liked that cable and took it for another customer. The cable had a Sonic label, they knew it wasn&#x27;t their service. I am convinced AT&amp;T does this on purpose since resold circuits bring in less revenue.<p>There is nothing Sonic can do for these types of shenanigans. Dane keeps on pimping Sonic&#x27;s fiber but it has limited availability. I am in my 50s, I will be dead before it comes to Santa Clara, California, the middle of Silicon Valley.')
