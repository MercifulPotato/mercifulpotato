Java and the Java community did a pretty good job of solving the problem of extremely large numbers of developers sharing code with little coordination over long timelines.  Unfortunately, they did it because that was their vision of how enterprise software would be created:  dozens if not hundreds of programmers working together on enormous monolithic applications with months-long release cycles.  Your code had to be extremely defensive, so you could change the internals without fear, and also extensible and customizable, so you would be less likely to be interrupted by requests to make changes to support someone else&#x27;s work.  All the extra work and complexity to accomplish that became the &quot;right&quot; way to write Java code regardless of context.')
