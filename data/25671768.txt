For example, I was banned like a week ago from a sub for arguing that it&#x27;s not obviously selfish&#x2F;evil for someone to travel during COVID if one is allowed to do so. It was on a travel-related subreddit where there were no rules to this effect, but a mod felt that this sort of attitude was tantamount to advocating manslaughter.<p>Most subs will not have &quot;no conservatives allowed&quot; rules but the enforcement patterns often will not follow the rules.')
