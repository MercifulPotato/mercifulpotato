Some simple napkin math: if you average running two builds&#x2F;test runs per day, not including weekends, you&#x27;ll pay somewhere over $12k&#x2F;yr. Crazy.<p>We test some cross-platform software with an installer, and there&#x27;s automated tests for every Windows version since 7, dozens of various Linux distros&#x2F;versions (including x86 and ARM), but we never got around to automating Mac largely because of the complexity with getting back to a &quot;clean&quot; environment (eg: what you get with a fresh EC2 image). Having relatively few users compared to all other platforms plus the cost being a couple of orders of magnitude higher, I doubt we&#x27;ll take advantage of this. Too bad.')
