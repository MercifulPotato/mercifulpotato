These app delivery platforms are impersonating companies, not selling their own products under someone else&#x27;s brand. The food comes from where they claim it did. The issue with impersonation is that customers who got worse experience (cold food, long delivery, etc.) end up blaming the restaurant for it, even though the restaurant had nothing to do with it.')
