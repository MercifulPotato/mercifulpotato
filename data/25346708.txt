At that price, you&#x27;re competing against the very best balanced armature drivers, which basically have perfect frequency responses and harmonics, as well as against planar magnetic and the very best dynamic drivers too.<p>As for computing audio, yeah that&#x27;s simply useless. Just have the DSP at the device. The device, iPhone, or Mac, or a PC, or whatever, is aware of which headphones it is connected to, and can trivially run the correction routines itself. In fact, this is already done by many.<p>In ear headphones aren&#x27;t going to have enough battery to power a cellular modem.')
