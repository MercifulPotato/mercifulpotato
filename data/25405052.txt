Well, I guess to some extent I am, I&#x27;m just the SQL routines running on a server, and I&#x27;m writing this down based on what I see in the database that this user is said to have sent at some point, and the frontend code will render it to you in some way I guess. See you there, friend.<p>But yeah I do think that in a simulative language as we have, anything that is referrable-to as a subject in a sentence can appear as an agent in this way, probably. And I think processes running by computer we tend to conjure into many types of sentences (in our human languages that refer to them) with intricate enough dynamics (whether subject, object, modifier, whatever) that I would consider them as existing among our society generally. They appear with as much complexity as what we consider others like ourselves do. Like even if only by looking far into our history and seeing the extent to which we acknowledge others: some times we acknowledge processes-by-computer more.')
