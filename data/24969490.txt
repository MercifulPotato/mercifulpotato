My spouse is a physician and when coughing (acute bronchitis) could not get a test without job consequences (being forced to take 10 days off and reschedule all patients regardless of the outcome of the test). There has been an exposure in a neighboring ward through a fellow healthcare worker and tests are not being made available broadly. Remember, in the US healthcare workers generally have to go through insurance to get approved for tests, etc., even though they work in healthcare -- they&#x27;re not at this time provided anything more than the general public in terms of diagnostics. (At least spouse gets free masks at work, haha...)')
