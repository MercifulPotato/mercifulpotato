But slap a party or ideological label on an article and it will appear to indicate the article is aligned with that bias label (even if it isn&#x27;t).  And people will conflate the contents of the article with the appropriate side even more than they already do.<p>What might be more successful would be to include a neutral fact check-style notice like &quot;This article presents the majority Republican opinion on ___&quot; or &quot;This article uses widely-disputed claims to justify a fringe Democratic position&quot;.  That would provide more context to the actual content of the article and how to interpret it.')
