Windows still does that with their &#x27;network identification&#x27; where sometimes something goes wrong in the probing process and the connection hangs on &quot;identifying&quot; indefinitely. And that&#x27;s just a silly &quot;optional&quot; service (which should default to the public profile and only change from there instead of defaulting to no connection at all).')
