Even a modestly modern GPU can produce 100&#x27;s of FPS in CS:GO at 1920x1080 or higher resolutions. Benchmarks for the 3080 were showing 400-500 FPS in CS:GO at 1440p resolutions.<p>After maybe double your screen refresh rate, all excess FPS don&#x27;t matter and are effectively wasted. Pro&#x27;s mostly use 144Hz monitors because 240Hz is indistinguishable[1] - making anything above 288FPS basically a waste (and it&#x27;s debatable if anything above 144FPS with FreeSync enabled is a waste too).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OX31kZbAXsA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OX31kZbAXsA</a>')
