The smartphones and computers that practically every student has access to.<p>Not very well, for educational purposes.<p>The experience of calculating the inverse tan of a number and returning the result in degrees is beautiful on a Casio scientific calculator; not so on iPhone&#x27;s default calculator (reverse Polish) or a Google search (awkward to execute at all).<p>It&#x27;s distracting from the educational point whenever you have to first figure out how to do the calculation on a student&#x27;s particular choice of app.<p>Caveat: I&#x27;d usually recommend a scientific calculator for most educational purposes, not a graphing calculator; Desmos.com is great for graphing.<p>I&#x27;m uncertain about learning Python on a calculator, then. There are potential educational advantages to having this on a calculator: I definitely think this is worth it for Casio to experiment with. I personally learned a lot on a programmable calculator. It&#x27;s mobile and likely saves you from a difficult set up process and identifying and installing a suitable IDE that works consistently across student devices (I&#x27;d say repl.it does a good job in this space)')
