You think it&#x27;s bad now, but some day you&#x27;ll look back on present conditions fondly.  If that&#x27;s not your cup of tea then I suggest getting out of the state because there are no political solutions to this.  Even if by some miracle AGW were stopped dead and reversed, California would still be getting hotter and dryer.  That&#x27;s what the pre-industrial climate of California was <i>typically</i> like.')
