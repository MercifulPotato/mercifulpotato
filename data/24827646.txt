That need to explicitly make the choice to share is a friction point, not a feature. What if my friend forgets? What if it&#x27;s needed over an hour? Why does my possibly tipsy friend need to decide how long I need their location for in the moment? On by default is an explicit feature once you explicitly allow, and the need to grant each time is a bug. Google&#x27;s original product appeared to strike a balance here with the &quot;on by default but possible to reject&quot; model pictured in the article which is interesting. Still, they understood they made an on by default product and the user value clearly.<p>For friends father away on the social graph, those temporary shares are also great too! iMessage&#x2F;Find My Friends has this and I use it exactly as you describe. But it&#x27;s two separate use cases.')
