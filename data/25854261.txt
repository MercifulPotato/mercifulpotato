At some point I decided to better understand how the Chinese government functions since for a long time it&#x27;s been both autocratic and surprisingly benevolent in certain areas. So basically some combination of youtube, wikipedia and a few other places till I more or less came to a high-level understanding.<p>There are also some English language Chinese government produced youtube videos that also do a pretty good job at giving basic civics lessons on how their government works if you can look past all the self-congratulations. It&#x27;s definitely &quot;complicated&quot; and is not just Xi Jinping barking his every desire and whim as it tends to get reduced to.<p>For example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qu4QTxl9GVw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qu4QTxl9GVw</a><p>There are plenty of others like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fgor9fmA6po" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fgor9fmA6po</a>')
