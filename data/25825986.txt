Sure, I won&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t have collaboration, or top-tier engineers etc. But in the end, the success of this well defined cadence boiled down to the simple strategy of &quot;we release what is ready&quot;. Everybody knew the deadlines well in advance, and  everybody strives to &#x27;make it&#x27;  - but, (not so) occasionally, some teams didn&#x27;t and you could see entire features get ruthlessly cut out. Simply no other way of synchronizing across the entire company... you cut scope to make it in time, and if you can&#x27;t make it, that&#x27;s it, your feature gets cut. With enough teams working, you still get features to showcase at each release.')
