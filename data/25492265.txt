To be clear, I don&#x27;t think that options have <i>no value</i>. I think that at a mature company they definitely have some value and you need to consider that. I think that as an early employee they have nonzero value, but I don&#x27;t think they have a lot of value (this is where you and I mainly differ, I assume).<p>&gt; Well if there is a spread then you have some other options (second market, third party exercise) and you already have some return. If it&#x27;s valued at significantly greater than when you joined you&#x27;re in a decent position.<p>IME this is true at more established private companies but not at most startups. I don&#x27;t think it would be that easy at Stripe in 2012 or 2013, for instance.<p>&gt; Yes there&#x27;s risk in exercising options, you can mitigate that by choosing well. It&#x27;s worth taking it seriously when evaluating comp.<p>With all due respect, I think that you may be letting hindsight get in the way of how <i>difficult</i> it is to pick which companies are going to be successful in 8-12 years&#x27; time. I certainly couldn&#x27;t pick the Stripe, Slack or Palantir of 2030. But if you can, you are much more insightful than I am - although I think that my (limited) level of discernment may be more representative of the average person making these decisions.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d also argue the opportunity cost&#x2F;downside risk here is not so bad either. Salaries at modern VC startups are pretty good anyway. You can make the bet and just work at your preferred megacorp if it doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>They&#x27;re not bad, but you can easily pocket an additional $100k+&#x2F;yr working at a big company, that money adds up when you invest it, and that money is guaranteed. (There are plenty of non-financial reasons to work at the startup, though, obviously.)')
