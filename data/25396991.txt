I reckon it&#x27;ll be difficult to convince them to shift to electric ones that costs more and haven&#x27;t got any long term reliability or efficiency reports. If anything, battery powered cars lose a lot of value as their battery capacities tend to decline over time. Also, unless their farm has heavily invested in solar power, they&#x27;d still have to use electricity from the grid. In a country like Australia most electricity is generated from coal. So that&#x27;s not really helping the environment. The EV industry will only last as long as we don&#x27;t figure out efficient production and transportation of Hydrogen. This is impressive use of ML though.')
