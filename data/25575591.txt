Some depend mostly on hardware (like subaru), others try to use sensors and torque control and&#x2F;or brake control to put the torque where it&#x27;s needed.<p>AWD is complicated with 3 differentials that can be a mix of open, limited slip, or actively controlled (by torque split or brake based system).   It&#x27;s especially tricky since it&#x27;s not the actual traction that matters as much as the driver perceived traction and predictability.  I&#x27;ve drivin AWD systems with snow tires that seemed to have more traction than my subaru with all seasons, but ended up driving more slowly because I couldn&#x27;t predict what it was going to do.  Subaru seems to communicate well with the driver, and making sliding just not a big deal.  Other cars make it harder to tell what a given throttle&#x2F;braking input is going to result in and can trigger heavy front or rear bias based on what the sensors&#x2F;software tell it to do.  It drives me nuts when a car acts completely differently in high traction and low traction conditions, especially when it changes one second to the next.  Some Subaru folks make fun of other systems that they call &quot;slip and grip&quot;, where there&#x27;s a heavy FWD bias (minimal torque to the rear), until AFTER you start slipping.<p>My WRX had a limited slip in the rear, center diff was a viscous coupling (100% mechanical&#x2F;no software), and a open front diff.  It was reassuring, never surprised me, and even when significant slipping I could always put the car exactly where I wanted.  Even when crab crawling sideways in a parking lot at 2 mph it never surprised me.  Numerous Toyota, Ford, Honda, and BMW cars I tried would try to outsmart me.  Limiting throttle, moving the torque around, limiting braking forces, etc.  Last thing I want when climbing a hill is the car to cut the throttle because one of 4 wheels slipped for 50ms.<p>Consumer reports tested a Subaru forester, Toyota RAV 4, and Honda CRV in heavy snow conditions and concluded the Subaru was a clear winner despite them all having similar dry road performance and AWD.<p>I think for normal snowy roads Subaru does it best with a mostly manual system, the ABS and traction control has a light touch that can be mostly avoided.  But for heavy offroad the best thing to do (in certain messy conditions) is lock all differentials, which is something the Subaru can&#x27;t do.')
