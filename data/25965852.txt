If it was, a company announcing a new product would be &quot;market manipulation&quot;, because it impacts the stock price. But I think you&#x27;re right that the line is definitely grey in a lot of situations. And really, that&#x27;s why we have courts.<p>&gt; Do you think that something like &quot;Elon Musk tweets the word &#x27;bitcoin&#x27;&quot; can&#x2F;should actually be charged as market manipulation?<p>If Elon Musk had just bought a whole bunch of bitcoin, then tweeted it out, and then sold his newly acquired bitcoin, then yes. He 100% knows that what he tweets affects markets, and attempted to <i>directly</i> benefit from it. If you want to argue that he doesn&#x27;t know that his tweets affect the market, the SEC has already determined that it does based on the &quot;TSLA private at 420&quot; situation.<p>&gt; What about people selling their newsletter of stock tips?<p>Market manipulation requires actual market manipulation. I dno&#x27;t believe that &quot;attempted market manipulation&quot; counts (but I may be wrong). All of these newsletter attempts fail, so there&#x27;s nothing to really charge.<p>If any of these newsletters actually have a measurable effect, or if the person sending them is buying-sending-selling (at a profit), then yes, it is market manipulation.<p>&gt; What about printing an article in Bloomberg suggesting that XYZ is undervalued&#x2F;overvalued for $reasons<p>This is kind of what Bloomberg does, and they <i>typically</i> have arguments in both directions (which I think kind of evens it out). That being said, <i>true</i> information, with real evidence, is not <i>illegal</i> market manipulation. DFV&#x27;s initial &quot;due diligence&quot; and legitimate bull case are not illegal market manipulation.<p>&gt; What about some nobody on reddit posting to wsb to say let&#x27;s go to $321!<p>Now you&#x27;re getting grey. I&#x27;m not qualified to answer. This answer will likely be very similar to whether or not something is &quot;inciting a riot&quot;, and will be <i>super</i> context-dependent.<p>But note that this is different than saying &quot;GME is going to $1000 because of <i>&lt;totally false and made up reasons&gt;</i>&quot; (especially if you already have a position, and if you make a profit as a result of the market that you influenced. Remember, if you don&#x27;t <i>actually influence the market</i>, then it doesn&#x27;t count.<p>But whether or not you succeeded in influencing the market can easily be determined after-the-fact. Just because you get away with it in the moment, doesn&#x27;t mean no one will look back.<p>&gt; What about being paid to tell clients what you think they should invest in?<p>If this is your job, you are likely licenced in some way, and the rules are likely different.<p>&gt; What about telling other users on reddit for free what you think they should invest in?<p>I think the answer here is the same as the WSB-specific question<p>---<p>Feel free to disagree with me, these are just <i>my opinions</i>, and again, context matters.')
