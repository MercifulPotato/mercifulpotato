Sometimes (most often when sending desktop to phone) the delay is 15 minutes or more. I&#x27;ve found it a lot easier to use a bookmarklet that uses DDG to generate qr codes, but that only solved sharing in one direction.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered how send could be so slow but maybe something in my setup is just killing it. More than anything though, I would love an easy way to access my phone&#x27;s sharing options from my laptop (perhaps an addon button that shows a list of app intents that can receive a url&#x2F;page).<p>This is one thing I&#x27;m hoping to hack at when I get my Librem.')
