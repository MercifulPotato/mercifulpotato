Vacuum full requires a lock on the table, and is not an ideal solution for tables that need to be available while being vacuumed:<p>This is confusing to me, i thought postgre was suppose to be better then mysql, yet mysql has a non-locking command to recreate a table. it has like 3 that would fit here, AND deal with the indexes in one command.')
