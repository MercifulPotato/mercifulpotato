Right now, banks receive and send money by sending flat files through a distributed processing system with no database transactions, verification, or transfer history.  Some big bank robberies were committed a few years ago by compromising the banking systems that create and process these files.  Once the file is sent to the ACH network, reversing transactions is a manual process and is nearly impossible after the funds leave the destination to a 3rd party.')
