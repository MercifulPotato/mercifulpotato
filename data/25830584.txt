My impression was that with M1 hardware all iOS&#x2F;iPadOS apps that <i>can</i> work on desktop OS <i>will</i> be available in desktop OS, blurring device borders.<p>In fact, this is opt-in at developer’s discretion. Distributing desktop version as a separate paid app can nearly double app revenue, so one would arguably be reckless to flag an iOS app as Mac-ready (unless it works via a paid subscription).<p>On one hand, this shows how much Apple cares about devs; on the other hand, hardly any useful iOS app is available on macOS right now except for Among Us that got advertised on the event.')
