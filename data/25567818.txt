But unless the satellite is in a few very special locations in Earth&#x27;s orbit, its orbit will naturally decay over time and eventually fall back to Earth, usually burning up in the atmosphere. (Above low-earth orbit this could take a very long time, but now satellites are required to be designed with deorbiting in mind)<p>Often some parts of the sat still make it to the ground, but SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink sats for example are designed to fully burn up in-atmosphere within a year of deorbiting.')
