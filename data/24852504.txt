Item(by='205guy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603316382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851157, text='Clearly, I was mimicking the TV network model in my proposal, but the &quot;Utube&quot; naming was meant to imply they all follow the YouTube model (free video hosting website) not become broadcast media with all the elitism that entails. There would be 3 choices when you create your own videos, each offering different ad&#x2F;placement deals (as opposed to accepting YouTube&#x27;s or perish).<p>As the sibling comment states, Twitch is an alternative, but I think that however big the gaming and live video market is, it doesn&#x27;t generalize to most YouTube content. I&#x27;m not sure if Vimeo has ever reached the same level, every time someone on HN mentions them, a creator has said they tried and got no traction&#x2F;views on Vimeo.<p>Patreon is odd, they host some exclusive content, but it seems nearly all creators retain their YouTube channel for discovery and Patreon is mostly for processing the donations. I guess in a way, they have siphoned off some YouTube functionality, taking the cream off the top (paying subscribers), and letting YouTube do the expensive part of hosting the content.<p>I suppose that short of the feds swinging the anti-trust hammer and breaking YouTube into 3 equal companies that compete in the same market, the YouTube monolith is here to stay by market forces alone.')
