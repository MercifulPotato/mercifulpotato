For me and many others, Yahoo was like a proto-facebook. You could go to Yahoo and spend your whole browsing session there, between checking your email, the news, looking at your friends&#x27; Geocities blogs, then playing some Chess over at Yahoo Games. Later on they became one of the bigger names in fantasy football.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how quickly they lost it all though, and I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand it. None of what they did was new, they just did it better (or well enough) and had the marketshare to keep people there.<p>What happened? And how do you decide that stripping away products people use is the way forward? What&#x27;s the point of the Yahoo name, if everything that made it Yahoo is gone?')
