In the USA, nuclear has 10x the install base of wind. If it were equally problematic, you should expect 10x the problems. The ratio is probably higher in France.<p>&gt; nuclear doesn&#x27;t work without considerable amounts of fossil fuel.<p>Ditto wind, ditto solar. They are considerably worse once you divide by the power they actually produce, as you should. With wind, you build a gigantic edifice of concrete and steel, and it powers a neighborhood, some of the time. With nuclear, you build a gigantic edifice of concrete and steel, and it powers multiple cities, all of the time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;wind-energys-carbon-footprint&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;wind-energys-carbon-footpr...</a><p>&gt; It would be interesting to read a full study on the requirements on fossil fuel to produce an electric car<p>Dude, this is electric car 101 stuff.
