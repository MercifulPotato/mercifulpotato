Most of my ideas have been variations of creating a scholarship fund where interest from the initial investment goes to pay for continued development on a specific project.<p>The big question though is how to run the investment without it being wasted on people aren&#x27;t helping the project at all.<p>Some notes (I&#x27;m planning on eventually writing a blog post on this subject):<p>- You probably need to pay people differently depending on whether they&#x27;re the maintainer or a minor contributor\n- There needs to be a balance of power between users and the maintainer. A simple balance could be, the maintainer is dictator for life (or until they lay down the mantle) but compensation is based on number of users.\n- Maybe compensation is done on a per-feature basis, e.g., users put a bounty on a feature and the interest money doubles that bounty.')
