In this way they force students to retype the code instead of just copying-and-pasting it.<p>Another case could be to make sure that the code always looks the same if you are going to put it in a Powerpoint presentation that you want to share&#x2F;copy to a conference laptop. (However, if one does not need to embed videos, it&#x27;s probably better to export a plain PDF.)<p>Apart from these very specific cases, I agree with you: it is more useful to allow people to select the text.')
