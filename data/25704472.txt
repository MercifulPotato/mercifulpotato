Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=[25704538], score=None, time=1610224697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703994, text='There are probably variances among polls, but this sample from 2000 shows 18% of Americans believed the election was stolen[0] (and it heavily leans Democratic).<p>Before the 2020 election, we see &quot;record low&quot; confidence, particularly among Republicans[1].<p>After the election, this poll shows 34% believe the win was not legitimate[2], nearly double from 20 years earlier.<p>There are several differences between 2000 and 2020[3], the biggest being that 2020 was <i>not</i> a close Election. Biden won 306-232 in the Electoral College, and 81,281,502 (51.3%) to 74,222,593 (46.9%) in popular votes. Yet the disbelief is double.<p>Donald Trump has been claiming election fraud even when he won in 2016, but his own task force found little evidence[4]. What explains such a change in <i>belief</i>?<p>In my opinion, this is where amplifying voices that espouse opinions further from the mainstream and center of the political spectrum (extremism) causes that to <i>spread</i>, for culture to fracture, or in a word, polarization.<p>So given the options of making it easy to reach everyone on mainstream social networks like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit vs pushing extremes out of the mainstream megaphone, it seems that the better option is the latter. Extremism (and polarization) will likely happen either way, but it seems like amplifying and accelerating it is actually the worse option.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;2188&#x2F;black-americans-feel-cheated-election-2000.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;2188&#x2F;black-americans-feel-cheat...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;321665&#x2F;confidence-accuracy-election-matches-record-low.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;321665&#x2F;confidence-accuracy-elec...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;poll.qu.edu&#x2F;national&#x2F;release-detail?ReleaseID=3685" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;poll.qu.edu&#x2F;national&#x2F;release-detail?ReleaseID=3685</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;934190243&#x2F;fact-check-whats-happening-in-this-election-is-not-like-florida-in-2000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;934190243&#x2F;fact-check-whats-ha...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fixgov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;low-rates-of-fraud-in-vote-by-mail-states-show-the-benefits-outweigh-the-risks&#x2F;#page-content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fixgov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;low-rates-o...</a>')
