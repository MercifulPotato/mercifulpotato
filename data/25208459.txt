You can pretty much say whatever you want and nobody is going to put you in jail or burn you at the stake. Indeed you have tools like never before with which to promulgate your message.<p>Even if your remarks are racist, xenophobic, misogynistic or some other kind of bigoted you can still pretty say much whatever you like and there’s even guys out there that will give you a platform.<p>You might think that these rights extend to the workplace but you would be wrong. Leave religion and politics at the door and just do your job.<p>I blame the culture of overwork that exists in the industry for many people not being able to know the difference between personal and professional.')
