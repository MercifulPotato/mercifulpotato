They&#x27;ll get you to close enough, but not correct your errors beyond that. Same seems to be the case for my kid&#x27;s language courses.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be that hard to get the pronounciation right in most languages, but it&#x27;s just not emphasised in favour of grammar and vocab.<p>As for English accents, I find that one of the more charming things about this country. People aren&#x27;t going to say you don&#x27;t aren&#x27;t native if you sound Liverpudlian, Australian, or American. By contrast in more localized languages people sniff a foreigner immediately on a missed vowel or wrong article.')
