Almost every time the crews tried to return to the United States, the Mexican border personnel would seize their very expensive gear.  The only way to get it back was to pay a bribe.<p>This was so common that everyone was told to just mark it down on their expense reports as &quot;Airport tax.&quot;  I only found out about it when I started asking why I kept seeing &quot;Airport tax&quot; on expense reports for trips I knew were done in cars.')
