Exceeding it would make the disk unusable and, perhaps, require <i>very</i> annoying manual intervention. The device also doesn&#x27;t have any way to warn the user without going through the computer and the OS which, at this point, should be considered hostile.<p>&gt; or network locations<p>This is easier to tackle by keeping backups and snapshots that are invisible and inaccessible to the end users and their OSs. Even if your workstation is mounting remote data as virtual block disks, you can still snapshot the whole disk at any given point in time. The problem will be cost - this requires a lot of extra storage capacity.<p>&gt; I would not be annoyed if a popup asked me to verify that this is something I approve of.<p>In general the user (and anything on their machine) cannot be trusted. This confirmation should go to a separate channel - a phone call or other alert that&#x27;s not going through the suspect computer.')
