IDE only means integration of tools, not neccessarily that the integration is state of the art. Go back 10, 20 years, and what IDEs could do back then, Vim can now too. On some parts, it&#x27;s even touching the realm of modern IDEs (mostly because of LSP and VS Code&#x27;s effort to make it possible for editors).<p>There are also now &quot;distributions&quot; of vim-configurations, which are taking care of delivering the IDE-experience out of the box and maintained by someone else. Also, don&#x27;t forget that vi(m) by design is meant to be integrated as the editor-component in the environment of the unix-shell. So it always was part of an IDE from the beginning.<p>Though, it&#x27;s true that there is an limit on how much it can do with it&#x27;s momentary ability and architecture. It&#x27;s textual, so it&#x27; can&#x27;t copy the GUI-Components of modern IDEs or the assistants. Meaning it will likely always stay a second rate-IDE. But I guess that&#x27;s ok. You don&#x27;t need to be the best at every aspect of the workflow. At the end the final results are what matter.')
