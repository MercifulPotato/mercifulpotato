It&#x27;s not broken, it&#x27;s the third-party software that incorrectly assumes time_t is a general integer arithmetic type that&#x27;s broken.<p>The ISO C11 standard only says that time_t is a real type that holds values &gt;= 0. The minute you start performing arithmetic on that type and checking if the result is less than zero you&#x27;re entering undefined behaviour territory. For example, does the following program halt?<p><pre><code>  int main() {\n    for (unsigned i = 1; i &gt;= 0); --i)\n      ;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe answer is &quot;maybe&quot;. The C standard defines an infinite loop like this as undefined behaviour ISO 9899:2011 [6.8.5&#x2F;6].')
