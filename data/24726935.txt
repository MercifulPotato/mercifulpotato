This doesn&#x27;t combine multiple big processors, but is still a very interesting tech!<p>Intel&#x27;s also been working to standardize &amp; accelerate mulit-chip connectivity, by donating their Advanced Interface Bus to the open group the CHIPS Alliance[2]. This saw a 2.0 draft emerge this summer.<p>Agreed that Intel has been fairly ineffective at driving interesting new fpga adoption. There has been interesting work but it&#x27;s hard to see what adoption has looked like. There is the Xeon 6138P for example, which uses a UPI link and dual 8x PCIe links of a 20 core xeon chip to talk to an on-package Arria 10GX[3]. I&#x27;m not a market researcher, but my guess is that adoption hasn&#x27;t been stellar. I haven&#x27;t seen any follow ups. I do hope there have been some interesting &amp; good uses though! I feel like AMD will face similar challenges to adoption. Frankly, tech like Xe and Radeon seems more appealing to the world we live in; big gpus that can do bfloat16 &amp;c. One of the big advantages of fpgas has been great connectivity, powerful transcievers &amp; other i&#x2F;o capabilities, which, if you put them in an existing platform socket, is probably going to squander some of those capabilities, I feel like?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;14211&#x2F;intels-interconnected-future-chipslets-emib-foveros" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;14211&#x2F;intels-interconnected-f...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;15434&#x2F;intel-joins-chips-alliance-contributes-advanced-interface-bus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;15434&#x2F;intel-joins-chips-allia...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;12773&#x2F;intel-shows-xeon-scalable-gold-6138p-with-integrated-fpga-shipping-to-vendors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;12773&#x2F;intel-shows-xeon-scalab...</a>')
