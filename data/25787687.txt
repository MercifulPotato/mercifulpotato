From (foggy) memory you can&#x27;t sudo by default, and you also can&#x27;t mount as a normal user. These things are probably perfectly reasonable choices to make for a secure server but annoying for a desktop.<p>This may not count as desktop, but another annoying one is &#x2F;usr&#x2F;sbin and some other common directories being missing from the default PATH.<p>Still, it&#x27;s way less annoying than ubuntu&#x27;s constant nagging about updates and trying to shove snap in your face.')
