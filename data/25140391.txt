But in doing so, are they not <i>identifying</i> themselves more with the counterfactual Downs foetus than with the counterfactual non-Downs foetus?<p>If so, does that not suggest people who think that way identify themselves with the disability to some degree (&quot;In that world I would have been aborted&quot;), rather than identifying themselves as people independent of a physical characteristic (&quot;In that world I would have been guaranteed my body would not have this disability&quot;)?')
