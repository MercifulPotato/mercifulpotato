In a nutshell:<p>- It&#x27;s made up of a bunch of independent servers, or &quot;instances&quot;. The common analogy here is to email systems.<p>- If you want to join the federation, stand up an instance and start using it. Voila! Now you&#x27;re part of it.<p>- My instance has a lot of users, and I don&#x27;t want to run them off, so it&#x27;s in my own interest to moderate my own instance in a way that my community likes. Allow too much in without doing anything? They leave. Tighten it so that it starts losing its value? They leave. There&#x27;s a feedback mechanism that guides me to the middle road.<p>- But my users <i>can</i> leave for greener pastures if they think I&#x27;m doing a bad job and think another instance is better. They&#x27;re not stuck with me.<p>The end result is that there are thousands of instances with widely varied moderation policies. There are some &quot;safe spaces&quot; where people who&#x27;ve been sexually assaulted hang out and that have zero tolerance for harassment or trolling. There are others that are very laissez faire. There&#x27;s a marketplace of styles to choose from, and no one server has to try to be a perfect fit for everyone.<p>I realize that this is not helpful information for someone who wants to run a single large service. I bring it up just to point out that there&#x27;s more than one way to skin that cat.<p>(That final idiom would probably get me banned on some servers. And that&#x27;s great! More power to that community for being willing and able to set policies, even if I wouldn&#x27;t agree with them.)')
