It took me like an hour to get all the services like I wanted them, and it’s reasonably portable if I ever need to move the services to a different box. And I’ve had stuff break on apt upgrade before, but I haven’t had trouble with updated containers (if I build them or get them from hub).<p>K8s at home would make me wake up in a cold sweat at night to make sure I didn’t break something though. That’s way too much.')
