Item(by='throw_m239339', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606756360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254099, text='&gt; Error handling is hard, Go doesn&#x27;t hide the complexity, but a lot of other languages try to handwave the complexity away. Either way, programmers are by default lazy, and you end up with &quot;Error 500: connection refused&quot;.<p>Except that (no pun) Go has both exceptions in the forms of panics AND its horrible error interface. I don&#x27;t like exceptions but I&#x27;ll take exceptions over Go glorified return codes anytime. No amount of &quot;decorating&quot; that system makes it better. There is nothing to it. Rust is a bit better on that matter BECAUSE Rust has the syntactic sugar to make errors as value painless to deal with. Go doesn&#x27;t.<p>Sometimes on your server, you have 15 IO operations to perform, you just want to log on failure and return error 500 to the user. This is the case where go doesn&#x27;t shine at all, what do you do? aside from being tempted to resort to a GOTO statement?')
