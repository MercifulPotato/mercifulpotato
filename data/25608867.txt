Not only do they educate our children, they babysit our children, and the pandemic has shown us how vital that aspect of the service is. I&#x27;ve anecdotally seen many parents on social media complain about having to look after their own children during the day.<p>Schools need arbitrary and often draconian seeming rules, such as refusing toilet breaks, not allowing food or drinks in a classroom, or enforcing strict dress protocols. If you truly knew how manipulative a group of children can be, when ganged together you&#x27;d understand this. Toilet breaks are often abused, with children skipping class to, for instance, vape in the toilets. I&#x27;ve had classes where I&#x27;ve spent my break cleaning up chewing gum, spilled drinks and crumbs from students sneaking snacks. When kids aren&#x27;t in uniform, or under a strict dress code they&#x27;ll push the limits of what is acceptable and additionally bully the poorer children that can&#x27;t afford the latest fashions.<p>If we want schools to ease up on such restrictions then you need to invest in more teachers and other staff. I&#x27;ve had science classes with 35 students all with Bunsen burners merrily flaming, flammable and corrosive chemicals in beakers at their desks, and syringes or pipettes (also read as water pistols). Or my engineering class with 20 soldering irons all on, pillar drills being operated, while a couple of kids are etching circuit boards. Try running that type of class without strict rules and you&#x27;re liable to see injury, loss of employment, a lawsuit and possibly prison.<p>If I&#x27;d had smaller class sizes, or more staff in the classroom, I could have relaxed my rules. I&#x27;d know the kids better, have built up a more trusting relationship been able to monitor who was doing what with greater efficiency.<p>These are kids we&#x27;re talking about and they&#x27;re developing, experimenting, learning, and struggling to navigate a complex social dynamic in a very unnatural environment. Without rules in place, they&#x27;ll screw up. For God&#x27;s sake, how many of you &quot;adults&quot; have had to sign a code-of-conduct agreement before being allowed admittance to a tech conference or hackathon? Even grownups can&#x27;t be trusted.')
