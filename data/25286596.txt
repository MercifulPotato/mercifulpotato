We indeed switch to Websockets for a few things that we would like to have (eventually) used HTTP&#x2F;2 Push for.<p>To give an example of an issue with this, is that we would like to receive updated resource states when they happen. Receiving these via websocket unfortunately means that they can&#x27;t really interact with the browser cache, which led us to implementing our own Javascript caching layer.<p>There&#x27;s many small examples of this where the ideal approach doesn&#x27;t exist yet, and we&#x27;re left to imperfect workarounds.')
