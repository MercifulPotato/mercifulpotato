Once at the top, suddenly the arbiter of honesty and righteousness.<p>Reddit - How long did they let &#x2F;r&#x2F;creepshots &#x2F;r&#x2F;jailbait and more run wild before shutting down? When it was convenient economically with investors and growth numbers? Only after a bad article was written?<p>Amazon - Make a list of all the businesses AWS have massive enterprise contracts with. How many do you think are with awful organizations&#x2F;governments? How much other small business terrible content is hosted on their platform?<p>Twitter - Flip flop when politically convenient on basically everything. Moments, search, comments are all literally designed where if you click any important political conversation the most inflaming reply is at the top. Then pretend “enough is enough” now. That the discourse is not a result of themselves?<p>Facebook - Built an entire business around encouraging what Cambridge Analytica did then come out and pretend to care about privacy and shocked that ‘they abused out platform’.<p>Google - Their ad platform is basically Cambridge Analytica. What consent do people actually think they are giving? The company’s goal is to basically be one giant “thisisyourdigitallife” app.<p>YouTube - Algorithms that radicalize but generate profit are okay, but then be outraged by it. Kidding me...<p>Box.com (similar non-info based tech co’s) - I’ve seen them tweet politics constantly from a high horse of morals. Let’s see a list of all their enterprise clients? I’m sure none of these growth tech service co’s do business with awful people, organizations, governments?<p>It’s time to point the finger in the mirror folks.')
