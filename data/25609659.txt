In the olden days, opinions were expressed through slow moving mediums such as news papers and press conferences. Those who wanted to criticize them had channels such as letters to newspaper editors, radio calls, etc, to express disagreement or point out flaws. This was good and bad. Good because you had to invest a finite amount of time and resources to express counter opinion. Bad because it has the effect of  amplifying the voices of fanatics.<p>However, with today&#x27;s friction free methods to express opinion and social media echo chambers that amplify everything, there is just too much noise.<p>I just hate Twitter and Facebook. Their ultimate contribution to society is sum negative.')
