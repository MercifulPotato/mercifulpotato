Very interesting! But the main downside seems to be the high voltage requirement. Hopefully there are more innovations in the space of robotic actuators. I hate that servos usually are not compliant and rather are controlled by position and not by torque &#x2F; force. I believe active compliance is not a real replacement for passive compliance in most use cases')
