The skynet system did not flag them for any of the reasons you would flag them, it is not intelligent, it simply runs map reduce on &quot;who talks to whom&quot; data, with some scores set for some of the numbers. By nature of the algorithm it tends to mark journalists and lawyers as high value targets, because their phones were in contact with scored phones or low value phones that were in contact with such scored phones.<p>Point is: if such a system would be used against other populations, it would again flag journalists and lawyers as high value.')
