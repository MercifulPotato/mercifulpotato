So I opened it and started a new project. And I really enjoyed it!<p>Something about coding on this oldish Mac makes me happy. I&#x27;m not sure why. In theory it&#x27;s worse in pretty much every way. Many websites have stopped working on the no longer supported copy of Firefox.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because the old machine reminds me of the time when programming was still new to me. Some of my earliest attempts at GUI apps are still on that Mac. Now I see the same tools, but know so much more things I can do with them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what my point is. I kinda lost interest in new tech as well, but somehow playing with an old computer made me excited about programming again.')
