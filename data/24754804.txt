Eventually, I chose to stay with Nvidia, because getting a new AMD card (apart from the fact that there seems to be no budget AMD cards...) seemed like a lottery in terms of having a stable Linux desktop environment, being my best bet to get an older generation card (RX570 or RX580), that had not much availability and they were overpriced here.<p>As for slowing down Linux desktop progress, I think it&#x27;s not Nvidia&#x27;s fault: you could always get a card from another vendor, although the alternatives were not as good. Well, maybe those other vendors are to blame, and not Nvidia...')
