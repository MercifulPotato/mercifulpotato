And not just just hobbies of creation, but also sports.<p>It takes a beginner significantly more energy to enjoy an activity, but once you are proficient in the basics (like keyboard playing for improvisation) the mental barrier is much lower, and you are more likely to just jump into it and enjoy yourself.<p>My father liked badminton, but was never good, and rarely played. Then, at some point in his busy life, he scheduled a lesson once a week, for two months.<p>It made such a dramatic change; he started to play weekly, even after the lesson ended, and each time with rejoicing and cheerfulness.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the same pattern on myself and my friends as well, in both arts and sports. So, I&#x27;d say if you think there&#x27;s something you might enjoy doing often, schedule some time to study it (again, doesn&#x27;t have to be long). Get better and get happier.')
