Although, to be completely honest, the functionality and design don&#x27;t seem to provide anything unique in comparison to already existing apps like trello &#x2F; todo apps which I believe suck. I have tried many of &quot;productivity&quot; tools but somehow always ended up with pen&amp;paper or notepad app. I wonder if that&#x27;s the best we can do in 21st century. And all of these apps seem to follow the same design paradigm.<p>After a pro-longed experimentation and reflection, I designed my own system. Shared it with friends and we&#x27;re building a tool with a slightly different approach. Hopefully to address user problems holistically. If anyone&#x27;s curious I&#x27;d be happy to share our work once ready. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;18lEuJ9cQLhgiPaH1K1bp2j8yy_BQYHscXMxSBaZzVxU&#x2F;edit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;18lEuJ9cQLhgiPaH1K1bp2j8yy_B...</a>')
