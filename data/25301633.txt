My point stands - assuming the land the Dothraki roamed is anything like somewhere on Earth is a leap. To suggest there are latitudes or that they are even on a spherical planet is a leap. They have what appears to be great seafaring cultures yet they always have to take what would appear to be the long way if they were in a spherical planet. Would their dragons fly in our physics? They cast steel in fires that couldn’t possibly be hot enough in our physics. There are innumerable examples to suggest their realm is quite unlike ours.<p>There’s simply no reason to assume Dothraki climate resembles ours.')
