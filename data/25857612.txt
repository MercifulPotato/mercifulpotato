I mean, upgrading security over time is mandatory and when I remember how it evolved for XMPP I clearly do not want an implementation that still has all the draw-backs that OTR had.<p>So I agree that XMPP is lacking some good governance, but I don&#x27;t see the rivaling XEPs necessarily as the core problem, as many of them had quite some time between the drafts. The bigger issue is that many clients don&#x27;t have enough developer momentum, so that XEPs that were drafted like 5 years ago are not implemented yet.<p>Regarding implementation bugs: I know XMPP has the compliance suite, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t catch bugs and is more of a basic testing for feature compatibility. Does Matrix have some kind of test suite, that simulates physical disconnects, package loss and the likes for testing real client and server implementations? I know that would not be an easy feat, but I wonder what the best way would be to build something like that, to improve the quality of the existing implementations.')
