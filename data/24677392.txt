Item(by='krick', descendants=None, kids=[24677648, 24677463, 24685402, 24677485, 24677788], score=None, time=1601802033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674490, text='So, this is basically YAML, &quot;but better&quot;. I can repeat once more that &quot;easily understood and used by both programmers and non-programmers&quot; is unapologetically stupid concept that can never succeed. So I see how all of this will sound all too familiar to anybody with a little experience, which makes them to automatically dismiss this <i>YAYAML</i>.<p>But YAML is really quite complicated, and JSON (which shouldn&#x27;t be used for config files <i>at all</i>) and TOML (which I love and wish it would gain more popularity) aren&#x27;t exactly alternatives to YAML. So, I would be actually totally ok with &quot;YAML, but better&quot;, as a way to deprecate YAML.<p>Now, it is clear from the start that this cannot deprecate YAML, because it doesn&#x27;t even have booleans and numbers. But, surprisingly, I can accept this as well: ok, let&#x27;s just assume that being good at dealing with strings <i>may</i> be enough.<p>The problem is, it isn&#x27;t clear at all from the docs, if this is better than YAML at anything. It raises dozens of questions. I&#x27;ll start with the most basic ones (using [] as a wrapper&#x2F;delimiter): how do I represent values [   a], [a   ], [&quot;a&quot;] and [&quot;&quot;] in this file format?')
