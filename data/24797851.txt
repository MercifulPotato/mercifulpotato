Item(by='JoshTriplett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602826896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796546, text='&gt; If we can&#x27;t do anything about the network effect then having a disinterested network should be preferable.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> a disinterested communication platform. I want a highly interested communication platform that actually cares and maintains standards. I&#x27;ve tried both, and I find moderated platforms far more enjoyable. I&#x27;m not telling <i>other people</i> what kind of platform they should prefer; I&#x27;m stating that both such platforms should be available to those who prefer them. Freedom of association is valuable.<p>&gt; let the userbase collectively handle the moderation<p>First, it&#x27;s not at all obvious why user moderation would avoid the liability, and why that wouldn&#x27;t put either the site or the user at risk under this new draconian liability scheme.<p>Second, user moderation like that requires some form of meta-moderation (&quot;which users get to moderate&quot;), and then you&#x27;re back to the same problem.<p>Third, you&#x27;re arguing that a site isn&#x27;t allowed to pay people to moderate, and instead should rely on unpaid labor by volunteers to make the site more useful.<p>Fourth, you&#x27;re effectively arguing that people who run websites (as opposed to those who use them) are not allowed to have standards. (And &quot;not allowed without incurring liability&quot; means &quot;not allowed&quot;, in practical terms.) No. If I host a chat server, and someone comes on and starts chanting &quot;butts butts butts butts&quot; (saw this one happen) or &quot;you should be gassed&quot; (also saw this one happen) or &quot;good ban all (slur)&quot; (saw that one in a flagged comment <i>on this website today</i>) or &quot;such-and-such group are mentally ill&quot; (I&#x27;ve seen this one too), they&#x27;re getting banned, whether I own the server or not, the same way they&#x27;d get kicked out of a party, or a cafe, or a business. Do you believe that, because I have standards and norms, I should not be allowed to run a server? Because if that causes me to incur liability for user&#x27;s content, I <i>cannot</i> run such a server. Why is that a problem? <i>Use someone else&#x27;s server.</i> I do, in fact, have freedom of association, and (modulo protected classes) believe very strongly in &quot;we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone&quot;.')
