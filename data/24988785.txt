From this information, a third party, such as\n    a sexual predator, could stalk and&#x2F;or harm victims by\n    exploiting insecure transmissions of vehicle\n    information.”\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s only one reasonable way to read this objection: our vehicles and&#x2F;or information services are insecure, and we don&#x27;t want you to be able to take advantage of it.<p>Instead of spending millions of dollars campaigning against this quite sensible proposal, why not spend the money developing secure transmission of information? Or better yet, transmitting as little information as possible in the first place?<p>Why do telematics companies need to know <i>where</i> you are? I&#x27;m aware that car insurance telematics companies provide location tracking for cases of vehicle theft (I had such a device in my car for my previous insurance provider), but that doesn&#x27;t have to be actively-transmitting location data at all times; it could instead do so only after a secure request to the device <i>from</i> the telematics company <i>after</i> a theft is reported.')
