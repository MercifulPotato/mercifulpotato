Inevitably someone will find a hack that turns the intent of the law around while remaining true to its letter.<p>This seems to be what dooms both pure libertarian capitalist schemes <i>and</i> pure socialist command economy schemes. In the former case there is not enough structure to contain exploits and no recourse when someone finds a good scam. In the latter case it&#x27;s impossible for central planners to imagine the results of their plans when they are exposed to opportunistic economic agents. The fatal flaw in both ideologies is their dogmatism. It causes them to fail to adapt when flaws and exploits in the rule system are inevitably found.')
