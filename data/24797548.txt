Specifically did studies on trailing edge dump and pressure side bleeding holes, the air is bled from 7-10th compressor stage for cooling.<p>3D printing would massively benefit it because more than structural loads, the part is at its thermal limits and structurally it becomes weak as a result. If they can just cool it by 200 degrees, it would be groundbreaking. The trailing edge of the blade is by far the most critical - thicker and aerodynamic efficiency will take a toll; make it razor sharp and it will just melt away.')
