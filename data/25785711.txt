Apple has done a lot of things that couldn&#x27;t be done: a computer without a floppy or serial ports, a phone without a keyboard, a headset without cables between your ears.<p>Building the iPhone was difficult. Building APNS and iCloud was difficult. Building the App Store was difficult. Building the Apple Watch was <i>fucking</i> difficult. Building the Ax line of mobile chips was difficult. Building the M1 was difficult. Don&#x27;t forget about airpods, homepods, and all the other mindbendingly hard shit Apple does all the time now.<p>Apple does insane technical achievements on a regular basis.  Secret sharing for e2e backups is well within their capabilities. Google even managed to e2e encrypt Android backups.<p>The problem is that Apple serves at the pleasure of the US military intelligence apparatus, and they know it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.')
