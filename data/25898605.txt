The problem isn&#x27;t censorship, it&#x27;s that people have this idea that censorship is inherently evil. I guess this stems from gross ignorance about how fucking stupid people in general are, and how they&#x27;re taken advantage of by charlatans, to the detriment of society as a whole.<p>Watch these two (short, 2min) clips showing an interview of the darling of the GOP:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Acyn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353144128188542977" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Acyn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353144128188542977</a>  \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Acyn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353147167523782657" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Acyn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353147167523782657</a><p>This is a video of a man who lied to get into office (about being a small businessman, about his accident derailing a Naval career, about being a constitutional expert, etc) and then used that platform to spread lies that led to insurrection and deaths.<p>It&#x27;s simply irresponsible to let such filth continue to mislead people, and censoring him would be better for USA, and better for the planet.')
