Those lists would be maintained by 3rd parties and users, just like eg. adblock blacklists and whitelists. For example, Python devs might maintain a list of search terms and associated urls that get boosted, including stack exchange and their own docs. &quot;Learn python&quot; tutorials would recommend you set up your search preferences for efficient python work, just like they recommend you set up the rest of your workflow. Japanese python devs might have their own list that boosts the official python docs and also whatever the popular local equivalent of stackexchange is in Japan, which gets recommended by the Japanese tutorials. People really into 3D printing can compile their own list for 3D printing hobbyists. You can apply and remove any number of these to your profile at a time.')
