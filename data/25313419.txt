A Web for cooking, a Web for politics etc).<p>The issue then is that you&#x27;re likely to get a balkanization of the webs of trust - echo chambers.\nHow we can support cross pollination of these webs is the issue. I don&#x27;t have an answer for that, but being able to trace news sources at least helps though.')
