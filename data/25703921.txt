Of 4 a priori known P&amp;Ds, the model detected 2 of them.  To say that they&#x27;ve got accuracy of a 50% or &quot;no better than a coin toss&quot;, ignores all of the non-P&amp;D events that it correctly didn&#x27;t identify as a P&amp;D.  If you did a coin toss, you would flip the coin much more than 4 times.')
