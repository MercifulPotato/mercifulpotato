It&#x27;s distinctly better than <i>not</i> being safe from a preemptive Russian nuclear strike. However, this is merely necessary; not sufficient.<p>Have you considered the vast number of non-nuclear aggressions that Russia might undertake, and in fact has already undertaken?<p>Crimea was safe from Russian nuclear attack too. Ask them how it went.<p>Are France and the UK&#x27;s nuclear arsenal going to help if Russia makes more Crimea-style land grabs? Shuts down shipping lanes? Cuts pipelines or internet access? Shoots down geostationary satellites over Europe? Assassinates the leader of a NATO nation?<p>Granted, there&#x27;s no guarantee that the United States would help you then, either. We have not been the most reliable partner, and I am deeply sorry for that. I do not support the leaders who have made things this way. I want us to be a better partner.<p>Regardless, surely you understand that there is a great need for conventional military deterrence by NATO? Nukes solve an <i>extremely</i> limited list of potential problems.')
