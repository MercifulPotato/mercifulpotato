Nor is HN just about &quot;tech&quot;—see the top of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>.<p>The important word in that guideline is not &quot;political&quot; but &quot;battle&quot;. When people are <i>just</i> trying to defeat enemies, that has nothing in common with curious conversation. Worse, it destroys curious conversation (as the guideline points out). For example, in battle, one must repeat the same points over and over—repetition is key to victory. But repetition kills curiosity (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20repetition%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20repetition%20by:da...</a>). Worse, in battle the goal is not to explore the world or think out loud, but to overpower someone else. Communication becomes weaponized and rhetorical. This leads to entirely different discussion, and it leads people to attack each other in nasty ways that destroy community. If we don&#x27;t moderate this, flames will take over the site completely.<p>The intention on HN is not to exclude political topics but to <i>include</i> them, when they&#x27;re interesting, in a way that is consistent with curiosity, which is the core value of this site (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;...</a>). That requires users to stay within the curious mode of conversation and forego the battle mode.<p>I&#x27;ve written about how we moderate politics on HN many times, and the questions and answers have been pretty stable for a long time. You&#x27;ll find past explanations here: .<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=political%20overlap%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=political%20overlap%20by:dang&amp;...</a>. If you or anyone have a better idea about how we should approach this, I&#x27;d love to hear it. But please make sure that you&#x27;ve familiarized yourself with the material first, because if it&#x27;s something simple like &quot;just ban politics&quot; or &quot;just allow everything&quot;, I&#x27;ve already answered many times why it won&#x27;t work.')
