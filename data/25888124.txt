This means you get working HTML powered by dynamic content out of the box, and it keeps working as content changes without needing constant builds for static sites.<p>I see the benefits of modern component-driven frontend systems but I think the better opportunity would be to integrate this cleanly into existing server-side engines rather than try to recreate the backend entirely or disassemble it down to such low-level build steps.')
