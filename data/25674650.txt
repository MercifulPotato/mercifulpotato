It&#x27;s not youtube pushing back against government misinformation. It&#x27;s about youtube punishing their users who express &quot;misinformation&quot; or wrongthink. Youtube is doing the opposite of what you are claiming. They are making the government&#x2F;establishment ( &quot;and given that the election results have now been certified &quot; ) narrative the default narrative that you cannot stray from on youtube.<p>I swear, the amount of people here blatantly and blindly support everything tech media does is rather interesting. I&#x27;d almost say there is a concerted effort here to push a pro-censorship and pro-tech narrative here backed by a political faction.<p>Oddly enough, you can still say Trump stole 2016 on youtube.')
