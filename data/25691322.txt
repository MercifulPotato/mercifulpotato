I&#x27;ve worked with some amazing people that respond best to very informal processes around performance-based feedback, and I&#x27;ve worked with some equally amazing people that desire a relatively rigid and analytical process. I think we all try to do what&#x27;s best for each person.<p>That said, it&#x27;s important that we do have guiding processes and principles here to ensure that everyone is being evaluated both fairly and effectively, so it&#x27;s not like the wild west or something.<p>Every &quot;track&quot; has levels with defined expectations in terms of the type of work they do, the impact they have, the interactions they have with teammates, others at Elastic, the community, etc. High performers would be folks that are at least meeting the expectations established for their level, which is where promotion comes in.<p>Promotion is not necessarily role-oriented in the sense that you don&#x27;t get promoted out of being an engineer into management or something like that, they are different parallel tracks. For example, I technically took a demotion to switch from a Tech Lead to an Eng. Manager role.<p>Processes do vary a bit team by team, though they&#x27;ve become more consistent over time and are pretty similar now. This is how things work on my teams:<p>I have 30 minute 1:1s with each person that reports to me every 2-3 weeks depending on their seniority. This is pretty informal, but the consistent face to face gives us opportunities to talk frequently about how things are going.<p>Every quarter I do a longer review with each team member. This isn&#x27;t super formal or anything, but it is more structured with a corresponding doc that I fill out in advance and that we both expand upon during our meeting. Nothing should be a surprise here as I give positive or critical feedback more regularly, but this is where we can really dig into aspects of their performance, rehash current expectations for their level and make plans with them for how to achieve their professional goals, whether it be promotion, type of work, transitioning to a different role, etc.<p>The 6 and 12 month reviews are a little more comprehensive as I also include anonymous 360 feedback from peers and others throughout Elastic.')
