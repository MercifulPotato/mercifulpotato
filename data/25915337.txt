Item(by='orwin', descendants=None, kids=[25915973], score=None, time=1611666336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915025, text='&gt; EU is laughing at us<p>I assure you we&#x27;re not, most of us aren&#x27;t at least. I feel sorry for everyone involved, including the EU.<p>I think the &quot;throw that form in the bin&quot; from B. Johnson last year was a low point of politics everywhere in the world and was a tell of a profound lack of empathy. I know some people will feel deseperate because of the new barriers (the Covid crisis did not help at all tbh), and luckily this one sentence is old enough so that not that many people will remember, but this is the kind of &quot;advice&quot; that can push a desperate person a  little bit too far.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m just joking&quot; doesn&#x27;t really work when you&#x27;re an adult.')
