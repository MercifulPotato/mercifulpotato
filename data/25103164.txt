A professional wouldn&#x27;t even engage with me, they&#x27;d note my feedback and move on -- I wasn&#x27;t replying to him and didn&#x27;t know who he was until he told me just how wrong I was.<p>Now I know he&#x27;s an asshole. Simple. An asshole with a really shit reference implementation for an overcomplicated protocol that only technically does what it claims, with little practical benefit.<p>Frankly to me, Matrix belongs in the same basket as Urbit: weird software for nerds written by eccentric assholes that are too pretentious to explain it to regular people because doing so would make their protocol less special and thereby self sabotaging adoption<p>The sooner Matrix is forked or better yet, dies, so that it stops stealing mind share from better projects, the better.')
