This is not super material with respect to what he is doing now, but I believe this is why such unusual phrasing is used in the article. It is likely Dr Oneto still passed his medicine boards and is a licensed MD, he just is limited to taking care of post surgical patients (moonlighting) and is not able to perform surgeries in California.')
