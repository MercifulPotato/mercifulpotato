As this will likely push premium laptop manufactures (Razer, Dell) towards ryzen CPUs, as opposed to using them in cheaper models. Loosening the grip that intel has on them.<p>With Zen3 on mobile, giving a similar 20% boost as it did on desktop, plus a jump from 7nm to to 5m, giving another 20%, next year might be a very good year for Ryzen laptops. Looking forward to a Ryzen 6000 XPS 13.<p>The other thing I&#x27;m grateful for M1 is that will most likely push the laptop manufactures to pay attention to thermals and noise.<p>The unpleasant thing, is that most likely Apple will be a process node ahead, with them most likely getting TSMC 3nm in 2022, and everyone else a year later. With a competitive year in-between.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to next year, to upgrading to a Ryzen 6000(5nm) cpu, if it&#x27;s good. And I&#x27;m looking forward for the more beefy apple arm chips and comparison between them. Also, maybe someone would compare a Ryzen 6000 hackintosh with an arm mac while it will be possible.<p>Also looking forward at Intel&#x27;s response, be it a partnership with TSMC, or fixing their nodes, and, fingers crossed, a completely new risc-v cpu.<p>Anyway, interesting stuff.')
