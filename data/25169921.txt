I don&#x27;t care to make much of an effort to socialize.  Sometimes I wish I cared more, but meh.  Still, I am a social animal.  I live in a city, with other animals.  I make sounds that other animals understand, and I can understand them too.  I wear my emotional state on my face and I can perceive the emotional state of others by looking at them.  I rely on my community to meet my basic needs, trading my services for food, shelter, and other things that please me.  I am a human, a social animal.')
