Item(by='chriswarbo', descendants=None, kids=[25988843], score=None, time=1612187844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988294, text='&gt; Oh no please don&#x27;t.<p>Don&#x27;t what? The author isn&#x27;t telling people to put NUL characters in their data; they&#x27;re telling Postgres not to abort in the presence of a NUL character.<p>The main job of a database is to store and retrieve data. Erroring-out for valid UTF-8 strings can <i>itself</i> &quot;wreak all kinds of havoc on applications&quot;, since it may be unexpected behaviour.<p>Personally, my expectation would be for a unicode string type to store any unicode string; and for data to be retrieved without modification. I would expect the same for any &quot;generic plumbing&quot; technology, whether it&#x27;s a database, a programming language, a file system, a data processing command or API, etc.<p>As a side note, I tend to use property-based testing, which is especially good at ensuring NUL characters are handled correctly (property-based testing uses randomly generated inputs, starting with &quot;small&quot; values, and &quot;shrinking&quot; counterexamples; NUL is considered the &quot;smallest&quot; character, so it appears quite often).')
