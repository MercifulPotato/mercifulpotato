There&#x27;s a pretty wide area between &quot;great&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot;, and I think that prop 22 is in there.<p>Regarding 7&#x2F;8 specifically, it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s &quot;not great&quot; and it&#x27;s also true that it is &quot;better than the default&quot;.<p>Consider the authors&#x27; perspectives for a moment, if only to understand it.  One party has a supermajority in the CA legislature, and they are openly hostile to prop 22.  They didn&#x27;t necessarily want an immutable proposition, but they also didn&#x27;t want it to be immediately nullified.  7&#x2F;8 seems like a way to guarantee that changes can be made <i>if and only if</i> there&#x27;s broad bipartisan support for those changes.<p>You don&#x27;t have to agree with that perspective but I think it should be said that there&#x27;s a non-nefarious way to see it.')
