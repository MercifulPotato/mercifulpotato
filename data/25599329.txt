On average, the federal government is paying quite a bit of money for tech people. I&#x27;d seriously estimate they&#x27;re paying almost FAANG rates in a lot of cases all told.<p>The problem is that a lot of it gets siphoned off in the contracting process. The contracting process needs to be fixed. There&#x27;s a ton of huge established players doing really bad work. IT specifically gets treated differently in government contracting, and is almost always procured through something called a GWAC which is basically a moat that it&#x27;s hard for new companies to get into (the goal is to streamline procurement by having &quot;vetted&quot; companies in this pool already but it usually means it&#x27;s very difficult for new players to get involved.)<p>That is changing, just very slowly. The agency that created this playbook, GSA, is helping facilitate that with things like introducing good vendors to other agencies and smaller more limited engagements.')
