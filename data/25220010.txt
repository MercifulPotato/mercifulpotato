If you drag the interior of the node, it moves.  To add a new arrow you drag from the immediate outside of the node.<p>Besides, in tikz I draw 3D commutative diagrams whose arrows pass in front&#x2F;behind of each other.  It is rather annoying to write the code for that, and it would be nice to do that somewhat automatically.  Does quiver support this?  For example, to draw a 3D cube.<p>EDIT: more comments: there are some important missing arrowhead styles.  For example, if there are bijections in your diagram, it is common to use a single bidirectional arrow with two arrohweads.')
