Not matter if it is work or my personal life. If I need to do focused work, I switch off Slack. At the same time, I love emails with long, detailed, well-thought points.<p>So, for my team (after trying quite a few options, with Slack being a no-go), I went for Basecamp. To a large extend, it is email-like, with chat and to-do lists as features (so can be used when needed), not - the core.<p>However - do you know some BC-like tools for community building (edu&#x2F;gaming)? Discord is considered the go-to solution, but it lacks &quot;posts&quot; for more focused content.')
