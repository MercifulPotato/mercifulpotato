Just 0.001% chance that you will be killed vs 99+% chance that you won&#x27;t. Believe me, you don&#x27;t want to be tossing this coin in a macro scale OR way too many times. Individually we make these choices every day and get out scratch free, BUT once you bring in enough coin tosses, there is an irrefutable point that one of it is going to end up killing you. Individually the hope is that you won&#x27;t take enough chances like that before you naturally die off.<p>As conservative as it sounds, keeping status quo is the safer option for a society. There is a reason we see folks turning conservative once they have generated enough wealth - the need to never be poor again far outweighs the need to be wealthy.')
