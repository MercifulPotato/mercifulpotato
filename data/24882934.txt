The inputs and outputs shifted a lot over the course of the project, as we came to understand the domain and implications of the work better.  At every update, the changes had to be transferred to a Microsoft Word document that went to the project sponsors.<p>Pandoc made this easy -- we just added scripts to write out the model inputs as Markdown tables, then embed those tables in a larger writeup, also written in Markdown.  Pandoc turned it all into a Word document.  Thus, the same toolchain that did the actual work, also drove the final report.  I really don&#x27;t think we could have had confidence all the tabular data was right, had it not been automated through Pandoc.')
