Seems like it could be extended to cover the non-shape based documentation (material properties, design loads, etc) as well.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve never seen is optimization techniques paired up with any sort of in-depth cost data. It&#x27;s usually based on na√Øve extrapolations based on total material weight or volume, and doesn&#x27;t take into account things like crane costs (a function of max component weight and building extents) local material availability, component fixed costs, number of connections, logistics costs, etc. There&#x27;s a ton of low-hanging fruit in design optimization that you could pick before you even had to reach for AI-based methods, though the AI methods are obviously the long term future of the space.<p>[1] - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.wpi.edu&#x2F;IQP&#x2F;BVCalcHist&#x2F;calc5.html#:~:text=A%20Computer%20Algebra%20system%20is,sometimes%20difficult%20algebraic%20manipulation%20tasks" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.wpi.edu&#x2F;IQP&#x2F;BVCalcHist&#x2F;calc5.html#:~:text=A%...</a>.')
