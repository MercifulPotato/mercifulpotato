Remotes being hit even for null foreign keys kills off some queries for us. Remotes not being supported in subscriptions (sort of understandable but still causes inconsistencies in user experience). We&#x27;ve had to be very strict with naming conventions for relationships etc or we find we&#x27;re constantly dealing with merge conflicts, but that&#x27;s as much our workflow issue. There&#x27;s poor support for Postgres enums. That&#x27;s the stuff I can remember off the top of my head, and none of it&#x27;s really a killer. Without something like Hasura my interest in GraphQL drops close to zero, to be clear, so it&#x27;s providing a lot of value.')
