A working IDE that integrates easily with all mainstream editors, extensions for all mainstream editors, cross-platform compilation for all major environments, a secure and effective dependency manager, a secure and effective build tool, and incremental compilation are all requirements for a language to get off the ground. Honestly, that seems like a big hurdle for one person or even a dedicated team to manage effectively without major funding outside of what is normally present in research grants. Hosting and curation alone for the dependency package system is a costly problem.<p>Are we as developers painting ourselves into a corner of stagnating pl technology with our expectations that all these things exist in order for us to call a language &quot;good?&quot;')
