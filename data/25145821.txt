There is no model. People who say there&#x27;s a model, they&#x27;re talking about something else - sometimes, a literal Platonic ideal of biology, that makes for an appealing pop science course, but not knowledge that like, helps you design experiments or better use drugs or whatever.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; It was hard to get through a sentence without having to consult Wikipedia. In immunology in particular the nomenclature is expansive.<p>This is a common refrain. &quot;Paternal allo-antigens&quot; for example, straight from the literature: people who do immunology research know what that means, they do not get tripped up like this author does.<p>Programming computers and being good at math does not prepare you at all for understanding this stuff! Watson and Crick were not math savants. They did not have natural gifts.')
