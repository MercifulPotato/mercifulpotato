If those expire in the money, these people will be on the hook to buy 100s of shares of GME and likely don&#x27;t have the cash on hand to purchase the shares (which leave RH holding the bag).<p>On one hand, you could say RH shouldn&#x27;t let people buy options if RH doesn&#x27;t believe those people can pay up when the option expires. On the other hand, you have people buying options who maybe don&#x27;t understand that you need cash to buy the shares if the option expires in the money.')
