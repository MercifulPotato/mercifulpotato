Nobody uses Python for real programs, they use an ad-hoc kludge of Python and C&#x2F;C++. This is basically fine if you&#x27;re doing bread-and-butter things that are well covered by existing libraries, but it&#x27;s a serious drag if you&#x27;re trying to do anything really interesting.<p>Python still suits a lot of people and that&#x27;s fine, but &quot;mature&quot; is very much a double-edged sword. We&#x27;re in the middle of a scientific computing renaissance right now and Python really isn&#x27;t keeping up; it was designed by and for hackers, but Julia is a multi-disciplinary effort.')
