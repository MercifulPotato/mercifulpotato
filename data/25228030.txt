One guy was complaining on my Facebook about how the battery went dead on his car remote and he misses the day when you could start the car with a physical key. Well, from a UX perspective, the key was never intrinsically desired. What is actually desired is that &quot;only authorized users can access the car and start the engine, and without any delay in doing so&quot;. Unfortunately for him, his new car didn&#x27;t have as expensive of tech as mine. In my Lexus even if the battery is completely dead, you can hold the key fob close to the steering column and it can still read the chip. The ultimate version of the technology will have no flaws or caveats and just always work for authorized users without them needing to remember to carry an object or have batteries.<p>So yeah the first versions of phones had terrible UX, they sounded when the owner shouldn&#x27;t have been disturbed. But what we must remember is that this state of affairs should have never come to exist in the first place. It&#x27;s just at the time, no one knew how to remedy it.<p>This type of thing will soon be forgotten except for an obscure reference in history books explaining why some time period story makes sense (why the father got enraged at being woken up). Meanwhile, until then, bringing it up in conversation will be a good way to signal to young people that you are &quot;really, really old&quot;. It is barely a blip no the radar once humans have had phones for 1000 years.')
