Yet I have long seen it as the height of hubris to think we could <i>replace</i> this planet from which we arose.<p>Everything from gravity to day length to soil composition, never mind the atmosphere which is at least theoretically reproducible, is something with millions of years of adaptation encoded into our genes, and has no compatible world within our known universe.<p>We can and should explore, and some will choose to make their home among the stars, but as a species, nothing can replace our Earth.')
