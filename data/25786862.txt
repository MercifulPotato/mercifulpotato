Item(by='ickyforce', descendants=2, kids=[25787212, 25787073], score=1, time=1610683234, title='What tools do you use to aggregate test results?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m looking for a tool which would present results of automated system tests that talk to a real environment via API. Think E2E but without UI. Ideally I&#x27;d like to use a standard framework for such tests (like junit, jest, rspec) and upload the results somewhere. Devs would be able to browse them, filter by environment, version and other tags, view logs or attached comments, see execution history for a single test and maybe some basic reports.<p>I&#x27;ve found https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reportportal.io&#x2F; which seems like an ideal fit but will be complex to manage (microservices + postgres + rabbit + elasticsearch). TestRail might be good, will need to evaluate it, although it&#x27;s more expensive than I would expect. I think that TeamCity has a decent view of test results but it&#x27;s a full-blown CI system, more than I need.<p>Is there some other tool that you&#x27;d suggest? Preferably a managed offering.')
