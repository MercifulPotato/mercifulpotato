Its filters are top notch and it has one of the best and fastest spam filtering as I&#x27;ve seen.<p>One of the same accounts on Thunderbird is also managed via KMail on my (personal) workstation and I love some features of KMail too but, it doesn&#x27;t feel as fast and nimble. I keep KMail because of its KDE &amp; Akonadi integration (it continues to process mail even if KMail is not running).<p>At the end of the day, Thunderbird is an awesome E-mail client. It does everything and doesn&#x27;t crash even if I leave it open for weeks. 78 integrates lightning so, calendars are well integrated and works flawlessly for me too.<p>I&#x27;ve also did some enterprise integration work on Thunderbird and it has some nice flexibility options under the hood.<p>However I need to note that (in my case) all systems it communicates with are UNIX servers (Sendmail, Postfix, Dovecot, et. al).<p>Of course, YMMV.')
