Suppose the developers and testers have Macs on their desks, but you still want to have your CI run in the Cloud. Now I&#x27;m not an expert on cloud pricing so I could be wrong, but I imagine you could benefit from paying by the minute in that case, depending on the specifics of your situation (builds per day, time per build, total cost of ownership of having a build farm in house).')
