I keep far from it even now. It is not good to have a uncritical self image. Keep doing the good work, enjoy life. Nobody knows what will happen, so plan for the risks ahead, and keep chaos at bay. That&#x27;s the best you can do. Rest is gravy. One of the worst things anyone can do is feel bad about things that they shouldn&#x27;t feel bad over. The time spent doing so is wasted, it belittles your spent effort, and creates a poor self image. And keep away from snobs. It is not worth killing yourself over. If you are born in US, you should be able to pickup friends outside your country circle anyways. Don&#x27;t fix the wrong bug. Cheers.')
