But not in a good way.<p>Crooks use search engines to find pages that have exploitable js code or sql injection vulnerabilities. They use them to find unprotected comment sections so they can inject spam into them. They use them to build dossiers on people by scraping public information sites. And all that API use, they never pay a dime for access. Nor will they reveal who they are in order to get access. It just isn&#x27;t how they operate.<p>At its peak I had over 2.6 MILLION internet hosts black listed from using the Blekko API. Exactly zero reached out to any of the easily found contact addresses and said &quot;Hey your API seems to be unresponsive&quot; :-)')
