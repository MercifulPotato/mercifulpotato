Item(by='Razengan', descendants=None, kids=[25385424, 25384467], score=None, time=1607683529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373105, text='I highly recommend watching the anime Dennou Coil [0] to see what the world could be like if AR glasses were as common as smartphones today:<p>• Everybody is connected to the same &quot;AR space&quot; and sees the same AR objects.<p>• Different people may have different view&#x2F;interact access to different objects.<p>• Some form of tactile feedback is assumed. In Apple&#x27;s case we will assume this to be provided via the Apple Watch or a hypothetical AR gloves accessory.<p>• Many things that are currently physical could be replaced with virtual versions: screens, keyboards, signage, fashion, pets.<p>Many developers have already noticed the gradual introduction of APIs and hardware like LIDAR that are so obviously meant to support a future glasses product, but I wonder if anyone&#x27;s connected the dots between features like the spatial audio recently introduced to AirPods.<p>Apple&#x27;s AR strategy is very likely going to be divided across their different products: iPhone (processing), Glasses (display), Watch (motion control and tactile feedback), and of course AirPods. Many of their users already own most of those devices. No other company is so perfectly positioned to finally deliver ubiquitous AR.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myanimelist.net&#x2F;anime&#x2F;2164&#x2F;Dennou_Coil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myanimelist.net&#x2F;anime&#x2F;2164&#x2F;Dennou_Coil</a>')
