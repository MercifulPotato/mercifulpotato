Basically, Mercedes can afford to try new things in racing, because it will bring them money in the long run, by selling those new features in their &quot;normal&quot; (road) sports cars. Even if we limit the research costs, some other Mercedes team will work with (eg.) engine optimizations for their production sports cars, and those findings will also find their way to racing.<p>Even with mainstream car makers (which most of the companies there are), it&#x27;s easier to develop racing stuff, if you then sell a bunch of very expensive, very fast street-legal cars, than if you sell mostly &quot;normal, working people cars&quot;.')
