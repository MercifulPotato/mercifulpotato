When you use a decent distro, the main apps are themed properly and somewhat cohesive. But the illusion falls apart the moment you wander a bit from mainstream applications. Having consistent themes and behaviours for Qt, GTK 3, and GTK 2 (so, the common denominator, which is the bare minimum but not many fancy features) only gets you partly there.<p>So, by “properly configured” I meant “with settings tweaked over a couple of years until the apps I care about behave sensibly”.<p>What I like with macOS is that the easy path produces the most consistent UI across the platform. It does not prevent stupid developers from reimplementing everything (hello, non-standard text fields in Adobe software, non-standard notifications in battle.net, and overall appalling window themes). But at least they have to go out of their way to do it, and applications from developers who care are great for not much effort on their part.')
