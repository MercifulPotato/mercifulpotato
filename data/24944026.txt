It is definitely more complicated. It sounds easy in practice--just rank your candidates--but how you actually put that down on paper in a machine-readable way is a bit non-obvious. Here&#x27;s an example of how it actually looks[1]. Now imagine that same thing, for every office on the ballot... It&#x27;s not too bad if you know what you&#x27;re doing, but it&#x27;s easy to see how someone would do it wrong.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m a huge fan of RCV and think it is massively unethical that we do not have it (or some similar system) for all elections. I consider elections that don&#x27;t use RCV to be borderline invalid.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minnpost.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;mpls-sample-ballot.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minnpost.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;fi...</a>')
