Quantum Foundations was strongly disfavoured as a research pastime for decades - not because Shut Up and Calculate gets the right answer (it doesn&#x27;t for many problems, including those that involve gravity) but because the risks of failure and obscurity were too high, there were few academic champions, it was seen as academically fringe, and the potential rewards for bolting something new onto the Standard Model without fundamentally changing its assumptions were much higher.<p>There&#x27;s also been the - likely incorrect - belief that different models are too hard to distinguish experimentally.<p>So there&#x27;s been a process of continuous refinement of existing theories which are known to be incomplete, and no concerted and sustained attempt to solve foundational philosophical problems - which is the level that Einstein, Newton, and other pioneers operated at.')
