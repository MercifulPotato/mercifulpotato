Because people value different things?<p>I stay on MacOS because it works very, very, very well for what I want to do.<p>There are a large number of affirmative reasons I prefer Macs. Hardware build quality has traditionally been stellar, on par with the golden age of Thinkpads (which is one reason the keyboard thing was so jarring). The OS is immensely, profoundly stable. The built-in tools for things like mail, contacts, and calendars work very very well. The overall polish of the experience is unmatched.<p>AND I have access to a bash prompt, and a whole host of FOSS offerings for things I might want. (As I&#x27;ve moved away from actually writing code, this has mostly boiled down to emacs and a few other bits, but still; it&#x27;s comforting.)<p>I also use an iPhone, an iPad, and have an Apple Watch. The seamless integration is really, really great. I&#x27;d be hard pressed to give that up.<p>Add to this the fact that there are material reasons I want to AVOID the other two players:<p>- Windows is a chaotic disaster in terms of consistency, stability, overall design, and general behavior over time. The degree of weird enmeshment of binaries required to install software more or less guarantees system bloat that just doesn&#x27;t happen on Macs.<p>- Linux can be many things to many people, and if Apple hadn&#x27;t moved to a unixy base at the turn of the century I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have ended up there. But as it is, I&#x27;m just not willing to tinker around to achieve a workable environment for me, or deal with the inevitable interoperability challenges that would come from living without the COTS tools I rely on, like Office.')
