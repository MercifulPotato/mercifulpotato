My email provider returned a permanent error one day (due to an issue on their end), so GitLab silently stopped sending any emails to my address. I checked my email in the preferences many times and had no idea it was blocked on GitLab&#x27;s end. Eventually, after not getting any notifications, I contacted their customer service and was told of this hidden setting.<p>So if you are not getting any notifications from GitLab, even though your email is correct, I suggest contacting them and asking if you have been blocked due to an error.')
