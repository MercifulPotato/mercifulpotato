At least when implemented as in clojure or srfi-171.<p>I understand that there might be some overhead to creating new sequence objects, but removing intermediate sequence object creation should be simple, at least for built in map-filter-take-et-al.<p>Edit: I seem to be wrong. People are recommending transducers over clojure&#x27;s lazy map-filter-take-et-al because of overhead, which to me seems off, but there might be something about clojure&#x27;s lazy sequences that I haven&#x27;t grooked.')
