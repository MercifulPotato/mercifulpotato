Isn&#x27;t it more likely that these super-successful companies use these interviews because they end up hiring the people they want to hire, and it&#x27;s you, the poster, lacking a clue as to what that looks like?<p>Basically the heuristic is, if something&#x2F;someone is successful and it seems stupid to you, start by assuming it&#x27;s you who likely has something to learn.')
