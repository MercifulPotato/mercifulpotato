That does happen, obviously, and we can certainly object to it.<p>In the case of rewriting an application feature for feature in another language, that may or may not be a good idea. Maybe we&#x27;re switching from an interpreted language to a compiled language because we need better performance. Maybe we&#x27;re replacing a huge pile of impenetrable bash with a well organized Python app. Maybe we&#x27;re taking advantage of a library that&#x27;s only available in another language. Maybe there&#x27;s a good reason for the rewrite but it&#x27;s so much work that it&#x27;s still not worth it. Maybe it&#x27;s just a engineers wanting to use the latest toys because it&#x27;ll look good on their resumes.<p>It&#x27;s totally legit to question the need for a given project. But the phrase &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; is just scornful insult. It adds nothing to the discussion, and in fact makes it harder to discuss trade-offs.')
