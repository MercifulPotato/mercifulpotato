I&#x27;m Brazilian, very white, green eyes, brown hair that was lighter when I was younger.<p>About 30 years ago (wow!), in my late teens I organized a party on a house my aunt recently bought to become her medical practice. We had lots of drinks, some drugs, a DJ, live music and some guests walking over the roof of neighboring houses. Police got called.<p>When they saw me, young and privileged, they wanted to arrest me. I offered them a beer, they entered the house, one of them played the drum set with his service gun. They drank some fancy cocktails.<p>They enjoyed themselves for about 15 minutes until they were called on the radio. Then they told me, laughing, I should try to control my guests a little better. Then they went away.<p>If we weren&#x27;t a bunch or privileged white kids in an upper middle class neighborhood, they&#x27;d most likely arrive shooting, as they do when there are parties in slums.')
