It&#x27;s fair to say that people with one or more of those (not an exhaustive list) are &quot;unhealthy&quot;.<p>So, it&#x27;s not misleading: it&#x27;s people who are vulnerable either due to age or health reasons that are at risk of dying, no one else.<p>It was even raised by an MP recently and he asked Boris Johnston why we&#x27;re getting locked down when only 400 or so people with no underlying conditions have died... everyone else had underlying conditions related to poor health that made them susceptible so they should have been locked down and the rest of us left to get on with things.')
