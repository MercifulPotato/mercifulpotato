Yes, compared to many in the US, you were &#x27;privileged&#x27; with respect to education, because you had free university-level education provided.  This is something that is outside the reach of many who want it here, and for some who get it, they get it with burdensome financial strings attached.  So..., in that respect, you were privileged.  People in the US are &#x27;privileged&#x27; in other respects compared to your circumstances.  But using the word &#x27;privileged&#x27; as some sort of singular distinctive quality doesn&#x27;t make much sense.')
