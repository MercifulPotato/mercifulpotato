I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;re still a lot of punch card programs and today no new system support it. Also there&#x27;s always a option to not use the new technology that dropped backwards compatibility, which is why many people still buy second hand game consoles and casette players. I love them, but I accept the fact that they&#x27;re no longer backward compatible with new devices.')
