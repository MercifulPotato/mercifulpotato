A technology is designed to serve a purpose, and is said to work if it achieves that purpose reasonably well.<p>My simplistic view is that government money such as the dollar serves a small handful of purposes: It&#x27;s a medium of exchange, short term store of value, and tool of government economic policy. The government has loosely defined &quot;short term&quot; by the target inflation rate. I suppose that regularizing the taxation process is another purpose.<p>Does it work? Apparently some national currencies work better than others. People in some countries will, if possible, use some other country&#x27;s money in preference over their own, for all but minor daily transactions. Thus, objecting to one kind of money, and swapping it for another, predates bitcoins.<p>What I think makes bitcoin different is that no government can influence its purpose, leaving its purpose up to each user to define on their own terms.<p>Perhaps another way of thinking about it, is that its own behavior defines its purpose, because if your use is in opposition to its behavior, then it doesn&#x27;t work for you. This could be said to be true of dollars as well.')
