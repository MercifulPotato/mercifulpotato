It is simple innocence until proven guilty. Asserting fraud is making an accusation that crimes occurred, and the burden of proof is not on the accused.<p>The idea that the proof is too well hidden is itself un-falsifiable, as any amount of effort to find proof, if it doesn&#x27;t exist, can simply be dismissed as &quot;well it&#x27;s just too well hidden&quot;.<p>If you are starting from an assumption of guilt, then sure:  any lack of evidence will always appear to be evidence that is well hidden. If you assume guilt then it is practically axiomatic that lack of evidence really means it&#x27;s well hidden.<p>Storming the Capitol does not change the burden of proof. The underlying issues have also been addressed in a few dozen failed court cases. By all means examine the evidence, but actually have some: saying you can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s too well hidden is not a rational approach.')
