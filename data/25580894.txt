Item(by='gpderetta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609328998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580703, text='a map is a set indexed only on a subset of the fields of your type.<p>This maps directly to the relational model, where a table (or relation) being a set of tuples is the fundamental concept: for your typical programming language set the uniqueness constraint (and key), would be comprised by all the columns, while for a map it would only be comprised by a subset (just one at the limit), while the remaining columns would be the mapped type.<p>Set operations  (union, intersection, difference) do make sense for maps as well in fact.<p>Given a powerful enough language, you can generalize your sets and maps with multiple uniqueness constraints and secondary indices. See boost.multindex for example.<p>edit: and BTW, most STL implementations use the same underlying implementation for std::set and std::map which has a set-like interface with the ability to specify the key mapping function.')
