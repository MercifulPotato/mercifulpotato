The other two companies I&#x27;ve worked with that had on-call experiences, if anything like that happened, we would be tweaking alarm levels so it didn&#x27;t happen anymore.<p>If you&#x27;re not tweaking alarm levels or fixing code to clear out false alarms, it&#x27;s not a sustainable on-call rotation and that needs to be fixed immediately.<p>I&#x27;ve been the solitary on-call for the main service of a company before and I almost never got called because 1) we had good KB articles for the operations center for when things did break; and, 2) things very rarely broke in a way that wasn&#x27;t <i></i>automatically fixable<i></i><p>It&#x27;s amazing how many cases &quot;remove broken machine from pool automatically and then restart service and bring that machine back on service crash&quot; is a valid fix for the weird, extra edge case junk that would otherwise be a call.')
