In most cases authentication gets kind of tricky because you need to set up everything yourself on the workstation.<p>For web-based certificate authentication, if you follow instructions for setting up CACs, then you&#x27;re usually good (but you have to just ignore the US Military specific stuff): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;militarycac.com&#x2F;macnotes.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;militarycac.com&#x2F;macnotes.htm</a><p>Yubico also provide some instructions for each platform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.yubico.com&#x2F;PIV&#x2F;Guides&#x2F;Smart_card-only_authentication_on_macOS.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.yubico.com&#x2F;PIV&#x2F;Guides&#x2F;Smart_card-only_aut...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.yubico.com&#x2F;PIV&#x2F;Guides&#x2F;SSH_with_PIV_and_PKCS11.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.yubico.com&#x2F;PIV&#x2F;Guides&#x2F;SSH_with_PIV_and_PK...</a><p>In the end though a centrally managed authentication solution isn&#x27;t really easy a quick and easy set up for *nix or Mac, unlike Windows with Active Directory. Perhaps in the future something better will come along.<p>And the same applies with iOS and Android - I&#x27;ve seen some pretty hacky products where they&#x27;ll interface with smart card readers onto phones do things like authentication to websites or email encryption, but in the end you had to use the vendor&#x27;s browsers&#x2F;mail clients instead because only they could handle the integration with the PIV cards. YubiKeys can now connect to phones too, but you&#x27;ve gotta have the right combination of YubiKey and phone to get that connectivity going - and you&#x27;re still limited to what the apps on the phone actually support.')
