They&#x27;re creating value for their customers, and releasing open source software while doing so. Indeed it&#x27;s Elastic who tried to get all the positives of open source with none of the negatives (as evidenced by them making Elasticsearch&#x2F;Kibana no longer open source)<p>BTW, not that it&#x27;s super relevant but the narrative that Amazon is driving Elastic bankrupt is farcical. Elastic pulls in $500MM in revenue and is valued at $15B+. Elastic&#x27;s doing fine.<p>Note: One thing Amazon did do that was unethical was claim that they had &quot;collaborated with Elastic&quot; when they announced AWS Elasticsearch long ago. That is indefensible. But there is nothing wrong with them forking.')
