To determine a unique user, we store an identifier on the device&#x27;s local storage, and that will remain the same as long as the user uses the same browser and same device and doesn&#x27;t clear their local cache data. Mobile is similar. An identifier remains across updates and gets removed if you delete the app.<p>So does that mean that if they are running Cookie AutoDelete or Temporary Containers addons, or simply clear all their browser data after exiting, any single user could easily eat all your user limit if they just repeatedly connected to the service? Or, even just having a single person connect on their desktop, laptop and phone once would eat 3 of your licenses?')
