Local, specialized knowledge is essential, and is one of the hardest features to scale, if it&#x27;s possible at all.<p>Also, this reminds me of stories about Soviet manufacturing quotas[1]:<p>&gt; The Soviet Union was the largest producer of shoes in the world. It was turning out 800 million pairs of shoes a yearâ€“twice as many as Italy, three times as many as the United States, four times as many as China. Production amounted to more than three pairs of shoes per year for every Soviet man, woman, and child.<p>&gt; The problem with shoes, it turned out, was not an absolute shortage. It was a far more subtle malfunction. The comfort, the fit, the design, and the size mix of Soviet shoes were so out of sync with what people needed and wanted that they were willing to stand in line for hours to buy the occasional pair, usually imported, that they liked.<p>Or even more ridiculous[2]:<p>&gt; But probabably the most outrageous malfunction of the system was of a factory that fabricated metal products. It had a quota for scrap metal for recycling. The factory was operating more efficiently than expected so it was not generating as much scrap as expected. Since the factory was not meeting its scrap metal quota the higher authorities were going to fine it. So the factor personnel did what to them was rational. They took perfectly good zinc metal sheets and converted them into scrap to fulfill their scrap metal quota.<p>When looking at large organizations through the lens of information problems, one realizes that Amazon, Google, Walmart <i>et al.</i> all exist on continuum along with the Soviet Union or even the US Government.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econlib.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2009&#x2F;09&#x2F;soviet_shoes.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econlib.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2009&#x2F;09&#x2F;soviet_shoes.html</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sjsu.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;watkins&#x2F;stalinmodel.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sjsu.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;watkins&#x2F;stalinmodel.htm</a>')
