There&#x27;s a lot of money in that. In servers power consumption is an important consideration and they have an advantage there as well. ARM based architectures are also a lot more relaxed in that they don&#x27;t have to present a nearly sequentially consistent view of cache and memory between multiple cores like x86. That may give them an edge scaling the core count. It&#x27;s horrible to program for if you are coding lock free algorithms, but almost nobody does that and fewer should.')
