With everything capped at 1 or 1.2TB of transfer per month, there&#x27;s no point to having internet any faster.<p>My ISP doesn&#x27;t cap at 1-1.2 TB (CenturyLink, Seattle metro area, &quot;gigabit&quot; service plan).  Comcast is often a monopoly, but it isn&#x27;t the only ISP in the US.  Your point is certainly valid for Comcast customers, and in other areas where all ISPs cap at some relatively small amount of &#x27;maxBW x hours&#x27;.')
