(There are some other mechanism employed in recent years as well (&quot;quantitative easing&quot;), but the message is the same: we are at the limits of <i>monetary</i> policy.)<p>After that it is up to governments, <i>if they so choose</i>, to also do <i>fiscal</i> policy initiatives, e.g., Keynesian economics: create economic demand through public spending (since private business spending&#x2F;demand is in the toilet).<p>Of course government are <i>free not to do anything at all</i>, which would generally entail lower economic growth and higher employment.<p>But central banks have a mandate to make sure the economy is in a certain middle-ground: not too hot to induce a lot of inflation, and not too cold to have a lot of people out of work.† Everyone agrees to these goals ahead of time:<p>&gt; <i>The Federal Reserve works to promote a strong U.S. economy. Specifically, the Congress has assigned the Fed to conduct the nation’s monetary policy to support the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;what-economic-goals-does-federal-reserve-seek-to-achieve-through-monetary-policy.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;what-economic-goals-does...</a><p>The &quot;unelected technocrats&quot; are doing what they were hired to do. They each have a fixed term (though renewable), and if they don&#x27;t do what they&#x27;re supposed to they are replaced.<p>They did not sneak into these positions: they were told to work towards certain goals, and they are using the tools at their disposal. They are no different than the Board of a corporation hired by the shareholders of the company: it&#x27;s just that the &quot;shareholders&quot; are elected representatives (Congress, parliaments, etc).<p>If the Board is not doing a satisfactory job it can be sacked with cause if necessary.<p>† Sometimes you actually have both: see &quot;stagflation&quot;.')
