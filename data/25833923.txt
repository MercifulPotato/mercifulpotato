But the main question should be: why? And the article does not really answer that, well beyond censorship.</i><p>There&#x27;s two types of articles around politicized topics like this:<p>1. Those dealing with Why: for the unconverted<p>2. Those dealing with How: for the converted<p>Both types are necessary, but I feel often articles that are being read by &quot;the converted&quot; spend far too long trying to deal with the &quot;Why&quot; (preaching to the converted). So this article is refreshing in that sense.')
