On whether these activists are secessionists: their demands focus on advancing democratic elections in Hong Kong while continuing under the &quot;one country two systems&quot; framework, the claim that they are asking for secession is incorrect given that the vast majority of the activists do not want Hong Kong to secede from China.<p>Edit: see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;yp&#x2F;discover&#x2F;news&#x2F;hong-kong&#x2F;article&#x2F;3065950&#x2F;hong-kong-protests-what-are-five-demands-what-do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;yp&#x2F;discover&#x2F;news&#x2F;hong-kong&#x2F;article&#x2F;3065...</a> which is from a newspaper in China (so even if it is biased, it would be biased towards pro-CCP views). As you can see, these activists want self-determination for Hong Kong, but do not want Hong Kong to leave or secede from China.')
