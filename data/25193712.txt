But not everyone becomes one for the same reason.  Assuming negatives about everyone in that group is unfair and unhelpful to the people that are within it trying to actually enact change.<p>In what way is disparaging anyone who is a police officer because they are a police officer any different than disparaging anyone that is a lawyer because of the numerous negative stories about lawyers?  There&#x27;s plenty of jokes about lawyers, but I assume most people take those for what they are, jokes playing on stereotypes that shouldn&#x27;t be applied to an individual or inform your opinion of an individual prior to evidence about them.<p>Are you saying it&#x27;s okay to immediately have an opinion about the trustworthiness or likelihood of an individual police officer <i>just because they are a police officer</i>?  That seems to be what your comment is defending.')
