Countries in South America locked down hard and early but it had no effect on the pandemic spread.<p>This is false. The hard lockdown period in most SA countries lasted 3-6 weeks at most; after that there was almost no enforcement by the police, no fines handed out, no public shaming. It was essentially left up to individuals with ample latitude in how they chose to exercise self-imposed freedom.<p>Poor people in SA did not generally have the option to stay at home with a robust safety net such as in Europe. Wealthier business owners have to deal with an inefficient legal system that burdens anyone who does things by the book.<p>The first few weeks with a <i>real</i> lockdown were remarkably effective, as shown by the mobility and disease transmission stats. As soon as the countries stopped using their monopoly of force to limit mobility, the disease shot up, in an entirely predictable manner.<p>It&#x27;s truly unfortunate that this misinformation keeps cropping up.')
