OK, I&#x27;ll take the bait.<p>Why don&#x27;t we have more advocates for unplugging from the internet?  A reasonable person that has lived both online and offline lives would certainly come to the conclusion that online life is inherently inferior to an &quot;offline&quot; life.  Social media is inherently unhealthy and attracts people with unhealthy lifestyles and choices.  Why should Mozilla&#x27;s mission be to promote a &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;online&quot; life when &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;online&quot; we know cannot coexist?<p>Like, instead of donating to Mozilla to promote good social media use for teenagers&#x2F;children, how about donating to $NONPROFIT to give low-income families a quality Boy Scouts&#x2F;camping experience and learn how to live and enjoy life through healthier means for example?  We do not have to make online life the norm.')
