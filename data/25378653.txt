It was locked for &quot;suspicious activity&quot; the exact moment I linked my Oculus account to my Facebook account. It gave me two options to unlock it: link my Facebook account with a google account, or send in some pictures of a government ID for verification. I don&#x27;t believe that the act of linking two, required, accounts on the first day the device was publicly  available, before my first experience with VR, is somehow racist or objectionable.')
