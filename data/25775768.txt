American absurdism is rooted in fake speech with the intent to cheat and steal. It&#x27;s perfectly permisible for politicians, businesses, and even individuals to say whatever they need to say to get what is not rightfully theirs. And they all get away with it, because the law hasn&#x27;t caught up with fake speech yet.<p>Why did this happen? Because they intended to. But the law only punishes what they did, and provides loopholes for not ever admitting intent, so long as they lie about it. That lie is the true crime. That lie is profitable.<p>Irnonically, in modern America, it takes a fake news show to be honest about the news, and a comedian to be honest about modern culture. That&#x27;s also absurd. Hilarious, but absurd.<p>&quot;When telling the truth, if you don&#x27;t make them laugh, they will kill you.&quot;')
