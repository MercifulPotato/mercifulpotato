Often if you deny it or don&#x27;t answer you also get a rant about how famous the influencer is and how you will repent for not going along.<p>I have a friend that has a Piadina[1] restaurant. I have seen the emails first hand. They even have a big sign in the front door in the lines of &quot;Influencers: no free meals&quot;.
