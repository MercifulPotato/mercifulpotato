I want my phone to tell me &quot;7 days since you last called your parents&quot;, &quot;4 days since you last did the dishes&quot;, &quot;3 hours since you just took a moment for yourself&quot;. These would be silent yet persistent notifications that I&#x27;d see anytime I check my phone. Easy to dismiss&#x2F;reset to 0. I want to feel accountable before the task turns into something I&#x27;m ashamed of like &quot;147 days since you called your grandma&quot;.<p>I imagine you&#x27;d set thresholds for each event, and the notifications would have a simple reset button. But other than that, you&#x27;d never really open the app. If you do something on your own, it&#x27;ll feel good to dismiss the item like crossing it off the todo list.<p>I assume this would be real easy to make, but learning anything app related always feels like a monolithic task.
