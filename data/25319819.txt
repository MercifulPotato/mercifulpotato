It&#x27;s like writing `.&#x2F;foo` vs `foo` in shell. Common Lisp is naturally more like operating system than programming language anyway.<p>But once you realize that CL has more than two namespaces (I think it has at least nine in the language itself, unlimited in user programs) it&#x27;s easier to understand how it can be more than historical accident.  People are used to  thinking words in context.<p>I do mostly numerical programming today. Common Lisp would have been my preference and IMHO much better than Python I have no time to rewrite numpy or R libraries in CL.')
