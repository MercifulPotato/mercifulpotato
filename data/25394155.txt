We never had unrestricted free speech in this country. There is a whole Wikipedia article about it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_free_speech_exceptions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_free_speech_ex...</a><p>In addition other democratic states have strict limits on free speech such as Singapore: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Article_14_of_the_Constitution_of_Singapore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Article_14_of_the_Constituti...</a><p>After all even “democracy” is nuanced here in the states. Obvious examples from our past include the wholesale disenfranchisement of women until 100 years ago, Jim Crow era laws, poll taxes, and more. Did we have democracy then? Do we have democracy now?<p>Did we have free speech when broadcasters in the USA had to abide by the Fairness Doctrine? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FCC_fairness_doctrine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FCC_fairness_doctrine</a>. Our system has it’s faults. But one can’t say that we ever had unfettered democracy or free speech, ever.<p>At what point is speech considered abuse? If you make the analogy between speech and network traffic, we intentionally censor “abusive” traffic to save our networks from collapse. Could one make the argument that entities with an interest in destabilizing our democracy should not be able to inject propaganda into our discourse because “free speech”? I think it’s a valid argument to have and a nuance that we have to contend with.<p>There are no absolutes. Trivializing this with a snappy trope of “democracy can’t survive without free speech” is disingenuous IMO.')
