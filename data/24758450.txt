I don&#x27;t want full remote - I&#x27;d like to come into the office one day a week to build a better rapport with my coworkers.<p>But yes, going forward, I&#x27;ll be expecting a much more liberal work from home policy from my current and any future employers.<p>In fact, we should all push for this, for all employees whose jobs can be done remotely - most people on this board can walk and get a better paying job fairly easily, but that&#x27;s not the case for every job in an organization, and we should support our coworkers who don&#x27;t have our privileges.')
