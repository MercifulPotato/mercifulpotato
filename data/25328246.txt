I had a family member who was hospitalized in late June in Houston, for non-coronavirus reasons, at the #1 rated hospital in Texas for general medical care. They were literally hospitalized the night when our county judge put out the emergency alert on all mobile phones to stay home and isolate because the hospitals were going to go over capacity. The hospital was my family member was at was absolutely inundated. The pharmacy would hang up on the nurses because they were so swamped. Sometimes meals would come nearly 3 hours late. Nurse calls were not answered at times for over an hour.<p>My family member was also hospitalized in October, for non-coronavirus reasons, and it was actually worse than in late June.<p>These hospitals are basically now running two hospitals in one: a coronavirus hospital and a non-coronavirus hospital--that are not supposed to mix (everybody admitted to this hospital gets tested for coronavirus) but this still happens anyways.<p>This is such a huge undertaking and requires tremendous amounts of work by all of the healthcare staff.<p>Dude, you are being so disrespectful towards the people who are literally working non-stop under tremendous pressure. They are our last line of defense, for saving lives, and you are just totally blowing the whole situation off like it is no big deal.')
