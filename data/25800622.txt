Employers pay for posting per usual, but applicants also pay $N&#x2F;mo. An applicant can submit a small number of applications per week, but get information of where their application is in the process, including if they&#x27;ve been passed over. Employers are forced to use some sort of tiered system for progressing applicants through the process, or won&#x27;t be allowed on the platform, and same with &quot;posting a role just to see who applies&quot;.<p>Really, it just monetizes some equalization of the power&#x2F;information assymmetry between applicant and employer. I know I would have paid easily over $100&#x2F;mo during my last job search to know wtf was happening with each of my applications, even if it was just getting turned down. The black hole is such a waste of resources.<p>Or, at least, something like that.')
