This is where duck typing&#x2F;templates shines.<p>I once sent a suggestion to the C++ committee people that they allowed easy templating of function parameters (something like &quot;auto foo(auto bar)&quot;), but I don&#x27;t think people who are not used to duck typing appreciate how much it helps in the grunt work inside modules. At least, I didn&#x27;t myself.')
