When you log into either the Google.com website or into an Android device your token needs permission to do everything you&#x27;d expect to do as a user - gmail, drive, etc. This attack is basically a browser MITM which captures that token and (theoretically) ships it off to a server for malicious usage&#x2F;storage.<p>Or, if you mean &quot;can Google employees read my email&quot;, then they can since almost no Google service is end-to-end encrypted (although you can e2ee Chrome sync[0]). Gmail, Drive, and Docs are completely unencrypted unless you use encryption on top of it (like with rclone[1] or cryptomator[2]).<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;answer&#x2F;165139?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en#6396505:~:text=With%20a%20passphrase%2C%20you%20can%20use,data%20without%20letting%20Google%20read%20it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;answer&#x2F;165139?co=GENIE.Pla...</a>.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.section.io&#x2F;engineering-education&#x2F;encrypting-gdrive-using-rclone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.section.io&#x2F;engineering-education&#x2F;encrypting-gdri...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptomator.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptomator.org&#x2F;</a>')
