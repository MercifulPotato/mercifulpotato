If those sentries are defective, or if the hitmen the sentries need to alert are defective, there&#x27;s nothing this vaccine can do to change that.<p>&quot;Immune compromise&quot; is generally used as a blanket term, but in many people there are <i>specific</i> immune deficiencies, which may or may not factor into the pathway being targeted here. For instance, natalizumab screws with immune cells&#x27; translocation across membranes, and shouldn&#x27;t play a role in responding to a vaccine (I mean, if it wasn&#x27;t off the market anyway).<p>If it&#x27;s a general immune dysfunction (cancer, diabetes), they will see some benefit, but it will be much reduced - specifically because both responding to the vaccine, and responding to the virus post-vaccination, require the activity of the immune system. What this means precisely will vary with the degree and nature of the immune dysfunction: some folks might see some antibody response, and benefit from repeat dosing. Others might fail to seroconvert altogether, in which case it is what it is.')
