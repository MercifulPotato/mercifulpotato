Plus, random annoying bugs are everywhere.<p>GNOME is not perfect, far from it. But it looks great by default, I just need a couple of extensions for my needs, and I have my calendar seamlessly integrated in my clock&#x2F;date panel. That&#x27;s simply great. And now, even the fingerprint scanner in my Thinkpad works in GNOME.<p>So yeah, GNOME might not be perfect, but if KDE was the &quot;default&quot; for the major Linux desktops, we&#x27;ll have many more desktop issues for new comers.')
