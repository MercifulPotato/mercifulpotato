It is more of an anti-trust issue, that a couple companies could get together to completely ban another one. We should consider if too much power has been concentrated in the hands of a few tech companies, if essentially their content moderation policies can so easily be misinterpreted as free speech issues.<p>That the outcome here is banning a community that was apparently mostly used for hate speech (never actually checked it out) is... maybe a red herring? I mean, they obviously didn&#x27;t build these massive companies with the primary goal of banning niche hateful websites.<p>If we were to, say, break up social media and internet infrastructure giants, then this sort of website would probably be able to persist by hopping from host to host until they found one without any morals. But could consider if losing the ability to perform this kind of deplatforming would be worth it, in exchange for a much more competitive marketplace.<p>I think it is actually a really tricky situation.')
