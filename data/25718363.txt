I feel like it&#x27;s a valid position to be against those things. However, any politician on any end of the political spectrum can be all those things, so setting those aside, let&#x27;s look at his actual policies: the only one I can think of is isolationism.<p>I mean I&#x27;m mostly just repeating myself. Feel free to make a counterargument.')
