They said it didn&#x27;t make the cut this time which probably means they just haven&#x27;t finished and verified yet. Likewise, I&#x27;d guess Apples engineering efforts are more focused on upcoming, larger designs so they can finish moving off x86. Once those ship, they can refocus (plus it&#x27;s another reason to upgrade your machine).<p>Rollout for most codecs is slow. I remember people saying no vp8&#x2F;9 hardware decoders was deliberate too.<p>In truth, streaming companies want to save billions in data and licensing costs. Modern mobile SoCs can decode in software reasonably well, but with worse battery life. Netflix isn&#x27;t paying for that, so they aren&#x27;t incentivized to care past the most atrocious battery hogging behavior (it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll be streaming their exclusives from elsewhere). This leaves Qualcomm to implement it or get worse performance reviews.')
