Burning forest is the lazy option; it&#x27;s only convenient if you can get away with it. Mapping can fix that.<p>Mapping doesn&#x27;t do shit if the politicians don&#x27;t act - and Bolsonaro is hellbent on not acting in the interest of anyone but the rich people paying him off (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-latin-america-49815731" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-latin-america-49815731</a>).<p>If the rainforest is to be saved, Bolsonaro must be removed one way or the other - and I&#x27;m not sure that it will be possible at all to remove that guy at the voting booth anymore.
