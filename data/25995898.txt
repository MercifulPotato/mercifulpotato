The distinction lies in the severity of the symptoms, and how resistant those symptoms are to more typical (non-medication) interventions.<p>The bigger problem is that some of these overly generic descriptions of ADHD are so broad that you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any young person in 2021 who <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> fit the description.<p>For example, consider what the inverse of this person&#x27;s list of bullet points would look like:<p>- Very, very easy time focusing on things they don&#x27;t like or don&#x27;t want to do<p>- Easy time reading physical books<p>- Hard to distract with construction noises<p>- Enjoys sitting still for extended periods of time<p>- Easily gets back to a flow state after being interrupted<p>Taken to extremes, overly generic descriptions of ADHD tend to paint unrealistic pictures of what a non-ADHD person looks like. When was the last time you met any young person who is unaffected by distractions, interruptions, sitting still for long periods of time, and has no issues focusing on things they don&#x27;t like?<p>The list of recommended techniques provided by the author is excellent. Everyone could benefit from it, frankly. ADHD people especially.<p>Newly diagnosed (or self-diagnosed) ADHD patients often make the mistake of letting their diagnosis become a convenient excuse. They might start speaking about their ADHD as if it&#x27;s a separate entity, holding their true self back (For example &quot;It&#x27;s not my fault I have ADHD&quot; or &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for my ADHD, I would be more successful&quot;). While this is short-term satisfying, it can be extremely counterproductive. If anything, an ADHD diagnosis means you need to put more effort into building routines, improving your self-discipline, creating focus-conducive environments, and other healthy habits that everyone benefits from, ADHD or otherwise.<p>If you find yourself identifying with some of the points in this article, bookmark the article and spend some time implementation the recommended bullet points. If you find the issues are interfering with your life to an unbearable degree, consider engaging with a professional psychiatrist for a conversation on ADHD. You don&#x27;t want someone who will simply prescribe stimulants and send you on your way. You want someone who will create a long-term plan. Medication can help, but it&#x27;s not as straightforward as it sounds. Worse yet, some people mistake medication for a free pass around building self-discipline, which fails when tolerance develops (and it will). Healthy habits and self-discipline last a lifetime, so it&#x27;s worth investing in building those up front.')
