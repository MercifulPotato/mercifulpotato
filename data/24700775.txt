(No whales to pull a market back into line). There is certainly money to be made there, but def not as simple as pushing a small edge.<p>Once some crypto markets really take off with much higher liquidity and larger pools of money in markets, it will be interesting to see if they make prediction markets more efficient, or whether by their nature they will always skew to systematic biases (overvaluing the rare event for example - there is a huge difference between something having a 0.01% chance of happening and a 1% chance of happening, which prediction markets rarely capture.)')
