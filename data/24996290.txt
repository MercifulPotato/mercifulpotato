I used to have this problem in the beginning too, with the &quot;chords of doom&quot; (Meta + Ctrl + ...).<p>But what worked for me was:<p>(1) Remap Caps-Lock to Control: I do this mindlessly, automatically, as the _first_ step on any new laptop now<p>(2) Set aliases for frequently used stuff: E.g. `C-x C-m` instead of `M-x`. In general, this piggybacks on (1) above. A lot of Ctrl-? key combinations become very ergonomic, and you don&#x27;t have to twist your hand into weird shapes.<p>Good luck! :-)')
