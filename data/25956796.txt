I would want to know exactly what was being looked for and why before I allowed the smallest trowel to scoop the smallest bit of earth off it.<p>Why? Because if in three years someone popped up and told me that there were a slew of important questions that were now off the agenda because I permitted a world heritage site to be trashed I&#x27;d be quite upset frankly.')
