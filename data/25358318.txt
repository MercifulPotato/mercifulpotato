I&#x27;ve spent 14 years building ecommerce sites, and the hardest thing for me was dealing with bundles. My client sells cot beds and mattresses, that come from separate suppliers as bundles. And once the bundle feature was added they went to town with it, but it makes stock hard, it makes forecasting hard, it makes promotions hard, it makes shipping hard. It&#x27;s much easier when you sell items in multiples of 1, with each item priced and discounted individually. Good luck with your project.')
