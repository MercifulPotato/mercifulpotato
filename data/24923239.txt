Taking away the context of mediation for political reasoning (IE because it works against Biden), Twitters cause for action was breaking the rules on hacked data. That in of itself was proven to be false. As was stated by both Dorsey and Zuckerberg, they had and have no evidence of Russian Dis-information or that the data is hacked or illegally obtained. They also acknowledge there is no evidence that the allegations were false. There were no <i>Fact checking</i> procedures leveraged. In the case of Dorsey, he then said they were wrong and that they have since removed the block for sharing of that information. Which as stated previously, was false, and would amount to lying under oath.<p>To prove partisan bias and hypocrisy, the follow up question of why didn&#x27;t you block or ban discussion or distribution of Private Tax returns (which is a federal offense) was important. Their responses and handling show that they do not treat data equally, the do not treat context equally, and have and will likely continue to apply selective biases.<p>Additionally, Dorsey was asked why Trump was censored or labeled as non factual over 65 times, when no other leader had been was intersting as well. His response on why they wouldn&#x27;t block the Ayatollah and others was that they had a duty to distribute their messages freely, yet when faced with clear evidence that they broke Twitter rules, he had no response. Further, when it was pointed out that Twitter isn&#x27;t even available in those countries, he had no statement either.<p>You can argue both sides, and thats fine. Break it down to the single argument here though and it is clear, there is a bias amongst these firms.<p>Now the argument is what should be done and what does that impact.<p>You don&#x27;t have to like it, but the reality is this sets a dangerous precident that needs to be addressed.<p>All is fine with the above until it impacts the other side. Then all of us end up with excessive rules and controls that ruins it for all of us. The argument here is simply apply the rules equally. They&#x27;re choosing not to do that. Twitter, Facebook, and others ultimately made their choices, now they have to explain and defend.')
