Item(by='kkoncevicius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602165769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718453, text='&gt; One big tip I wish was more obvious is that you can turn off retweets from specific people you follow. So if someone posts cool content themselves, but also retweets a bunch of political trash, you can get the former without any of the latter.<p>The bigger problem to me seems the inconsistent quality. If I want to follow someone they usually have something like 20% quality posts and 80% political opinions. Finding someone who posts consistently on topic is hard. Some bots do that, but they typically re-post everything they find without a quality check.')
