Closures, event bubbling, monads, abstract classes - they&#x27;d say the same thing.<p>Can someone without CS &#x2F; programming knowledge really judge a good abstraction versus a bad one? Similarly, it&#x27;s arrogant of us to assume we can do the same in the humanities, because it means we assume the humanities are easy &#x2F; trivial and so on, which they are not.<p>It&#x27;s like the &quot;my kid could paint that&quot; cliche of Modernist painting - maybe your kid could, but, you saying that just indicates that you aren&#x27;t educated about what the artist is doing, why they choose to do it, and the previous works of art the artist is responding to or in dialogue with.<p>Kind of like, &quot;why can&#x27;t everything be HTML&#x2F;CSS, with maybe a little JQuery?&quot; Sure, you have a point, but there are clearly more sophisticated use-cases where that approach is not the most effective, and, your saying that kinda indicates you may not have encountered or had to deal with those use-cases.<p>Truth be told I think computer science, at least the parts of it where you get to create abstractions which then define the bounds of what is possible within that programming paradigm (see - word jumble!) is closer to the &quot;soft&quot; humanities than many are aware of or would care to see.<p>Tech folks tend to love&#x2F;desire &quot;certainty&quot; in one form another, and, the easiest way to achieve that is to rule out everything which is &quot;uncertain&quot;, and, constrain your domain until &quot;certainty&quot; can be achieved. Which can be a great approach for certain technical problems, but also IMHO results in ignorant behavior towards anything which threatens said certainty.')
