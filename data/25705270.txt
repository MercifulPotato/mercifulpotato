(Streams can allow you to transform a very long sequence of data, without needing to realize the whole sequence in memory first, as one example.)<p>I also use immutable data structures by default wherever possible, unless I know I really need to mutate the data.<p>I try to make the output of a method dependent only on the inputs, wherever possible.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t take it to extremes, but incorporating paradigms from one language into another can pay big dividends.')
