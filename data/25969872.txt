Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612020938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969058, text='HN should not be considered representative, and is suffering a great deal of echo chamber self-affirmation here. Apple requires developers to keep up with major breaking changes on their platform, and some folks don’t like that. HN has at least one concentration of such people, seemingly used to Linux&#x2F;Windows development, who bring an expectation that “code once written should work for years without needing to keep up with OS changes”. That expectation is well-known to be void when working with any Apple platform.<p>open() was documented to be capable of returning EINTR. The Postgres team chose not to write code to handle that case. Now they’ll have to write code to handle that case, or drop support for macOS. That’s life on macOS. They’ll fix it or they’ll drop macOS support.<p>Keep up or walk away. Repeatedly complaining about macOS being a moving target will not change Apple’s direction. Boycotting it will not either. Either target the platform on the terms provided or drop support for it.<p>But for the sake of HN, please just let it go. If you don’t want to be macOS hackers, then just don’t be, and move on to another post. Let those of us who do want to be macOS hackers contribute value to HN instead, by talking about the minimum-viable workarounds and how to find other broken code in Homebrew, instead of driving us away. (For example, there’s an obvious way to solve this that doesn’t require disabling SIP.)<p>The recurring outrage and the reposted miserable viewpoints framed as ‘questions’ with nothing new or curious in them makes HN look immature and unprofessional. Everyone that y’all might have swayed has already been swayed, everyone that hasn’t been swayed has stopped commenting about it, and all that’s left is the echo chamber complaining to itself.')
