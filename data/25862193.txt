I (conceptually) understand RegEx. I can write Regex quickly and effectively without much thought. But I can’t read it to save my life. In fact it’s so difficult for me that I struggle to believe there are people who actually can “read” it.<p>I can decipher it but it’ll take me a bit - more like solving a little puzzle in my head than reading and understanding a piece of code.<p>And judging by the way a lot of people talk about RegEx (including seasoned programmers) I can’t imagine I’m alone.')
