He definitely does have opinions... and if I had to sum it up, I would say he&#x27;s a romantic optimistic. Which is in contrast to his tone but that&#x27;s really what he puts out.<p>I like him because of his guests, his outlook and the way he approaches life. I hope you find the time to give him a chance.')
