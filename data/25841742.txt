It’s so much easier to have a routine without having to bump into a bunch of other people. I don’t know if I could have survived without my outdoor spaces though... there’s nothing like being able to sit outside and work on my laptop for long hours. Really sorry for everyone else who has been locked indoors. Two months would have been rough, but this is beyond intolerable. At least we will always have the upper hand whenever our grandchildren complain about being bored or cooped up: “Let me tell you something about being stuck inside!”')
