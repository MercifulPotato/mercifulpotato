They used to represent a center of activity, a locus of control for the user.<p>Now, a very sizable % of our computing is off in far away clouds, &amp; the desktop itself is a less compelling, less interesting place to invest time.<p>My hope is that the Free Desktop &#x2F; Linux world can begin to grow new roots, become more connected, &amp; return to a little bit more of a place of prominence &amp; relevance. Lots of visioneering &amp; pioneering &amp; engineering to do.')
