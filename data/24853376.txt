Even if it required an explicit start and end of the comment (&#x2F;* ... *&#x2F;). I also can&#x27;t say I want or need anchors&#x2F;references from YAML, so I think that helps me be quite OK with using JSON.<p>I appreciate the challenges of writing JSON, but also think it can be easier to spot issues if you have an editor that&#x27;s doing magic indentation based on the JSON. Give me comments to help the humans, and I&#x27;m sold.')
