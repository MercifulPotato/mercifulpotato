I found after some trail and error that I&#x27;m more rested and perform better on less than recommended 8h of sleep. My sweet spot is somewhere around 7h. Fitbit &quot;magic&quot; sleep score also seems to confirm that (better sleep score on less sleep). I also found that stress is the biggest factor in getting good night sleep. When stressed I can sleep 8h and still feel bleh.<p>I wonder if 8h of sleep is the cause of the better performance or they both are a result of less stressful life, better health or something else.')
