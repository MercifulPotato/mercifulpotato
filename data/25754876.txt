For example:<p>* A person says &quot;looting&quot;, and in a following or preceding segment another person, on another channel at another time says &quot;Antifa&quot;.<p>* An image of cars on fire in the background, and segments by some anchors or pundits saying that protests are important, or should not be polite.<p>So, while I&#x27;m no fan on MSNBC, CNN etc., and think they&#x27;re being rather hypocritical with their treatment of the confirmation protesters - that clip is just under-handed smearing by its author and by you.')
