Everyone agreeing on the interface to use is very unlikely.<p>The underlying data in different implementations will be different. This is something Golang fails terribly at because it doesn&#x27;t have polymorphism.<p>This is, I believe, why there are so few DI systems for Golang, and most of them are of the sort you are referring to as silly.<p>The way Golang works, and the reccomended patterns for Golang are somewhat anti-DI.')
