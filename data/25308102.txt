I have read some of his work, watched some of his presentations.  He seems a credible bloke.<p>This, though, looks and feels like thinly-veiled retroactive and pretty unconvincing PR.  It&#x27;s short on detail and appears somewhat at odds with several points from Timnit Gebru&#x27;s resignation note [0]:<p>- Dean says the paper was reviewed by a &quot;cross-functional team&quot;.  Gebru says she received the feedback through a &quot;privileged and confidential document to HR&quot;<p>- Dean says the paper was submitted for review on the day it was due to be published; Gebru says they had notified &quot;PR &amp; Policy 2 months before&quot;.<p>- Dean suggests the feedback was due to the paper not highlighting mitigating work for some of the limitations the paper was exposing.  That seems like a very normal part of the research process.  Why, then, does Gebru claim that she was told that a &quot;manager can read you a privileged and confidential document&quot; and that no other recourse or exploration of the feedback was permissible?<p>The only thing we know from the outside is that reality will be far more nuanced and complicated than the tidbits that leak out.  Even allowing for that though - and reading some of the related comments here - Google isn&#x27;t coming out of this well at the moment.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-a...</a><p>EDIT: Fixed spelling of Timnit Gebru&#x27;s name.')
