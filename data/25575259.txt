I&#x27;ve used this little piece of software for over a decade and I don&#x27;t think I can ever leave it. I used to use it for programming, but these days it&#x27;s just my outliner. I much prefer it over org-mode, or all the new markdown-based ones. I <i>wish</i> I would see this type of folding in VS Code or any other modern editor!')
