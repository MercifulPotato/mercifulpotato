NO software can handle arbitrary amounts of bitflips. ALL software designed to mitigate bitflips only lower the odds via various forms of redundancy. (For context, I&#x27;ve written code for NASA, written a few proposals on making things more radiation hardened, and my PhD thesis was on a new class of error correcting codes - so I do know a little about making redundant software and hardware specifically designed to mitigate bitflips).<p>By claiming a bitflip didn&#x27;t kick off the problems, and trying to push the cause elsewhere, you may as well blame all of engineering for making a device that can kill on failure.<p>So your argument is a red herring<p>&gt;On the whole, you fail to make a case that preventing bitflips is the solution to a problem<p>Yes, had those bitflips been prevented, or not happened, those fatalities would not have happened.<p>&gt;Ya, I&#x27;m not buying that biyflips are a problem.<p>If bitflips are not a problem then we don&#x27;t need ECC ram (or ECC almost anything!) which is clearly used a lot. So bitflips are enough of a problem that a massively widespread technology is in place to handle precisely that problem.<p>I guess you&#x27;ve never written a program and watched bits flip on computers you control? You should try it - it&#x27;s a good exercise to see how often it does happen.<p>I guess you define something being a problem differently than I or the ECC ram industry do.')
