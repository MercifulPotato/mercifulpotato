While Reddit strongly discourages self-promotion, it certainly can be done through creative methods. I&#x27;m curious how easy it would be for a company to buy control over 100k &quot;real&quot; Reddit  accounts and use their upvotes to cause their products to hit the front page in order to increase sales. What are your thoughts?')
