From there, any attempt to make it ‘even more scrambled’ would be pointless — and actually likely make solving the resulting puzzle easier.<p>Now imagine there&#x27;s a programmer who wants to make the ultimate cube scrambler despite not knowing any of the above. Their brilliant idea is to take the aforementioned algorithms and chain them together. (Result: snafu.)<p>In essence, the moral of the story is that one shouldn&#x27;t try stacking encryption algorithms without first acquiring a pretty good understanding of how they all work.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popsci.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;2010-08&#x2F;gods-number-revealed-20-moves-will-solve-any-rubiks-cube-position&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popsci.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;2010-08&#x2F;gods-number-r...</a>')
