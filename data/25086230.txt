I have been 6&#x27;7&quot; and 190-200 pounds for all my adult life, and have cooked most all my own meals since I moved for university, so at least for being weight consistent I haven&#x27;t had much trouble. I moreso have observed that snacking foods + sugary drinks + fast food leads to a partial negligence of the diet, we often eat too fast and eat hard-to-estimate caloric worth quantities to recognize in our gut we are full enough.')
