I&#x27;m not proposing to replace it for all situations overnight; of course SMTP etc will be used for decades.<p>TMTP also covers most IMAP&#x2F;POP use cases. And it allows short, plain-text messages (see Ping) to make first contact with others -- necessary when that server has less restrictive membership requirements.<p>Authenticity is a double-edged sword. For certain confidential content, you want the recipient to know that it originated with the sender, but you don&#x27;t want anyone else to know that in the event the content is leaked or stolen.<p>I believe the extinction of email for person-to-person &amp; app-to-person correspondence is a foregone conclusion, due principally to phishing. The question is <i>what should we do now</i>, and the answer is clearly not chatrooms (which are of course useful in certain circumstances).')
