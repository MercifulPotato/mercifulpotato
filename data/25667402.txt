Is it 8 channels 16 bit each? That&#x27;s drastically different from AMDs 2 channels 64 bit each.<p>It looks like apple m1 is much less eager when caching memory rows. Maybe because it doesn&#x27;t have l3 cache.<p>Edit: This test utilizes the 8x16bit memory bus of apple m1 fully. It&#x27;s mostly just fetching random locations from memory, which can all be parallelized by the cpu pipeline. It explains why the results are exactly 4x slower on my ryzen 3 with 2 memory channels.<p>So the summary is that m1 is optimized for dynamic languages that tend to do a DDOS attack on RAM with a lot of random memory access, but it might take a performance hit with compiled languages and traditional HPC techniques that tend to process data in sequence like ECS.')
