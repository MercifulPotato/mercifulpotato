I learned to read at only 4 years old, which opened so many doors for me. By the time I was 7, I had read the &quot;Black &amp; Decker&#x27;s Guide to Home Wiring&quot; so many times, I bought some parts at Walmart and built a working electric lamp from the book. (And, to the shock of my family, an electrician later inspected it and said I had done everything correctly and it was completely safe to use.) By the time I was 9, my focus had switched to computers and building apps that ran on them. I downloaded a copy of Visual Basic .NET Express and (on a different track) got an Arduino UNO from my family for Christmas.<p>After some time building Windows apps and seeing that was not the future, I switched to learning PHP and downloaded my first Linux distro - Ubuntu 11.04. I got my first client at 14 freelancing software development. Later, I learned Laravel and re-wrote that app in a proper, cleanly-developed framework. I&#x27;m 19 now, finishing my AA degree, and the client is considering hiring me long-term instead of the occasional freelance project. I&#x27;m still open to new stuff though. :)<p>What is interesting, looking back, is about how much has changed since I learned programming. I really started with websites when I was around 10-11 years old, and everything was PHP, JQuery, WordPress, MySQL, Apache, the like. Windows XP was still quite common and my main development PC. Even though I still use those technologies, it is truly amazing how much has changed. Node, Express, MongoDB, Laravel, Redis, Linux Mint... they all didn&#x27;t exist yet. It feels like web programming has changed completely, and I&#x27;m not that old!')
