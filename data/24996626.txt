A cost to your supplier is a cost to you, because it will inevitably affect the cost of goods sold.<p>- IT cost implications both internally and at your suppliers.<p>- If you don&#x27;t get 100% of suppliers adhering, you don&#x27;t get as much benefit. Good luck getting Coca-Cola to change their production lines for no benefit to themselves!<p>They are not cheap to maintain:<p>- At an estimated 2p per item, if you are shipping 10 billion items that is £200,000,000 a year just in tag costs. Alternatively put, if you sell items for £1 on average and make 4% net profit, that cost of tag cuts deep.<p>- There is an incremental cost for suppliers to maintain all that equipment to apply tags or build them into the packaging (which comes back in COGS).<p>- Maintenance of all RF readers<p>And inventory routines are cheap relative to this cost:\n- Assuming you have 1000 stores, and spend 5 hours per day on inventory routines @ £12 total cost to employ, you are talking a £20m cost (5 hours assumes gap scanning &amp; code checking). I assume a manual financial account is still required once a year to account for failed tags.<p>So we have to come up with other benefits, like top-line growth driven by a better customer experience, but customers will have to be willing to pay for this with higher prices.')
