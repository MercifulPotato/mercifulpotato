My Android 5 powered phone (which is my only phone) works perfectly fine, the only annoyance i have with it is that it has become sluggish - but that is the fault of software developers bloating their code (the software pretty much does the same stuff as it did when i got the phone years ago), not of the phone itself.<p>Note that i do not expect someone to do free work for me, i just do not consider a 5 year old device &quot;old&quot; enough to be weird for it to be supported - especially when it works just fine.')
