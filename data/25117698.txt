In my mind it would go like &quot;hey your site has included a script from a domain I own&quot; - &quot;haha right, that&#x27;s some legacy stuff thanks for noticing us&quot; - &quot;no worries<p>but obviously that&#x27;s not what happened<p>1. Telling them in person (they didn&#x27;t understand)<p>2. Asking for the IT persons Phone number (they didn&#x27;t give it to me)<p>3. Leaving my phone number and email (they never contacted me)<p>4. Notifying the austrian CERT (they never got an answer from the owner)<p>5. Notifying the press (standard.at posted an article about it, they didn&#x27;t respond)<p>6. Writing them on Facebook (ob boy did they respond :D)<p>But since my first police raid I don&#x27;t publish anything before letting my lawyer read it. He said if they do press charges they haven&#x27;t got a chance since I have a paper trail of everything I did and didn&#x27;t harm them or their site in any way')
