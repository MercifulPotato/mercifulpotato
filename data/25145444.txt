If you pay attention to the beginning of every Disney&#x2F;Lucas Arts movie, they all start with the threat of violence (proof: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ytimg.com&#x2F;vi&#x2F;L3OPoOUMQ2M&#x2F;hqdefault.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ytimg.com&#x2F;vi&#x2F;L3OPoOUMQ2M&#x2F;hqdefault.jpg</a>). And those aren&#x27;t baseball bats the FBI carries around in their holsters.<p>&gt; But what if they just stopped paying you while you were still working there?<p>I would stop working there. Many years ago I was a contractor and that happened with a client every now and again.<p>&gt; Do you have a problem with an author writing a book and then selling the book?<p>Nope, no problems with an author writing a book, getting paid to write a book, or giving a book they&#x27;ve written to someone in return for cash.
