He highlights the issues people have raised about &quot;MID&quot; (mediator of individual data) (4 of them), but doesn&#x27;t actually address them in depth.<p>1. &quot;My data earnings are too small to be worth it&quot;: Not sure why someone would raise this issue. To me, it&#x27;s better than getting tracked and not making anything, its not about data profits. If they really don&#x27;t want to transition, its clear they don&#x27;t care about facebook tracking them. Many people don&#x27;t.<p>2. &quot;People will never pay for Facebook!&quot;: What he means is people will never pay for the alternative that is more privacy centric. That is still a concern, just because Netflix can charge money, doesn&#x27;t mean a Facebook alternative can. Netflix is cheaper and more convenient for most people who don&#x27;t use their previous solutions: cable.<p>3. &quot;This will price poor people from the internet!&quot;: Well it depends how expensive it, and how it&#x27;s designed. Didn&#x27;t you say people are making money in this scheme anyway.<p>4. &quot;The tech giants will never go for this&quot;: Why would a tech giant miss out on this. The tech giants will go for what makes money. If you make a solution which is viable, tech giants will be able over you. Its just validation. You&#x27;re not making it p2p are you?<p>The only concern I have, which he hasn&#x27;t addressed (also there aren&#x27;t many articles on MID): what exactly is it, and how would it be viable? Someone still needs to make money to pay for infrastructure and development. It still needs to work.')
