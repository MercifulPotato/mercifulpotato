There&#x27;s stuff that happened, and there are consequences - just because the consequences may not be fully computable in the amount of time and effort anyone is willing to expend on it, doesn&#x27;t mean truth suddenly becomes fuzzy. The territory is sharp, it&#x27;s just the map that&#x27;s uncertain.<p>Oh but it definitely DOES mean that truth becomes fuzzy. There is NO territory we can meaningfully talk about outside our subjective maps. Likewise, there is no such thing as &quot;absolute truth&quot; - and I do mean this on a very practical, day-to-day level, not in an abstract philosophical way.<p>The sooner we accept and embrace this, the sooner we can move away from &quot;I&#x27;m right and you&#x27;re wrong&quot; to &quot;let&#x27;s make progress on what actually matters to the parties involved&quot;.')
