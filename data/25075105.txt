I use Firefox on a day to day basis and generally build applications which work in Chrome <i>and</i> Firefox. They used to work well with EdgeHTML too.<p>I&#x27;ve run into cases in the past where basic SVG rendering with an feColorMatrix filter doesn&#x27;t work properly in Safari and looks like garbage .. but works fine in Firefox and Chrome. I&#x27;ve run into lack of support for HTML elements that every other modern browser vendor supports. I still can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s no proper input[type=date] support on desktop.<p>Away from desktop, I&#x27;ve also run into Mobile Safari failing to properly calculate the height of &lt;iframe&gt; elements, not supporting background-attachment: fixed and localStorage failing unintuitively in incognito mode.<p>Safari is absolutely the browser that gives me the most issues; I&#x27;d call it the new IE.')
