Item(by='Umkus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609767060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631044, text='In one of my projects I really needed to restrict access from VPNs, proxies and other potentially shady traffic.\nI do respect the right of anonymity but in this particular case 99% of the illegal actions were performed by the VPN&#x2F;TOR IPs, so this seemed like a low-hanging fruit.<p>This ended up being a tough task, though. Existing IP ranking solutions were way expensive, slow or not portable, so I rolled my own. I used open solutions and data I could find on Github and the Internet. It took a lot of digging, compiling, manual reviews and investigations of IPs, companies, ASNs, but eventually I compiled a quite sizable dump and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the result. This ended up being an SQLite3 database containing all of the information needed to quickly rank&#x2F;describe an IP address (datacenter, blacklisted flag, country, ASN). The data is also doubled as plain text files, in case the database format is not portable enough.<p>Resulted database is updated daily (from public sources) and currently used in production for half a year already.<p>Even though I learned a lot, I&#x27;m still not extremely knowledgeable in the IP&#x2F;networking department.\nAnd of course, there are rare false positives and there are cases that are not caught yet.<p>Please feel free to join the effort!')
