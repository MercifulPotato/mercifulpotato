Item(by='Imnimo', descendants=None, kids=[25308026, 25307927], score=None, time=1607114991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307167, text='This reads to me like Google felt that the paper painted some of their other technologies in a poor light, and wanted to insert language that made them look better.  The way he describes their objections, they strike me as the sort of thing that is routinely addressed in the camera-ready version of papers by adding a few lines to the related work section. Not the sort of thing that a conference reviewer or an internal reviewer would reject a paper over.<p>Previously, we only had one side of this story.  But if this is Dean&#x27;s best spin on Google&#x27;s side of the story, I&#x27;m very tempted to conclude they&#x27;re in the wrong here.  Obviously I don&#x27;t have all the information, but the information I do have feels consistent with the idea that someone important at Google didn&#x27;t like Gebru&#x27;s paper for corporate-political (meaning making Google look good, as opposed to political-political) reasons, they tried to get Gebru to play ball, she refused, and now they have to back-project a justification in the name of &quot;scientific integrity&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, I think this is a story where most people&#x27;s opinions about who&#x27;s in the right will be more informed by their previous opinions about Gebru and Dean than the narrower question of what happened with this particular paper.  I&#x27;m probably even guilty of that to some extent myself, given that I&#x27;m a fan of some of Gebru&#x27;s previous work.')
