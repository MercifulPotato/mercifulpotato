In particular one of the more promising recent implementations is &quot;stochastic&quot; superoptimization where you view it as a search problem instead of brute force search. One of the great things about this is the search doesn&#x27;t need to be perfectly accurate: e.g., you can evaluate only the 10% most promising programs via benchmarks to determine how fast they are, using a much faster (but less accurate) method of counting instructions for the other 90%.')
