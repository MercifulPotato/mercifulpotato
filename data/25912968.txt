It fits a narrative, not of being overly protective, but of run-of-the-mill incompetence.<p>Someone once used a DigitalOcean droplet to run an aggressive layer 7 denial of service attack against a service I host. I notified DO via their web form, didn’t get a reply for three days, then got told to email to their abuse@ email address instead.<p>Dutifully, I mailed abuse@ and included the relevant server logs, gzipped, as an attachment. I got a reply that they won’t open any attachments, please copy and paste the logs directly into the email.<p>As an outsider, it seems to me as if they have few people with the appropriate technical background staffing their abuse department, so legitimate reports are left uninvestigated due to dumb technicalities like not being willing&#x2F;able to open attachments, and bogus reports are accepted without thought or understanding as to the appropriate course of action.')
