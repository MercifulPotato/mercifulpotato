Going to your own link, Newsweek did not call &quot;GME investors &quot;far-right extremists&quot;&quot;. The article clearly states that far-right extremists were instead using the &quot;stick-it-to-the-man&quot; ethos driving a lot of the GME investor chatter to recruit. There is a huge difference.<p>Yes, but no. It’s called throwing shade and while it is very different from actually showing evidence on a subject and making a claim, it is intended to link the ideas in the readers mind.<p>In middle school it would go like “I’m not saying hn_throwaway is a slut, but I did see her watching Harry Potter and also saw three other boys who say they like her at the theater that weekend.”<p>Both statements are true, but without some other fact they don’t matter so the only reason to mention them is to make a claim without evidence. Especially since I explicitly said I’m not calling you a slut.<p>The article linked does not act responsibly by mentioning these facts in the same article without some link. I think it’s mostly last journalism coupled with trying to click-bait get eyeballs for ads.<p>I too like HN for our attempted critical thinking, and I like that people keep busting through different theories and trying to get to the source of truth.')
