What about hiding browser chrome, or making sure it opens as a new window instead of a new tab, or having seperate window preferences (such as size and location) for it?\nAnd I believe one goal of PWA is that &quot;installed&quot; apps have additional permissions, such as being able to use keyboard shortcuts that are normally reserved.')
