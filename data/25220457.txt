Class conflict would be good for productivity? Clearly no. You made your case for the failure of a society run by financial parasites, but so far it seems they’ve defended against class conflict by converting a huge number of people from a productive and capable working class into financial dependents of income redistribution from the middle class. This has been the character and the result of all such ‘class conflict’ so far, and it only makes things worse.')
