Item(by='Xylakant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605469978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103943, text='&gt; Generally when I personally see code with an MIT License, I understand that I am able to copy whatever I want from that project to my own projects, I thought that was the point of it. Do y&#x27;all not do the same?<p>You are allowed to take and copy it to your project. You just need to retain the notice along with it - IANAL but I usually just copy the licence in a code comment along with the copied section (or file). I usually include a pointer to the original source for audit purposes. That doesn&#x27;t make my project MIT licensed, but that part of the code that I lifted without substantial modification remains MIT licensed, even if I make my project closed source commercial. There&#x27;s no way around that - I cannot claim it as my own since I have not written it. Same for public domain code.')
