Sometimes comments are higher rated than the parent post. This extremely challenging when the Top filter in Reddit is sorting by post&#x27;s upvotes and not the comment&#x27;s upvotes.<p>Here top posts from Reddit are ranked by the comment&#x27;s upvotes&#x2F;score (5th column), using data before 2019 (Forgotten content and also avoiding up-vote gamification.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topredditcomments.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topredditcomments.com&#x2F;</a>')
