It sort of implies that there are or were competing schools of thought around processor architecture when in reality so-called CISC represented an earlier trend and RISC represents a later trend.<p>Neither trend were very intentional by their designers (e.g. why would anyone intentionally make their processor “complex”?) but instead were consequences of the technology available at the time and were simply the most reasonable ways to go about things.<p>So called CISC designs emerge from a time when assembly programming was widespread, RISC came about once compilers were in widespread use. Reasonable engineers with constraints from both eras were focused on producing highly efficient designs.<p>Which is why the term “CISC” rubs me the wrong way. I almost have to wonder to what extent this naming was subversive product marketing leaking into academia.<p>Of course today we have the hindsight to see that the constraints of contemporary processor design requires a significant amount of design elements from both RISC and CISC methodologies.')
