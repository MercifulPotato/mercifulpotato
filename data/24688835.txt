Even outstanding scientists and experts are not allowed to treat a patient. Heck one of them teaches Physicians but can&#x27;t practice.<p>Totally bizarre how widely accepted having 1 medical cartel is. Hopefully after the opioid epidemic, people are much more skeptical of Physicians and we can get legislation to destroy their grip.')
