My argument is that the linux kernel (even if you strip everything out and create the most tiny linux kernel) is still too big for many constrained environments, e.g. a old router with 512 KiB memory (there are many devices that cannot run linux). However, it is possible to run a small microkernel on such a router, that&#x27;s my point, nothing more nothing less, that&#x27;s why I consider using microkernel a good fit.<p>Then people argued that mircokernels can be as big as a linux kernel and that you can strip the linux kernel down in functionality and I agreed with them, but this does not contradict the point I made.')
