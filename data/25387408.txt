We don&#x27;t mess too much with custom commands. We just have a library of about 30-40 small helper functions, mostly to do simple steps to test UI elements from Material UI, React Select, etc.<p>So, for example, if we need to select something with React Select, it can get tricky. It is a multi-step process with Cypress to ensure the thing is actually rendered. But after we do that once, it is only a matter of making a `selectDropdownOption(tag: string, option: string)` helper function. We have dozens of tests that are just 3 or 4 lines of those helper functions.<p>One of the major drawbacks we have with Cypress, though, is about the data. Since Cypress just uses your `localhost`, it uses whatever DB you are connected. I really miss the Capybara&#x2F;Rails integration of just spinning up a proper test DB, seeding it and then destroying it after the tests were done.<p>I bet there are ways to do this with Cypress, but it is just not as straightforward as it was in Rails.')
