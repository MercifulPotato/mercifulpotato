The number of customer service representatives per user they can hire is proportional to their profits per user. You can&#x27;t change that with legislation. A company making 1&#x2F;10th the profit per user cannot spend as much on customer service. At best, you can make laws that effectively ban companies from having low margins.<p>If I buy something from my local dollar store, they have a no return policy. The items are typically low quality. But they cost a dollar.<p>My cell company, on the other hand, charges around $60&#x2F;month for a phone plan, so they have more customer service representatives.')
