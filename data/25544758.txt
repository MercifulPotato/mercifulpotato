Everything is uh-may-zin in America. Everything is &quot;WOW&quot; and &quot;FLAVOUR BLASTED&quot; and ends with an exclamation point.<p>I often mock some of my American friends by mimicking them when they say that some rather mundane thing is &quot;AMAZING&quot; or &quot;OH MY GOD I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT&quot; or &quot;THIS IS INSANE&quot; and no, Mark, it&#x27;s not insane, it&#x27;s just a decent piece of a cake.<p>Of course my default French blas√© attitude towards everything errs the other way, there&#x27;s probably a compromise to be found. But at least when I say that I found something to be &quot;amazing&quot; my friends generally take note, because it&#x27;s not something I say lightly.<p>That&#x27;s sort of the main issue for me, it&#x27;s like the loudness wars for music mixing, when people tell you how to unclog your drain as if it was the most amazing thing that ever happened to them the baseline is completely skewed.<p>BUT WAIT, THERE&#x27;S MORE!')
