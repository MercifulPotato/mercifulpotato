You cannot seriously think that the trainwreck that is US healthcare is what it is solely because of <i>government intereference</i>?<p>Would Cigna fund and run the tiny little community clinics that serve with sliding-scale pricing? Would Kaiser willingly insure students with preexisting conditions at a fair price? (I know that in my case, they wouldn&#x27;t)<p>What &quot;free market&quot; incentive is there for these insurance companies to cover people that would clearly cost them more money than they receive? Those people need help and sickness&#x2F;viruses do not have any concept of money, and they effect people indiscriminately.<p>You are promoting a healthcare system for the wealthy and privileged, which is exactly what we have right now and what needs to be torn down.')
