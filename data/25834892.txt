How the Y-axis Servos are mounted isn’t the ideal orientation. Some of my initial decisions, ie for linear rails, limited my options based of what I was able to fabricate in-house. There were a lot of lessons learned and if I was to do it all over, I would actually go with mag driven linear servos if I can afford them or have the same existing Servos mounted in vertical orientation with the gear rack facing outwards engaged with the pinion<p>2. Good question! One of the biggest challenges of starting to make your own machine are the real life unknowns, which might yield one answer theoretically, and another in practice. Trying to balance between a realistic budget and wanting a unicorn setup, I realized that it was out of my budget to machine the entire base frame for this machine. So, the Y-axis gear rack was basically mounted to base frame using self tapped holes, some shims from McMasterCarr and very long hours with a Mitutoyo dial riding back and forth. Since the gantry was much smaller compared to the base frame, I was able to get the X and Z axis machined from a local shop. Here’s pix of that: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;RLEETAm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;RLEETAm</a>. Due to the DIY nature of my project, I was also not able to stress relieve the weldments but was still able to achieve 0.001” tolerance for my use case materials (with the exception of aluminum which is probably around 0.01”).<p>3. Having made some mistakes along the way and doing this for the first time, my actual expense was around $23k over 1.5 years. However, that also includes a very nice 2x high volume Busch 20kW vacuum setup for the vacuum table (which I got for a steal deal on eBay). They would normally run $20k&#x2F;ea but I was able to find and fix DOA units with minimal work for around $1600 for both.<p>I hope this helps!')
