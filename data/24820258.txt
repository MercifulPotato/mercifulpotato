The Venezuelan bolivar is not really pegged to any currency otherwise its hyperinflation would not have been possible. That is also the reason why nobody would buy bonds in the Venezuelan bolivar.<p>Of course the UK is in a different situation than Venezuela, being a country with an advanced economy.<p>Still the rating will have an effect as a lot of institutional investors are bound to very stable bonds. So the interest rates will rise.<p>Of course the UK can use inflation of the sterling to get rid of its debt. That would however also reduce its ability to issue low yield debt in the future.<p>In the end the UK is bound to what rating agencies and the market thinks of it like basically any other country.')
