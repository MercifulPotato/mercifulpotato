The point of Brexit was &quot;sovereignty&quot; - but only for a somewhat eccentric and delusional ruling class which saw its financial and political power being eroded by the UK&#x27;s links to the EU.<p>Instead of integrating and keeping some influence and privilege - something the continental aristocracies managed relatively smoothly - they decided to pull up the drawbridge and launch into a fantasy of Empire 2.0.<p>This will not end well.
