Item(by='onion2k', descendants=None, kids=[24716482], score=None, time=1602135143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713752, text='<i>a lot of engineers at FAANG make more than $400k total comp</i><p>This is the problem as I see it: $400k sounds like a good compensation, but we have no idea if that&#x27;s as high as FAANGs would go. Maybe all those engineers could be on $800k if they&#x27;d negotiated better.<p>We don&#x27;t, and can&#x27;t, know the answer to this problem. And frankly it doesn&#x27;t matter if those engineers are happy with $400k, and FAANG companies happy paying them that, then everybody comes away feeling like they&#x27;ve won. I&#x27;m just wondering if, as a whole, engineers are actually leaving a lot of money on the table because using the &#x27;market rate&#x27; is really the average of all the negotiations that have come before, and if the average engineer is bad at negotiating that means everyone is basing their salary expectation on lots of previous low offers that people shouldn&#x27;t really have accepted.<p>This is really a pricing problem, and everyone knows pricing is hard.')
