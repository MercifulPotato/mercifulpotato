Multiplatform by default, with the option to build rich reactive UI? Plus text editing with a sane document model (via ProseMirror etc)? Fast math rendering (via katex)?<p>If so I will happily jump ship!  Even Microsoft&#x27;s attempt at a react native for desktop excludes Linux so it&#x27;s a non-starter.
