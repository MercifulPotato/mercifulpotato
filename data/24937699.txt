This went on for years. Yet every time I had a moment to reflect, I would realize that I wasn&#x27;t fulfilled, I learned a few meaningless skills, but wasn&#x27;t anywhere near my personal &#x2F; professional goals. So I started doing the following things and it has changed my life:\n1) write down how my day went every day\n2) document why it went well, want went &#x27;not so well&#x27;, and what i learned\n3) systematically gather feedback from peers and mentors i trusted<p>I now have a couple of months worth of data and can systematically tell when i&#x27;ll have a great&#x2F;good&#x2F;bad day and where i need to focus to grow (e.g., my communications skills). I feel much sharper and more growth and goal oriented - it sounds cliche but i feel like i have found a new lease on my professional life.<p>Curious to hear HN friends how you guys manage it all.')
