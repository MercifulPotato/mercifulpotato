That&#x27;s specifically catering to extremist groups.<p>But I&#x27;ll point to videos I can find which aren&#x27;t as bad. If anyone can find the original ads that I mentioned I&#x27;d appreciate a link. Here[0] Ingram mentions radicals like Alex Jones and Candice Owens mentioning that it is a social network specifically for conservatives. It is easy to find plenty of videos like this where they consistently talk about it being a social media platform for conservatives. Here&#x27;s one where the CEO complains about fact checking the president[1]. He does end struggling to suggest that Parler is gaining diversity, but also says that Twitter is a Biden community in the same sentence. But I&#x27;ve never been one to think that Twitter was specifically targeting conservatives. But you&#x27;ll find that a lot of these interviews do still focus around the politics of the issue. Compare that to Signal&#x27;s much more neutral stance on the matter.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j6iyAt1Ydpc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j6iyAt1Ydpc</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=F8IcjsFHwc8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=F8IcjsFHwc8</a><p>Edit: Downvoters, would you mind explaining? Is it that I no longer have a direct link to Parler using Info Wars&#x2F;Alex Jones and Breitbart as endorsements? Or do you not think those are extremist websites?')
