And given that viewpoint-based moderation is overwhelmingly-common on Reddit, this means that on non-politics based subreddits then engaging on any political issue as a right-leaning individual carries a decent risk of getting some sort of wrongthink ban. It&#x27;s extremely common, sadly, and even though one can avoid politics entirely it&#x27;s hard to just watch people circlejerk and mock people who hold your views when these issues do arise.')
