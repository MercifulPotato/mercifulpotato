That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t argue about short and medium term risks; but if someone is worried about long term risks, pointing to the months of studies doesn&#x27;t help at all.<p>Given the known short and medium term risks, vaccination seems like a good plan, at least where there is community spread. In areas where the disease is controlled, the unknowable long term risks dominate, IMHO, and would make it a harder decision. Of course, lack of supply moots that question for now, there&#x27;s more than enough people to vaccinate in areas with major caseload, so we don&#x27;t have to think about vaccinations in places that are under control.')
