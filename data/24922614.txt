If you were interested in money, and willing to get after it, those salaries were laughably low for someone with the talent and history to back it up.<p>So now what? The same as always, get paid what you can get paid? If you want X money go get X money. If you can&#x27;t, maybe you don&#x27;t have what it takes to live in a high COL city(is that so different from now)? Perhaps the COL will come down to reflect a reduced demand for those particular urban centers. Or to reflect ability to pay high rents and prices?<p>IMHO the potential downsides are more social; risk of increased social&#x2F;economical stratification. Maybe the cities end up even more packed with a certain &quot;type&quot; that can pull the big money while everyone else is servicing them on scraps. IDK.')
