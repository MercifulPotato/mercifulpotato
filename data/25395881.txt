Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25396285], score=None, time=1607751551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395052, text='&gt; If they had proof, they would&#x27;ve shown it in court, where there are <i>real</i> consequences, not on social media where anything goes.<p>This is a great example of why censorship is such a disaster.<p>The Texas case was dismissed today because Texas &quot;has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections&quot;. So regardless of whether there was anything to complain about, Texas isn&#x27;t allowed to complain about it. (This is basically what everybody predicted, but it means the Supreme Court will never even hear the case.)<p>The case in Pennsylvania was dismissed because they were complaining that Pennsylvania had changed its election procedures in violation of its own constitution (in ways alleged to facilitate fraud), which appears to be true, but the court dismissed the case for a procedural reason again, in this case for being brought too late.<p>Several other cases were dismissed for similar reasons, i.e. lack of standing or timing. The only one I&#x27;m aware of where they&#x27;re even being allowed to make their case is the one in Wisconsin, which is still pending.<p>Does it concern you at all that you apparently didn&#x27;t know that?')
