Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606805676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25263001, text='&gt; if I trust some argument made here, it would be better for the environment to buy a whole new laptop rather than fix the existing one<p>No, I don&#x27;t think that argument is being made by anyone.<p>The argument being made is that to make the laptop more able to have replaceable components could potentially require more environmental costs up front in making that laptop.<p>I doubt that argument works for the power connector.  I suspect that&#x27;s more to do with making sure Magsafe is really solid, but it might for the battery due to the pouch design instead of extra battery casing, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>There&#x27;s no question that if you can repair it afterwards you probably should.<p>By the way, literally all my <i>other</i> laptops either died due to the power connector failing, or I repaired the failing power connector.  Sometimes I had to replace the motherboard to sort out the power connector properly, which seems like poor design.<p>The Apple has been the only one that hasn&#x27;t failed in that way, which from my anecdote of about 5 laptops says Apple&#x27;s approach has worked best from that point of view so far.  Of course Apple power supply cables keep fraying and needing to be replaced, so it balances out :-)')
