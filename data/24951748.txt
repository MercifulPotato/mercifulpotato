For a static binary, Debian has to notice the change<p>Because this argument is often made, I think it&#x27;s worth pointing out:<p>Just shipping a fixed dependency like `libssl.so` isn&#x27;t enough to make the fix effective on the end users&#x27; machines. You also have to restart all the running executables that link in that dependency.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, Debian does not handle that for you. So even if it ships that small, nice dependency-only package update via manual or unattended upgrades, your long-running nginx will still be vulnerable until you manually restart it.')
