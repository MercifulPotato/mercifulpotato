Personally, I&#x27;ve had only a brief encounter with it, and that was clearly driven by a project lead in a SV bubble, as in, everybody&#x27;s doing it, so must we. But I&#x27;d imagine that Salesforce management isn&#x27;t so stupid as to spend that kind of money only to loose customers. I know that Salesforce has made inroads into eg time tracking and invoicing for freelancers at large consulting companies, so there&#x27;s definitely a market to grow into that&#x27;s not entirely alien to Salesforce&#x27;s core business, even if they don&#x27;t start from a tech but business administration angle. And Heroku still doing what they did ten years ago, if anything, is rather a sign that Salesforce will leave Slack as it is, isn&#x27;t it?')
