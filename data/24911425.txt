In the subject of the analogy (software incidents) I think both should be done -- a regular and habitual focus on important&#x2F;high risk commands via procedure, and preparations for the time when the inevitable still happens because people are people and it&#x27;s impossible to fully predict all potential sources of unintended consequences. A lack of habitual focus when important consequences are at stake could lead to an over-reliance on the safety nets, and you really don&#x27;t want your safety nets becoming routine. Otherwise you&#x27;ll need safety nets for the safety nets.')
