I can give a list of pros&#x2F;cons that probably overlaps what you&#x27;ve heard:<p>Pros:<p><pre><code>  - The toolkit feels fairly mature and not too hard to parse. I think there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;this class works with defaults and breaks otherwise&quot; feeling, though the core components are robust enough that this isn&#x27;t a huge concern.\n  - It was super easy to build for Android, iOS, and Mac all at the same time. Everything Just Worked (so far).\n  - It was very performant\n  - Very easy to add your own painting code if you wanted a custom component.\n  - The debug view is so so useful for figuring out painting and layout issues.\n</code></pre>\nCons:<p><pre><code>  - I didn&#x27;t understand Futures very well (and honestly still don&#x27;t); this might be an issue with people working with modern Python&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;whatever.\n  - Because of the above, interacting with a database &#x2F; JSON on disk felt a little contrived. In particular JSON parsing felt very non-obvious, even though it feels like at this point is should be a first-class feature.\n  - It still produced relatively fat binaries, though not sure how much of that was debug&#x2F;release mode.\n  - My computer ran hot while running Flutter, though not sure how much of that is debug&#x2F;release mode.\n</code></pre>\nOverall I&#x27;m very very happy with it. It was the kind of project where when I had time to work on it, after work, I had a list of things I wanted to do, and I could quickly check off feature after feature instead of fighting the system. That made me add more desired features, etc., but very enjoyable.')
