I&#x27;m still not sure why this particular cause of death is so terrifying to the world compared to every other cause of death out there.<p>Now say, were those numbers reversed and only 1 million out of 55 million recovered, I could see this level of panic and hysterics.<p>As it is, i&#x27;ve got a better chance of dying crossing the sketchy ass road I have to cross every day than dying o. covid.<p>Those elderly folks and people with pre-existing conditions, well if it&#x27;s not covid, it&#x27;ll be something else.<p>That&#x27;s just kind of how it is when you&#x27;re old or have pre-existing health conditions.<p>The thing is, if you have a pre-existing health condition, you&#x27;re likely already used to being cautious. If you&#x27;re old you already know even a cold can kill you.<p>Why is it the entire world must react and compensate for two specific groups of people who are already high risk and who already (hopefully )take precautions for themselve?<p>They&#x27;re not children, they&#x27;re adults.<p>That&#x27;s the thing about living, one day it stops, whatever you do.<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s selfish of those people to expect the entire world to cater to them so they feel a little bit safer.<p>It&#x27;s insane. People can&#x27;t work, can&#x27;t run their businesses, told to stand in line like sheep, told who they can bring into their homes, who they can associate with, where they can go, to take some vaccine because...<p>A small percentage of the population is high risk?<p>That&#x27;s justification for ruining the lives of countless people?<p>Yeah, I do know some people who died, not of covid though. My friend died of his cancer after being unable to go for treatments during covid and another friend with a heart condition who had their regular checkups repeatedly delayed due to covid and ended up dying of heart failure in their sleep. Again, this person did not have covid.<p>These people were supposed to be the people we&#x27;re protecting through these.measures?<p>They died because of these measures.<p>They may have died anyway, they may have gotten covid and died without them, but that&#x27;s not what happened.<p>It&#x27;s completely fucked to make the majority of the world suffer in the name of protecting a tiny percent of people.<p>I don&#x27;t give a fuck if it&#x27;s selfish, it makes no sense. The cure should not be worse than the disease.')
