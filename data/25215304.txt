I thought I&#x27;d like using Hyper-V but it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to configure static ips. So I do all my development in a Fedora VM on Linode...<p>In writing this up I realize there&#x27;s not really great reason to be using Windows after all. More and more important software is available in the browser (i.e. Figma finally made Sketch&#x2F;macOS less of an issue, Google Docs is Google Docs).<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll switch back to FreeBSD.')
