This should be done, however, only to preserve equal liberty â€“ i.e., the liberties of the intolerant should be limited only insofar as they demonstrably limit the liberties of others: &quot;While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.&quot;')
