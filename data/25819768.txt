Had very few users, but it scratched my own itch and tried to give Safari some basic feature parity with Firefox when dealing with Xml feeds. At the time the relevant Apple directory of extensions was so poor, I had to serve the update mechanism from elsewhere (which was a pretty bad security practice, in hindsight). Eventually Safari was just lagging in so many areas, I went back to Firefox, but kept maintaining the extension; the burden was small, basically just re-testing it once a year.<p>Then they decided extensions should go “full Apple”, requiring the developer fee and so on. It was clear they didn’t want any developer who wasn’t already committed to iOS, they just didn’t care about Mac hobbyists. I dropped my extension and never looked back.<p>Apple basically had two children: one of them became a superstar multibillionaire (iOS) and the other (MacOS), well, he kinda “gets by”. Now iOS keeps MacOS in a job, and tells him what to wear and who to talk to. The poor thing is humiliated and increasingly lonely, but what you gonna do? Meanwhile his old friends Linux and Windows, who used to be so envious, are doing pretty well for themselves and don’t look up to him anymore.')
