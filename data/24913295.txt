It isn&#x27;t the case that Democrats are anti-cannibalism and Republicans are pro-cannibalism. There are no prominent existing supporters of cannibalism to vociferously condemn.<p>Climate change and feminism have factions to fight each other. Oil workers in Texas don&#x27;t want to lose their livelihood. Homeowners in California don&#x27;t want extreme fires to claim their homes. Women want more rapists to go to jail. Men don&#x27;t want to be falsely imprisoned for an alleged rape that didn&#x27;t really happen.<p>So you can find plenty of people to argue that climate change is over-hyped, and plenty of people willing to believe them because it serves their own interests, and therefore plenty of people on the other team to be unnecessarily vicious to those people to the point of making their own side look bad.')
