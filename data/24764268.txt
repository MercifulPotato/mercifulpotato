Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[24765126], score=None, time=1602586811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760154, text='&gt; merely expressing a negative opinion of something is plainly free speech and not harassment.<p>Again, this is merely your opinion, and it does not reflect the opinion of everyone else. Another person will see that statement and believe it is harassment and not free speech.<p>&gt; You asserted the contradiction, not me. I merely confirmed your observation that a free-speech proponent who alleged that harassment was free speech would be contradicting himself because by definition harassment is not free speech.<p>No, this is false. You asserted the contradiction and you still have not demonstrated that it exists. If you look up this chain of comments to find the first mention of &quot;contradiction&quot;, that mention was made by you (not me!) as a response to my comment where I said:<p>&quot;&quot;The kind of speech which is often labelled &quot;harassment&quot; by its opponents is often labelled as &quot;free speech&quot; by its proponents.&quot;&quot;<p>...to this comment you responded:<p>&quot;&quot;If they are doing this, then they are contradicting themselves&quot;&quot;<p>Notice that I never said &quot;free-speech proponent alleges harassment is free speech&quot;. The example I gave was very clear that the label &quot;harassment&quot; is not given by the speaker - it is given by an observer. You seem to hold on to this strawman that you constructed where the speaker labels their own speech as harassment and free speech simultaneously. This does not really occur in practice. What occurs in practice is that the speaker does not label their own speech as harassment, the label is given by other people who are offended and want to silence the speaker . In some instances we might agree with speaker, in other instances we might disagree with them. But in any case, the speaker&#x27;s internal position is not contradictory; they don&#x27;t believe that their speech constitutes harassment.')
