Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603929369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923562, text='&gt; Linux distros want to stay competitive in the now, not in 1990s. Which is why they&#x27;re gaining market share.<p>This is where distro diversity is critical. Users have the choice to use a distro that is serious about maintaining backward compatibility or they can choose the ones chasing the new shiny. Everyone wins.<p>Personally, I’m not swayed by the “but it’s modern!” arguments. I just want my existing software to continue working. I don’t care if my stack is obsolete, whatever that means. I just don’t want to worry about software breaking when I update to the never version.<p>Other people are not like me and they can go use a distro with Wayland, and we are all happy.')
