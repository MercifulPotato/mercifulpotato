Itâ€™s not a coincidence that the quickest keyboard measured also has the shortest key travel distance by a large margin. ... Note that, unlike the other measurement I was able to find online, this measurement was from the start of the keypress instead of the switch activation.<p>That&#x27;s disappointing. He isn&#x27;t measuring latency nearly as much as he&#x27;s measuring point of actuation.')
