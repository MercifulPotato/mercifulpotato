Item(by='yholio', descendants=None, kids=[24980850], score=None, time=1604362002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24970629, text='A vehicle without battery that is just standing there on the swap platform waiting to get a fresh pack does not need a structurally sound frame. So while the battery is structurally important, it does not follow that non-swappable batteries are by default of a higher capacity; the same structural elements can be integrated in the swappable battery.<p>The only real margin is the swap hardware and any structural binding parts designed to pass loads towards the battery frame as if it was built in part of the fixed frame. True, it makes no sense to design and include those parts when swap is not on the market, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff. But is it a salient tradeoff, does it make the car with the built-in battery significantly better? Only very marginally I would say.<p>The same for aerodynamics, there is really only one place to put a large battery pack, it&#x27;s not like you can gain lots of design liberty by putting an unconventional shape battery in the bumper or in the roof. Swappability of the underside of the car has no impact on aerodynamics.')
