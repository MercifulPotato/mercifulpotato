Every organization which ran an NNTP server had a copy of all messages because Usenet is decentralised, every single one could have kept an archive and didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not like websites where nobody but the webserver host has full access.<p>Not gonna go as far as saying &quot;it cannot be evil to do what everyone else does&quot;, but if there is only one remaining archive on the planet and you desperately value it ... why are you shitting on the company which owns it?')
