From Airtable, to Monday, to Hugo, to Tara, to Asana, etc., etc.<p>It feels like there&#x27;s a lot of stagnation here, also. If I was building a product management tool, I would certainly <i>not</i> make it anything like Jira. Jira&#x27;s a bit of a &quot;dirty word,&quot; anyway -- it&#x27;s a monolithic system that seems to suck more productivity than it generates. Where&#x27;s the innovation? The last truly revolutionary productivity tool was Slack, and maybe Dropbox before that.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to throw any shade at the Tara people -- it seems like a ton of work went into the product. But I guess I just don&#x27;t really <i>get</i> the state of the market (even though I work as an engineer and am often-times force-fed these kinds of tools).')
