Item(by='captainmuon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610486815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725561, text='&gt; I started by inspecting the list of recurring tasks, but the output was so voluminous that finding anything useful was a dim prospect.<p>Sometimes I phantasize about a novel computer or phone, where you can &quot;physically&quot; inspect the running (non-OS) applications. On a phone, you&#x27;d have a glowing edge where each light or micro display corresponds to one application. You can only ever have 6 or so apps running at the same time. If an app launches a lot in the background, you&#x27;d notice it quickly from the new color blinking. On a desktop PC or a server, maybe you&#x27;d even have a little door in the case, and behind it a bunch of little OLED displays that replace the task manager. With a click of a physical switch, you could evict an application from memory automatically.<p>Of course this would be unpractical for a lot of reasons, and you&#x27;d have to trust the OS&#x2F;firmware. But I like both ideas of understanding what the PC is doing, and adding back a tactile element to computing.')
