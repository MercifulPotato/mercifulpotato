Not even on their developers portal. (I’ve had developer account with Nintendo since the Wii days).<p>And with regards to your point about Linux vs micro kernels, it does make a massive difference when you’re talking about hardware like the N64 which wouldn’t want any of those features which micro kernels excel at and which every instruction wasted is going to cost the user experience heavily. This point was made abundantly clear at the start of the conversation as well.<p>Look, I have nothing against micro kernels. There’s an architectual beauty to them which I really like. It’s the functional programming equivalent of kernel design. But pragmatically it wouldn’t be your silver bullet in the <i>very specific context</i> we were discussing (re N64). And to be honest I’m sick of you pulling these pathetic straw man arguments in every thread you post on.')
