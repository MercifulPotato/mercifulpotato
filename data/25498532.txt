They did pay a salary that was commensurately higher. I was able to buy an Anthem individual plan (family coverage) and it was reasonable. It was essentially equivalent to any other employer plan I&#x27;ve ever had except notably it did not cover maternity but that was OK as we were not having any more kids at that point.<p>The absolute best plan I was ever on was an HMO in the 1990s. No out of pocket for anything as long as you were referred by your primary care provider. Our first kid was born via emergency C-section and we never saw a bill for any of it.')
