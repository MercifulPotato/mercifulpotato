I&#x27;m honestly not sure how GDELT scrapes its data though, but this is what they do for over 5 years now and it&#x27;s backed by Google Cloud processing, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ever expanding and very thorough.<p>The kinds of articles which are discovered revolve around world events, however. So you won&#x27;t see random blog posts, or traffic reports. Instead you&#x27;ll see geopolitics, big tech news, and cultural discourse.<p>Trending stories are found for the entire set of articles in a batch, with no separation for source, category, or location. If the top stories all happen to be in the USA in a given moment, then that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll find. If NYT happens to publish an article that fits an overall story being talked about in the rest of the batch, it&#x27;ll get added to that story.<p>Trending popularity is decided by how many individual sources talk about the given topic. This is good enough to identify the Zeitgeist of a moment, but it likely won&#x27;t catch nuances in evolving stories.')
