(For comparison: Signal&#x27;s encryption protocol was sponsored &#x2F; paid for by the US Govt and is used by Facebook&#x27;s WhatsApp.  Telegram has been banned in multiple countries for refusing to turn over data to the govt as well)<p>Signal advantages over Telegram:<p>- E2E chats are the only type of chats offered.<p>TLDR - If you use mostly 1:1 chats and E2E is important to you, use Signal.  If you use mostly group chats or want ease of use to get your friends &#x2F; family on board, use Telegram.  Both are open source and have had independent security audits, which is better than WhatsApp!')
