This is not a political debate. This is about enforcing TOS which explicitly ban use for criminal acts.<p>The fact that the criminal is the President of the United States and his enablers is incidental to the principle.<p>No one wants to ban any <i>reasonable</i> political views. But when a political party organises public mass violence, subversion, insurrection, murder, intimidation of public officers, the attempted overthrow of a legitimate election, among other crimes, that party - and especially its leaders - loses all claims on the patience of the public and on the tolerance of private sector service providers.<p>Attempts to turn this into a debate about political censorship are not being made in good faith. The reality is that criminal acts took place on a scale that was truly shocking.<p>Anyone who provides goods and services of any kind to the individuals and organisations responsible has a moral and legal duty to stop doing so - immediately.')
