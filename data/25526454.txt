Focuses the mind knowing whatever you&#x27;re doing when you&#x27;re not working is billable hours (hence no vidya). I still mostly make my own food, coffee and wash my own clothes. Hell Paul Krugman washes his own clothes in his sink, while he&#x27;s travelling, and I&#x27;m pretty sure he bills more than I do (I actually do use laundry service when I travel for work).<p>Anyway, maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see a lot of those things on the list as desirable; if I have to spend two hours managing the graphic designer to make a chart&#x2F;plot&#x2F;figure, I may as well fiddle around in xfig or whatever to get it done myself.')
