I do however care about knowing the limits of my &quot;unlimited&quot; plan, which are very real and easily reachable.<p>It&#x27;s funny how the limits of Unlimited can be reached in just a few days of youtube videos.<p>These limits don&#x27;t feel like limitations on scammers and abusers. They are not designed to stop people from downloading 20TBs of data hoarding. They&#x27;re limits that normal people reach <i></i>easily<i></i>.<p>Imagine a road having &quot;no speed limit&quot;, but cops enforce a 200mph speed limit. That seems reasonable to me. They&#x27;ll pull over people actively trying to break the sound barrier rather than merely trying to get to work going 80mph.<p>Now imagine that same road, with &quot;no speed limit&quot; - but cops pull you over at 80mph[1]? These aren&#x27;t people actively trying to kill someone. They&#x27;re normal, non-abuser people.<p>Tmobile&#x27;s data limit isn&#x27;t even remotely about data hoarders. My 5 year old thumb drive is 10x bigger than my Unlimited data limit.<p>[1]: This is a somewhat location dependent example, but over here (WA, USA) that&#x27;s frequently obtained by &quot;normal&quot; people.')
