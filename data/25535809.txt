And I love being able to have 9 virtual desktops arranged in a 3x3 grid and a semi-permanent transparent &quot;minimap&quot; of what&#x27;s on each desktop as well as my current location in the 3x3 grid. But it has an issue which makes it unusable for me, something which may or may not be a bug, i.e. on switching to a desktop, if that desktop contains more than one window, all of them are brought to the front one after another, causing considerable delay if there are &gt;3 windows present. The native win10 virtual desktop feature doesn&#x27;t seem to have that issue.')
