Not that I work on AWS, but we heavily use and rely on it.<p>The ones comparing AWS to VPSs even colocation think AWS is just short sighted. If VMs and bandwidth is your only case, yes it is expensive. Skipping the marketing talk, AWS has great services like SQS, S3, Dynamo, SNS, Kinesis, Firehose and hosting open-soure or paid alternatives of them requires a lot of engineering power, effort and extra monitoring, restless nights. I prefer our engineers to work on features, not infrastructure and only deal with it when it is required financially.<p>Most organizations are fine with vendor lock-in when vendor is stable (not deprecating, not increasing costs). Money is always an issue but its relative, there are many factors in real business. Some can afford cloud, some cannot.<p>I also agree that you would be fine if you did not use brand new X service that does AutoML, any shiny new over marketed features for you etc. but comparing AWS to Colocation is just one dimensional thought.')
