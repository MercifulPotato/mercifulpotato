I&#x27;d suggest with Test::More that Perl did something similar.  Almost all the modules you&#x27;d find on CPAN are full of test-cases.<p>There might well be thinks we can argue about with Perl, but it is definitely true that it has&#x2F;had one of the biggest and most consistent set of extensions out there.  CPAN has held up pretty well, compared to some of the later alternatives (such as node modules, ruby gems, etc).   One reason that I was able to work with Perl so easily was because I could find Stripe integrations, and similar with ease.')
