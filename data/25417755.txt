WMDs are <i>hugely</i> expensive, and the Iraqi economy was running on fumes at that point. That combined with US belligerence against Iraq made the claims improbable.<p>But Russia actually does have a strong black hat culture, with links to the political establishment. Putin is a technologically savvy kind of despot who likes sneaky low-cost high-return actions. So this fits the profile - both as a workable hack and also as a proof of concept for future attacks.<p>Consider the cost&#x2F;benefit. Instead of physically blowing up infrastructure and security systems you can cripple them, possibly permanently, for the cost of - what? - 20 or 30 specialists, some PCs, and maybe some supercomputer time. Although even that may be optional.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely conclusive evidence will be released, because that might reveal too much information about defence strategies. So circumstantial evidence will be as good as it gets.<p>But whatever the cause, clearly - <i>clearly</i> - all countries and larger orgs need to work much harder on security. Some decorative pen-testing isn&#x27;t going to be nearly enough in the 2020s.')
