You seem to be confused about my post, I&#x27;m not passing any judgement here in the sense of approving with the firing, I&#x27;m saying, if you make a post on some political event and you create some sort of backlash, even if you didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, but you&#x27;re being perceived that way, your place of work may let you go.<p>That&#x27;s unfair but it&#x27;s not a sign of hysteria, other than for the general shittiness of viral internet communication.')
