I sometimes end up with clothing that fits poorly – especially in t-shirts – that I chose because of the sourcing story, even though I’m dubious about the impact of voting with my meager few dollars.<p>On a completely different topic, I have discovered that the clothes dryer has a similar impact on the lifespan of clothes that smoking does on people. If you can manage, hanging your clothes to dry – for example, over the back of a chair or whatever – will make them last longer, though I’m not sure if it’s the heat or the spinning that does the damage. (I’ve been trying to dry things on low heat for longer, but I’m not sure if that helps and I’m too lazy to put together a spreadsheet like this person.)')
