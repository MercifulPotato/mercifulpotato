A friend turned me onto his blog in 2008 and since then I&#x27;ve read nearly everything he&#x27;s written. It amazes me one can be so prolific and write with such beauty and grace for such an extended timeframe.<p>For television I think the original &quot;Arrested Development&quot; series was absolutely as good as my friends were telling me. And &quot;The Good Place&quot; deserved every bit of hype it got.')
