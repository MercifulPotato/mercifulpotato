It is unclear whether or not it is efficient.<p>This situation has shorts identify a probably-failing company and set the stage for traders to (possibly) detonate a GameStop&#x2F;Hertz cash-bomb.  It yields a transfer of cash from &quot;greater-fools&quot; to a probably-failing company.<p>As a value-investor, it seems to me that occasionally raining cash upon failing companies seems like a strategy with a below-average probability of long-term success. Extracting that cash from unsophisticated investors seems to risk moral hazard -- the school of hard knocks is expensive and bruising.<p>Someone, somewhere, should be able to profit from blunting these explosions. Why aren&#x27;t options prices increasing to make this effect unlikely?  Surely there are options-traders who are incurring losses as they expand their hedges.')
