Unfortunately, we have to come to terms with the fact that outside the sphere of hackerdom and a select few privacy-conscious individuals, decentralization is completely and utterly irrelevant.<p>I&#x27;d posit that decentralization is a <i>business model</i> choice that has design implications.<p>A decentralized model means that one entity can&#x27;t control access to users, their data or their eyeballs.<p>As far as privacy is concerned, that&#x27;s not really an issue WRT centralization vs. decentralization since the whole point of social networking is to share information with others.<p>Rather, what folks present as &quot;privacy issues&quot; are really more about control, monetization and engagement.<p>I want <i>control</i> over the information I share.  If I want to keep it private, I wouldn&#x27;t share it.<p>What&#x27;s more, I despise advertising and contact from individuals and corporations whose only interest in me is to extract value (whether that be money, attention or access to my social graph) <i>from</i> me.  I&#x27;d say that most people, if given the <i>choice</i> not to have that in their social interactions[0] would choose control&#x2F;lack of advertising&#x2F;marketing overwhelmingly.<p>So no.  It&#x27;s not irrelevant at all.  Rather it&#x27;s a matter of having a <i>viable</i> alternative.<p>Unless, of course, your paycheck is contingent on such centralized platforms.  Is yours?<p>[0] Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re at the pub having a pint with your friends and a group of strangers stood nearby listening to your conversation, and every 30 seconds or so, one of them started pitching some product or service to you?  How long would you continue to frequent that pub?')
