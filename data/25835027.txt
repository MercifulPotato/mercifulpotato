In fact, often &quot;Agile&quot; is only applied within the development phase and they retain everything else Waterfall. It often looks like this:<p>Design phase - waterfall-styled, 3-12 months<p>Development phase - &quot;Agile&quot;, but with sprints planned out for the next 36-60 months<p>Test phase - waterfall-styled, 3-36 months<p>Deployment phase - waterfall-styled, 3-120 months<p>They don&#x27;t incorporate testing properly during the Scrum-based development phase (only <i>some</i> testing, too limited to really provide confidence). They then use their experience to say, &quot;Agile is bullshit&quot;. And they&#x27;re <i>right</i>, if you take their definition of Agile which is: What we did before but with finer-grained &quot;planning&quot; of the work for 5 years.')
