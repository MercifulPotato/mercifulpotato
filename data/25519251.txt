The vaccine would be allocated and priced just like any other scarce resource should be allocated and priced: by demand and supply.<p>After all, it&#x27;s the strategy that allowed us to feed and shelter a planet of 8 billion.<p>But in reality the vaccine distribution is made through policy and politics. Because this strategy worked so well back in March, with the PPE. If this doesn&#x27;t prove that we live under socialism, I don&#x27;t know what will.<p>So check if you have a friend in high places, if you are one of the chosen ones. Because in socialism resources are allocated through the good old power networks. Relations, bureaucracy and so on. Who you know becomes more important than what you know, who you do more important than what you do. It&#x27;s a brave new world and I hope your dossier is perfect.<p>But don&#x27;t worry: you&#x27;ll easily buy a dose on the black market.')
