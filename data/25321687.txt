Item(by='keiferski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607237565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25312681, text='Rather than list all the classics like Plato, Aristotle, Hume, etc., I always suggest that those new to philosophy pick a book that will “shock” them, so to speak. Something that makes the reader go, “Wow, I had never considered the world from that perspective before.”<p>For this purpose, I recommend some of the following:<p>- Max Stirner. Sort of a proto-anarchist that critiqued everything and denied the authority of everyone.<p>- Nietzsche&#x27;s <i>The Genealogy of Morality.</i> The concepts in this book will radically shake up your understanding of modern ethics and values.<p>- A work about Zen Buddhism. Zen in particular is very focused on the everyday moment, in a way distinctly opposite from the common YOLO &#x2F; carpe diem idea we’re all familiar with.<p>- Spinoza. HN’s especially will appreciate the complex, mathematical nature of his metaphysics.')
