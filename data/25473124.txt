The post mortem action items for these are always really deep thoughts about the safety of config changes but in my experience there, nobody ever really fixes them because the problem is really hard.<p>For this kind of change I would probably have wanted some kind of shadow system that loaded the new config, received production inputs, produced responses that were monitored but discarded, and had no other observable side effects. That&#x27;s such a pain in the ass that most teams aren&#x27;t going to bother setting that up, even when the risks are obvious.')
