While it is a truism that starting a company is easier with money than without, that doesn&#x27;t explain the abundance of poor immigrants (here in the US) who build businesses.  Nor is any of it a clear indicator that shifting policy towards blanket money hand-outs would be an efficient means of increasing entrepreneurship.  The left-tech&#x27;s attachment to universal hand-outs looks much more like a guilt-salve than reasoned, efficient policy.')
