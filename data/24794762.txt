If SpaceX can’t legally operate commercially in any locale then it seems incredibly unlikely that they will try.  The satellites know where they are and their phased array antenna will know approximately where the terminal is, especially if gps is embedded or they do multilateration of a signal with multiple satellites.<p>This also is the big problem with the post, the satellites will be doing lots of beam steering to maximize throughout and minimize latency.  Flooding the entire area underneath them with a single signal would severely impact service.<p>That said, they will almost certainly have to implement some or all of these controls in support of military operations.')
