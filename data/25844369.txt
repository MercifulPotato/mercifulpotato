To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.<p>What if instead of cramming the non-Euclidean space of perceived colors into an Euclidean space and interpreting straight lines there as gradients we used geodesic curves in the original non-Euclidean metric? Are there efforts to explore this area?')
