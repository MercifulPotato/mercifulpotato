How many doctors are talking crap about Covid? Here lies one of our problem about misinformation. Too many people are just regurgitate opinions of &quot;doctors&quot;.<p>Generally speaking, I like to use fallacies for myself, just to be aware about certain pitfalls. Not so much about discrediting others, but rather not fall into one myself.<p>If I realize other people are using fallacies to support their argument, it helps me to build an argument against it. Just don&#x27;t use it naively: &quot;you&#x27;re wrong because of fallacy number 42&quot;. Using it like this is a bad habit, because of the wast number of fallacies, you can probably kill any discussion.')
