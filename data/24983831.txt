The color itself though still varies from red to blue based on percentage vote margin. In my mind, this is a great tradeoff, with the only exception that dark Grey counties (large counties with roughly 50:50 split) are way more important than they look since humans tend to de emphasize greys. I would have preferred a brown or something. Purple is not used as it has an imbalanced perceptual effect.')
