They could also buy ads for the Exotel keyword. The two could get stuck in a bidding war, wastefully sending money to Google when the optimal thing would be to <i>just send users to the site they&#x27;re trying to reach</i>.<p>We&#x27;re long past the point where you should expect users to try to guess domain names and to pretend that Google is just another general-purpose search engine. That universe could be nice but we don&#x27;t live in it.')
