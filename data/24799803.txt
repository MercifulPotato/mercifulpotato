He has every right to point out that they are using his code.  And I think it would be at least polite to mention that, and it is in my opinion impolite not to mention it.<p>And actually a little misleading when they don&#x27;t mention using an open source system that is similar.<p>And it&#x27;s not like the fact that he didn&#x27;t say that in his license means he is not allowed to mention he made that software.<p>So I think better late than never, put the requirements you want in the license for credit.  Or go AGPL or whatever.  Although obviously that&#x27;s not retroactive on the previous version.<p>This also proves that someone thinks it&#x27;s a business.  So I feel like there might be an opportunity to launch a competitor, with a main advantage that they have the actual talent that created the system.')
