Item(by='wruza', descendants=None, kids=[24976101], score=None, time=1604351959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971652, text='I would actually like site-related ads rather than a stupid version of mini-me chasing me around and suggesting crap I don&#x27;t need.<p>Targeted ads are dead-end, because they inhibit exploration. They act on assumption that a person is fixed and cannot change or want to change. Before adtech I actually <i>liked</i> ads on paper, because it was shiny and showed things I maybe wanted to want. E.g. watch, suits, travel, home utility. I have <i>read</i> ads out of curiosity. Now it is an idiotic AI that thinks I need items that I bought a week ago, single women near me, and nothing more. I have some money but I don&#x27;t have any watch, suits and I barely travel, partially because no one suggested that it is cool and I&#x27;m too lazy to do full-time research myself. Where are your <i>really targeted</i> ads, adtech industry? Can you do your job and empty my pockets? You&#x27;re too dumb for that.<p>Based on a description of powerful datasets they have, they should show me:<p><pre><code>  - rtx 3080 with discount (free shipping!)\n  - compare se 2020 and 12 mini at coolstore.com\n  - stop walking and get a scooter!\n</code></pre>\nAll three are at least $800+ to spend at my location. Instead it shows:<p><pre><code>  - cheap mobile op that sucks and will never regain me a visit cost\n  - Xiaomi phone that I both have and hate\n  - python courses (I helped someone with script deployment at my linux box an hour ago)\n</code></pre>\nIt is like a psycho that follows you all the time and just repeats every action or mistake you do; every time you kick a stone on a road, they bring it back and pull your arm.')
