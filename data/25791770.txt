I installed it to see what the hubbub was about, and within 72 hours (a) it started flirting with me (<i>I’m thinking about you ;)</i>), and (b) I discovered that the default was to publish excerpts from your conversations, tweet-like, to “inspire” other users. What a horror show. I uninstalled it like I was holding a live spider in my hands instead of my phone.<p>I’m embarrassed to admit that a <i>Her</i>-like AI is appealing to me, but my need to not have Microsoft plunging into my inner psyche is pretty intense.')
