For a time, I was tracking some of them to figure out which ones support which particular protocol extension; the result is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssh-comparison.quendi.de" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssh-comparison.quendi.de</a> and the list there is really incomplete (and sadly also outdated -- PRs welcome ;-)), I think I could easily double the number of entries there if I resumed work on it.<p>The one concern I&#x27;d have for a custom implementation is when they roll their own crypto... On a quick glance, that seems (?) to be the case here, see &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;crate&#x2F;thrussh&#x2F;0.28.0&#x2F;source&#x2F;src&#x2F;cipher&#x2F;chacha20poly1305.rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;crate&#x2F;thrussh&#x2F;0.28.0&#x2F;source&#x2F;src&#x2F;cipher&#x2F;chach...</a>&gt;, albeit only for chacha20poly1305 which is <i>relatively</i> easy to implement &quot;right&quot; and &quot;securely&quot;, but one can still mess that up...')
