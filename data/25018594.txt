Perhaps based on the tendency to amplify rumours, or even bad jokes, until they are widely believed regardless of truth.<p>In places where it hasn&#x27;t resulted in obvious violence, it appears to be pushing people towards polarisation and distress, with violence looking plausible if that continues.<p>We have a real dilemma around this one.  It may be that certain forms of &quot;speech&quot; that have emerged in modern society <i>also</i> push people towards violence.')
