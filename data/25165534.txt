Runs on Android. Has a nice VR mode that auto integrates head tracking. Turn on, switch to VR mode, slide into your pick of cardboard style devices and off you go. It isn&#x27;t fast enough response for racing, but is great for inspection&#x2F;maneuvering a drone around inside and out of a crowded facility (slowly) without line of sight.<p>I use an old samsung galaxy for the ground station&#x2F;dispaly. Works excellently for the purpose and cost me nothing.<p>For work I use a DJI mavic pro with updated firmware to remove some pesky restrictions and the DJI phone home functions.<p>If you really want a roll your own solution, check out Ardupilot with a Navio II flight controller. This will let you construct a full flying telepresence solution to your personal specifications. Embedded Linux and ROS built in too!')
