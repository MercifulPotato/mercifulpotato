Three repositories within it. One named &#x27;knowledge&#x27; where I store code snippets, common issues with their solutions I have dealt with. It has multiple markdown files, one per scope. I have a git.md, docker.md, and language based ones.  issues.md I keep all the error X has solution Y. If I have to deal with an error I look there, if nothing is found i append the solution. If I realize I had the solution but I was using the wrong search term, I will add my search term in the original solution.<p>My other repo is a scratch pad of sorts. Various scripts and tests, at various stages. This is for things like testing sorts, weird complicated manipulations to strings etc. I some need to run some script somewhere else to check somet so I can just clone scratch repo somewhere remotely and run things there. Mostly though it&#x27;s more of a let me take all my objects from debug mode and use those values with a code snippet I want to alter without having to run large files to reproduce those object values.<p>Third repo is my story repo. It holds all the stories I work on, with my notes. We use Jira so it&#x27;s story is - a short description. Inside I write my thoughts, things I need to consider, things I don&#x27;t want to forget. Lately I have been experimenting with having a day.md and I just keep appending on the top new days, I don&#x27;t k ow if I like it more.<p>All three repos are public within the company. I actually have used the story repo for presentations within my team etc. I find that it helps me keep me accountable.<p>The fourth repo is not pushed anywhere. Just local for my personal todos, but I rarely use it. Instead I write my personal stuff on paper. It helps separate personal from work todos just by using a different medium.')
