E.g. Hibernate allows logging of the SQLs being executed so when I make changes, I review that the SQL being executed is as expected + performance is acceptable. From that point of view, understanding SQL performance is important. However, I don&#x27;t really want to write boilerplate SQLs when the ORMs can basically form the query for me using query method name - that is super convenient and I don&#x27;t want to give that up.<p>Selecting * from a table with 200 columns isn&#x27;t performant but if the table had 200 columns, I won&#x27;t be blindly relying on the ORM generated query anyway since most provide the escape hatch of executing direct SQL.')
