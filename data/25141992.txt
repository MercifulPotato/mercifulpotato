The context and expectations are different, and such restrictions -- hobbling many uses of macOS -- would drive developers away from Macs to competing platforms. I&#x27;m not even sure what those restrictions would look like; can I not execute arbitrary Python code? Can I not install Python packages from PyPI? (And how are they going to stop me, exactly?) Can I not use clang to compile a C project? To what extent can MacOS really be locked down in a way that doesn&#x27;t drive away any developer who&#x27;s not making iOS apps?<p>And if the Mac software scene stagnates, Apple eventually loses their core constituency.')
