I couldn&#x27;t send &quot;my car broke down&quot; on Signal because it&#x27;s one service was down for reasons entirely unrelated to my use.<p>This happened to gmail recently, too, and my realtor couldn&#x27;t send me contracts during a bidding war.  In the case of gmail, it was an accidental reduction of provisioning to an internal service (perhaps easy to predict if you ignore the enormous complexity of the googleverse).  In the case of Signal, it was a result of a scaling suddenly and faster than they could be expected to predict (perhaps easy to predict, but not a certainty; a risk in any case for a small operation like Signal).')
