If one considers a population where 60%+ of the population has 30%+ of bodyfat percentage, then it&#x27;s impossible to define what constitutes fitness - even one flight of stairs, in a sense, requires a decent amount of training.<p>In at least northern Europe, hiking is relatively common for elderlies (people in their 60s) - and this amounts to hours of walking in rough terrains, so definitely, for a person who&#x27;s not (considerably) overweight, and hour of walks in the city is... a walk in the park.')
