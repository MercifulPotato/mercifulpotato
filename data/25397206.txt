People watching TV get used to the idea of an elite crew of colorful personalities inevitably hunting down their man, and they think murder is a guaranteed jail sentence, so they murder less often. In reality, probably pretty easy to get away with murder.<p>Also: video games. Young men, who commit most of the murders, spend more time playing video games and therefore less time murdering.')
