Only the internal floppy drive is implemented<p>o 8520 CIA<p>o ao68000 OpenCores IP core is used as the aoOCS processor\nAll of the above components are WISHBONE revision B.3 compatible<p>The aoOCS contains the following additional components:\nSD card controller written in HDL with DMA. Supports SDHC cards only.\n10&#x2F;100 Mbit Ethernet controller written in HDL to send the current VGA frames (frame grabber)\nHDL drivers for SSRAM, PS&#x2F;2 keyboard, PS&#x2F;2 mouse, audio codec, VGA DAC\naoOCS uses only one external memory: a SSRAM with 36-bit words and pipelined access.<p><i>A video buffer with about 250KB is located SSRAM.</i><p>Another 256KB are used by the ROM. All the rest memory can be used as Chip RAM.<p>[...]<p><i>The video output is VGA compatible: 640x480 at 70 Hz.</i><p>A rather simple method is used to extend the 256 PAL horizontal lines to 480 VGA lines: all lines are doubled except for every 8th one.<p>PDS: Today I was thinking, &quot;you know, I&#x27;d like the simplest of simple FPGA soft core VGA cards -- but one with 2D acceleration (bitblt), but more specifically, only the simplest, most common, most used 2D graphics primitives...&quot;<p>Then I saw this web page on OpenCores...<p>Then I said to myself, &quot;This makes a lot of sense; instead of having the &#x27;graphics card&#x27; (implemented as another FPGA) be separate, why not put it on the same physical FPGA, and that way, it and the CPU (FPGA soft CPU) could share memory, and at least one area of complexity, which is, how data is interchanged with the Graphics Card over a bus -- can be, to a large part, removed, at least in theory...&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why I like this soft CPU core -- it does all of that, has a VGA output signal, and the Amiga &quot;blitter&quot; (AKA, &quot;block move&quot;, AKA, &quot;2D Graphics Card Accelerator&quot;)  -- from the days of old...<p>I like to think of this core not as an Amiga SoC, but rather as an Accelerated 2D VGA card -- with additional &quot;bonus&quot; features (68000, etc.) that makes it Amiga compatible! &lt;g&gt;')
