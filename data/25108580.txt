One could argue that it&#x27;s eventually a moral imperative - otherwise we&#x27;re just wasting these skills which the planet has sacrificed so many resources for, and never giving a voice to the myriad different ways that different species can see the world.  That is, if consciousness is good at all... otherwise we might as well just dull ourselves back down instead.  This is also clearly not a simple task that should be undergone lightly - but it does need preparatory steps like this one for it to ever happen.<p>If you were a new species capable of language and philosophy, would you be happy that humans unlocked that intelligence in your people, or not?')
