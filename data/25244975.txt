They’ve actually been on the <i>trailing</i> edge in such matters, rather than the leading edge. There’s been a repeating cycle of rigidity, followed by flexible theming support, then back to rigidity by way of allowing apps to control things, then introducing a new kind of theming support (always weaker than the last iteration); and each time you introduce the new hotness, it’s touted as a groundbreaking revolution, completely ignoring the fact that ten and twenty years ago the system probably had the same functionality. Windows has gone through a couple of iterations of this loop; Android has as well; macOS has too, though it was never as strong as Windows’; Windows Phone was always dark; iOS never really gave the flexibility before last year. In the current cycle, Windows and Android both had it for more than a year before Apple.<p>I think the dark mode theming capacity will <i>probably</i> be more permanent this time through, but it could still fizzle out within ten years.')
