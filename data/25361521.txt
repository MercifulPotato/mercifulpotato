When I was driving for GrubHub I met a lot of other delivery drivers and everyone considered DoorDash to be the the worst in terms of treatment of drivers.  In other words, bad support and tip stealing.  We referred to it as &quot;DoorTrash&quot; or &quot;PoorDash&quot; for that reason.  Postmates has pretty much nonexistent driver support but at least they didn&#x27;t steal tips and it was pretty difficult to get fired from it randomly.')
