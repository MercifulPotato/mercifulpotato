Google has abused its power and many, many users of Google know it. There wasn&#x27;t really a place or group that can give voice to that anger though so I created the club. As others have pointed out, we aren&#x27;t Google&#x27;s customers, we are just users of their software, the advertisers are their customers. I don&#x27;t think we have enough power as just users to be able to get to a point where we can negotiate with Google directly and issue demands and extract concessions. The power that we do have, as workers within the tech industry who understand what Google is doing, is talking with regulators and showing them how and why they should regulate Google. I&#x27;ve found regulators to be extremely receptive and grateful for the research I have provided them (i.e. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knuckleheads.club&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knuckleheads.club&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-crawled-our-way-into...</a>). Many of these regulators have the same general complaints we do and want to dethrone Google from being king of the internet. I support the Alphabet Workers Union and am super happy to see it exist and I am working hard to establish the club as a way for people working outside Google to make changes to how Google behaves.')
