He somehow maintains a superhuman level of efficiency in writing. This is the 4th of a planned 10 book epic fantasy series. I can&#x27;t possibly summarize the 3.5 books I&#x27;ve read in the series so far, since each is approximately 1200 pages. Really they&#x27;re about 3-4 of an average sized trade paperback each. That&#x27;s not to say they are too long either, with the exception of the first book (a common&#x2F;unavoidable problem the with epic fantasy genre, there&#x27;s just a lot you need to say to get people fully invested), they pick up from the first word on interesting storylines and just keep churning.<p>and<p>Children of Dune by Frank Herbert (Book 3 of the Dune series)<p>Dune is one of my favorite books of all time. SOmehow, I&#x27;ve never read the rest of them. I re-read Dune this year, and decided to continue the story. I really wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of Dune Messiah. I don&#x27;t want to spoil anything for you, but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s probably because flaws of the main character are too humanly frustrating to watch unfold. Children of Dune is, so far, as good or better than Dune in my opinion.')
