You’ve got a bucket that you want to load data from and shuffle it away somewhere else (redshift, s3, whatever). This could be populated by a Firehose, another system, etc etc. Bookmarks just store the greatest “created time” for the files you’re loading from s3. So when you trigger a job it will only load files created since the last successful run. It does some funky stuff to handle s3’s eventual consistency with LIST operations.<p>Super simple incremental loading. This also works when loading data from a relational database, by storing the greatest primary key value.')
