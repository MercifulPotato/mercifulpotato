I&#x27;m not well versed in the technical differences between BIOS and UEFI, but I don&#x27;t think it really matters? All these people like Richard Stallman and this guy make their lives harder as a method of virtue signaling. I&#x27;m convinced they get off on the masochism of making their life hard for the sake of &quot;freedom.&quot;<p>Meanwhile, the rest of us just want to get work done: my Arch Linux desktop that boots with UEFI is functionally <i>identical</i> to one that boots with BIOS. So.. really, who cares?')
