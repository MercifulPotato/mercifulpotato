This isn&#x27;t &#x27;i disagree with their politics so I need to change the platform to silence them&#x27;. There was an insurrection on the US capitol due to extremists and online communication tools were a big part of this (though it was social media mostly). Let&#x27;s not abstract away what happened to downplay how serious the event was. I don&#x27;t know what signal should do, but it&#x27;s strange to be surprised that given a new understanding of the world people would revisit their principles. That&#x27;s what people should do. People should not be intransigent.<p>Also, personally I don&#x27;t think signal should compromise the quality of their product though. E2E is too important.')
