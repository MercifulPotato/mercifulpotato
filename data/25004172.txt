There was a an article awhile back that the most longed lived or healthy groups were New Jersey Asian females and South Dakota male farmers.<p>I’ve been at a desk for 20 years and I’m almost crippled.<p>The difference is the variety of work. Fix fence in the morning, do the manual stuff before it gets too hot. In the afternoon get in the ACed tractor (if you’re lucky). Get back in the house at 10pm. Maybe not till age midnight if the combine breaks, etc.<p>Lots of physical activity, lots of fresh veggies and a bit of fruit seems to be the recipe for a long healthy life. Wealth not likely or guaranteed.<p>For better or worse that life is economically impossible now.')
