In Yokoi&#x27;s day, the rationale for &quot;withered technology&quot; was that it was cheaper and much easier to second-source, meaning that a shortage from a single supplier wouldn&#x27;t hold up the production run.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until fairly recently (Wii and later) that Nintendo realized that participating in the red queen&#x27;s race of ever-increasing console specs was going to get them trounced by megacorporations with much more cash to burn selling consoles at a loss, so they had to pivot to producing cheap hardware with unique value adds in order to get the console profitable fast.')
