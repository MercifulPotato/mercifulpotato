I&#x27;m a slavic expat in UK. I recently raised an issue with how teachers at our kids&#x27; school are struggling with utilising technology in productive ways. I also offered taking a day off work to help them get better at things like google classroom and google docs. I was labelled rude solely by pointing out the deficiencies. It didn&#x27;t really matter that I offered constructive way of resolving this. According to the brits, I was rude because I pointed out areas of improvement. WTF?')
