Most people have at least some manners even if they are awkward and being in a group face to face adds social pressure to mind them. It&#x27;s fairly rare that you see someone who is a complete boor since they are usually excluded from gatherings due to their behaviour. To make something like this work you&#x27;d need to leverage all of that cultural machinery that&#x27;s already in place, networks of trust and reputation, consensus, expectations of politeness, etc. We still have all that social technology that&#x27;s been built up over millennia, I think we&#x27;re mostly just lacking the hubs around which we used to organize. Build the hub and people will provide the etiquette.')
