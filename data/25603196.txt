A horses for courses approach is better IMHO.<p>If you&#x27;re exposing SSH to outer world, minimizing attack surface by removing users and&#x2F;or passwords is good. OTOH, if you&#x27;re not exposing these services outside, or putting them behind a VPN maybe with people connecting from unsecured locations, adding a password is always a good idea in my book.<p>A laptop maybe stolen, a workstation maybe breached if someone is not careful and losing a key create bigger consequence.<p>So maybe instead of a tug of war about which method is the silver bullet, we should discuss about which one is better, under which circumstances.')
