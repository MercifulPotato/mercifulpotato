It has fast lanes and slow lanes, which cause a lot of problems for work VPNs even when down the street.  This TLS handshake bit flip is just yet another issue AT&amp;T has, including the 1.1.1.1 DNS issues, and everything else.<p>I&#x27;m on Sonic.net fiber over AT&amp;T too.  To get the equivalent fiber from Comcast out here it&#x27;s $270 a month.  However, if you&#x27;re lucky enough Sonic.net fiber that doesn&#x27;t run over AT&amp;T is amazing.')
