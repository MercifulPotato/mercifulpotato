It&#x27;s also the only computer a lot of people own.<p>It&#x27;s not a dedicated gaming device - people use iPhone to call, edit media, find jobs, pay for things, calculate, date, do email. It&#x27;s a computer. Arguments like &quot;but you can&#x27;t install on a Nintendo&quot; aren&#x27;t equivalent. Nintendo makes one of a dozen different game platforms, all of which have wide penetration and lots of alternatives. And it&#x27;s just for games. This is closer to &quot;you can&#x27;t repair your tractor&quot;, which is also an issue for farmers.<p>Computers, especially those with massive market share, should be open to 3rd party installs.<p>It&#x27;s an expensive device and it got to where it is because of a trillion dollar company backing it. You can&#x27;t compete with that.<p>You own an iPhone and you&#x27;re happy installing just from Apple? That&#x27;s fine. But there are a lot more people in this world that will benefit from open computing. Apple can still have their App Store, charge for distribution, and will still be making bank.<p>Computing on computers should be free and open.<p>If we let this slide, we&#x27;ll one day own nothing. Stallman was right about everything.')
