The mechanics and how to solve for it are the important pieces to learn. Further I think it actually does more harm as it hinders the child&#x27;s ability to look at numbers as placeholders and variables when they get into higher level maths. Spending so many years on the basics of mathematics could be speed up if we ensured that children fundamentally understood the mechanics and principles and then moved on to more interesting math like algebra and geometry. Where you can see more real world applications by applying them to easily solve those word problems that we all hated as children. We really don&#x27;t do a good job of teaching children how to think most of it is teaching them how to memorize. It&#x27;s the whole concept of cramming for a test, memorize it just long enough to get past this test, then let it fall out of your brain.<p>I don&#x27;t even know where to start with english and literature, I just muscled thru those but man that was like death to me, just not my interest at all. It&#x27;s very evident in my writing that I was not very attentive in those classes. Thank goodness for spellcheck and a very pedantic highschool friend that did not mind proofreading and shaking his head at me, after each paragraph.')
