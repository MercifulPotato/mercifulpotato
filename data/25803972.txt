Maybe. No framework or ORM that I&#x27;ve ever seen that does this though.<p>But even when it does: it still requires you to do the parsing and mapping in the application: introducing a tight coupling (e.g. you cannot add a constraint without releasing new locales).<p>In practice, is my experience, you&#x27;ll most likely have some constraints in the DB, some validations in your ORM, some of which overlap, some of which are unique to one of both.<p>Which is arguably worse than having each app that uses the database repeat that. It all depends on the use-case, obviously.')
