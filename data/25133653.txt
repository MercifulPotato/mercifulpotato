Most platforms have O(10) cores now so it&#x27;s an order of magnitude question, but exploiting that is a problem that few languages are helpful at. JVM is much better for that than JSVM though.<p>(But usually the much bigger speed problem is in the programming phase, better to optimize for programmer performance than runtime performance or risk not delivering anything  due to time&#x2F;money limitations)')
