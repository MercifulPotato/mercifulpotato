I would also bring you into the (late) twentieth century with Deleuze &amp; Guattari. But I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to a beginner.<p>I also think as a start, knowing these figures, perhaps even tasting their work, lets you read around them. You see the way their ideas spread out into the world. I sometimes think there are more different takes on Nietzsche&#x27;s work than ideas in them!<p>You can also read back and trace a line of thought through various philosophers from say, Deleuze back through Bergson, Nietzsche, Kant, Spinoza, Liebniz, all the way back to the Stoics. To understand Dennett, you need see the impact Descartes has on modern thought, and you can trace that kind of thinking back through to the Socratics. You start to see that these philosophical threads actually shape people&#x27;s entire view of the world around them, and in some way the world itself.')
