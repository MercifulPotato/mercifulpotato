Then my &#x27;what&#x27;s in season&#x27; web page or API would just be a thin domain-specific wrapper over Wikidata.<p>I&#x27;ve never actually played with it though, don&#x27;t know if it already has that data, and I don&#x27;t know what its terms of service permit doing, so not advice etc. just something I thought of, to likely never get to.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24811316" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24811316</a>')
