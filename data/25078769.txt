There&#x27;s a few reasons that&#x27;s wrong and a significant underestimate. Most LTC patients leave and live a few years beyond the end of their stay in other facilities (hospice, or more intense care facilities). Additionally, some patients leave because they&#x27;re healthy (I assume you go to a care facility because you have a broken hip, or something, but leave once you&#x27;re healed). These patients have, as a group, significantly shorter stays, so the median stay length among terminal inhabitants is actually longer.<p>But let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re correct. In fact let&#x27;s go further and say that those people&#x27;s lives are irrelevant, or unavoidable losses, because they were going to die soon anyway. In fact, let&#x27;s assume the same for everyone over the age of 75 (who I presume make up the vast majority of the LTC deaths as well). They were close to death anyway, and Covid just got them there a little faster.<p>We&#x27;re still left with more than 93000 deaths and counting. Deaths that can&#x27;t be blamed on long term care facilities, or even age. Deaths in people who might have lived for 30+ more years in many cases.<p>Certainly nursing homes and the very elderly may deserve special and additional protections, but claiming that because old, frail, and colocated people are highly impacted that we could relax is a disservice to all of the not-old, not-frail, and not-colocated people who still may need protection.<p>And I think you&#x27;re vastly exaggerating the impact, both on the economy, and on the way of life, that a well managed set of guidelines have. Mask mandates + closure of certain non-essential businesses + restrictions on others means that relatively few things shut down. Certainly some do, your mall and movie theater may have trouble, but grocery stores and restaraunts can and are surviving and adapting (and imo the changes to enable urban outdoor dining that are happening in SF, Chicago, and other cities aren&#x27;t a change that should be repaired, they should be embraced).')
