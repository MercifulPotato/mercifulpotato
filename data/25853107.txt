How is it an advantage to not use pen and paper to track down your train of thought as you do a complex calculation, and instead be restricted to do it only in your head?<p>If dynamic type systems are like not having pen and paper, then static type systems are like a teacher forcing you to &quot;show your work&quot; by writing every little step on pen and paper, no matter how obvious.  What&#x27;s interesting is finding good middle grounds.')
