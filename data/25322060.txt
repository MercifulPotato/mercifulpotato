(He has a background in formal AI and a longtime academic interest in how an AI, or a human, could usefully model and act in the world. More recently he&#x27;s been a serious student and practitioner of some less-well-known-to-English-speakers sorts of Buddhism, which he mostly tries to describe to his website readers from a secular, naturalist perspective.) I appreciate that he&#x27;s kind, curious, thorough, intelligent, and eclectic. I sometimes think I&#x27;ll be doing well if I get to 30% of his attainment in any of these areas!')
