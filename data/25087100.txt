Everybody wears one here.<p>Enforcement and compliance are two different things. I was saying that it cannot be enforced. Not that people won&#x27;t comply.<p>&gt; You probably missed the part where I said we would only outlaw knives if we had a safer way of cutting things (reliably)<p>You seemed to misunderstand. The way we have is perfectly safe as it is. Billions of people use them everyday without issue. There is neither the incentive or need to.<p>You cannot enforce the ban of knives as they are soooo trivial to make (you can make a knife by hitting a large stone against a piece of flint).  Even in a very locked down environment such as a prison inmates still manage to acquire them or produce them.<p>Even if in your fantasy world you did outlaw them and was successful. People would hit each other with Baseball bats, Umbrellas, Pieces of wood, Bricks, lumps of metal.<p>You must solve the problem of why people are being violent not what they are using to be violent.')
