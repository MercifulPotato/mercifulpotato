If it isn&#x27;t strict waterfall then it&#x27;s agile, in one way or another, so &quot;agile&quot; becomes a pretty useless term.<p>And I don&#x27;t much like agile because many of the features seem to have the goal of (to re-use your apt language) removing craft from software development.<p>I get the same feelings about what little I know of &quot;lean&quot;. Everyone loves and claims to use it, one way or another. Which med me wonder about alternatives that aren&#x27;t followed.<p>So I was receptive when I came across mention of the Uddevalla approach. I would really like to have seen that approach developed and tested further.')
