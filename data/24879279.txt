I doubt the public insurance subsidy works the way you are representing it. They&#x27;d not insure against the risk of a catastrophic meltdown in a free market, the risk is too low. The &quot;insurance&quot; is probably more of a government tax on the assumption that there is latent risk. I&#x27;m not going to say that is unreasonable, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with how safe the industry thinks it is.<p>Consider Fukushima, the result of one of the biggest earthquakes in recorded history (Wikipedia says 4th largest [0]). Free markets don&#x27;t bother to insure against that sort low-risk event. It would be like insuring San Francisco against the fact that it is on an active fault line - the market doesn&#x27;t bother to insure against a risk that rare.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lists_of_earthquakes#Largest_earthquakes_by_magnitude" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lists_of_earthquakes#Largest_e...</a>')
