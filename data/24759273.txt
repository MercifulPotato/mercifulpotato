No, we will go back to normal. This cannot continue forever. We cannot live the rest of our lives in fear. This is not how we evolved and I&#x27;m honestly sick of it.<p>There is growing evidence that there is immunity out there beyond antibodies; including memory T-cells. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll be fine long before a vaccine is produced, through a combination of herd immunity and just better therapeutics (there are some big studies on inhaled steroids right now that are promising).<p>Mississippi, Florida and other states are starting to go back to normal without any increase in fatalities (and don&#x27;t go on about cases, because there is no distinction between people who test positive and people who test positive because they&#x27;ve actually been sick). Fatalities are going down across the board. Exponential growth does not go on forever. It ends.<p>Things should have been back to normal months ago. All these lockdowns have just delayed the inevitable. When this is over and we can prune all the data, I expect to see the same fatality rates between countries that did and didn&#x27;t lock down, excluding places like NYC, northern Italy, Michigan and other places where we put all the elderly people together.<p>In 2030, we&#x27;ll look back at this as a time of overreaction and mass hysteria.')
