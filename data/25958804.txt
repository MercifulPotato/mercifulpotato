Too busy to use the very internet which some of them probably helped build to magically render learning materials to the screen in front of them at zero marginal cost.<p>I will say that I’m not too busy for this at the moment, and getting to my <i>very basic</i> level of understanding has required me to sort through, at the very least, a fairly decent chunk of reference material and reading interpretations and explanations online.<p>Like, here’s some things I’ve been grappling with understanding recently:<p>How do settlement risk, clearing brokers, and clearinghouses work? Why does buying an ordinary stock carry so much settlement risk?<p>Why do market makers buy stock for delta hedging? How do they figure out how much stock to buy?<p>To make an analogy, it feels like I’m some kid in chemistry class who just learned how to draw bond diagrams, and then I watch a video of someone talking about how they figured out the structure of some chemical using Raman spectroscopy.')
