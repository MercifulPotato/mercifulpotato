Item(by='joseph_grobbles', descendants=None, kids=[25608137, 25607876], score=None, time=1609538998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607628, text='Let me be more explicit for you, then: I speed past a cop who is <i>pointing his radar gun at me, staring at me</i>, but for some reason he doesn&#x27;t decide to pursue me (an experience many of us have actually had).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s an off day for him and he just doesn&#x27;t care. Maybe he was confused about the speed limit on that stretch. Maybe he is waiting for a bigger fish. Maybe he likes my car (or skin) color and decided to look the other way. Regardless, I <i>got away</i> with speeding.<p>If I then at some future date pointed to that as legalizing my speeding for all time, that would be ignorant nonsense. Yet we see this exactly this sort of childish argument in all realms: Some guy deducts something unlawful for years and then one day the tax man says &quot;Uh no...that isn&#x27;t allowed&quot;, and they point to their prior years as if that makes it suddenly lawful. That getting away with it before grandfathers it in or something.<p>Some random Apple employee writing a story linked it (or a tax employee accepting a tax return, or a cop giving a pass to speeding), therefore it is <i>officially sanctioned for all time</i>. Give me a break. That isn&#x27;t how <i>any</i> of this works.<p>But it makes for a lot of crybaby stories.')
