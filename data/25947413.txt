Who said this to whom? How did it go from here to a decision to shut down buys (but not sells). This isn&#x27;t vanguard. It&#x27;s a daytrading app.<p>Not to mention that this is near suicidal for robinhood. That&#x27;s why the Citadel story resonates with people.<p>The only non-cabal story <i>I</i> can think of (I know I said it was hard, but I thought hard... swear) is that they ran out of cash, or are hedged poorly and trying to trade their way out of a hole. Cabal still seems more likely. I wonder how reliant on Citadel Robinhood is for long tail emergency capital.')
