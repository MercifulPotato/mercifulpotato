They are like lower latency and faster DDG &quot;bangs&quot;. What I found is that most of my searches are better served by direct searches on Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. For Linux and software trouble shooting, using Google is better, but at least there&#x27;s less &quot;privacy surface area&quot; than doing <i>everything</i> through Google.<p>There&#x27;s also so much SEO-spam on Google&#x2F;Bing that I find it easier to just do site:reddit.com or look up the top rated posts&#x2F;comments on HN from Algolia. The latter works really well, so thank you all committed HN users! :)')
