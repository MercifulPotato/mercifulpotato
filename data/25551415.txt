I was not referring to it.<p>The two modern ARM instruction sets, the 16-bit-encoded ARMv7-M &#x2F; ARMv8-M (for microcontrollers) and the 64-bit (32-bit-encoded) ARMv8-A, are very different from the traditional ARM ISA and they both are very well designed, incomparably better than RISC-V.<p>RISC-V is primitive even compared to the instructions sets used 50 years ago. It includes a few good ideas and the RISC-V team has the merit of popularizing the fact that the older vector ISAs of the seventies were better than the more recent SIMD ISAs of the nineties, which lead to modern vector ISAs, e.g. the RISC-V vector extension and ARM SVE.<p>However the base RISC-V ISA is extremely weak and its only merit is that it is simple enough to be easy to implement in student projects.')
