CMOS Logic has dealt with this by having &quot;dark silicon&quot; -- yes, you get twice as many transistors as the last generation, but you can&#x27;t use as many of them at the same time.  You have to keep some of them turned off.  But turning off SRAM means lost data, so &quot;dark SRAM&quot; is useless -- unlike, say a &quot;dark vector unit&quot; or &quot;dark floating point unit&quot;.<p>DRAMs can optimize the entire process for just one job -- the 1T1C access gate -- to keep leakage at bay.  Or if all else fails, just refresh more often, which hurts standby power but isn&#x27;t a meaningful contributor to active-mode power.')
