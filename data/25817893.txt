So I really meant &quot;one language&quot; in each category. Obviously there has to be a language to generate machine code, and then another higher-level language on top of that, and so forth.<p>The world is better off with fewer rather than <i>more</i> languages for obvious reasons. I never really considered the industry to be a fragmented mess until &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Rust&quot; came along. That was the straw on the camels back for me where I just said: &quot;Ok please stop, you aren&#x27;t helping.&quot;')
