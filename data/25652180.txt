Luckily, nobody died. But that happens all the time.<p>Presumably, a self-driving car will drive slower in adverse weather than a human might, as well as being able to control the car if it hits an ice patch better than an untrained human can.<p>Also, the car can notify other cars on the same road of the ice patch, instantaneously.')
