(Celsius * 9) &#x2F; 5 can trivially be rearranged to Celsius * (9 &#x2F; 5)<p>You can implement this as a fixed point multiply by the constant 1.8.<p>You are already using base 10 fixed point, so it simply becomes a multiply by 18, which can be simplified to a few shifts and adds:<p>(Celsius &lt;&lt; 4) + Celsius + Celsius<p>Don&#x27;t forget to add 32 and the algorithm requires a 16bit shift and three 16 bit adds.')
