Millions of shares floating, disinformation campaigns find their fruit in people who don&#x27;t do their research. Shorters can cover their shares a few thousand at a time, cause the price to rise a bit, then do a touch of market manip to bring it right back down.<p>Rinse and repeat over a few weeks and the positions are clear. It&#x27;s expensive because there&#x27;s lots of interest but the amount of float is allowing massive under-the-radar moves. Very soon people lose interest because there won&#x27;t be much in the way of massive gains anymore<p>The fact that the price keeps picking back up after every single dip means only one thing. There&#x27;s still massive pressure going on. If this market were rational, it would clear. It&#x27;s not clearing. No way GME is worth $360.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the HODLers, the only thing that would drive the price back up would be news stories piquing interest. That&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re seeing here. It&#x27;s picking right back up because the people the shorters wanted to sell, didn&#x27;t.')
