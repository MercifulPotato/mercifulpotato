If you have, for instance, a big pile of near identical Lenovo M78 small form factor desktops  (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lenovo.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;desktops&#x2F;thinkcentre&#x2F;m-series-towers&#x2F;m78&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lenovo.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;desktops&#x2F;thinkcentre&#x2F;m-series-t...</a>), it&#x27;s easy to swap parts between them.<p>If you have just one unit and a failed power supply, instead of swapping in an ATX power supply you can buy in any local PC repair shop, you have to order the custom weird power supply online and wait for it to arrive. Or if you have a failed fan, maybe it&#x27;s a standard 60mm or 80mm 12VDC fan, but it has a weird connector on it for how it plugs into the motherboard, so you&#x27;ll have to take the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; PC heatsink or case fans you have on hand and splice the old connector onto it.<p>Or if you have a failed motherboard (maybe a blown MOSFET?), but you&#x27;re fairly certain all the other parts are good, instead of getting an ATX motherboard that will work with your CPU and RAM, you need a motherboard for <i>that specific model</i> of Lenovo M78, to match the weird shape and size of the case and rear I&#x2F;O panel, and to match the specific DC power connections unique to that series and model of SFF desktop PC.<p>At least hard drives and RAM are common between whitebox PCs and enterprise type semi-proprietary PCs.')
