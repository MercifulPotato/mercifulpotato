Item(by='SoylentOrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609620628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613326, text='The author specifically calls ML non-human computing and I believe is talking about the advances in ML from a theoretical standpoint. I don’t believe it is possible to lump the human written software used to train models, generate adversarial examples, and perform other tasks on GPUs, as purely non human computing. In fact, a lot of the advances in computing recently are specifically to enable this type of computing to be more efficient: easily parallelize training, analyze bigger datasets, graph databases, and other “big data” technologies.<p>In any case, software notebooks definitely existed before Jupyter like you say (I’m not familiar with Wolf but Mathematica has a similar idea), but I don’t believe they date back to 1996. I might be mistaken. I don’t see the author mention them in the text.')
