Low-end VPSes are cheap ($5 a month and under) but if you have multiple apps (or one big one), getting a decent amount of RAM in a VPS raises the price significantly.<p>Using Linode as a benchmark, a 512 MB VPS is $5&#x2F;mo but an 8 GB VPS is $40&#x2F;mo. But an 8 GB Rasberry Pi 4 is well under $100 with peripherals so after three months it will have paid for itself.<p>This of course assumes:<p>1. that the cost of powering the Pi is negligible\n2. your home internet connection is stable enough and fast enough\n3. your apps run as comfortably on the Pi as on VPS')
