User researchers often run a survey with open ended questions, manually group responses into themes and then turn that into a normal multiple-choice survey based on what gets said most. Overall it can take a full week of work and is pretty frustrating.<p>How our tool makes this process better:<p>- By analysing user votes we surface the most important topics&#x2F;opinions, not just the topic with the most submissions.<p>- You get qualitative input alongside quantitative analysis, making product prioritisation way easier.<p>- By letting users submit new opinions you can discover new insights you never considered before.<p>We&#x27;re in the process of setting up a freemium subscription model. Right now it&#x27;s free to create your first survey [1] and we&#x27;ve got a sample survey going too if you want to just play around with it from a participant perspective [2] (it asks for your email but feel free to put anything in, it doesn&#x27;t verify it).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.opinionx.co&#x2F;sign-up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.opinionx.co&#x2F;sign-up</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.opinionx.co&#x2F;5fc62b9f9891c20db5dc2d14" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.opinionx.co&#x2F;5fc62b9f9891c20db5dc2d14</a>')
