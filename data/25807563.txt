If they have mortgages, they were set by the home price when they bought.<p>CPI is an average. The people who have owned their own homes for years are dragging down the average for the cost of living. You can&#x27;t get the cost of living that they have if you buy today.<p>Averages can mislead. It&#x27;s like the old joke about average income in a room when Bill Gates is in the room.<p>By changing who is included in the average, it might be possible to construct a CPI that&#x27;s more relevant to you?')
