I built it for fun, to get better at GSAP, and to test the waters for my video renderer service for Glitterly.<p>I’m not sure if there is any product-market fit for a tool like this and I have no idea who a potential user who would need this product would look like.  But I came across Pikaso.me and they seem to have some traction for their tweet to image generator, so maybe there is hope.<p>Current features:\n- Paste a tweet url, customise the tweet video with theme, background, animations<p>Potential features:\n- Generate png, jpeg image\n- More themes with your own branding (logo and colors)\n- Anything else? I’m open to ideas &#x2F; collaborations')
