Behavior validation means you check a <i>mock</i> dependency to make sure the right functions were called the right number of times, and in the right order.<p>A stub is just a thing you can substitute for the dependency that knows how to tell the test it’s state, and a mock is a substitute for the dependency that knows how to tell it’s behavior, like which functions are called and how many times.<p>In terms of them being the same thing, they are both types of Test Doubles, so they both fall into a higher level category of “a substitute for a dependency of the system under test (SUT)”. The difference is how they’re used.')
