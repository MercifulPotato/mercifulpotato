Have you thought about this at all? \nDo iPhones have crumple zones designed in? Do they asses performance of the chassis after 30 years of corrosion? Do they operate in 50 degree Dubai or -30 Siberia?\nDo they travel at 100 m&#x2F;h? How many Gs does an SSD (~100) survive as opposed to a human brain (~10)?<p>I am sorry for namecalling, but this post comes across as very arrogant.')
