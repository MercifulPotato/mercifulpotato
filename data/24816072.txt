I&#x27;m a WA voter, but it seems like they use a similar system to OR. When I go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voter.votewa.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voter.votewa.gov&#x2F;</a> and enter my first&#x2F;last name and DOB, I can go to &quot;My Ballot -&gt; Online Ballot&quot; and it gives the following text:<p>&gt;To print a ballot packet, only click &quot;Continue&quot; if you did not receive your ballot by mail or your ballot is lost or damaged. Continue only if you intend to vote this ballot.<p>&gt;Print both 1) Replacement Ballot and 2) Ballot Return Packet.<p>&gt;To view what&#x27;s on your ballot, select the voters&#x27; guide in the navigation menu.<p>&gt;Frequently asked questions<p>&gt;This site allows you to mark, review, and print your ballot materials for return to your county elections office.<p>&gt;Can I just view my online ballot and then vote the paper ballot coming to me in the mail?\n&gt;No, the online ballot should only be used if you want to print, vote and return it. Click on Voters&#x27; Guide in the &gt;left navigation to see what will be on your ballot and to learn more about the candidates and measures.\n&gt;I lost my paper ballot, can I print and return this online ballot?\n&gt;Yes, the online ballot is a great replacement ballot option. When printing make sure to print both the 1) replacement ballot and 2) the ballot packet. Follow the ballot packet instructions and make sure you return your ballot on time â€“ the earlier the better!\n&gt;Caution: If you continue, a ballot previously mailed to you will be cancelled.<p>It is specifically this phrase <i>Caution: If you continue, a ballot previously mailed to you will be cancelled.</i> that is concerning. It makes one think that if I press the [Continue] button on that page, then the ballot that has already been mailed to me will be automatically canceled. Can you confirm that that is not the case, and if so what is your evidence?')
