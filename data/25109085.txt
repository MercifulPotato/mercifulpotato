There is discrimination, real and pretty strong. But on the other hand it&#x27;s rational to discriminate - if a group of traditionally dressed roma is entering a shop, you&#x27;d better bet the security guard will follow their every step without even bothering to be subtle, and that he&#x27;s doing this from experience. And walking around in roma neighborhoods as a foreigner is a _very_ chancy activity. Nobody local will even cry for you if you get robbed.<p>The main reason for this state of affairs is roma&#x27;s traditional reliance on internal law and complete disregard for outsiders and their laws. Coupled with this is a tendency to just not apply morality to whatever you do to outsiders. This makes it very very hard to change their ways from outside - even 40 years of communism barely made a dent. Best strategy I know of is to make sure each individual has full protection of the host nation&#x27;s laws and support mechanisms, and that they know it.  This makes it possible for them to disregard internal laws with less fear of being ostracized. It&#x27;s a slow strategy, but I know of none quicker.<p>And to end on a brighter note, in the next elections I&#x27;ll be voting for an independent, who is the newest rising star of local politics. He&#x27;s a gypsy.')
