The initial disclaimer is, given that this is &quot;non-material cultural heritage&quot;, it&#x27;s hard to be sure about details; however, just for some incomplete (from what I see - I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t even mention Ukrainian or Russian folk music at all) summary of what <i>is</i> known, see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Polyphony" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Polyphony</a> (based on this, polyphony existed for sure at least before year 900). For some especially exotic (for &quot;us&quot;) stuff see e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qnGM0BlA95I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qnGM0BlA95I</a><p>Now to get closer to answering your actual question: from what I heard from some researchers (for whom visiting remote villages is part of their work), in shortest words, I understand people who were surrounded by songs all their life would &quot;feel what is missing&quot; by ear, and join with their voice to &quot;fill the gap&quot;. Expanding a bit more on that, basically among every local community there were some people that were better at singing compared to the others. And singing tended to be <i>required</i> in some form, as part of various rituals (e.g. marriage, death are moments in life where you can be pretty sure there was some accompanying community ritual; and moms would shush and lullaby their kids even just for practical reasons). So it was more or less unavoidable to be familiar with singing to some extent. Now, as to the specific harmonies used in the modern sea shanties scene, I don&#x27;t know enough to be able to say whether any of them are grounded in harmonies actually used on ships - that&#x27;s not an area I&#x27;ve ever researched.<p><i>edit:</i> Two more things: (1) higher layers of society tended to be derogatory towards the culture of the lower layers (I guess somewhat necessarily in order to differentiate and maintain status), so a lot of what you learn about history of music tends to be just about the music of the nobility, which often was just a small percent of the population; (2) also, singing is actually very close to speaking and shouting (see e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TYO_B5Nj8QY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TYO_B5Nj8QY</a>), so it&#x27;s not hard to imagine singing in general might be <i>at least</i> as old as speech itself...')
