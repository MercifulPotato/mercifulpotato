Item(by='credit_guy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608138788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435681, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not sure how the author puts a value on someone else&#x27;s preference for a view. This seems paternalistic. The view out the window of your home has a significant impact on your quality of life.<p>The author is a bit facetious. It&#x27;s not the emotional value of the view, it&#x27;s the market value of their real estate. If you have a house worth $1 MM with no above ground subway in front of it, and then one day they build such a subway and the market value goes to $800 k, then you just lost $200k. It hurts your pocket, but it sounds better to say it&#x27;s your emotions you really care about.')
