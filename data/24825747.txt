I can go there, hand over the watch, go to another shop for groceries or something and return after 10 minutes and they&#x27;re done.<p>If Apples products are designed that way, there is no reason why it could not be the same (at least for batteries). Watches have usually the same constraints: Water tight, less&#x2F;no screws, small, intricate.<p>Of course, lithium batteries are more expensive, but that&#x27;s it.')
