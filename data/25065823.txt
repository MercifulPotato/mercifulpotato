I can&#x27;t imagine a future in which YouTube just ceases to exist. The company has already become tied to the livelihoods of so many people, and has spawned too many significant subcultures.<p>It&#x27;s a strange feeling to be alive just after all of the significant technology companies were created and started to gain traction. YouTube has only existed for fifteen years, but it might continue to exist for centuries. The demand that has arisen in people to watch videos online is probably not reversible so long as maintaining a video streaming service is still physically possible. If not YouTube, something else would probably fill in such a void if it ever appears, barring the Apocalypse.<p>It gives me a lot of conflicting feelings. Twenty years ago,  few people would have known they wanted the unique content that YouTube offered that wasn&#x27;t available at the time, like livestreamers or swathes of content about every single plane crash or minor video game mechanic that can be talked about. But now, thousands have become hooked on them. I can&#x27;t remember the details, only that I&#x27;ve watched them at some point. I wonder where the time would have went if we were not enterprising enough to invent big data and portable streams and engagement metrics. And for me personally, I can say that I &quot;like&quot; a lot of content, but I&#x27;m reasonably certain that&#x27;s the kind of thing some portion of drug addicts would say about their habits. Not much of it actually helps me.')
