Bitcoin is traded around as bitcoin to speculate that it&#x27;ll have future value upon a traded upon nationalized currency. Commodities, while do get traded, are eventually consumed outside the investment market. You might trade and hold corn on the market, its end goal is to end up (consumed) as doritos or cornbread. Or iron gets consumed as steel for a car. The end goal of trading bitcoin ends up to be continously traded for a direct return on investment in the future. This is partially the issue with the housing crisis. Houses were constantly market traded without being consumed. Both in home investment speculators, folks that just bought the house to flip it the next week without ever living in it (a paper in florida at the time did an article showing a lot of homes in neighborhoods would go through about 6 owners in 2 or 3 years before someone lived in it right before the bubble burst) then there was the investment vehicle constant trading of the mortgages themselves. That was a twofer of shit hitting the fan.<p>Anyways yea, not harping on you too much for semantics but the rabid crypto fanboys(not calling you one) really fuck up their terminology and understanding of basic economics.<p>Hey, wait a second, isnt McAfee supposed to eat his dick since bitcoin didnt hit the million mark?')
