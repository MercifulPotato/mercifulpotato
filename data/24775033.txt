That does not prove what you claim at all.<p>2.) Also notably, neither study nor wiki claim that both brothers had equal resistance to cold.<p>3.) Lastly, Wim Hof claim is not so much that &quot;gradually increasing exposure&quot; makes him better at cold, his claim is that he found breathing techniques and has batter control over body functions. That may or may not be bullshit, but again, study is not disproving that.<p>Here I am going to quote exact same study:<p>&gt; Core temperature decreased in both subjects with a smaller decrease (−0.18°C) in subject A compared to subject B (−0.40°C). As the accuracy of the measurement is ±0.1°C and due to the small range within core temperature is held, we interpreted the difference of −0.22°C as physiologically different. There was a clear difference in cold sensation and comfort between both subjects. [...] Furthermore, subject A reported that he was comfortable with these temperatures during the entire experiment, whereas subject B felt between uncomfortable and very uncomfortable. Cold exposure slightly increased heart rate in subject A (baseline: 46 beats&#x2F;min versus cold: 52 beats&#x2F;min), whereas it slightly decreased in subject B (baseline: 51 beats&#x2F;min versus cold: 47 beats&#x2F;min).<p>tldr; some physiological responses were different and one brother felt uncomfortable while the other felt ok.<p>Edit: here is direct link to study quoted on wikipedia: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4094425&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4094425&#x2F;</a>')
