I would guess 3nm makes more sense from a die size perspective. I imagine Zen 4 on 5nm would be the same as Zen 3 except with 16 Core and the same amount of cache, since the L3 Cache are now shared.<p>But the problem isn&#x27;t so much with the Core Count but the TDP per Core. Imagine it is 3W per Core, 128 Core gets to 384W. And that is excluding the IOD.')
