Can&#x27;t you do both and use the strongest available guarantees that are applicable to a particular set of data?<p>Sure. The amnesiac property just doesn&#x27;t add a lot of security on top of full disk encryption. If you have an encrypted USB stick that contains an amnesiac OS and $TOP_SECRET_DOCUMENT, the information that your adversary cares about is the document. If the adversary somehow breaks the encryption, they still get access to the document, regardless of the amnesiac property of the OS.')
