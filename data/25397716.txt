The whole point is to shake the foundations of your principles, and make you doubt yourself.<p>Corporations that control 90% of the internet, and therefore public discourse, are hiding behind the technicality of being private entities, and therefore can enforce whatever rules they want. This can&#x27;t really be disputed, but it&#x27;s obviously unethical, and obviously used in bad faith. They are no longer just companies, but quasi-states.<p>Some people saw this coming in the early 2010&#x27;s, but no one really cared. We saw people&#x27;s indifference to being tracked by these companies and governments with Snowden&#x27;s leaks. We saw the transformation of Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter from supposedly &quot;open platforms&quot; to editorialized publishers, and arbiters of truth.<p>This is exactly what we all signed up for, without caring about the consequences. This is only going to get worse.<p>Some people have called for a decentralized internet, where there is no overlord, but truly open platforms. That&#x27;s the modern counter-culture, or modern activism. Decentralization won&#x27;t solve all our problems, but it would make it easier to work on them in good faith.<p>Things I&#x27;d like to encourage, from a pragmatic view:<p>- Stop using the corporate internet.<p>- We must hear people out, even if they&#x27;re wrong.<p>- We need to remove the addictive and exploitative systems currently ingrained in social media design.<p>- Move from a perspective of &quot;us versus them&quot; into a mindset of compassion for others who have valid grievances that are not being addressed.')
