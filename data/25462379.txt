Or just look at the math (pulled from google&#x27;s nutrition facts):<p>Eat two cups of cooked white rice, ~412 calories, 316 g.<p>A day later with the same starting conditions, eat 316 g of butter, or ~2,265 calories. I bet you&#x27;re going to feel way more full after eating the same &quot;amount&quot; of butter vs rice.<p>As for 500 calories of rice vs 500 calories of butter, hopefully someone else can chime in with references, but again, do the experiment for yourself: how soon after eating an entire meal of rice vs butter do you find yourself getting hungry? This is complicated by what kind of macro ratios a given person&#x27;s gut is used to, but generally, I find myself ready for more after the rice much sooner.')
