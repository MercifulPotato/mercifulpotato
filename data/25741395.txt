It&#x27;s really a bi-directional multiplexed messaging channel, not a pure strict hierarchical relationship, and many client&#x2F;server dependencies can go both ways over the same connection, at the same time. You can even run an ssh that opens tunnels in both directions, then tunnel X and http connections over that.<p>Once a connection is established, it really don&#x27;t matter which end initiated the connection (or how many links and proxies and tunnels there are along the way) -- you&#x27;re just sending messages both ways.<p>&quot;Client&#x2F;Server&quot; is an over-simplified way of describing what&#x27;s possible.')
