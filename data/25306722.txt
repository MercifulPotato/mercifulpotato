Item(by='morelisp', descendants=None, kids=[25307058], score=None, time=1607110793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306532, text='If you can&#x27;t do much, it shouldn&#x27;t be much code, so coverage should stay high.<p>I used to be of the &quot;70% is good enough&quot; school, but I found that as I wrote better programs, I also achieved better test coverage. Not because I was writing more tests, but because I was choosing core designs with fewer edge cases, simplifying my error handling with fewer reachable paths, and admitting I might as well just crash in more cases. So now my line&#x2F;branch coverage is more like 95-100%, but my code is easier to read and I write _fewer_, mostly functional&#x2F;behavioral, tests. Most lines I don&#x27;t reach are fatal errors, and most fatal errors are the only statement in their branch.<p>Code you can&#x27;t reach from test cases isn&#x27;t a sign you should write more tests, it&#x27;s a sign you should remove that code from the program.<p>Today I view 90-95% really as a baseline, and focus more on path coverage (most standard tools are quite bad for this still) and edge cases in data (e.g. denormed floats or different kinds of invalid data I want to make sure stay invalid) that don&#x27;t affect coverage one way or another.')
