First of all, the article is almost 10 years old and references data from 1999 at the latest. But most importantly, it uses common nutrition weasel words like &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;good for you&quot;, which are not supported (in fact, CAN&#x27;T be supported) by the study.<p>It is a huge leap to go from &quot;there&#x27;s less Vitamin C in this supermarket carrot&quot; to &quot;you will get fewer diseases and&#x2F;or live longer or better if you eat carrots from soil 100 years ago&quot;. The former is a claim about vitamin content. Easy to measure and write a paper about. It is another thing entirely, and totally outside the scope of a paper about mineral&#x2F;vitamin content, to claim that eating modern carrots actually results in <i>worse health</i>. That claim is (fortunately for &quot;nutritionists&quot; and &quot;functional nutrition&quot; people) never actually backed up by any science whatsoever. It&#x27;s the same with grass fed beef and all the other &quot;organic&quot; stuff - they are never actually connected to better health outcomes and they never live up to the wild claims made by journalists and bloggers.')
