It&#x27;s also a social network, an issue tracker, a workflow management system, a code review tool, a wiki-builder, a frontend for your CI, and plenty more.<p>If github disappears tomorrow, all the code will be safe and decentralized already, yes, but most of the workflow of the software world would be significantly stunted for a good while, because everyone would need to migrate to something else (like GitLab) and then take the time to rebuild all of the data and flow that is on Github but isn&#x27;t captured within the actual git repository.')
