Things where all you want is a relatively basic connection between two electrical components.<p>I carry a stock of ESP32&#x27;s at home for stuff that falls into a domain where this might be useful, especially if this has the ability to convert a given signal into a stream of MQTT messages.  This seems marginally easier than firing up a new esp-idf project (although that&#x27;s possibly because I haven&#x27;t built up the muscle memory to have the right GPIO incarnations stored).<p>The code export is probably the killer feature here, so when you get to the point where working in the GUI is limiting, you can export it and switch to editing source code.  I don&#x27;t have a Mac handy, I&#x27;m curious what the export looks like.  Is every card a different file?  Is there an event loop that &quot;listens&quot; for these events?  Or does it just generate a big main function?')
