Cigarettes were known to be harmful since the 1890s, and the government didnt do anything about it until 1964.<p>Regulation can be successful, but at best its slow and incremental, and in the long term corporations will weaken and subvert them. Just having a system which incentivizes good behavior in the first place would be better than trying to regulate bad systems')
