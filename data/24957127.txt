For example, a famous result [1] showed that testing whether a given number is prime, actually CAN be done in efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time), unlike integer factorization (that we know of).<p>Some discussion of why some believe factoring could be easy can be found here: [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AKS_primality_test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AKS_primality_test</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;79366&#x2F;evidence-for-integer-factorization-is-in-p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;79366&#x2F;evidence-for-intege...</a>')
