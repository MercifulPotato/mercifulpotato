While there are disadvantages with respect to the latter, being able to write code on the Pi vastly simplifies things compared to microcontrollers.<p>It is also worth noting that a fully equipped Pi can cost significantly less than $200.  Everything that you need to add to it can be salvaged e-waste: discarded USB power adapter, old keyboards and mice, lower capacity SD cards, as well as televisions are things that are often discarded in working order.<p>Edit: for clarification.')
