Then, because of the default iTunes settings, launching a media file for playback would always initiate a process of importing that file into the iTunes library. Whether or not the user cared about creating or maintaining such a library.<p>Whenever installing iTunes, for myself or others, I am careful to fine-tune the system&#x27;s file associations, and even more importantly, I make sure the iTunes prefs are in line with what the user would expect&#x2F;prefer.  Especially the settings for &#x27;copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library,&#x27; and &#x27;Keep iTunes Media folder organized.&#x27;<p>With those two settings unchecked, the contents of the iTunes library are not duplicated or socked away in an obscure location; they&#x27;re exactly where the user wants them to be. And the files don&#x27;t get renamed. That&#x27;s the way the media library feature behaves in the current version of VLCâ€”and there&#x27;s no reason to assume that VLC will change this behaviour, to be more like the iTunes default, just because it may change its GUI front-end.')
