In fact I didn&#x27;t even take a position on the matter. I specifically asked _you_ about _your_ beliefs.<p>&gt; So in that case why not pick the one that actually makes sense according to the motion of the solar system? If I have to make a choice between two equally logical solutions, I always pick the most beautiful or most symmetrical. Why not?<p>Why not? As I pointed out, there are other considerations at play like morning&#x2F;evening light.
