And the have the audacity to suggest these western platforms are &quot;banned&quot; in China when they chose not to operate there legally. That&#x27;s peak exceptionalism mindset. It&#x27;s time to separate trade with imperialism and stop expecting companies to execute foreign policy. US companies are already foreign policy instruments subject to National Security Letters, that&#x27;s enough. &quot;<p>The argument is interesting. You may be right about non-western markets. I am not an expert so I won&#x27;t address it.<p>&quot;Global market =&#x2F;= global values and global trade is not trade between peoples but governments&quot;<p>And not both? It is possible that I am misunderstanding the statements. Could you elaborate?<p>&quot;CCP wants to import phones, NBA games, blockbuster films not western values and certainly not western propaganda.&quot;<p>We all want things. But NBA, films, and values ARE all part of western propaganda. CCP may think it is cutting all the dangerous thoughts from the movie, but all it does is creating a streisand effects resulting in bans on number 8 and winnie the pooh. On the flip side, why does US have to comply with Chinese propaganda efforts?<p>&quot;No one expects US soybean farmers to bundle exports with bibles, but somehow expect Google or Facebook to operate in China without complying to censorship laws that domestic companies must adhere to.&quot;<p>I genuinely do not understand the comparison. Could you provide a different example?<p>&quot;And the have the audacity to suggest these western platforms are &quot;banned&quot; in China when they chose not to operate there legally.&quot;<p>Well, both statements are true are they not? They are banned, because they do not adhere to local laws. Stuff in Turkey is banned too and they are called out on it. It is not audacity to say water is wet.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s peak exceptionalism mindset. It&#x27;s time to separate trade with imperialism and stop expecting companies to execute foreign policy. US companies are already foreign policy instruments subject to National Security Letters, that&#x27;s enough. &quot;<p>I am stealing &quot;peak exceptionalism&#x27; phrase. I agree with the sentiment, but it is not realistic based just one the comments you made at the very beginning ( &quot;Multinational companies conforming to local laws and customs is status quo.&quot;).')
