If you start at a very high dosage, you will mobilize all the stored calcium in the gut and vascular system.  It has to go somewhere.  As some who is currently at 52k UI&#x27;s per day, I can say that if I started at that level I would have damaged myself in many ways, not just kidneys.  I started at 2k per fatty meal&#x2F;snack and worked my way up over a few years.  The purpose has been to de-calcify my vascular system and gut.  I can actually tell when I am near the limit as it induces pain.  I back down a few thousand IU&#x27;s for a couple weeks, then keep working back up.  When I first started, I could not exceed 4k per meal without getting blurry vision.  Now that happens around 54-56k.  I probably will not go much higher.  I do not suggest doing this unless you have a good reason to do so.  If you must do this, then be sure to include K2 MK-7 and magnesium for each dosage.  I am not a doctor and this is not medical advise, not to mention, only a small percentage of functional medicine doctors use this method of de-calcification.  For people just wanting enough 25-hydroxy to fuel their immune system, 2x the RDA is probably fine assuming normal renal health.  BTW, measuring 25-hydroxy has little value unless you know your kidney health, as that is the not the final stage of the hormone.')
