That authorization is usually more &quot;expensive&quot; rather than &quot;difficult&quot; to acquire so a lot of the smaller shops have struggled to secure it.<p>I think one way to read the decrease in volume is that - yea it&#x27;d sure be nice if six fewer dealerships had access to this information, so why don&#x27;t we make sure they all get forced to close their doors because the automakers don&#x27;t want competition - there would be fewer in count, but that doesn&#x27;t really speak to the security of that data at all (additionally, most of the sensitive data you probably care about doesn&#x27;t appear to be on the table for this bill - specifically telemetry about driving habits doesn&#x27;t appear to be under consideration)')
