Admittedly, that&#x27;s because I am of the 80 percent of people who get decent health coverage via my employer.<p>Do you still have coverage if you get laid off? For how long? For kids too? That’s what freaks me out about the US system, is that it’s tied to employment to a high degree. \nThis pandemic must have led to tons of people being laid off. Many of them got laid off and <i>then</i> they (or a family member) got Covid. How long after being laid off are people normally covered? How long is coverage for family members on the employee’s insurance after they are laid off?<p>I wouldn’t say care is <i>better</i> under my single payer than it is for US white collar employees, but I assign a <i>massive</i> value to the fact that I don’t worry about insurance or money if I get sick, have a child, or have a chronically ill child.')
