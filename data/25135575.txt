Flash was a notorious attack vector for all manner of malware and viruses. RealPlayer (first released in 1995 so it&#x27;s not so much the &#x27;modern&#x27; Internet that sold out) was <i>literally</i> spyware for a while. I&#x27;d love for DRM to vanish entirely and for me to be in control of what my browser is doing, but failing that utopian ideal I&#x27;d <i>much</i> rather have DRM be a first class citizen in the browser that means users don&#x27;t have to open up gaping holes in their security to watch and listen to the latest cat videos and true crime podcasts.')
