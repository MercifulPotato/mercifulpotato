So it seems in the Jalopnik case, Tesla missed disabling those features while it was in their possession, so did so after they sold the vehicle to a dealer <i>and</i> after the dealer sold the vehicle to a private party?<p>Then it would seem to me, in the Jalopnik article that Tesla was just in the wrong in this instance. They could have disabled the feature when they sold the car, but once they transferred title of it and it retained that feature, they should no longer be able to revoke that feature.')
