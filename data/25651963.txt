From my findings, the grass is not greener.<p>I&#x27;ve been using WinPython for a few years. It&#x27;s the closest thing to &quot;just works&quot; that I&#x27;ve found, and non-programming colleagues have been able to install it successfully.<p>Because it works almost like an isolated &quot;container,&quot; it&#x27;s also possible to test your code on a clean install of WinPython to make sure it will run on someone else&#x27;s computer before you share it.<p>I don&#x27;t know the technical difference between WinPython and a true container, but you can have multiple WinPython installs on one machine, and they don&#x27;t interfere with one another, or with a pre-existing mainstream Python installation on the same PC. So you can share your stuff without worrying about screwing up someone else&#x27;s stuff.')
