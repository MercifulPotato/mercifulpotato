DEEP STATE PEDOPHILES have infiltrated our government and want to have free reign to access pictures of you infant child in the bathtub for their disturbing desires. Pedophiles managing social media servers want to be able to snoop on the private media of anyone their sick desires are targeted at.  They want to be able to blackmail your children who have taken selfies in the mirror into sending them more child pornography or even committing espionage against their own parents or families, consolidating power for the secret cabal of pedophiles at the top of our institutions.<p>Say NO to pedophiles, keep encryption secure!<p>Any politician who supports these measures should get the question, &quot;Why do you support this legislation, are you a secret pedophile?&quot;')
