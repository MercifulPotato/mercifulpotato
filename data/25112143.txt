JPEG is for continuous tone images. PNG (and GIF) are optimized for line art.<p>PNG replaced GIF because the latter was patent-encumbered at the time, only supported 8-bit color, and in later revisions only support 1-bit alpha transparency. PNG supports 24-bit color plus an 8-bit alpha transparency channel.<p>WebP, first released in 2010, allows for the replacement of GIF&#x2F;PNG with lossless encodings and lossy encodings for replacement of JPEG. And unlike JPEG, WebP supports alpha transparency as well.<p>10 years sounds like more than enough time to optimize previous work and publish it. It&#x27;s not like existing WebP or even new WebP images will suddenly stop working.')
