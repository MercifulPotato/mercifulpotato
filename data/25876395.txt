This prevents tools like asan or valgrind from detecting memory related bugs. It caused my team a lot of grief, to the point that we regretted the choice of using glib in the first place.<p>I am not sure why there is a memory cache in the first place. Malloc may have been slow in the 90s, but these days there is no reason to cache and reuse allocations.<p>Itâ€™s also a major security risk, since it nullifies hardening measures from the standard library, as we have seen with openssl&#x2F;heartbleed recently.')
