Personally I&#x27;d much rather take a 15 minute train (leaving every 15 minutes) to the centre of London then a connecting tube (total £25ish, 30 mins) than sit in a taxi for <i>at best</i> half an hour, and often much longer, at a cost of £50-£100.<p>Of course, depending on timetables&#x2F;connections the train could be a bit slower, and if one has a lot of luggage door-to-door by taxi might be better. But for me it would be hard to argue that fighting through London traffic in a car or taxi is superior to public transport.')
