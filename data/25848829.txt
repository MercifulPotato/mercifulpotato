Something to support some a new piece of design from the design team, or save hours or days of dev, or remove the need for hacky &#x27;fixes&#x27; that could be done cleanly with modern browser support.<p>So off to analytics they would go. &quot;X thousand users are using IE8. We&#x27;re converting at X%. Removing support for IE8 just means these people will shop elsewhere and we&#x27;ll lose X thousand pounds a month. You need to support IE8.&quot;<p>Believe me, I wish it was as simple as saying developers are &quot;part of the problem,&quot; because it would be an easy fix. But try selling that (without a huuuuge struggle!) to the person who holds the purse strings.<p>Sadly the new features usually only came on new sites. It&#x27;s much easier to push it through when you&#x27;re not cutting off an existing income stream.')
