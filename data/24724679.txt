I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I think it is likely that some components, such as SOM or WPS, contain very little or no Microsoft-developed code. New features developed after OS&#x2F;2 2.x were developed solely by IBM, without Microsoft involvement – Microsoft was only involved in OS&#x2F;2 1.x (and possibly earlier stages of 2.x development.) There might also be some components which IBM licensed from third parties (non-Microsoft), but they are likely just individual DLLs or drivers, easily separated from the rest of the code.<p>I think the real problem here is IBM, not Microsoft or any other third-party. There are significant sections of the OS&#x2F;2 code which are only under IBM&#x27;s copyright, and there is nothing legally stopping IBM from supplying the source code to those sections, but it doesn&#x27;t want to. Also, regarding the sections co-owned by Microsoft, I wonder what the story is – did IBM ask Microsoft and get told &quot;No&quot; (or &quot;Yes&quot; but only under non-viable conditions)? Or did IBM never even bother to ask Microsoft about it? I have no idea, but my gut tells me the later may be more likely than the former.')
