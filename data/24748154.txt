If you are into numerical computing, you will quickly understand this is crazy cool.<p>A consequence of that is composability. Most libraries are pure Julia, small, and play nicely with each other.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.julialang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;11634" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.julialang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;11634</a>')
