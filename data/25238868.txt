Other companies it was talk to recruiter, phone screen with manager, and then virtual onsite interviews. Hiring was either not team specific or the recruiter helped manage the process (ie: what does this role actually need). Very clear directions on what type of questions will be asked, format of the interviews, what to prepare for, etc. Amazon the recruiter just told me to look on the job site and then, despite me being clear, applied me to the wrong role. Then got one of those automated coding exercises despite 15 year experience and an internal referral. Wasn&#x27;t hard but it also pointless since the coding exercise was for the wrong role. Finally got a phone screen and they asked me nothing but pedantic college textbook questions for 40 minutes. Recruiter provided no warning for that.<p>edit: You could blame the recruiter but every other company had a well oiled machine for their recruiters. So even if they provided only generic information there was still a standard process for what they provided.')
