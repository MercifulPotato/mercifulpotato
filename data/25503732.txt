Things are so broken, that such legislation is impossible to imagine today.<p>IANAL, but theoretically, yes, we have the ability to pass and enforce laws that would protect individual and societal rights. In practice, you would need a complete overhaul of both the rules and incentives of the current political system; however, such an overhaul would need a fair and just system to be here in the first place, otherwise it&#x27;ll just entrench the authoritarianism and&#x2F;or refuse to enforce the good parts, put in there only as platitudes.
