The textual representation isn&#x27;t stable IIRC, and it adds a step in between you and your already lumbering backend.<p>Ultimately the C++ API isn&#x27;t too difficult to <i>use</i> but LLVM mandates a fairly hardcore level of C++ knowledge to play with it&#x27;s internals.<p>Quick Tip: if you&#x27;re thinking &quot;Holy shit how do I get from [complicated] all the way down to IR instructions&quot; lower the big thing to a something simpler so you can reuse the code to generate IR from that - for example, a foreach loop is expressible as a for loop under the hood, now you only have to be compile for loops. This would usually be done in the AST itself.')
