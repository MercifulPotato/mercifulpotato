Ubuntu LTS releases are supported for five years -- Centos is for ten years.<p>2. FreeBSD updates are typically easy to perform, and the new system is not that different from the previous one.  Things are where they used to be and you configure it the same way as you have for years. With Centos, there was a migration from yum -&gt; dnf.  With both Ubuntu and Centos the init system has changed from sysv -&gt; upstart -&gt; systemd.  The default network configuration on Ubuntu has been replaced with netplan.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is that there is significantly more churn in Linux distributions and vastly less churn in FreeBSD.  This could also be seen as a lack of progress, but I don&#x27;t think that OP sees it that way.')
