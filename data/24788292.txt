Preventing total&#x2F;nuclear war between major power is the goal. Border changes are (were) the way conflicts escalated into the great wars.<p>This why &quot;aggression,&quot; the one international &quot;law&quot; that is taken seriously basically means border violations. The few non voluntary border changes since the late 40s (eg crimea, the west bank) are (despite generations) not recognized by the UN.<p>All the low power UN institutions cloud people&#x27;s understanding of the core. The core is the UNSC, non aggression and a few other principle&#x2F;institutions designed to prevent (basically) the US and Russia&#x2F;USSR from destroying the world and the cold war cold.<p>It&#x27;s not even designed to do last minute conflict resolution. It is designed to take the motive&#x2F;gain out of war. The lesson is how major war has been avoided for 75 years largely because we can&#x27;t go from pretence (China&#x27;s terrible crimes in Xianjing) to war. Pretence will always exist. Major wars are preventable.')
