If anything, we <i>know</i> that it will work without much fuss. Most of the issues you describe no longer exist anymore.<p>60 miles in 5 minutes is far slower than 400 miles in 5 minutes. Even better, you can consistently go from 0-100% and not 10-80% or whatever. It also scales to larger vehicles, something that simply won&#x27;t work with batteries.
