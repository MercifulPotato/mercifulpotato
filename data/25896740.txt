You are trying to solve a social problem via technical means, and that generally does not work.<p>Spam&#x2F;scam email isn&#x27;t a great parallel: that sort of thing is a more-or-less anonymous party intruding into someone else&#x27;s life in order to try to sell them something or steal something from them.  Blocking that kind of communication is the correct solution, and that&#x27;s what success looks like.<p>Getting people to have nuanced, respectful conversations online is a completely different thing.  If you get to the point where your best option is to block the other person, or moderate&#x2F;delete their posts, that&#x27;s a failure, not a success.')
