Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=[25843641], score=None, time=1611122837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841599, text='I was using data in the abstract.<p>AskHistorians is still a niche sub for history nerds, and is well run, like most of the niche subs. I don&#x27;t disagree, reddit is my goto for niche topics.<p>But if you look at all major country subs, or major subs such as politics, news, world news, etc., all are badly run, with a hard bent to the left.<p>&gt;  It sounds a lot like your actual complaint here is that you don&#x27;t like perceived persecution of your personal politics, and if moderation doesn&#x27;t touch that then you have no problem with it at all.<p>Ah, how nice to toss baseless allegations at me. For one, I do stand aligned with most subs&#x27; political views. But I also stand for letting the other side state their views politely without demagoguery. I do not agree with subs brigading users who come from a different political shade, and have even taken the hammer from the mods for pointing out their hypocrisy in implementing the same. It doesn&#x27;t take an idiot to see how neutral country subs have been taken over by a lot of far-left or far-right premium accounts, presumably paid for by party funds (I know a bunch of r&#x2F;uk mods who are part of Momentum, the far-left branch within Labour, for instance). There isn&#x27;t a place for centrist leaning folks on reddit anywhere on the main subs.<p>Not to mention the effective dictatorships that mods run, regardless of political leaning: you call out a mod for partiality and&#x2F;or bias or bad behavior, instaban.')
