And media, Spiegel being one of the most outspoken, created enough pressure tp force that order. Not that overall quantity was an issue, so. But all people saw was shortages. There were no delivery schedules published, so that played a role. But I would have expected some more investigation and research.<p>Then thr EU ordered more, being under fire, and that let to a temporary shutdown of the plant and even more severe shortages.<p>Nobody is thinking about that. Instead, the Spiegel is using this to push an agenda against von der Leyen. I&#x27;ll not defend her, she should never have gotten the presidency (EDIT: become head of the Commission) but what is going on now is just cheap propaganda. And definitely not helping in any way.')
