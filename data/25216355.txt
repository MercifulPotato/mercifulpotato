Most of your tickets were still in the queue - and no one has gotten to them yet. Some other tickets were closed in error because it looked like the issue was resolved - as your original ticket had mentioned there was an unban.<p>As for the initial unban, a bug had caused the &quot;successful appeal&quot; macro to apply - but it did not actually unban your account. Hence the confusion.<p>We are definitely working on improving this and the experience - and I&#x27;d like to apologize for the quite honestly shitty experience you had. 2020 has been a wild year for us, and we are still playing catch up operationally on some things - with the rapid surge of usage on the platform.<p>Unfortunately the people handling these appeals don&#x27;t have all the information necessary to explain exactly why you were banned - and as a general policy we try to keep those exact details under wraps to thwart attempts from people to try and reverse engineer &#x2F; circumvent our anti spam. (Of which there are many, so... so many people trying to do this.)<p>We are working hard on improving our process around this - but it&#x27;s a rather gargantuan effort. From both the improvement of automation and tooling, and also staffing in general. But we are actively working on it - and a lot of my day job is to make sure we are handling these kinds of cases in a timely manner and also making sure nothing slips through the cracks due to a bug like your tickets have.')
