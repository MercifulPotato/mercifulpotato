There&#x27;s a bizarre ideal here of the selfless internet &quot;Mother Theresa,&quot; who exclusively works on open source projects and only shares things with the world out of passion.<p>You could spend 3 years compiling research on an extremely valuable topic and publish it for free...but if you put a newsletter sign-up form on the page, somebody here will complain about it.<p>Strange, considering HN is hosted by an entrepreneurship incubator.')
