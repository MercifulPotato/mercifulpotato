It doesn&#x27;t have any notion of the server side beyond that which html has: URLs.  As such it is attempting to say within the original model of the web: a hypertext architecture with REST&#x2F;HATEOAS as the bedrock.<p>It isn&#x27;t a complete framework in the flavor of unpoly, and so it won&#x27;t have the expressive power of unpoly in many cases.  That&#x27;s an intentional tradeoff based on the core motivating concept of the library.<p>Which is fine: different strokes for different folks.')
