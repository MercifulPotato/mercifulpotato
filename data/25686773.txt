I don&#x27;t see any compelling argument why the actions of the Russian government shouldn&#x27;t land them in the same boat<p>Decades of sanctions in those countries has never led to the kind of political upheaval you&#x27;re calling for, while causing several hundred thousand deaths. Why subject Russia or yourself to that fate.')
