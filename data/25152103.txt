Are these states or counties that CL doesn&#x27;t scrape? It would be nice to have a breakdown by jurisdiction.<p>Also, by &quot;case&quot; do you mean &quot;opinions&quot;?<p>Full disclosure, I&#x27;ve written and contributed to several scrapers for CL, and if there&#x27;s a large source they&#x27;re missing I&#x27;d like to know.<p>Note that the CL opinion number you&#x27;re quoting doesn&#x27;t include orders from Federal courts that are in the RECAP collection, which accounts for several million additional opinions.')
