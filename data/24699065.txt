I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible but 132 mentions is not a lot. And it&#x27;s not as if no one is fighting you for these Elixir jobs, quite a few people still want these jobs.\nIs Elixir still being chosen for new projects by startups or is it all python &#x2F; go &#x2F; rust ? The numbers for Elixir are very low.')
