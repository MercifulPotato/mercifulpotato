I&#x27;m sure you realize that there is full modern UI support in any reasonably up to date Smalltalk implementation, it even includes mouse and keyboard input support.  If you mean accessing data from the filesystem, yes that can be done as well.  And guess what, there is even network support.<p>That said, if it comes down to more OS specific stuff, then yes, you may need to do more work.  Squeak&#x2F;Pharo very directly support loading external modules (platform specific code written specifically to a VM-specific API) as well as a reasonably competent FFI implementation.  I have less knowledge of other implementations but I&#x27;m sure something similar is also available.')
