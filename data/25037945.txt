Not saying this as a libertarian or any kind of principled statement, simply looking at what happens time and again. We need to switch to 401(k)-style DC plans or something similar where the funds have to be contributed <i>today</i> and are beyond the reach of politics.<p>The incentives to game the system are just too strong. Whether incorrect discount rates, systematic underfunding, whatever, people always treat the pension assets as a &quot;big pot of money&quot; for today&#x27;s emergency, and use it for the pet project du jour.<p>I even see this at my condo association. We have a replacement fund to stay on top of long-term replacement liability. We can&#x27;t even balance that. What chance does a large government, with many stakeholders, have of getting this right?')
