(8000 bytes per second) The companding was actually a very good use of 8 bits per sample for voice, introducing little artifacts except at high amplitudes and the low pass filter. Nowadays I find it ridiculous mobile networks feel it&#x27;s still necessary to compress the audio further - 64Kbps is nothing on modern mobile networks, ie VoLTE etc... WB-AMR is definitely an improvement with it&#x27;s 16Khz sample rate and a bitrate lower than that of G.711, but mostly not supported between different mobile carriers...')
