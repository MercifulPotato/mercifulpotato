The plugin will work on behalf of the user, compared to current moderation which acts on behalf of the platform.  Different users can select either different moderators or different settings for the same moderators.  Moderating could be a mix of AI and human flagging.  Moderating could also include more editorial work such as suggesting people to follow.')
