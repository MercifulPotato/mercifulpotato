Not even under Bochs, Qemu with a perfectly setup VM with PCI under w95 or w98, with both VGA drivers tested: Cirrus and UniVBE.<p>Flash will follow the same path, but unlike those pesky Direct Draw spin-o-rama games, Ruffle works with ease and back in the day you could play swf embedded videos in a video player with a library. So, stop whinning. We, the older abandonware gaming users have it worse, far worse.<p>ScummVM may support that w95 game one day, but today it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Oh, and for Sure Scummvm in a near future will make standalone SWF games playable.')
