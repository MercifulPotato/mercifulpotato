Item(by='RandallBrown', descendants=None, kids=[25995812], score=None, time=1612219062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994200, text='Former Microsoft employee that worked on MyFordTouch for a little while.<p>&gt; Rumor is Ford outsourced to Microsoft who outsourced to someone&#x27;s cousin who wrote it in Adobe Air or something<p>That&#x27;s actually pretty close. From what I understood Microsoft and Ford worked pretty closely on SYNC and that was a large success. Ford came back to Microsoft to have them do Sync 2.<p>Microsoft gave them a quote saying it would take $X and Y time. Ford said it needs to be cheaper and faster. Microsoft told Ford &quot;We can&#x27;t do that, here are some of our preferred contractors for Windows Embedded, maybe they can.&quot;<p>Some time later Ford came back to Microsoft saying &quot;Please fix this&quot; and that was around the time I joined. I actually heard a Ford VP say &quot;This is the worst quality problem we&#x27;ve had in my time at Ford.&quot; He had been there during the Firestone tire debacle. (He was talking about cost in lost sales, obviously iPods not working wasn&#x27;t as bad in the grand scheme of things as cars rolling over.)<p>The &quot;backend&quot; of the system was written in C++ on Windows Embedded. The user interface was written in Flash with some insane stringly-typed interface to talk back and forth with the C++ layer. And that&#x27;s how I became an action script developer at Microsoft for a (very) brief time.<p>iPhones worked decently with the system. Android barely worked at all (Ford didn&#x27;t care much about that at the time). Windows Phones actually worked pretty well since all the employees at the time had them and that&#x27;s mostly what we&#x27;d use for developing.<p>It was the worst job I&#x27;ve ever had.')
