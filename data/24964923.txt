I bought a Pilot Metropolitan and I&#x27;ve found it to be an improvement. However, I still have not seen another in the wild.<p>Err, &quot;an improvement&quot; probably needs clarifying, though. It moves across paper much more smoothly than the ball point pens I&#x27;ve used, and I find reloading the ink to be enjoyable (I&#x27;ve also gone two years without the pen disappearing into the void, something which has never happened for me when using disposable pens).\nIt does seem like fountain pens require heavier paper than ball-points, though. Maybe it&#x27;s the ink I bought, but trying to write on the standard lined paper used in schools leads to a lot of smudges and bleeding ink. Standard weight printer paper is fine, <i>unless</i> it was left out on a few humid days.')
