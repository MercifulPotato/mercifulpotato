Modern web browsers turned out to be a great application runtime and the Web turned out to be a great delivery platform. Nowhere else in software engineering would you see so much resistance to a perfectly good tool.<p>Maybe the problem is that it&#x27;s <i>too</i> good: people and organizations end up producing &quot;web applications&quot; instead of &quot;web sites&quot; just because the technology is so readily available and so widespread.<p>If there&#x27;s one thing to complain about, it&#x27;s that sites don&#x27;t gracefully degrade when JS is disabled.
