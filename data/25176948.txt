I&#x27;ve expressed my fanatical hatred towards the modern web. And I&#x27;m not sure when or how it happened. Every website I open comes with a &quot;compressed&quot; javascript which is several megabytes. And yes, having a good internet is a given in my case and it has nothing to do with that. Truthfully I have no issues with images on the web that are several megabytes. A good comparison in my view is the nautical mile vs statute mile: they are both called &quot;miles&quot; and they both measure distance, but this is where the similarities end. All that javascript(regardless of which &quot;modern framework&quot; we are talking about) eats your CPU time for the sake of flashiness and makes no real contribution. All the spinners and preloaders these days have less to do with transitioning effects and more to do with hiding the bloat that the web has become. I&#x27;d be much happier to see a blank screen for 20 milliseconds and fully rendered content a few milliseconds later, rather than a grey page, with 20 different empty containers, filled with preloaders and waiting for 10 seconds for each of them to load, while that eats up one of the cores of my CPU. While I abhor javascript as a language, I don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s usage to some minimal extent but at this point, if you are using anything less than an 8-th gen i7 with at least 8gb of ram, the web is pretty much unusable. That is absurd considering that the web, by design, was meant to be a simple and fast way of transferring documents. Hence the reason why I ended up making this[1]. Now that I opened it, I realize that I&#x27;ve messed up the favicon and it&#x27;s larger than the rest of the content. Apart from that, this does serve the purpose of &lt;250kb with moderate interactivity...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rorigami.site&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rorigami.site&#x2F;</a>')
