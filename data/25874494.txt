I know that makes it seems like you&#x27;re having to pay for the trip, but you were always having to pay.<p>Agreed, but people work more like this:<p>1. I already paid for my car, so I use it kind of for free, except gas.<p>2. I have to rent a car for $50 a day to go hiking, mmm, that&#x27;s an extra $50. Maybe I&#x27;ll do something closer to home in the range of my EV.<p>Also don&#x27;t underestimate the convenience of leaving from home at any time in the day or the night and returning there vs driving to get the rental car, go through the paperworks, and again when returning it. It can easily add a couple of hours of friction.')
