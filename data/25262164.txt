It&#x27;s way harder.<p>By the time SpaceX was founded, we&#x27;ve been shooting comnercial rockets into space for half a century, and had flown humans to the moon multiple times. Some application of modern technologies allowed to do the next logical step, a cheaply  reusable first stage (expensive reusable space systems existed for decades, like the space shuttle).<p>Fusion is nothing like that.<p>We can reliably blow fusion-based nuclear bombs. That&#x27;s mostly it. We don&#x27;t have a reliable reactor that would run any close to breaking even (a fusor does not count). We have no experience burning the plasma for more than a few hours, before losing it to internal instabilities. Certainly we have nothing similar to commercial energy generation furled by fusion. A plethora of approaches exist because no common design is known to reliably work.<p>This is not a moment for a SpaceX. This is not a moment for an Apollo effort. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s a moment for a Manhattan project type of effort. We still seem to know too little to spearhead an <i>engineering</i> effort.  I&#x27;d be glad to receive a qualified refutation of my points.')
