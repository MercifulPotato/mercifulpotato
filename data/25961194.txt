Why can&#x27;t the database be updated ~instantly though? Is it just because of legacy systems that handle settlement in periodic (daily?) batches?<p>Also, couldn&#x27;t a broker eliminate this risk by just making assets &quot;unavailable to trade&quot; until they&#x27;ve been settled? Granted, I understand why brokers wouldn&#x27;t want to do that under normal circumstances, but it seems like something they should be able to enable when liquidity becomes a problem.<p>To me, &quot;Your cash can&#x27;t be spent yet because the TSLA sale you just made hasn&#x27;t settled&quot; would seem a lot more understandable than &quot;We&#x27;re halting GME purchases&quot;.')
