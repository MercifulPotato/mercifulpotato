(Which I attempted to cover in my 100k estimate anyways, though you&#x27;re free to dispute it). Off-the-shelf servers will implement it as an option if you want to turn it on, some clients will support it, and for the rest, status quo should hold? Not for some - e.g. firewall manufactures will presumably have to care - but the vast majority I don&#x27;t really see being negatively affected by the existence of this standard.<p>Speed increases will presumably be consumed by continued bloat on part of publishers, as has historically happened in all tech innovations. Which might argue that it doesn&#x27;t matter regardless and no optimization is ever useful, but that&#x27;s both defeatist and ignores companies who do care (e.g. CloudFlare), for whom 4% probably matters now and will matter still in a decade.')
