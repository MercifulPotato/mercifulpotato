But for the rest, yeah, it&#x27;s incredibly tough.<p>A talk I watched recently by Ijeoma Oluo made a point I had never considered before: statistically, most people refer friends, and most friends are of a similar background, race, culture, gender, etc. It&#x27;s not intentional- people aren&#x27;t going out of their way to only refer people like them- but it&#x27;s measurable. And those referrals are more likely to be hired (they&#x27;re good people, that&#x27;s why they were referred!)<p>Which means referral bonuses have a perverse incentive of making a company less diverse.<p>I don&#x27;t even have a good answer to what to do about it, because you&#x27;re right: referrals are a great way to hire good developers. It&#x27;s just got this big worrying downside that leaves me bothered.')
