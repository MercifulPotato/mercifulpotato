I see it as the back-end of the phones of my family though, calendar&#x2F;contacts sync, auto picture uploading (which you can view on a map even), sharing files within the family, of-site backups for everyone. I&#x27;m just waiting for NextCloud Talk to support federation so I can talk between servers (I say family but it means different families, in my language there is a word for just parents and kids and when you also include more (&quot;gezin&quot; vs &quot;familie&quot;), not sure what to use, but we have multiple domains and servers (all in my basement though ;))')
