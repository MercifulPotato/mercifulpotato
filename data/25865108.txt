We all can surely think of reasons why someone would do that <i>currently</i> with the benefit of conversational ambiguity. And I see no evidence that any of those reasons would go away by making the request for &quot;friendship time&quot; or whatever explicit.<p>In fact, since narcissists clearly exist, adding that level of explicit request to casual conversations could easily make people more mendacious. Compare current blow-off of, &quot;Yeah, narcissist, maybe we can get together for a beer if I ever get a break from my job,&quot; to the explicit, &quot;Yes, narcissist, I agree to Zoom twice a month.&quot; Nobody&#x27;s going to want to do the latter, but the narcissist will certainly make the request so an explicit lie is now required in return.')
