Anything in vi that involves counting some number is usually faster with normal keys or the mouse. For example moving down 20 lines is way faster with the mouse, you just click. With vi you have to count the lines in your head - better hope you don’t lose count half way because two lines blur together. With lines you can use line numbers and mental arithmetic, but not really for any other number+noun combo.<p>I recognise there are other better ways to move around but they too often have drawbacks, like moving somewhere with ‘&#x2F;‘. You have to parse the line you want to move to for a unique string that’s close to where you’re going. Then you have to scan over all the text in between to make sure it doesn’t occur too much there.<p>Maybe I’m still just doing it wrong.')
