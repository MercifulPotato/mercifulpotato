It&#x27;s available on Fedora&#x27;s Firefox build.<p>In my experience, it doesn&#x27;t work yet; Firefox can select the IDE window (though you have to select it twice for some reason), and I can see the shared screen on my side (so the Wayland part seems to be working fine, since Firefox can get the window contents), but to my coworkers it appears frozen (they don&#x27;t see any changes I make to that IDE window). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a bug in Firefox or a bug in Google Meet.')
