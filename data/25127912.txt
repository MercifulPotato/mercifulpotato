I actually shipped my first Rust code just a couple months ago and it rarely used lifetimes. There is definitely a learning curve, but that true of any language. Rust&#x27;s insistence on safety makes it less forgiving than other languages, but I think that&#x27;s a plus. We have enough unsafe languages already, and we&#x27;re paying the price for it now.<p>Here&#x27;s a representative example of the code I wrote. This bit is outputting stuff to a file in some binary format: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ValveSoftware&#x2F;Proton&#x2F;blob&#x2F;proton_5.13&#x2F;media-converter&#x2F;src&#x2F;fossilize.rs#L211" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ValveSoftware&#x2F;Proton&#x2F;blob&#x2F;proton_5.13&#x2F;med...</a><p>E: If you want to take another stab, the way I learned Rust was the book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;</a> Actually type out every code example, it will help your fingers learn the &quot;feel&quot; of the language, and give you an opportunity to break things on purpose to test your understanding. Learning something new is always a challenge, but I really do like Rust and think it&#x27;s worth the trouble.')
