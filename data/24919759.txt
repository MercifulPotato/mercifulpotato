The transactional sql or plpgsql surrounding the state makes dangerous operations much safer and clean. Then as you get farther from risky state changes, you get the productive flexibility of less strict javascript.<p>You also get the option of putting complex operations in plpgsql functions when you want them executed atomically without any side effects, corruption, or cleanup requirements when one of the step fails. Your default failure mode becomes &quot;You got an error, everything was automatically reverted, you can safely tweak your request and try again&quot;.<p>Also operations being performed in a monolitic db means that the different pieces of data are much more likely to be loaded in adjacent memory caches and ready to be joined, combined and processed, providing significant efficiency and speed gains.')
