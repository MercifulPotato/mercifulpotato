Try building a prototype and verifying your idea before comitting to it. You&#x27;ll learn a lot about whether your game idea is fun&#x2F;can be made fun, and learn the ropes of your new dev environment in a way that&#x27;ll let you throw away your early code with no regrets.<p>- Pick Unity if you don&#x27;t have experience with either. You&#x27;ll get to results faster, and at solo dev scale, the quality Unreal offers won&#x27;t matter.<p>- If you&#x27;ve decided on a mobile game, do some research on how effective monetization on mobile works, come to terms with how bad the options are and decide if you&#x27;re still into it<p>- Runway seems OK for what you&#x27;re doing, but word of advice: it is mentally taxing to some people to be in financial &quot;freefall&quot;. I know this hit me hard when I made a similar decision to yours.<p>That said, there are a lot of good parts as well. Seeing people play and enjoy your brainchild is definitely more rewarding than working somebody else&#x27;s startup or company, and as a venue for creativity, game development is hard to beat for somebody with a programmer skillset.')
