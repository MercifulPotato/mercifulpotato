The other one is of course Btrfs which was and is the worst of the lot.<p>What was worrying was that the XFS dataloss was due an action totally out of our hands: a power outage at a substation which took out a whole area of the city.  The whole datacentre lost power, and the XFS filesystems on some massive storage arrays were completely hosed.  Just from power loss.  It took days to put it all back from tape backups.  XFS has long been known to have problems with unclean shutdowns, but total loss from a power outage is about as bad as it gets.')
