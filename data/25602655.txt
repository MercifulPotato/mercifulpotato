I love the fact there is a macos app and wanted to give it a shot just for that. Coming from the very unhelpfully named “habit” (that btw costs 3.49 GBP per year instead of everyday’s 29.99 GBP), the features I’m missing are mainly weekly and monthly habits, more colours, health integration.<p>One of the things I haven’t seen much in habit trackers is api access. I was considering building something like simon’s everyday calendar but wanted to be able to hook it up to a habit tracker as it’s too limited on its own.<p>Keep up the great work!<p>ps. A mailing list or rss to keep up with updates would be nice. I don’t think I’ll be using it now but maybe when it gets parity with my current tracker.')
