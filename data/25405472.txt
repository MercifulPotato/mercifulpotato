Only the actual driver can be found guilty of speeding, even by speed-camera.<p>-Same in Norway - ticket is sent to registered owner by default, if s&#x2F;he contests the claim, s&#x2F;he is summoned to the local police and shown the photo. If s&#x2F;he claims not to know who drove the car or refuse to identify the driver, the police may investigate if it&#x27;s a slow day in the office - say, call you for a formal interrogation (during which you are legally obliged to provide truthful answers or else get slapped for obstruction of justice), compare the speedcam photo to other members of your household &amp;c.<p>In short, the owner of the vehicle will never be on the hook for a speeding ticket with unknown driver - but is required to assist the police in finding out who the offender is.<p>Two identical twins back where I grew up claimed to have gamed this system on numerous occasions - claiming they couldn&#x27;t remember which brother had driven the car on the day in question.<p>After all, refusing to cooperate is a crime. Not remembering isn&#x27;t.')
