First, maybe don&#x27;t buy companies with bad technical debt, just start from scratch?  And always prefer two experts to 10 juniors in the beginning even if you move more slowly at first. I don&#x27;t know what would have worked well in that particular situation, but if I were to do it again and could influence the original team, I&#x27;d use Clojure. I believe the immutability and control of side effects would have been more of a benefit than types. That was where the real problems came from, dynamic ability to create out-of-sight side effects and alter data in unexpected ways all over the damn place. Clojure&#x27;s immutability plus spec would have been way better.')
