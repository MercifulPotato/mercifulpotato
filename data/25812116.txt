But this justification is weak.<p>I think a developers expectation would probably be that if they upload an app to the iOS store, and explicitly say they don’t want users to be able to use it on their laptop, that users shouldn’t be able to use it on their laptop (either by installing it normally or via side loading).<p>Why should some workaround to this be allowed just because “it’s quite complicated so users won’t expect it to work”. Making things intentionally difficult and unreliable isn’t exactly what Apple is known for... It should either be allowed and simple to do, or not allowed at all.')
