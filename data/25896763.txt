The assertion I took issue with is that &quot;Software architecture probably matters more than anything else&quot;.<p>Yes if you want to deconstruct the term to the point of absurdity, and say that whatever shape your program ends up in implies some &quot;software architecture&quot; then you can say architecture is always relevant, but I would consider it a stretch to say this means it&#x27;s also the number-1 priority in software development.<p>If you read my comment, you would see that I&#x27;m arguing that software results, and software development as a process matter much more than thinking about architecture.  I would also argue that every time the term &quot;architecture&quot; came up in a professional discussion over the past several years, this was a sign we were going down the wrong path.')
