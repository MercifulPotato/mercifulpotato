Einstein actually blundered <i>twice</i>: first by putting in the constant for the wrong reason (because he wanted a static universe), but then taking it out again when it turned out that reason wasn&#x27;t the case (when the expansion of the universe was discovered).<p>If you just look at how to derive the Einstein Field Equation of General Relativity from first principles, the constant <i>should</i> be there; it isn&#x27;t an add-on to General Relativity at all, it&#x27;s part of it. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no way to know from those first principles what its value is. That we had to figure out from observations.')
