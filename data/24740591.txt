This affects the gid on new files that get created (a field in the new file&#x27;s inode).<p>Try these commands:<p><pre><code>    id\n    touch a\n    newgrp cdrom   # or any group other than the first one\n    id             # note that gid is now &#x27;cdrom&#x27;,\n                   # and it&#x27;s also first on the groups= list\n    touch b\n    ls -l a b      # note different group ownership\n    exit           # leave the extra shell that newgrp created\n</code></pre>\nThis can actually save steps if the gid of newly-created files matters because it can avoid an extra chgrp command (which saves typing and avoids a little I&#x2F;O).')
