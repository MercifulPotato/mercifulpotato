There are certainly rent-seeking businesses that do not create value (or net value?). And the majority of businesses are competing in (disrupting) existing markets.<p>Even if they don&#x27;t increase total consumer spending by offering better products and winning market share, they do increase consumer _wealth_. I&#x27;m glad I can buy a 65&quot; 4k TV for as much as my parents paid for a 15&quot; CRT 20 years ago, adjusted for inflation.<p>That&#x27;s the median outcome. Then you get outliers like the sewing machine that greatly increased the productivity of vast amounts of workers, making those users much richer and society wealthier because clothes got cheaper.<p>I find it disingenuous to claim, as the OP did (perhaps unintentionally), that innovators are bad faith actors playing a zero sum game. Surely that&#x27;s the exception, not the norm. Just as there are bad actors in academia and any other profession.')
