My point is that social safety doesn&#x27;t just happen at the government level, and a plurality of entities, including private ones, can be responsible for it.<p>In my country employees at sizeable firms have guaranteed representation on the board of their firm. (30%). Stakeholdership can be enshrined in law. Small and middle-sized business doesn&#x27;t just optimise for profit but employs people for life. (the unemployment during covid did not go past 6-7%).<p>Is that less &#x27;efficient&#x27; in a direct sense? Yes, but it&#x27;s also autonomous and decentralised and robust and gives people real stake in their workplace and control over their life. The perversity of gig work is how it alienates and atomises workers.<p>You&#x27;re essentially building a super fragile system in which benevolent government taxes single minded competitive companies to send checks to fluid workers who get ordered around by an algorithm. That system has so many single points of failure it&#x27;s not even funny. the US, ironically enough, already suffers from a version of this. What happens when the army of Uber drivers and table cleaners doesn&#x27;t get their 2 trillion relief fund because one guy in charge of the entire thing throws a tantrum?')
