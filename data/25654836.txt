It doesn&#x27;t just apply to Uber&#x27;s TOS but almost everyone&#x27;s. We&#x27;ve moved way past the point where someone can be expected to actually have an understanding of the legal ramifications of what they sign. Even if you were to read all of it, hardly anyone can even decipher what rights they actually have if they made it to a court given how counter-intuitive much of it is even to educated people.<p>&gt;If the standard is &quot;well nobody reads those things anyway&quot;, then a lot of mortgages and credit card agreements could be invalid.<p>I think that&#x27;s actually a completely legitimate argument and it&#x27;s why a lot of behaviour in the loan industry can be predatory and why arguments towards &quot;rational consumers&quot; hold little merit. The world has gotten so complex, it&#x27;s left a lot of people behind.')
