Editing stacks is miserable.<p>I would even consider it by design - management doesn&#x27;t want apps to be deleted so easily. It&#x27;s a subtle nudge for a user to accumulate apps, which slowly increase and eat up disk space.<p>The justification is that if no one deletes apps often, the button to do so should be hidden away, so users don&#x27;t &quot;accidentally&quot; delete an app. And the designers are just a cog in the wheel - they listen to the objective given to them by management and do exactly that.<p>This is why you see great designs from apps that are written&#x2F;made by a single person, or from a small team that cares. One such example is IDEs like Intellij - the UI&#x2F;UX design is very much geared towards developers (by developers).')
