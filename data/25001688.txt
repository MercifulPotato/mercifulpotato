Item(by='oarsinsync', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604608452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001008, text='&gt; More people have lost money to Bitcoin scams and exchange fraud (see e.g. Mt Gox) than have lost their money to civil forfeiture.<p>Can you please back this statement up with some citations for this? I&#x27;d be hugely surprised if the number of victims, or even the USD value, of BTC related fraud or foolishness outnumbered state sanctioned theft in the USA, considering how lucrative the theft is for the state, without any need for laundering the ill-gained funds either.<p>At the same time, it would be remarkable if more people lost money, or more money was lost, in BTC than through civil forfeiture, and possibly an ironic statement that exploiting foolishness is the quickest way to riches, rather than deploying state sanctioned violence.')
