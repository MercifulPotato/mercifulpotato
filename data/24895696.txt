He has almost no interest in people except for his partner and sometimes his family, although I&#x27;m not sure if this is self-imposed or he really has interest in these people. He laughs and feels comfortable some times, but he doesn&#x27;t express love, not even his family, except for his partner (sometimes?). He has suffered previously from a psychologically abusive partner who has made him cry and suffer, but during his relation with her, he has not showed any symptons whatsoever, and insists that although he cried back then, he insists he has never felt happiness or sadness.<p>During our friendship, I tried to make him feel better and support him, maybe helping him feel something. The truth is that it ends up being just psychologically exhausting, and despite being the only person he trusted, once I decided to insist in having contact with him, he just didn&#x27;t even try. For long I have thought he was just a jerk who doesn&#x27;t care about people, but your comment makes me wonder if there was something wrong with him (not trying to be offensive, I just don&#x27;t know how to make a difference between being a jerk vs. having some kind of dissability&#x2F;difficulty&#x2F;handicap).<p>Seeing that you (may) be knowledgeable about asperger&#x2F;autism, I wonder what would be your take on this thing.')
