And it&#x27;s an exponential growth; who knows when it might taper off. I certainly don&#x27;t expect it will just <i>stop</i> increasing when we hit that, although maybe it will.<p>Also, 50 million years ago the temperature was that warm but it also happens to be around the time when an impact of a large asteroid caused one of the greatest extinction events in the history of the planet[1]. Not sure if that&#x27;s relevant to the temperature aspect or not. Just throwing it out there.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinctio...</a>')
