For the attacker, it&#x27;s a nice feature: victim could be using SMS, authenticator app or even an out-of-band delivered token book - they are all captured and passed along equally well.<p>U2F and FIDO2 with hardware keys are the only realistic safeguards. On the other hand, I do subscribe to the stated problem, because for most people they are a usability snag. The NFC variant has the potential to address this, though: instead of plugging a key in and touching the blinky button, you just wave your keyring next to the device. Too bad NFC readers are not universally available on phones, tablets or laptops.')
