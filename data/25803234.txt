Item(by='saalweachter', descendants=None, kids=[25803640], score=None, time=1610814348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802808, text='The problem, from HN&#x27;s perspective, is that false positives on GSB hurt businesses a lot more than they hurt users or the internet at large.<p>If I&#x27;m a random person browsing the internet at large, and a website I try to visit gets flagged as &quot;possibly malicious&quot;, well, I probably didn&#x27;t need the information or services on that particular website that badly anyway.  I can find another website that offers the same information and services easily enough.  Meanwhile, if <i>my</i> computer or browser is infected with malware, that&#x27;s pretty bad for me personally.  I could lose money, time and personal data and security.  The potential consequences are bad enough that I really shouldn&#x27;t risk it.<p>On the other hand, if my business is blocked by GSB, that is <i>very bad</i> for my business.  The customers I don&#x27;t lose are going to lose confidence in me.  Meanwhile, the cost to me if I <i>am</i> accidentally hosting malware is pretty minimal.  Even if a large number of my users are harmed by the malware, they&#x27;re unlikely to be so harmed they stop paying <i>me</i>, and it&#x27;s pretty hard for to know where you picked up malware, so it&#x27;s unlikely to be traced back to me.  I&#x27;ve never actually heard of a lawsuit from an end-user against the website they downloaded malware from.<p>A false negative from GSB is a lot worse for internet users than a false positive; an internet business, on the other hand, would prefer a false negative to a <i>true</i> positive, let alone a false positive.<p>Add in that internet business owners (or people highly invested in internet businesses through their jobs) are over-represented on HN, and it&#x27;s no surprise that HN is not a fan of Google Safe Browsing.')
