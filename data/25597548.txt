(although bugs with data-loss happen to them too)<p>The same rules as for all other backups apply: have backups in multiple, independent places.<p>EDIT: Also, if it&#x27;s just a synchronization of the photos from your phone and not an explicit backup, a mistake or fault could also delete the photos on your phone and then it would dutifully sync that deletion to the cloud. sync services != backup for many purposes')
