On the scale of O(100 million) years, expansion at 0.001c is enough to colonize the galaxy.<p>A general purpose von Neumann probe is not that far off. Self-replicating micro-machinery and reasonably intelligent robots already seem on the horizon. Unless there&#x27;s truly some unforeseen roadblock, certainly within 1000 years of current growth. A 1 KG probe at 0.001c takes about 90 gigajoules of energy. On the order of what an Airbus A380 uses at cruising speed.<p>Given lots of patience, and an only slightly higher level of current technological development, interstellar colonization does not seem like an insurmountable challenge.')
