For example, being able to quit a job to apply for others, moving to another town, spending additional time and money on education or similar. These are all options that you  haven&#x27;t got without the four-figure net worth. The real tragedy is that these options seem to be becoming more expensive or scarcer. Many are still better than an iterated lottery, but the (perceived) decline in optionality may be worthy of some sympathy.\n(Completely agree on Vanguard.)')
