Major chunk of population of Kerala and Tamil Nadu don&#x27;t have a caste related surname. It doesn&#x27;t make them ineligible for caste based reservation. Because the point of the reservation is to level up these communities from the descrimation they faced for hundreds of years. Just changing the caste name doesn&#x27;t automatically level the playing field. It helps. But they need more support as well.')
