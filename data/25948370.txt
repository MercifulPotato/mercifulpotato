I think there&#x27;s a non-insignificant amount of &quot;investors&quot; who have tossed paltry sums at $GME with no plans on making a return.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d have done the same, but I don&#x27;t do any form of stock trading so I don&#x27;t have accounts on any platforms to do it. I&#x27;ve done the same with various crypto shitcoins and made a few bucks off throwing $50 or $100 at something I don&#x27;t expect to ever see return on too.')
