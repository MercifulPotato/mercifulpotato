In other words, money is backed by some commodity that has intrinsic value.<p>Recently, there has been a debate about applying Regression Theorem to Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin.[1] Since Bitcoin (for instance) is not backed by any commodity, it appears to fail the definition of a currency according to the Regression Theorem. Others hold the view[2] that Bitcoin does fit the definition as it is at once a payment system and money, with the source of value being the payment system.</i>')
