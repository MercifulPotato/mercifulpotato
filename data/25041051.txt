Oddly, that was also one of the first clearly counterfeit products I received from Amazon. Order was for some Nalgene lab solvent wash bottles, but the product I received had extremely poor printing for the warning diamond and were unvented. The reason I remember the card was that they offered $20 for a review, and IIRC I paid ~$15 for the product.')
