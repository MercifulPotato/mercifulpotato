Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25034507], score=None, time=1604881560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25028272, text='You&#x27;ll have to provide material scientific evidence for every one of the claims, otherwise, though there&#x27;s a ton of truthiness in there, it&#x27;s also a lot of pop psychology.<p>Many of our greatest leaders exhibit a lot of those traits (though not the existentially negative one&#x27;s i.e. they are only motivated by their own power etc.).<p>&#x27;Looking down on others as incompetent&#x27; is not a negative sign if said individuals are incompetent.<p>&#x27;Interrupting&#x2F;speaking over others&#x27; is in most cases just a sign of possibly poor communication, and frankly in many cases warranted. Just because you are &#x27;speaking&#x27; does not give you the right to monopolize someone else&#x27;s time with your thoughts. Some people, myself in included have difficulty &#x27;getting to the point&#x27; and I&#x27;m used to leaders interrupting me, it&#x27;s fine.<p>&#x27;Pontification&#x27; &#x27;Telling Stories&#x27; - often is at the root of positive charismatic leadership. Plebes want to believe that their jobs have a higher purpose, a &#x27;mission&#x27;, they generally want the koolaid so long as it&#x27;s not too out of hand.<p>&#x27;Chaotic Climate&#x27; - again, some systems work better when they are in more or less permanent chaos or in an ambiguous state. Not &#x27;panic&#x27; obviously, but in entrepreneurism chaos is often the defining quality of the situation, those that can&#x27;t live with that may want to work elsewhere.<p>&quot;Appears unsympathetic to othersâ€™ concerns&quot; - sorry - again, one person has absolutely no material right to require that some other person is sympathetic to their concerns. Of course a sympathetic leader makes us &#x27;feel better&#x27;, but most mature, senior workers who have emotional maturity could care less if their bosses are &#x27;empathetic&#x27;. If management isn&#x27;t listening because they are &#x27;wrong&#x27; or &#x27;missing something&#x27; then that&#x27;s altogether a different stories.<p>Politically astute leaders take this one to the bank - appear to be &#x27;empathetic&#x27; when really it&#x27;s just an infantile, placating emotional display that has nothing materially to do with anything. They do this because a lot of emotionally immature people respond to it.<p>&quot;Disdain for human frailty or weakness of any kind&quot; - this one I think  is adding to the list of &#x27;made up&#x27; &#x27;unscientific tropes&#x27; amended to the list by someone because they think leaders ought not to be this way. I think it&#x27;s misunderstood. I think most, even &#x27;tough guy&#x27; leaders are fine with weakness, it&#x27;s a matter of how it&#x27;s displayed. You can cry, but not on Television for god&#x27;s sakes; it&#x27;s not the &#x27;crying&#x27; that&#x27;s weak, it&#x27;s the evocation of sympathy or empathy from others, a form of emotional grovelling that&#x27;s the issue.<p>&quot;Moralistic whistleblowing&quot; - like shaming, cancel culture? So yes, it&#x27;s possibly a sign of something, but possibly not.<p>I think this is a great article - and all of these things &#x27;can be signs&#x27; of bad leadership but are often not. Every point probably needs a counter point, I think a lot of the behaviours of leaders are misunderstood.<p>I&#x27;ve been very fortunate to have a lot of great and demanding leaders and see many of the supposed &#x27;negative points&#x27; in them, so I&#x27;m wary of promoting such a list without a whole load of caveats and contextualisations.')
