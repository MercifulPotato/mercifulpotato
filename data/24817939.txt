Mozilla is just as guilty as Google. Mozilla has Firefox sync and Chrome has its own sync. This is basically to stop clearing browser data from automatically disabling sync, which most people would want. There are a plethora of third-party tools that allow you to clear your browser data completely if you want. There is nothing stopping you from using them, and you&#x27;d also be surprised how much you can do (including disabling Google Sync) from a simple policy file.<p>Stop waiting on your government to fix things because they aren&#x27;t going to. If you want to fix things, then build your own tools to abstract syncing, bookmarks, and other features from the browser. They exist, whether you&#x27;ve ever taken the time to look or not. Somehow it is easier though for people to simply say... The government will fix it for me, rather than fixing things yourself.')
