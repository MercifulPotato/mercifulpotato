So a female surname would be Isaeva, but the male Isaev.<p>English writers that want to avoid what happens to a Russian family name when involving several members (it&#x27;s complicated) take the smart way out and do it like this:\n&quot;after the Isaev family relocated&quot; [1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theamericanreader.com&#x2F;4-june-1855-fyodor-dostoevsky-to-maria-dmitrievna-isaeva&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theamericanreader.com&#x2F;4-june-1855-fyodor-dostoevsky-...</a><p>But the reviewer at the guardian (or is it the writer of the book?) goes for &quot;When the Isaevas moved&quot; when writing about husband and wife. If you can&#x27;t get the surnames right, how much trust should a charitable reader extend towards the review?<p>If you stumbled across &quot;Hemingway she wife&quot; in an essay on Papa&#x27;s love life biography, instead of &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s wife&quot; how much trust would that carry?<p>Source: I first read the D-dude at nine years of age, in the original, and then went back to him on multiple occasions. What a downer. Also, genius. I prefer Pushkin, the only optimist of Russian literature, but you gotta respect Dostoevsky: how much ahead of the time his realism was, and what an influence he left. And then lots of people simply enjoy his work. If you haven&#x27;t read &quot;Crime and punishment&quot;, strongly recommended.<p>As for his love life, I read many opposing viewpoints, but I prefer to limit my judgement to the work, not the person. Too messy. Unreliable sources.')
