I&#x27;m currently desiging and building a system which has a separate MCU just for timing accurate stuff rather than having the burdon of realtime kernel stuff, but I never considered just dedicating a core. Then I could also use that specifically to handle some IO queues too perhaps, so it could do double duty and not necessarily be wasteful. Thanks... now I need to go figure out why I either didn&#x27;t consider that - or perhaps I did and discarded it for some reason beyond me right now. Hmm... thought provoking post of the day for me')
