Every item in the set is high density wood composite and tables are built upon steel structures. They would outlast my children easily if they&#x27;re not abused on purpose.<p>Or my Kitchen, which is again built by IKEA with high density composite and its workmanship made a good carpenter jealous.<p>If you want top of the line items in a category, look for &quot;Stockholm&quot; series.')
