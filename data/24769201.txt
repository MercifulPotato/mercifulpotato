My take was audio quality is WAY better, so if your primary desire is for a speaker it blows the Google&#x2F;Amazon ones out of the water. BUT Siri is less useful so if you want more voice-control&#x2F;smart assistant stuff it feels much more limited.<p>It&#x27;s actually really decent at the use cases it&#x27;s explicitly designed for, but completely falls apart if you have any edge cases. Bear in mind though, these are what Apple thinks of as edge cases like &quot;What if I prefer Spotify over Apple Music,&quot; not necessarily a reasonable person&#x27;s idea of an edge case.<p>I, personally, didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the HomePod and the Sonos 5 though I know people who say the HomePod is markedly better. The Sonos, however, has a line-in and works with an Alexa unit if you have it (though, strangely, it&#x27;s not built in). If not for the privacy sensitivity with Alexa I&#x27;d probably go for the Sonos, but the privacy and integration with the rest of the Apple ecosystem kind of tips it back to Apple for me.')
