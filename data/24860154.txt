Maybe it is slightly outside what would be considered &quot;standard&quot; relational DB use case? My impression of recursive CTE&#x27;s in RDBMS is that if you need speed or any more advanced graph-like features, you should move to an actual graph db. So far I haven&#x27;t taken on any projects that warranted that, though it does interest me.<p>Either way my intention here was to simply provide an example of a real-world recursive CTE use case.')
