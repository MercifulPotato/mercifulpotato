It&#x27;s revolting.<p>Hmm?<p>Yes, there are adverts on all the podcasts I listen to. Many of my favorites offer members only ad-free versions. Usually I suffer through the ad supported versions because the adverts are easy enough to skip.<p>Some podcasts have too many adverts or annoyingly inserted advertising. Those are pretty 1 and done. No point listening to them.<p>IMO the (current) podcast market is a good example of how we can enjoy content and know the producers are compensated without having to deal with obtrusive marketing crap.<p>It is getting clear some podcasting is getting sucked into things like Spotify, but there is still enough good content I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem.')
