Having been in startup that seriously looked at expanding in the US vs expanding in the rest of the EU (it expanded into the US), I&#x27;m confident to say the US is <i>far</i> more homogenous. Interestingly that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it&#x27;s easier for an EU company to expand the US rather than the EU. But it does mean that EU startups have a much larger bump in the road than US companies when they&#x27;re expanding.')
