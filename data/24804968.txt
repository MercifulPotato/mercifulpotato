In such a position there is a lot of opportunity to attend medical lectures, and also ideally to shadow MDs in clinic, observe procedures, and sit in on case reviews.<p>There are also various 1-2 year MS degree programs, often called &quot;MS in biomedical sciences&quot;, which can function as a bridge into medical careers. Some are designed to prepare for MD or other professional school, while others have a focus on broader background (variety of subjects like anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology).')
