It says to me that we humans are very emotional beings, whether we want to admit it or not. I think many cultures have a tendency to forget that emotions drive our behaviors, or are afraid to admitâ€”feeling about feelings :-)<p>I wish we would spend more time talking about what people were feeling more so than what they were believing. Like you, I know many people whom I admire for their intelligence who seem to have fallen into a deep distrust of many institutions and individuals in society. How we feel can really distort how we think and what we believe.')
