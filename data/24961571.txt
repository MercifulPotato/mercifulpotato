He has a wonderful mind for seeing the politics behind all of the confusion and propaganda from all the factions that formed after the revolution.<p>I have thought about this a lot this year, especially how the bourgeois liberals, who when faced with a choice between a people’s revolution (only half realized when the fascists began to take over) and a fascist military dictatorship, often sided with the fascists.  Those given just enough improvements to their own material conditions no longer saw themselves as exploited by capitalism and largely ignored the working classes.')
