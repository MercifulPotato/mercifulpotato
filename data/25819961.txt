Gas stoves are great because they have none, so any temperature changes are immediate. Anything between the pot and the flame will destroy that advantage.<p>Also, the combustion chamber will have a vent for the exhaust. So I would suspect that it won&#x27;t be any more efficient, except for very small pot sizes.')
