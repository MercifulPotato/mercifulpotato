Better speech. Not banning their misinformation.</i><p>While I agree with this in principle, it assumes a level of reasonableness in the discussion that is simply not there for many people who hijack online forums. They are not &quot;spreading misinformation&quot; in the sense of making factual statements or reasoned arguments that happen to be wrong, and then engaging in a civil discussion about the matter. They are &quot;spreading misinformation&quot; in the sense of shouting over everyone else and not observing any rules of civil discussion. What they say is often not even coherent enough to be worth trying to refute with better speech. The only way to keep the forum viable at all is to ban them.')
