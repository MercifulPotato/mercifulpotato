AWS services are more reliable, less buggy and have more stable APIs than any of the alternatives. Specific services that made a difference to us are Fargate, Spot, Batch, SQS&#x2F;SNS, Lambda, ECR, EFS, ELB&#x2F;ACM, CloudWatch Logs, IAM, Aurora RDS, SSM&#x2F;Secrets Manager, and Step Functions - in addition to EC2&#x2F;VPC&#x2F;EBS, Route53 and S3 that you already listed. Each of these services does a lot to free us up to do more value added domain-specific work.<p>Terraform has emerged as a key tool to manage AWS resources - so much so that it really adds a lot to the value prop of AWS itself. I can do stuff with Terraform that was only aspirational until it existed.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t plan on using on-prem except for niche applications that involve heavy data streams from local hardware. In the time that I&#x27;ve spent with companies working on AWS, I&#x27;ve seen a number of other companies waste lots of time and resources on heterogeneous strategies while complaining about their AWS bill - which was high because someone got so fed up with IT dysfunction, they went and used AWS but left behind inefficiently configured resources that were on all the time. Cloud often ends up being an escape hatch for teams that are not adequately served by dogmatic IT departments.')
