Everyone hates politicians, even if not everyone hates the same politicians, so there&#x27;s some appetite for tech companies favoring speech from one group or another. But now that they&#x27;re wading into the territory of health, they&#x27;re putting themselves into a precarious position, especially if some of their choices on what information they allow the public to see or not to see turns out to be incorrect.<p>Potential legal issues aside, the PR nightmare that would come from this if it turns out they&#x27;ve tried to suppress information that would have saved lives is going to be very ugly. Right now they&#x27;re a spoiled kid eating whatever cookies they want because no one has ever told them no. Whether the stomach ache, rotting teeth, or parental wrath comes first remains to be seen but there will at some point be consequences for this overreach into areas they have no domain knowledge. They of course will act shocked that there is blowback and that their ever expanding intrusion into everyone&#x27;s lives through information control ends up causing them harm.')
