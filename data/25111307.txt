And I want to thank all of the doctors and scientists and researchers involved because they’ve never moved like this, or never even close.<p>&gt; The NIH and HHS have also been working constantly with private industry to evaluate more than 100 potential treatments.<p>&gt; The Food and Drug Administration has swiftly approved more than 130 therapies for active trials; that’s what we have right now, 130.
