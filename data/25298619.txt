And again, &quot;There are difficulties on collecting data and historical reasons that leads to bias in the trained model&quot; is accurate, but it&#x27;s still a total cop-out! There&#x27;s no way Facebook would let results like [0] slide if there were money at stake - they&#x27;d get more training data, or even throw out training images of white faces, if they had to - so why is LeCun defending someone else&#x27;s failure to do so?<p>More importantly, how should that make us feel about the very real possibility of LeCun serving as an expert advisor on, say, police or other military applications of AI? Would he again just throw up his hands and say, &quot;Well the training data consists disproportionately of black faces, so the model disproportionately implicates black people, nothing we can do about it&quot;?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Chicken3gg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1274314622447820801" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Chicken3gg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1274314622447820801</a>')
