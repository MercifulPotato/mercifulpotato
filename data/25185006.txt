If I review the comments that mention censorship, it seems to be a nuanced discussion from a range of political perspectives:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+censorship&amp;ia=web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+censor...</a><p>The reason that some people (like myself, admittedly) are upset about extremist views being censored is not because we agree with the extremist views, but because censorship starts with the views that &quot;everyone&quot; can agree to censor;  communists, ethno nationalists, anarchists; for example, then it expands to suppress religious minorities,  atheists, sexual minorities, racial minorities, etc, etc. Censorship is then used to suppress even the discussion of whether censorship is correctly applied.<p>Once that mechanism is in place, the  censorship inevitably expands to include information that is inconvenient or embarrassing to those who control the censors.<p>Witness the persecution of Julian Assange, for example.')
