The issue here is not that they have a different &quot;scientific model&quot;. They are suggesing giving a different weight to the competing costs of various approaches to covid19. I&#x27;m not sure I agree with them, but they&#x27;re not disputing everybody else&#x27;s science. They&#x27;re saying &quot;look, given what we know now, we think that if you rate the impact of the lockdown approach on poor people, and consider that to be a very important factor, you wouldn&#x27;t see lockdowns as such a good idea&quot;.<p>None of that means that they are denying what lockdowns do, or the problems of a no-lockdown approach. They are saying that given a certain set of weights for each component of the consequences of a policy, we should try to avoid lockdowns.<p>You&#x27;re free (as we all are) to disagree about the weight they choose for each consequence.')
