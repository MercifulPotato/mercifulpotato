I don&#x27;t like to freeload, so I do have a Bronze subscription which includes a certain number of monthly CI minutes for private projects, as mentioned here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;ci-minutes-update-free-users&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;ci-minutes-upda...</a>. But I rarely make use of it.  Also note that there are special arrangements for Open Source projects.<p>I can totally understand limiting the number of minutes available.  It must cost an absolute fortune, and having it unbounded makes it easy to abuse.  Having to pay makes developers have to consider if they really need to go overboard on huge build matrices and limit themselves to something reasonable.  Likewise for constraining the amount of network traffic.  If you don&#x27;t want to blow your budget, then self-hosting is an obvious and easy choice.')
