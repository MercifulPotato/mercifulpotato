People can be nationalists or biased towards group identities with many different flavors. The underlying issue is that people get discriminated.<p>I completely agree.  I prefer &#x27;bigotry&#x27; rather than &#x27;racism&#x27;.<p>Mostly for the reasons you suggest, but also that &#x27;racism&#x27; is a nonsensical term in the context of biology.  Homo Sapiens is a single species.<p>As such, one could be racist against dolphins or dogs or daffodils, but not humans.<p>But we can still hate and be <i>bigoted</i> against those who don&#x27;t look or talk or dress or act like &quot;us.&quot;')
