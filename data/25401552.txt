It works well but has an Nvidia GPU that makes it heavy and I’m getting tired of lugging it back and forth to work (yeah, back in the office now).<p>Before the M1, I was planning to get an Intel MacBook and dual boot Linux on it. But with the performance and battery life of the M1, I’m on the fence. I know Linux isn’t supported natively yet, but I spend most of my time SSH’d into a headless Linux server anyway, or in a local Docker container. I hear Docker isn’t perfect on the M1 yet either so I would probably go all in on the headless server. I also do some React Native dev and the idea of a faster Xcode build is intriguing indeed. Thoughts? Would I be better off with a native a Linux experience or are the perf&#x2F;battery advantages of the M1 worth putting up with Apple’s telemetry, etc?<p>Curious what others have experienced so far who bought an M1. Was it worth the money, and do you have any regrets?')
