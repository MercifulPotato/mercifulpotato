So don&#x27;t be fooled that the censorship is to stop violence, it&#x27;s to achieve political goals, and has been ratcheting up for the past 6 years. Twitter was canceling people for life even for daring to say such crazy things as &quot;There&#x27;s only two sexes.&quot;<p>Cancel culture has been getting out of hand for a long long time now, and people have had all they&#x27;re going to take of it.<p>Now the left has gotten so brazen they&#x27;re conspiring to shut down entire internet companies under these same false pretenses. And you have the audacity to call this &quot;alarmist&quot;. Wow.')
