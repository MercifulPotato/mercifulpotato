Power losses are proportional to current squared, so for a given power transmitted, they&#x27;re proportional to the inverse square of the voltage.<p>We&#x27;re just used to power transmission being AC because with AC it&#x27;s easier to switch large currents on and off, and easier to step voltage up&#x2F;down.')
