This appeals to me.<p>In any company, employee trust is a huge benefit when it works and a huge concern when it&#x27;s missing.  this Gumroad model would require even higher trust to operate so independently and not incrementally add more &quot;check up&quot; meetings and slack etc etc.<p>Can anyone from Gumroad speak to how they built the team?  Hiring some roles from your customer community makes a lot of sense as they already will have some feeling of propriety.  Have there been bad hires?  I guess having everyone on contract makes it easier to move on.')
