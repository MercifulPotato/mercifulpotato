I searched for picture of a &quot;Basketball Team&quot;, and in the team in the first photo there are 7x as many black people as white. An infinite ratio of men to women too.<p>That isn&#x27;t evidence of any sort of discrimination or prejudice. It is due to the rather difficult to dispute fact that for reasons uncertain black men seem to play better basketball. I don&#x27;t even know anything about basketball I just picked a stereotype.<p>I&#x27;m all for investigations; but report back when there is evidence of a problem not evidence of a difference. Differences are routine.')
