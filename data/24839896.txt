The last time I renewed my driver&#x27;s license, it literally took me longer to walk the mile round trip from my office than the time I spent inside the DoL (Department of Licensing here in WA State, USA). We don&#x27;t buy cars very often, but the last time we transferred title was annoying because we had to wait behind one or two others, but it was the usual print-print-stamp-stamp-have-a-nice-day ten minutes once at the desk.<p>OTOH, it probably depends greatly on the office one goes to.')
