I write Go every day, and come from a Python background. I often describe Go as the strongly-typed, more performant version of Python. I say this mostly because my Go code isn&#x27;t too dissimilar from my Python code (structure, naming, packages). But I still drop into Python if I want to do something quickly. I don&#x27;t really know why. Maybe it&#x27;s the Go tooling, e.g. unused variables cause compilation errors, so things like this slow me down. Or maybe it&#x27;s because Python just offers _so_ much out of the box, e.g. all the data structures you&#x27;ll ever need (list, set, dict, tuples), and all small things you take for granted (like writing &quot;is a in list&quot;, which would require a function in Go). The REPL is Python&#x27;s killer feature.')
