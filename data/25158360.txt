Very interesting for home users. I run it on my NAS.<p>It is very important to realize that you can’t <i>expand</i> VDEVS. You can only <i>add</i> VDEVS.<p>This makes expanding storage less flexible than regular MDADM RAID. Going for Mirrors is the most flexible but you lose 50% of capacity.<p>You also get the random IOPs performance of a single drive per VDEV. Sequential performance <i>does</i> scale within a VDEV.<p>You scale random I&#x2F;O performance by adding VDEVS.<p>For home usage, as a NAS, you don’t need to use SSDs for a SLOG, unless you have write-intensive random I&#x2F;O workloads.')
