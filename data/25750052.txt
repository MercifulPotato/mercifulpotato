One of my frustrations with personal finance tools that I have tried in the past is that they&#x27;re really bad at modelling occasional expensesâ€” for example as a low-car family, we only fuel our vehicle once every 4-5 weeks, so some months the &quot;gas budget&quot; goes unused, whereas other months if we take a trip, we&#x27;ll completely blow the gas budget because we fuel up twice or three times.<p>I wish it were possible to &quot;smooth&quot; those kinds of expenses into an average daily amount, but also have a way of indicating that a particular chunk of them should actually be extracted from the smoothing and assigned to a different category altogether (eg, the gas used on the trip should go to &quot;vacations&quot;, not &quot;vehicle&quot;). A similar thing applies with other bursty things like home repair expenses, where I&#x27;d like my Home Depot receipts amortized over a time period that I specify rather than counted right at the moment of purchase.')
