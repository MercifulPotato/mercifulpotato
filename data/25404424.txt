I had to zoom out to get an overview and the legend overlapped with the top left of the table. If it could scale to different sizes more clearly and smoothly that would be an improvement I think. But I understand if you don&#x27;t intend to make changes, and it&#x27;s also great as it is, thanks very much for releasing!')
