Messages went from one node to the other using store-and-forward overnight.  With enough nodes in the right LATAs, you could send messages (e-mail at first, then bulletin board messages) across the entire region.<p>Where I lived at the time, I could make a local call between two area codes in two different states, so my node was very busy overnight relaying all the messages that got bottled up in either state at 300 baud.')
