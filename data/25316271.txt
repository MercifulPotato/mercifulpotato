Totalitarian belief systems that can&#x27;t coexist with others can&#x27;t be tolerated, yes, but it&#x27;s nothing inherent in christianity - yet different Christian denominations spent decades killing each other in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It&#x27;s more of a character trait. Same personality type that was happy to kill all &#x27;papists&#x27; would be a fanatic nazi in 30s&#x27; Germany and an eager killer for Pol Pot.<p>People like that are always going to exist, what happens depends on the reactions of the other members of the same &#x27;tribe&#x27;. If they oppose it nothing happens, if they ignore it or, worse, weakly support it, the situation deteriorates in a feedback loop until both sides convince themselves that everyone from the &#x27;enemy&#x27; camp wants to kill them, so the only option is to kill them first.')
