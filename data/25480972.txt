Which I think answers your objection? If you were in a bad state because your dog died, that&#x27;s completely understandable. But now it&#x27;s up to <i>you</i> to salvage the dynamic, not me, as I already went out on a limb once. If you do that, then the first encounter would be water under the bridge and I wouldn&#x27;t hold it against you.<p>Giving compassion is wonderful, but life is a lot better when you reserve most of it for people who will respond with compassion in kind, rather than milking it for their own benefit and giving nothing in return. Sticking up for yourself doesn&#x27;t mean being transactional--it just means that you extend compassion to yourself as well as to others.')
