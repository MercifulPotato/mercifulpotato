I practically only use the discover panel with a reduced number of lines. It&#x27;s by far the slowest webapp on my computer. Granted, it&#x27;s a 2013 MBP (with 16 GB though), but pretty much nothing else is so painfully slow. It&#x27;s barely faster on a more recent computer (i5-8500 with 32 GB).')
