Because i have yet to see any numbers that aren&#x27;t clearly the result of a massively streamlined SoC. Yes the ARM chip is great, but the RAM is blazing, tiny, and more close to the ARM chip than anything out there for x86, right?<p>I&#x27;ll be interested to see if Apple can keep this up with 128GiB of RAM and a beefy GPU.<p>So far to me M1 is great, ARM is great, but comparing a tiny amount of RAM soldered onto the CPU compared to flexible and huge RAM potential devices seems dishonest. Unless Apple manages to squeeze 128GiB of RAM on their chip, at least.<p>I want to see what my Blender workstation looks like on Apple&#x27;s Architecture. Where i purpose built a huge CPU, GPU,  and RAM for Blender rendering and large scenes. I suspect Apple will start seeing huge falloffs in the SoC design under larger workloads.<p>Apple is dominant in making phones though. And this Laptop is designed like a Phone. So yea, it&#x27;s amazing for that.')
