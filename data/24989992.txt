As a CS researcher, if I want to delve into a new topic (for example, because a specific line of work comes out where I think my research could be applicable) I typically can start by directly reading the paper I&#x27;m interested in, and in the introduction I&#x27;ll find a brief history and some references I need to look at for context.<p>It&#x27;s much better than having to look through all the relevant papers in that topic in the last decades in order because they all assume knowledge of the past ones.<p>Of course, I know there are survey papers, and they can be very useful, but they&#x27;re typically going to be too general and not specifically oriented to what you need to understand <i>that specific paper</i> you&#x27;re interested in. Plus, you inherit the biases of whomever compiled the survey, which in my experience are often significant.')
