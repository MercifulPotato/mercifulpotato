Item(by='upofadown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611317327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870133, text='&gt;Telegram claims that E2E encryption cannot be extended to group chats for backup reasons: to keep the highest level of security, messages from Secret Chats are not stored after delivery. Hence, if a phone is lost, the content of Telegramâ€™s Secret Chats is lost.<p>This sounds like a feature to me. Keeping old messages conveniently available to the user means they are conveniently available to an attacker. This is particularly important on a device like a smart phone that keeps everything conveniently available to the user all the time.<p>This way of doing things does in fact make those Secret Chats more secure than  Signal&#x27;s regular chats in practice.')
