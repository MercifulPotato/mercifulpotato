Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25141251, 25145083, 25140658], score=None, time=1605723502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138719, text='&gt; This logic horrifies me because it applies equally well to wage disparities based on protected classes.<p>I dunno if GP meant to imply that, but this is kinda the key flaw with the &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot; thing. most engineers earn way more than the median income. this is a direct result of existing in a market-based economy where wages are determined by supply and demand rather than some abstract notion of fairness. you can&#x27;t complain that the payscale is different for atlanta vs sf while maintaining that it&#x27;s totally fine for you to make 5x as much as the cashier at 7-Eleven.')
