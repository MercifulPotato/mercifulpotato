There is Ann Arbor but it&#x27;s a college town and not likely what you want.<p>Michigan has over 10,000 lakes. There are lots of parks and open state land. It&#x27;s not just the tourist places like the dunes (where you can take off road vehicles on sand dunes) or rivers you can canoe on camping trips. Not far from me is a dog run (wouldn&#x27;t really call it a park) that&#x27;s over a hundred acres of state land. It&#x27;s a chunk of a much larger thousands of acres section just meant for dogs. Other areas have horse trails and stuff.<p>There is a lot of opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors.<p>This is also going to mean that you aren&#x27;t going to have great public transit in these places. The options are limited because it&#x27;s off the beaten path.')
