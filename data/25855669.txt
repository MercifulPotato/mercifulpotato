Each has a pitcher of water beside the bed.  A fire starts in the wastepaper basket in each room.<p>The physicist wakes up, sees the fire, estimates exactly how much water is needed to put it out, and pours exactly that amount from the pitcher, dousing the flames.<p>The engineer wakes up, sees the fire, pours the entire pitcher of water on it, then refills the pitcher and douses it again to be safe.<p>The programmer wakes up, sees the fire, sees the pitcher of water, decides it&#x27;s a solvable problem, and goes back to sleep.')
