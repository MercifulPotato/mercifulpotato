Before SPDK it was with custom kernel bypasses and fast inifiband&#x2F;FC arrays. I was involved with a similar project in the early 2000&#x27;s. Where at the time the bottleneck was the shared xeon bus, and then it moved to the PCIe bus with opterons&#x2F;nehalem+. In our case we ended up spending a lot of time tuning the application to avoid cross socket communication as well since that could become a big deal (of course after careful card placement).<p>But SPDK has a problem you don&#x27;t have with bypasses and uio_ring, in that it needs the IOMMU enabled, and that can itself become a bottleneck. There are also issues for some applications that want to use interrupts rather than poll everything.<p>Whats really nice about uio_ring is that it sort of standardizes a large part of what people were doing with bypasses.')
