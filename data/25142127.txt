Now, we can range these numbers, then we can remap these numbers back to natural numbers: 1 is first formula, 2 is second formula, and so on. We can produce these numbers with just «next» operator.<p>However, some formulas are incorrect, so we filter out them and then remap remaining functions again: 1 is first correct formula, 2 is second correct formula, and so on. Now, we can produce correct formulas with just «next» operator.<p>However, some formulas can contradict our system of rules, so we filter out them, and remap remaining functions again: 1 is the first correct formula which doesn&#x27;t contradict the system of rules, and so on. Let&#x27;s call them &quot;Lisivka&#x27;s numbers&quot;.<p>So, Godel&#x27;s numbers can contradict axiomatic system, while Lisivka&#x27;s numbers cannot.<p>Do you see the problem?')
