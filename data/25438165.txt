It&#x27;s not like you can get lost in the world like in GTA or RDR, there is no world for you to get lost in. It&#x27;s all smoke &amp; mirrors. Also, pandemic lockdown in my country has left me with plenty of free time.<p>The game offers you three &quot;life paths&quot; at the beginning so after I finished it once I had to see if a different path would be better.<p>Well it turns out life paths change nothing besides the introduction. It&#x27;s still the same dumb game with the same railtracks and the same story. Your choices don&#x27;t matter and you realize that you&#x27;ve been swindled since the promises and descriptions of the immersive and emergent open-world nature of the game turned out to be a bunch of lies.<p>Hearing all the stories about refunds being hard or impossible to execute, one has to wonder if legal action is justifiable here. The CP2077 that CDPR framed and advertised gameplay-wise has very little to do with the end result that they delivered. And I&#x27;m not even talking about the bugs, but the game itself.<p>It goes without saying that I&#x27;m done with them and my intuition tells me that the CDPR brand will be poisonous to a lot of gamers out there after this fiasco. Bugs are one thing, but blatant lies quite another.')
