Because by that token, nobody would ever buy computers, because the money saved by not buying a computer today can go into buying a better computer tomorrow.<p>if anything, deflation is fantastic because it makes you think twice before rampantly consuming shit, which is going to be much better for the environment than the misaligned incentives of demand-side economics.  (not that supply-side is any better).<p>Finally, inflation redirects real returns from the poor to the rich and deflation does the reverse.  Japan (which has had net ~0% official inflation over the last 30 years) has had a stable GINI coefficient; the US has gotten worse and worse.')
