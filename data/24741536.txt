That&#x27;s definitely my only complaint. The dactyl is the absolute perfect keyboard, except for the fact that it&#x27;s a nightmare to transport anywhere. If I have to take it anywhere I carry it in a paper shopping bag with nothing else in it. It&#x27;s not a cheap keyboard either, so getting one for work and one for home is a hit to the wallet.<p>I recently grabbed a keyboardio atreus for travel and laptop use. Not nearly as ergonomic as the dactyl, but still a very nice keyboard in it&#x27;s own right.')
