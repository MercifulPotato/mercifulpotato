Do you have to query all of those things separately for every locality you serve?<p>Honestly, this is why so many big companies still prefer things that HN would call “stupid” like an FTP drop of a file 5 times per day&#x2F;hour&#x2F;etc.<p>Every FTP implementation I’ve ever seen has included either checking the timestamp, timestamping the filename and filtering on that, or moving to an “archive” folder after processing. Most of the API implementations I see ignore the fact that HEAD requests exist, cache headers can and should be used, etc.')
