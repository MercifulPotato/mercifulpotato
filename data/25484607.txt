The only person who comes to a poor end is the savage, precisely because he refused the offer (which Mond envies) of going to the islands.<p>Mond also summarises why contemporary people are so willing to follow visions like ISIS or QAnon:<p>&quot;Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isnâ€™t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.&quot;<p>(NB that BNW was written after WWI, 1984 after WWII, which may, beyond the temperaments of their authors, also explain how the visions got so much darker. Note also that Huxley wrote a much-less-famous utopia near the end of his life.)')
