As a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed grad student, I felt extraordinarily lucky to be there among the world’s top experts. By the end of the week, the experts agreed that it was basically impossible to improve the GPY method to get bounded prime gaps. Fortunately, Yitang Zhang did not attend this meeting. Almost a decade later, after years of incredibly hard work in relative isolation, he found a way around the impasse and proved the experts wrong. I guess the moral of my story is that when people organize meetings on how not to solve the Riemann hypothesis (as they do from time to time), don’t go!')
