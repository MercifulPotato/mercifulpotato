They aren&#x27;t likely to colonize in your wiring, for example, without significant help and ideal conditions, such as a great deal of starting spores all over the wiring and lots of water and a good dose of additional nutrients that the fungus needs to grow.<p>In other words, if you shred your wiring and put it on top of a pile of fungi that are bred to eat this type of plastic, they&#x27;ll probably use rainfall to extend their mycelial network and eat the plastic. But if you just park your car next to the pile, it&#x27;s probably never going to colonize your car and digest its electrical system.')
