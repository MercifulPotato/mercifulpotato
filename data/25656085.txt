Employees at meatpacking plants and Starbucks baristas don&#x27;t get to work outside in the summertime. Children still go to school, their school days are just as long, and they don&#x27;t have classes outside even if the weather allows it. You still have to walk the dog, whether it&#x27;s summer or winter.<p>This is very different in my case (France). In the summer, windows are often open, which suffice to make a big difference I believe, work and home. Never in winter. In summer, half or our work meals are eaten outside or in well ventilated restaurants. Winter -&gt; at most you walk fast 2 minutes to get in a hot building again. Social activites are all closed rooms in winter.')
