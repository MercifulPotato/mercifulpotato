Red Hat still has to release the patches, right?<p>A really big chunk of the world&#x27;s traditionally shared hosted websites run on CentOS, because most commercial control panel packages and hosting automation systems are built for that. A rebadged CentOS is also AWS&#x27;s default distro.<p>Wonder of the hosting industry, AWS included, will build a new stable clone of RHEL 8&#x27;s upstream security patches. There are some big companies, like GoDaddy in there, whose business models are unlikely to accommodate for RHEL support subscriptions.<p>This is truly a bummer, and if someone doesn&#x27;t pick up the pieces and continue offer RHEL rebranded, there&#x27;s no(?) open sauce operating system with a decade-long support lifecycle.  I wonder if this might cause an increase in unpatched servers and appliances when the alternatives offer five years at best.')
