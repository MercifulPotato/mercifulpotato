There were some instructions saying that adding terminal.app to the developer tools pane in security preferences would solve my problem but it didn&#x27;t.<p>Butchering ocsp by fiddling with &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts still didn&#x27;t fully solve the problem: it still takes 200-300ms to start any new binary the first time. But at least it&#x27;s no longer up to several seconds in case of bad networks.')
