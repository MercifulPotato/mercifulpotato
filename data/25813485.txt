Imagine a key that costs &lt;$3... even packaging with a polybag + printed label + padded envelop gets to a cost that has a significant % of the production cost.<p>Next, it&#x27;s features. To stay on par with competition, people expect the same features (see, e.g., openpgp mentioned above - the code currently doesn&#x27;t fit in the stm32l4 flash), both firmware and hardware. As a result we have to look at the latest &amp; greatest micro, but of course that alone has a significant cost.<p>And finally, there&#x27;s the overall viability. We all know that open source projects die without a business model. The numbers in the U2FZero review simply don&#x27;t add up, that was clearly unsustainable and that&#x27;s why we made SoloKeys. A business has expenses other than manufacturing and if you don&#x27;t account for that, the business dies together with your dream project.<p>Anyway, thank you both (and all others) for the great support. One step at a time, we&#x27;ll get to a stronger and eventually also cheaper product!')
