Fujifilm X-A7, Fujifilm X-T200, and Sigma fp are three mirrorless cameras that support UVC. And if you classify action cameras as &quot;real&quot; cameras too, the Insta360 ONE R also supports this.<p>Note that you may have to update the firmware and put the camera in webcam mode to get this to work.')
