When the number of new cases, positivity rates, and deaths in a given region fall below specific thresholds, the next phase of opening up happens in that region.  Then those numbers start to increase, then restrictions start going back in place.  The same as it has been since the start of this pandemic.<p>With those that are the most vulnerable (front-line workers, elderly and health compromised), hopefully the death rate will start to fall as they are getting the vaccine first.  That is what I&#x27;m looking forward to.')
