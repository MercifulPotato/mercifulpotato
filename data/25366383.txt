You have a very significant cost per unit. Not to mention lots of risk if you have any warranties and for your brand.<p>Like if you ship 100k units and they have a critical component that gives out after 2 months due to a bad manufacturing run that&#x27;s a huge cost.<p>You don&#x27;t have that type of risk with software. Software is just way less risky and way more profitable.')
