It&#x27;s pretty great to putter around the city on electric power, almost never swapping to gas unless I head over to the highway.<p>But if I want to keep puttering on EV, I need to charge, and I rent. Thankfully, my city (Boston) has a <i>decent</i> number of chargers. My most convenient one is a couple blocks down the street, in front of a parking meter. The meter is only enforced from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, so I can get a charge for free if I park outside those hours. Sometimes my desire to not give off emissions even when I haven&#x27;t had a chance to do it for free will encourage me to pay $1 or so for the 19ish mile range of a full charge... so it&#x27;s not even a bad rate compared to the price of gasoline.')
