PHP is expensive to scale out. You advertise it as the Facebook killer but how can you kill Facebook with something that can&#x27;t handle more than about 50 concurrent requests per commodity hardware server.<p>- I don&#x27;t really know <i>what</i> it is. There&#x27;s a short video that says you can do this and that but you don&#x27;t show how you do it. In your mind it all makes sense. As someone coming to this repo I read it&#x27;s an OS, then it&#x27;s not an OS it&#x27;s a PHP script with a JS frontend. It uses MySQL and I think MySQL performance and scaling. Not a good experience.<p>- Over the top sales pitch. You claim things that just aren&#x27;t true. You&#x27;re trying to sell it as freedom from Facebook and Google. Yeah I bet it does have many features, but why do I need it? What do I use it for? Why would I use it and not the other thing? Don&#x27;t lie to me (It&#x27;s an OS it&#x27;s not an OS). I&#x27;m a technical guy and I see you&#x27;re trying to blow it up so it&#x27;s bigger than it actually is. Oh you can sign up everywhere? What&#x27;s so special about that? The whole sales pitch it doesn&#x27;t target me. It reads like one big ad of bullshit someone is trying to sell me.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re just too smart for me and I&#x27;m not smart enough. I don&#x27;t want to offend you. I know it&#x27;s hard taking criticism for something you&#x27;ve spent the last 2+ years working on to get smashed in negative feedback because people don&#x27;t understand your vision.<p>The only use case I saw was this yang2020. So ok it&#x27;s script to promote politicians. Should I ever run a political campaign or know someone who does, I&#x27;ll consider it. Right now I don&#x27;t really know what it is you&#x27;ve built.
