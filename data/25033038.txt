Conditional probability is P(A|B), the probability of event A, given that event B was observed. What&#x27;s the probability that I am a magician, given that I shuffled the deck and when you saw it it was still in new deck order?<p>Now certainly, there is an astronomically small chance that this was observed due to random chance. And yet if you observed this, I&#x27;d expect that you would, with relatively high confidence, believe that I stacked the deck.')
