In a competitive environment, those who have no qualms about breaking the law (agreement) are at an advantage.<p>China and other countries are trying to compete with the US economically, and this agreement would provide a way to do that via unequal outrage. US haters are already doing it, condemning the US (even though it&#x27;s been lowering emissions for a while now), and making excuses for China and other major polluters because they are &quot;developing countries&quot;. Meanwhile China is largely immune to internal criticism, and basically faces no meaningful pressure externally (aside from Trump, for other reasons). This would have been bad for the US.<p>Your views on this are emotional and overly simplistic. Grow up!')
