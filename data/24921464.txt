I suspect an entirely different approach is required to supplement&#x2F;supplant the deep learning one and fully autonomous vehicles are still quite some way off.<p>Why is that every time the safety of self driving cars is brought up, people appear to ignore that human drivers are not 100% perfect. There are on average of 104 deaths on the road each day in the US. if we can get that number to 50 people, that&#x27;s a net positive.<p>Self driving cars don&#x27;t need to be perfect, just better than us.<p>So the question shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;are SDC perfect yet?&quot; but &quot;are they better than us?&quot;')
