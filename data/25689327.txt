A few buildings were burned down in isolated incidents during several months of protests across multiple cities. Looting is not well-documented but my friends in Portland didn&#x27;t seem very concerned.<p>The vast majority of participants in the protests following the Floyd murder did not take part in any violence. It is all but certain that the fraction who did is much smaller than the fraction of 1&#x2F;6&#x2F;21 protestors who illegally entered the Capitol.<p>Comparing the one to the other is not justified.')
