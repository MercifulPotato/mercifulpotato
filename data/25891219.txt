They make everyone around them more efficient. BUT people like this are hard to determine with Standard Performance Indicators.<p>Personal anecdote:<p>I had to fight tooth and nail to keep a junior coder in my team because &quot;she wasn&#x27;t performing well&quot;. Yes, she didn&#x27;t commit often and her code quality was average at best. Tasks took longer than average to complete as well.<p>But what she DID DO was keep the two auteur seat-of-their-pants 10x coders in her team focused and on task, made sure to ask the correct questions and had them document their work. She also took over their customer-facing stuff so the socially awkward 10x pair didn&#x27;t need to do that.<p>None of this showed up on standard performance indicators.<p>Now she&#x27;s a team lead at the same company, managing the two 10x-ers.')
