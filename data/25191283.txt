FDA says it to everyone, so all companies in same condition. And they can shift cost to healthcare system and have larger revenue. They probably don&#x27;t mind their pie as a whole being larger, because having revenue of 50 billions and profit of 10 billions is better than revenue of 5 and profit of 1, even though proportionally it&#x27;s the same. All big pharma companies are massively profitable, fx Novartis net income in 2017 $17.8bln on $50.4bln revenue. Pfizer&#x27;s $14bln operating income on $53.6bln revenue in 2018. And it&#x27;s year after year. They really don&#x27;t seem to suffer from those high costs trials. Also, Pfizer reports only $8bln on R&amp;D in same 2018. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27; a lot of inefficiencies in those trials, same as it turned out vaccine could be created in year instead of a decade. (btw, previous large scale epidemic of swine flu was largely profitable for pharma companies).  They just don&#x27;t have incentive to reduce the inefficiencies. \nYou&#x27;re telling it&#x27;s not just US but then you cite high healthcare costs (retail vs large scale trial, definitely can be cheaper at scale), which is much cheaper outside of US. I would be very interested in reading numbers of detailed case study of creation of some real world vaccine&#x2F;drug.')
