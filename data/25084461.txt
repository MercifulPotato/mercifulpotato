I did not attend the graveside service even though it was outside, which is anecdotally supposed to be lower risk than something indoors.  The issue for me is I&#x27;m high risk combined with the fact it&#x27;s possible someone could show and refuse to wear a mask. Even if everyone socially distanced and wore masks, I believe there&#x27;s still a non-zero chance of transmission. Couldn&#x27;t take the risk for myself, much less anyone else I might expose if I were to get infected.<p>To answer the original question I don&#x27;t plan to do anything for the holidays either.  Our activities will be in-home with my wife and myself only.  I don&#x27;t really see that changing until vaccines are ubiquitous and the local R factor is well below 1. Unless the disease is eradicated which in the face of antivaxxers seems unlikely, I don&#x27;t thinks things will ever entirely return to normal.')
