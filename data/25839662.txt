She will be gone either way, so at most it hurts here for a couple months.  This is about my family looking at our last chance for memories. We are sad for us because we did enjoy spending time with her. We are sad for the grandkids that will never remember their grandma. In a couple months there will be no long phone calls. Already she will never again send us home grown pecans (too painful to get out and process them so they are selling this years crop to generic processors). Those are but a few of the things we are going to miss.<p>Note, the above is not a unique case to me, if it was I wouldn&#x27;t say anything as my grief is a private matter. The details are different, but stories like the above happen every day. COVID just made this case slightly worse because it isn&#x27;t safe to make the final visits.')
