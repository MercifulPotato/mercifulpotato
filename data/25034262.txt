What I mean is that you can do that. Set up a license so rich people can’t use it.<p>What I meant is that releasing software under a license that doesn’t reflect what I want and the complaining will just lead to frustration.<p>This seems like a simple problem to solve, just release under whatever license I want. This faker.js project is released under MIT. The author can continue development under some non-OSS license and I think that will make him happier because rich people would stop using it. But I don’t think it will make him the income he wants.<p>I think the problem is that non-OSS licenses will result in people just not using the project, not that rich people will start shelling out.<p>As a small business, I would avoid these licenses as well because having multiple licenses kick in at different levels will be confusing and expensive. I’d rather use OSS or just buy commercial products.')
