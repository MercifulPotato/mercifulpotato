The system that prevents the reversal has a caveat. There MUST be a liquid market for the floating point numbers (i.e. you should be able to exchange it for currency).<p>But that creates a paradox. Why would anyone buy numbers in some &quot;distributed spreadsheet&quot;? Well the ONE and ONLY reason to buy them is if you can use those numbers themselves as currency.<p>Lets summarize. block-chain can only work if somebody buys the numbers for real money. People would only buy the numbers if they are a useful currency (and non-reversibility is a useful property for a currency, so some people determine it valuable and buy it).<p>That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s block-chain in a nutshell.<p>Anything that exists in physical world is absolutely pointless to &quot;put on the block-chain&quot;.<p>*there is one more small use-case that&#x27;s a side effect of block-chain existing. You can prove that a piece of digital information existed at some point in the past.')
