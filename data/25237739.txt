Item(by='normaljoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606574156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236451, text='Clock is a up volt and down volt.  There is a period of time it takes to reach either up or down.<p>If I have to get the clock to reach 2 cores&#x2F;units at the same time that is easier then say 4 cores&#x2F;units. As you increase the clock speed the time to reach all the cores decreases.  So if you are wider you would need to reach more cores&#x2F;units in the same period of time, hence &quot;harder&quot;.<p>EDIT (To make it a little more clear)\nTo make it more clear the voltage change is typically represented in books as a vertical line, but that is not the case it&#x27;s diagonal and fuzzy.  By fuzzy I mean not a straight line but will have some tiny mini downs on the way up.<p>Different parts of the circuits are going to respond to the up or the down.  They are also can vary based on the exact voltage. For example if I have a 5V up one circuit might consider 4.8V to be up and another could be 4.9 or 4.7.<p>Silicon has improved, but there still is limits of scale based on size, volts and timing.')
