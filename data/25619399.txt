Three thoughts:<p>- People concentrate on the tool (technology) vs. goal (value)<p>Let say you need to handle a million users in the past (read: &quot;provide value to million users&quot;). It would be an unbelievably huge effort back in 1996, requiring _A LOT_ of logistics. For most companies, it would take years to reach out to these million users. And god forbid you to need to send out an update.<p>Fast track to 2021. One person can put the code in a docker, drop it in AWS Kubernetes, scale it up and be able to serve million users by the end of the day. (BTW. I am not saying that you don&#x27;t need to do marketing&#x2F;sales and so on, but purely engineering&#x2F;distribution end up being way simpler).<p>Oh... BTW. All these people can use this new service on the go, because everybody has a computer in his pocket with access to the internet. And get update to it pretty much instantaniously.<p>I don&#x27;t care that a new language has curly brackets or a new programming paradigm invented each year or once a decade. I care how much value could be created. And tools&#x2F;languages&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;infrastructure in 2021 provides a way to build way-way more value<p>- You don&#x27;t need to improve a hammer that much<p>The first hammers date back ~3 millions year ago. There were relatively few improvements to it for a looong time. The idea is still the same (a heavy head and a long arm).<p>If the tool works well, you don&#x27;t need to reinvent it that much. You invent other, more complex, and specialized tools.<p>- Ignoring real achievements<p>There were dozens of things mentioned here in this thread, which wasn&#x27;t mentioned in OP (LLVM, Mobile, ML, and dozens and dozens of others).')
