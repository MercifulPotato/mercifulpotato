Sampling data is an elegant approach that allows us to serve fast, flexible analytics for all our customers.<p>I&#x27;ve been reflecting recently on how problems like this only exist for companies with extreme scale (similar to how microservices came about to solve FAANG-sized problems). This is a non-issue if you go with a product like plausible (or my personal choice: GoatCounter) for your analytics, because in that case you&#x27;re essentially just paying them to manage an instance of their open source software for you on a multi-tenant server (I&#x27;m guessing here). And if it does eventually become a scale problem for plausible to the point where they start complicating their architecture to solve it, you can self-host or switch to another plausible provider.<p>If you set out to solve a simpler problem, you can use a simpler solution.')
