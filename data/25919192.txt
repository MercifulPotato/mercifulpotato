My question is: based on marketing, how can we measure how good our product&#x2F;market fit is? For example, if we spent $1000 on marketing, what kind of response should we expect if we have a good product&#x2F;market fit? Another way to word this is: what should the customer acquisition cost be for a brand new D2C app (right off the starting line)?')
