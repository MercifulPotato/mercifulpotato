It just depends on where someone sees an opportunity and exploits it. (not as easy, but thats about the crux of it)<p>I wanted to touch upon the other thing Garry Tan mentioned when he said that reason people try the same ideas is because &quot;desire is mimetic&quot;. We want what other people want.  Same ideas especially ones which have already been successful. And he cites examples like Podcasts, Travel plans, and local events app.<p>Out of the three mentioned, local events app and travel plans apps have been tried multiple times but never been successful. Its something when you ask casual travelers what they would want in a travel app and travel planning help is their first pick and local events and guidance is their second pick. Most of these ideas fold because travel is very cold market for an investor and most dont want to invest.<p>Also, quite a few folks now pick ideas based on what is a hot market ergo what is being funded, and quite a few times its a variant or a rendition of what is already successful (or something a success in one vertical can be tried in another).<p>That being said, I do think that you need to have the experiences of the people you are building the product for. It may or may not be the same experience as others.')
