Item(by='mindcrime', descendants=None, kids=[25933489], score=None, time=1611778377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25932892, text='I can&#x27;t read the article because of the paywall, but I can say that this has been a known issue for a while. The NFPA has been recommending that firefighters turnout gear and other equipment be cleaned &#x2F; decontaminated regularly for some time. I believe this advice was circulating back when I was still a firefighter, some 20 years ago. But it was the case then, and is probably still the case now, that many departments - especially smaller, all-volunteer departments in rural areas - don&#x27;t have the resources to do this. For starters, if you&#x27;re going to wash a set of turnout gear, then the firefighter in question needs another clean set to use in the interim, so you&#x27;re roughly doubling the number of sets of gear you need. And there are departments that barely have enough gear to provide each member with one set, much less two.<p>And you need laundry facilities which aren&#x27;t always present in fire stations. And a generic Kenmore washer from Sears probably won&#x27;t hold up very long washing turnout gear due to the size and weight - you really need a proper (read, expensive) industrial washer.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s a problem that still needs attention from what I can see. And cancer rates for firefighters still run disproportionately high relative to the general population. Gear soaked in various contaminants is likely a factor in that. :-(')
