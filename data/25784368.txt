Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610666164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783338, text='This is another one of those posts where I had, like, two jobs (talking to our users about a way they can set up their Fly apps, and talking about Serf) and it definitely shows, but there was no way I was ever going to take the time to revise this into two documents. You can, if you like, just skim to the &quot;What Serf Is Doing&quot; section if you&#x27;re interested in how Serf works, which was the fun part of this post to write.<p>I&#x27;m sort of kicking myself for not using Serf a lot more in the past; it&#x27;s kind of like an inetd for clusters.<p><i>(Also: because I am the best, I forgot to set the repo public, which it is now; the links should all work now).</i>')
