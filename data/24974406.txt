I need to get files in and out. I want to be able to put stuff in Dropbox. I want to be able to get it in and out of LibreOffice and Gmail. I want to start in a Linux text editor, add some info in LibreOffice, save as .DOC and open it in Word to work on the structure. I want to be able to copy the name of the speaker, the talk, the time and subject and paste them direct from my browser into my notes.<p>It&#x27;s host integration that means this isn&#x27;t a toy for the sake of the thing. If I wanted that, I could run Wordsworth under UAE, or Word 5.1 under System 7 in Basilisk.<p>This is a tool to get work done. For that, I want the host environment to be as invisible as possible.<p>If you don&#x27;t, well, fine. But your choices would be useless for me.')
