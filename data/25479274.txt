Then NYT retracts it. Maybe adding a footnote or correction (sometimes they don&#x27;t even do that [1]) is added to the story. Maybe the story is removed from their site.<p>However, the faulty information has already registered into the minds of millions of people.<p>NYT has already intentionally or unintentionally indoctrinated the minds of many readers and with the &quot;retraction&quot; at the same time they can claim the highest standards of journalism.<p>Unless in good fait, NYT tries to bring as much attention into the correction to the readers they have already impacted, the retraction is journalistic virtue signaling and a very small victory for truth.<p>Even if they do as much work in publicizing the retraction so many people have already formed a biased view and it&#x27;ll be hard to undo that.<p>The only path forward is to fully hold NYT accountable. Fire the editor and journalist in charge of the story would be a start.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Timcast&#x2F;status&#x2F;1187036978463891456" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Timcast&#x2F;status&#x2F;1187036978463891456</a>')
