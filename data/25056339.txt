Life in the United States is, on average, better for young women than it is for young men. They simply have more opportunity.<p>I don&#x27;t have any resentment over it. I&#x27;m not even young anymore (let&#x27;s go ahead and cap it at 26 years old, using the limit for insurance under your parents), but if I was, I wouldn&#x27;t be resentful. It just is what it is.<p>I am somewhat annoyed by people who refuse to admit it, though. It&#x27;s not <i>strictly</i> better, but given a choice and typical circumstances, I know which one I would take.')
