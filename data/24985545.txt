Even if the problem would be worse with anti-aging I&#x27;d trade not-dying for more powerful oligarchs.<p>I think it might make things more egalitarian. A hard working genius born to poverty only has 80 years to work their way into the upper echelons. Removing senescence means such people will have more time to rise to elite positions and demonstrate track records of competence and merit.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that anti-aging would be restricted to the richest. One simple reason is that anyone with the know-how could make vast wealth by making anti-aging available to the masses.')
