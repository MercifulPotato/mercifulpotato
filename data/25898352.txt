It was a pay raise.<p>2) Experiment did not succeed because of (1), they just attempted to test if a higher minimum wage was well received. Of course even that they failed to do properly, because they have no clue how customers would react to that great idea to increase the cost of all products.<p>3) I didn&#x27;t notice that &quot;well-being&quot; of people who paid for that largesse was evaluated, but let me guess: it wouldn&#x27;t increase (if it did, they&#x27;d give money away today).<p>4) Everyone knows - you don&#x27;t need to be an academic - that UBI is a complete nonsense and doesn&#x27;t work at any scale (and also cannot scale).
