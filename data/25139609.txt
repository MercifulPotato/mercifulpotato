Lets get back outside, even I&#x27;m bored of these walls now.<p>Excellent! That is exactly what I want. The more people who take it because they are either at high risk, or because avoiding exposure seriously harms their lifestyle, the more data there will be for me when I decide to take it.<p>As far as side effects go, the kind of things that take years to show up are usually things that you&#x27;d only see in a medicine that you have to take regularly.<p>The latest research suggests that we probably get long term COVID immunity. Those few cases of people getting it twice were probably people who got a small viral load the first time and didn&#x27;t develop strong immunity.<p>All the COVID vaccines look like they will be take once (or take twice over a short period) and that&#x27;s it, so we almost certainly won&#x27;t see anything like people developing cancer from it 5 years later. Those things take times to build up, like say we had with Actos and bladder cancer, with each time you take it adding to the risk.<p>If there are long term bad effects from the COVID vaccines, the underlying damage will happen within a couple weeks or so of taking them, and then should start being detectable in the health statistics of people who took it versus people who did not within a year.<p>Thus, at the latest we should know about any long term effects by the time my Walmart+ subscription is up for renewal, which is perfect timing.')
