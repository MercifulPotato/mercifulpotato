Fusion power has more problems than just magnets needed to be kept cold. MRI machines are a niche thing, sure they could get cheaper but why should average Joe care? Computers don&#x27;t get just magically faster. Computers need semiconductor switches and those operate <i>based</i> on energy dissipation, you can&#x27;t just remove that and get a better computer. Maglev trains are overpriced gimmick and lossless transmission would be nice but current estimate of energy losses is like 5%, negligible part of the cost.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a holy grail technology.<p>In the sense lots of people talk about it as something important, but it is never actually seen or used.')
