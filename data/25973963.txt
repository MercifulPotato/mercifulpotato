Rumor sites such as this one tap into the same mechanism that makes rumors, conspiracy theories and superstions effective since forever: Once people have decided for whatever reason they trust a particular source of information, it will take some exceptional events to make them distrust it again. Someone else simply stating that the source should not be trusted is by far not enough.')
