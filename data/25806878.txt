For me the clear advantage of building HTTP endpoints using Go (framework-less) over DRF, Swagger and others is: no magic, no annotations, no dependencies; I know exactly what&#x27;s happening and I can build a tailored system that is adjusted to my needs. This leads to very performant systems that are highly independent of the current trends and, most importantly, to a high degree of ownership of the systems you are building.<p>The act of writing these kind of systems is IMHO, somehow, liberating.')
