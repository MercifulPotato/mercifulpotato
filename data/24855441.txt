Police did find the tracking device.<p>It sounds like the suspect moved the bug from his car into a house.  If you were to move a bug from your living room to your attic (and place a sign at the location of the original bug saying &quot;The bug is now in the attic, feel free to collect it when you find this note&quot;) then it might be harder for the police to claim you had stolen it.')
