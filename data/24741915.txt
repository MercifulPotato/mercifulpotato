We are super excited to share our passwordless login API with you! Here&#x27;s a video on how it works: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nb3vU9kCTGg . You can also try it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gazepass.com&#x2F;<p>Passwords add friction during registration and login. Our mission at Gaze is to eliminate them from the Internet. We do this by enabling brilliant hackers such as yourself to remove passwords from your products.<p>Meet Gazepass—a fully passwordless login API that lets your users sign up with just a few clicks, and subsequently login seamlessly.<p>Here are the highlights:<p>- Social Accounts: Users can register with Google or by typing in their email address (more social logins to come in the future)<p>- Native Biometrics: They can subsequently login using native biometric auth (like Apple Face ID, Windows Hello or Android&#x27;s biometric-enabled devices)<p>- Camera Face ID: If they don&#x27;t have a biometric sensor on their device, they can choose to sign in with camera face ID—our own face ID technology that runs on any webcam&#x2F;front facing camera<p>- User Choice: If your users prefer not to use biometrics at all, they can disable biometrics altogether and login with a single click<p>Integrating Gazepass on your website is easy too! We have already released our JS SDK for integration on websites. We will be releasing our mobile SDKs very soon as well (currently under development). You will also find relevant API endpoints on our docs (which are constantly being improved -- launching comprehensive docs very soon).<p>This is just the very first version of our product—there&#x27;s lots more in store. We would love to hear from you and get your thoughts&#x2F;feedback. You can join our Slack workspace by visiting https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gaze.ai&#x2F;slack -- we&#x27;ll be waiting to start working with you!
