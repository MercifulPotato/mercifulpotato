The Mueller investigation was very narrowly focused on whether the Trump campaign conspired (not &#x27;colluded&#x27;) with Russian entities during the 2017 campaign.<p>The additional issues you raise were outside of Mueller&#x27;s remit. Those questions were supposed to be answered by a separate counterintelligence probe conducted by the DoJ. This separate investigation has vanished without a trace[0] and appears to have been killed or suppressed.<p>Leaving aside the conflict of interest issues inherent in the Trump DoJ investigating Trump, why would this investigation disappear, given how eager Barr would be to exonerate Trump if the outcome of the investigation would give the DoJ the slightest figleaf of justification to do so?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-happened-trump-counterintelligence-investigation-house-investigators-dont-know&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-happ...</a>')
