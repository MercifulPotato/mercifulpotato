By theorem, all bases are equivalent in power with respect to their capabilities of encoding information and processing&#x2F;computing said information, and binary logic can be used to bootstrap any other multi-valued logic system desirable (goes for ternary logic and 64-bit integer computation alike). Thus, the decision to make a base-3 falls back pretty much entirely on circuit efficiency&quot;</i><p>This reminds me of Alan Perlis&#x27; famous admonition to <i>&quot;Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.&quot;</i><p>There are many programming languages which are Turing complete, and so are interchangeable as far as their computing power goes, but as you know they don&#x27;t tend to compete on efficiency alone.<p>People want to use the right tool for the job, and many other considerations come in to play.')
