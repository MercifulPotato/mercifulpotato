If my piece of software works for me in my use cases and I am not interested in fixing it for other people (as is the case for the author), then bug reports are costs, rather than value. Minimizing costs in this scenario means refusing to accept costs (in this case, bug reports) unless something of value (in this case, money) makes this deal acceptable.')
