Even with a very strong tech professional community the country has problems figuring out what to do with that incredible resource.<p>The reasons are economic. To build vacation apartments for locals and foreigners is a big business and the tourism industry is easier to understand and has less risk (until 2020 I guess) than the tech industry. So, politic and industry leaders are not interested in tech.<p>Luckily that is changing with many international companies creating offices in the country to take advantage of the existing talent and, as a side effect, inspiring more locals to work in the tech industry.<p>I love the country&#x27;s easy tax collection system, and many other public technologies. But, there is still too many misconceptions.<p>I will not get into the historical reasons (also related to agriculture and politics) that made tech difficult to penetrate in Spain.<p>Anti-intellectualism also has been rampant in the arts. Many people equated being educated to understand art (literature, painting, wine tasting) and despise technology.<p>I am hopeful with a new generation growing to understand better technology, and if the current circumstances should have a positive side, to be wary of a tourism focused economy.<p>That police struggles with tech, is just on of many situations that older generations still struggle with a technology that learned to see as a lesser subject than others.')
