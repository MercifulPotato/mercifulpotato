They see yields that are 1&#x2F;3 to 1&#x2F;4 of US agricultural yields. These yield gaps dramatically close when you start using fertilizer and modern agricultural practices.<p>I&#x27;d just like to point out that these are two different continents with completely different conditions, soils, microbiota, seeds, pests, and climate. So apples and oranges.<p>Also, you count wrong because you don&#x27;t count the number of acres needed to produce fertilizer.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m certainly biased, I&#x27;m the CTO of a company that&#x27;s trying to improve agricultural inputs by financing access to smallholders<p>At this point, yeah, your financial incentives pretty much color your entire worldview.
