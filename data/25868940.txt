It changes nothing about the licensing situation nor about the ethics. You’re also not factoring in the fact that the nonrestrictive license is <i>why</i> Elasticsearch became the standard.<p>You also haven’t resolved the logical contradiction that Elastic is equally “guilty” of profiting off of Lucene.<p>I honestly don’t think a nuanced understanding of these licenses and open source business models can lead to any conclusion except this one: Amazon is not in the wrong here, Elastic is being entitled, misleading and duplicitous. Elastic is free to use Lucene as its kernel and monetize it, and Amazon is free to offer a managed Elasticsearch service.<p>If you write Apache 2.0 software, you have no right to bitch about competition. That’s the short of it. And remember - Elastic is doing fine. They’re worth $15B. The founder has hundreds of millions of dollars now, and rightly so.')
