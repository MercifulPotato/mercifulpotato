Item(by='xyzelement', descendants=None, kids=[25878570], score=None, time=1611362564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874374, text='It&#x27;s clear from my posting history that I am hugely biased towards &quot;pushing myself&quot; to extremes career-wise. But at least in my experience, that doesn&#x27;t really translate to more stress, and quite often to less.<p>I have a theory that there&#x27;s a constant level of happiness and misery that we experience in most normal situations that really has more to do with who we are than our situation. So for example, a guy may experience a certain level of anxiety about losing his job that doesn&#x27;t depend on whether he&#x27;s the janitor or the CEO. He will feel the same amount of pressure and exertion whether he&#x27;s trying to finish mopping the floor on time or launch a successful IPO.<p>To the extent that this is true, you might as well be the CEO.<p>A related view is that our perceived difficulties are relative to our challenges. I used this example before: my wife and I are pretty busy with our 1 kid. Our rabbi is seemingly equally busy with his 10 kids. I bet we&#x27;d feel roughly as busy if we each doubled our number of kids.<p>Similarly, I didn&#x27;t feel that it was &quot;harder&quot; to go to business school while working fill time than it was to just work. It all kinda feels the same, so the &quot;pushing&quot; part is more about being able to get yourself into the situation than handling the situation on on-going basis.<p>And the kicker is that it all works out way less stressful. If the CEO and janitor worry about losing their job about the same, but the CEO has a much nicer cushion if he actually gets fired, you might as well try to be the CEO. Similarly, if being an individual contributor and being a manager are about equally hard on you, be the manager because if you ever get sick of the job, you&#x27;ll have 2x the opportunity (all the management jobs along with all the IC jobs) versus just being the IC.<p>All this is a long winded way to say - people over-estimate the stress of being at the next level, and under-estimate the reduction in background stress that actually being at that level brings.')
