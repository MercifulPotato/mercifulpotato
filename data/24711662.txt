If I want the biggest audience today, I need to support chrome. But if that&#x27;s my goal I&#x27;m probably not writing my own server anyway.<p>In terms of building things today, I&#x27;m more saying that if you need an internet protocol for moving data around, HTTP is a pretty dang good choice. It has some cruft, but if you were to start making a replacement from scratch you would end up with a large subset of HTTP&#x2F;1.1. That&#x27;s not true of HTTP&#x2F;3. You simply don&#x27;t need the complexity for a large number of useful tasks.<p>Now, in terms of the future. I think that the internet will long outlive the web (at least as we currently conceive of the web), and I think HTTP as a transport layer will outlive it as well. In that future, I want HTTP&#x2F;1.1 to still be a thing.')
