We are a licensed ISP so we&#x27;ve got the regulatory aspect covered pretty well. The best part of our laser system is that it uses so called &#x27;free space&#x27; which doesn&#x27;t require government approval. We&#x27;re confident in our superior technology and lower costs when competing with telcos and ISPs.')
