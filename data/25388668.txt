We&#x27;re a social primate species. We need to shoulders to cry on, hugs, handshakes, etc. We crave being in the same space with others, experiencing their physicality.<p>Even the <i>smell</i> of our loved ones is an important component of being connected to them. Most of us probably have <i>deeply</i> evocative memories of the smell of &quot;grandmas&#x27;s house&quot; or an ex&#x27;s shampoo. Scent is tied to our emotional memories more deeply than any other sense.')
