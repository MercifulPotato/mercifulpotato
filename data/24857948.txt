Such declines are\naccompanied by a decrease in expressed worries on health and economic conditions<p>I wonder if this is simply because there is a mismatch between what people are being told and what people are observing with their own eyes.<p>If, instead of covid, it were a plague with 50% death rate... I doubt people would be having as much &quot;lockdown fatigue&quot; since they would literally see the bodies piling up in their communities. Instead you have a disease that only mildly affects the majority, putting only small minorities in real danger, which doesn&#x27;t jive with the &quot;sky is falling&quot; stories the media&#x2F;government peddles.<p>One parallel to this finding would be climate change, of course. There&#x27;s a danger in preaching that the sky is falling in that if people can&#x27;t see the sky falling with their own eyes, they are going to get &quot;climate fatigue&quot; followed by &quot;a decrease in expressed worries on [climate] conditions&quot;.')
