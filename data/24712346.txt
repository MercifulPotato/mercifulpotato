Their non union bosses hired me for a job they aren&#x27;t qualified for, or interested in having, to solve problems they&#x27;d been complaining about for years, but because I was using oxygen in their vicinity it became a legitimate union issue because of the language in their contracts. So, yeah. Unions do stupid stuff. I still support them. Kind of wish my contract had been cancelled, could have doubled my rate when they crawled back.')
