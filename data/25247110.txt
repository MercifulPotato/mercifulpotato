I found that the best way to go back to sleep after waking up is to think about the dream I just had. It seems like this &#x27;forced&#x27; dream continuity is somehow sleep inducing.<p>What may be happening to you is the same thing: your firs instinct is trying to remember your dream, as you trained yourself through years of dream journaling. It&#x27;s a learned behaviour. But what happens is, this induces sleep, and you&#x27;re caught in the loop.<p>Maybe the trick is to go back to writing down your dreams when you wake up. This activity may keep you from falling back asleep.<p>Hope this helps.')
