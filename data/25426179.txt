Planning meetings and 1-1 with direct reports. Personally, if I were the manager, and I committed to supporting this team, I would take the bulk of the hit and wake up as early as possible to overlap at least 3-4 hours with my team.<p>(Of course, I also would think long and hard about whether I wanted to make that commitment)<p>Generally, I also think it&#x27;s important teams figure out their core timezone(s).
