So, instead of just publishing honestly, you find some way to &#x27;spin&#x27; your research.<p>For instance, a paper on perovskite solar cells might claim that they have the best-in-class efficiency of any inorganic  perovskite cell, but you have to buy the paper to find out that they sacrificed longevity to do it -- it only lasts 20hrs.  Meanwhile, mixed organic&#x2F;inorganic perovskites have even better efficiency AND better lifetimes simultaneously -- but the article can still claim a breakthrough b&#x2F;c they qualified their claim with &quot;of any inorganic cell.&quot;  Why is that relevant? It probably isn&#x27;t.')
