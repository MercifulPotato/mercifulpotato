In worse cases, your exception&#x2F;condition system will kick in at a time which is essentially non-deterministic (it&#x27;s usually deterministic but depends on a lost of things you may have no visibility into).<p>But if TCE is available, you might even have no allocations after some startup. That&#x27;s different semantics which are part of the language (e.g. in the case of Scheme) and thus not an &quot;optimization&quot;.')
