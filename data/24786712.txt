How are you measuring that?<p>Despite tons of noise in social media, real life up has been incredibly stable for the last couple of decades in the west. The least amount of violence, lowest extreme poverty, highest disposable income, etc etc.<p>In the 70s (before social media), there were multiple bombings every year in the US.
