Sweden&#x27;s pandemic impact is inline with the rest of Europe (for good or bad). It looks to be right in the middle of the EU pack. But they didn&#x27;t lockdown, and the hard large-scale spring lockdowns seem to have been a big, costly mistake.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure how much credence to give to public health opinions of a &#x27;virologist&#x27;, as opposed to an &#x27;epidemiologist.')
