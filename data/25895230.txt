Now, I am back and can smell again, but I cannot smell my body odour after a workout even so normally it smells really. This is at the moment the only thing I cannot smell.<p>The questions are: is it because the infection had for effect a change in my body odour? Or is it because I recovered all my sense at the exception of the capacity to smell my own body odour?<p>Nobody in the family can answer (too small or still suffering from anosmia) and I am not yet ready to ring the bell next door after a hard workout and ask the poor soul the smell!')
