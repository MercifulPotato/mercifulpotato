I&#x27;ve heard that human meat doesn&#x27;t taste very good and isn&#x27;t healthy, so I likely wouldn&#x27;t even try, but if I heard that it was the tastiest thing in the world I would certainly try a lab-grown one if I could and I don&#x27;t see why I shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Also, no - vegans for ethical reasons don&#x27;t necessarily have to oppose sourcing cells from animals. For some it would be enough if the sourcing was done cruelty-free. But you&#x27;re right that the ethical issue is still there and I&#x27;m certain that some people will be still opposed to that.')
