There was a rioter wearing a &quot;Camp Auschwitz&quot; sweatshirt in the Capitol this week.</i><p>Yeah, so? What part of this is not already covered by my &quot;few and far between&quot; comment?<p>And what part of that anecdotal isolated example proves that Nazis are anything like a real presense in US politics, or that the people deplatformed and silenced are kept to Nazis or people of that kind?<p>Would you point to some persons wearing a &quot;class war&quot;, &quot;kill the rich&quot; or some questionable communist leader (e.g. Stalin or Mao), or &quot;Camp Gulag&quot; t-shirt in a liberal rally as excuse to deplatform people?<p>(And I say that as a European, sympathetic to communism, leftie - just one that can&#x27;t stant cant).<p>Was Donald Trump - a ho-hum president compared to Reagan as concerning the social damage his Reaganomics did, and less hawkish compared to Clinton, Bush, and Obama - a nazi (and thus 40% voting for him Nazi supporters)? Or is it just either hysteria or a code for &quot;people we disagree with politically&quot; (and can use the real-world equivalent of Godwin&#x27;s law to to yield political wins over)?')
