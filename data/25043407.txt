For example, these ACF images are almost invariant under some rotations. Sound waves are almost invariant under temporal shifts. I&#x27;d argue that what makes an ornament look good is the ease of recognizing those transforms and what makes sound sound sound is the ease of recognizing those temporal shifts.')
