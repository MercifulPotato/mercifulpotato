Item(by='the_pwner224', descendants=None, kids=[24948527], score=None, time=1604106334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948005, text='They&#x27;re good in residential areas with smaller streets - one lane in each direction, and cars on the sides of the road.<p>With a 4-way stop sign everything works well, and traffic stays slow since you&#x27;re not going more than one block without stopping: no room to accelerate to fast speeds. Roundabouts take a lot of space. 2-way stops are dangerous because traffic can be going a bit fast for the small roads, and visibility is low. There&#x27;s a two way stop near my house and it&#x27;s always hard to see if another car is coming, until they&#x27;re almost inside the intersection. Most of the intersections in the area are 4-way and they just work.')
