Due to the trial size, I think we can be confident that if there are any short-term safety issues with this vaccine they are extremely rare.<p>1,769 people 25-34 have died of Covid this year. There are 23m people in that age range. .0077% have died. If the vaccine had an adverse effect at a similar rate as covid has killed young people, we&#x27;d expect it should have showed in the trials in 1-3 people.')
