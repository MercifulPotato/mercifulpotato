Assuming your UUIDs are sufficiently random, isn&#x27;t this just a generalized birthday problem? Take the birthday problem and generalize the formula from 365 buckets to N buckets, where N is the total number of possible UUIDs given a length and set of possible characters.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mste.illinois.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;mat764fa03&#x2F;folders&#x2F;edwardssu&#x2F;Tech_Port&#x2F;ThesisPape02.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mste.illinois.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;mat764fa03&#x2F;folders&#x2F;edwards...</a><p>You should be concerned with what happens if there&#x27;s a duplicate -- you can calculate the probability of that occurring as long as you know the potential size of your dataset and set your UUID length accordingly.')
