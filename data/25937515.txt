The key thing to keep in mind is that here you do legally own the share you bought, except that when buying it you also signed a contract that says you will resell a share to the original owner at the original price, plus interest.<p>This is exactly how loans from banks work. You took money from the bank and bought a house. You now do not have enough money to pay back the bank, but the bank doesn&#x27;t mind, because they only care about the contract that says they will get their money back plus interest.')
