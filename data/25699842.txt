The use of Haskell is a huge win on this metric and demonstrably so. You don&#x27;t have bugs in any of the Haskell programmed OSes you actually use, nor your editor written in Haskell, your Haskell mp3 player nor your Haskell time machine and Haskell en-truthenator.<p>Pandoc is good. Some like xmonad window manager, git-annexe has some fans. There&#x27;s probably 4 or 5 more too! Mostly centred around parsing.<p>And for all that you absolutely should learn Haskell. You&#x27;ll enjoy it and it will enable you to think about programming in New and powerful ways. Just don&#x27;t fall so deep you expect to actually ship anything you write.')
