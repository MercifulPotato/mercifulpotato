He is speaking in a scientifically accurate and narrow way - they don&#x27;t know that yet, those studies have not been completed. That doesn&#x27;t mean you can, or that it is even likely or probable that you can, just that they don&#x27;t have results saying you can&#x27;t yet. That is because those results inherently take longer than studying the effecicacy of the vaccine...because people have to get the vaccine, get exposed, and then the difficult task of tracking any potential infections that they transmit. That science is even harder than what has happened through the vaccine trials. They are studying and will know the answer to it.<p>The headline is click bait and I&#x27;m disappointed in HN here...&#x27;we don&#x27;t know&#x27; is a statement that we should laud and appreciate scientists for making, not use as a form of propaganda.')
