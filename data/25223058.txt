I bought her a nice backlit foldable Bluetooth keyboard and she loves it.<p>When she heard about the M1 laptops from me, she wasn&#x27;t very impressed, saying:<p>1. Well, MacBooks in general have been extremely powerful for a while, weren&#x27;t they?<p>2. Will they come with the ability to put the keyboard facing down like the Lenovo Yoga tablets?<p>While we here at HN may drool at every bit of performance without the fans sounding like a jet taking off, a lot of people just want some ergonomy. Sure, now there are 200 EUR detachable keyboards with a track pad but that&#x27;s an insane price already. Still, it works for people like her who won&#x27;t use their iPad Pros for work -- just to do a lot of other stuff on them.<p>I for one would love to buy an ARM-based MacBook Pro with a keyboard that can be put in a face-down mode.')
