Had a drain backup and the guy that showed up said it was $150 an hour. minimum 1 hour. As he was working he kept getting calls. He said he had 6 more calls that day for drain issues. The he was getting he had to schedule for the following day. Sometimes when im neck deep in tech crud for hours tracking down a problem or trying to cram in yet more &quot;needed&quot; features I sometimes wonder if ditch digging or working in the brown stuff would be much more rewarding. After all you can see the problem is resolved when your done with a plumbing or ditch issue. With IT you never really know if it will crop up again or not.')
