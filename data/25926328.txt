Just imagine something super basic like: take a JSON structure that&#x27;s a &quot;patch&quot; to an existing domain object, merge it in place, and for each field type there&#x27;s a given way of merging it and a possible kind of error that can occur; gather up all those errors and report them together. That&#x27;s trivial in Python and impossible in Java&#x2F;C++.')
