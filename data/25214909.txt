It can be embedded in configuration file, as a string in a database, on a web page or deep in backend code, and it will still work the same.<p>The &quot;Java Verbal Expressions&quot; already have &quot;Java&quot; in the name and so are complete loss when it comes to portability.<p>Then comes the fact that &quot;Java Verbal Expressions&quot; are many times more code that actual regular expressions. That isn&#x27;t easier to scan, it is much worse.<p>Regular expressions are very succinct and you can express a lot in a single line of it. Comparable JVE-s would require many lines and wouldn&#x27;t be more readable for anybody other than a person that doesn&#x27;t know regexes at all.')
