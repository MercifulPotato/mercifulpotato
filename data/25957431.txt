Item(by='jsjohnst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611930032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953143, text='&gt; If you don&#x27;t mind me asking, do you interface with these kind of people?<p>Yes, I do, multiple people in fact (which I refuse to name drop). That’s why I replied to you the way I did in my other sibling comment. Him tweeting it means somebody told him, and likely he trusts that person. Billionaires are humans like anyone else, they sometimes trust the wrong people. They can also fall victim to “hearing what they want to hear”. They also have a lot of folks who want to win favor with them and thus will intentionally or unintentionally take information out of context and oversell it as something it isn’t. The ultimate point is that thinking a billionaire won’t possibly be misled&#x2F;deceived themselves and then share wrong info (Elon Musk has had this happen a few times as an example, but he’s far from alone), or won’t deceive others for their benefit (there’s a “household name” in the US that immediately comes to mind as an example, leave it to you to decide who I mean), just seems naive to me.')
