The main Tether-BTC transacting I&#x27;m aware of is in high frequency trading.  Any longterm position in Tether is effectively against BTC (electing to instead hold a tokenized USD). Furthermore, Tether has a market cap only 1&#x2F;16 of BTC.  You can say either are flawed individually, but their valuations are independent.<p>China also has a geopolitical incentive to promote crypto and counter the USD&#x27;s current status as the reserve currency.  The capability for the US to inject USD into itself while retaining a worldwide demand is undoubtedly at the forefront of China&#x27;s mind.')
