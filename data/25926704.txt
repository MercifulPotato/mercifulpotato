And, beyond that, they’ve also lost a substantial minority of the <i>Right</i>; the various long-time and recent Republican figures that have come out in opposition to the Trumpist faction – and not just in the usual intraparty opposition sense but to the extent of either making a dramatic exit from the Party and&#x2F;or advocating for the defeat of not only its Presidential candidate but of its downballot candidates as long as the Party adheres to Trumpism is telling.<p>Shouting about the Left is, I’m sure, cathartic, but it is also very much irrelevant to what is going on here.
