Plus, it&#x27;s not like something they&#x27;ll admit openly.<p>Second, there&#x27;s also internalized violence&#x2F;indoctrination, from a young age.<p>There is of course voluntary choice too -- even western women who have converted and adopted wearing it (in which case there&#x27;s no youthful indoctrination). But for tons of muslim women in Europe, which see their non-muslim friends not having to wear any, it&#x27;s imposed by their families and communities.')
