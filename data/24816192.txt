Item(by='taxicab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603007252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24814956, text='&gt; unrestricted &#x27;say anything lmao&#x27; free speech does not exist<p>I am baffled by everyone here talking about algorithmic platforms like Facebook and Twitter as if they are a bastion of free speech. They are designed to promote only the most engaging content (IE most outrageous and in some cases literal misinformation meant to feed on your biases).<p>These services are not a free marketplace of ideas, they are companies which are designed to make money.  The more eyeballs on screens, the more money they make, and it is not well reasoned discussion with a diverse representation of viewpoints that keeps people glued to their devices.<p>Consider how you respond to someone making an incorrect statement on Twitter.  You reply to them, and by replying to them you amplify the audience of the incorrect tweet.  The fact that your correction causes misinformation to spread isn&#x27;t a bug, it is exactly how the platform was intended to work, because it causes &quot;engagement.&quot;<p>&quot;The solution is more free speech&quot; doesn&#x27;t work here because the platforms don&#x27;t have free speech and never did to begin with.  All people are asking is for those platforms which currently promote outrage above organic content to sort themselves out.  Not any of these strawmen about creating a &quot;bureau of truth&quot; or &quot;state censorship boards&quot; and certainly not notions of making an American KGB which I think I saw mentioned somewhere.<p>I have no idea of the best way to do this.  Treat the negative effects of algorithmic platforms as some sort of externality?  Develop strict regulation on what types of methods to keep people hooked on social media are considered ethical? Similar to how drugs or gambling are already regulated?  Just straight up ban this type of business model?<p>It&#x27;s going to be one of the big questions of the next decade.  Even something like a user generated flag where if enough people press it, a tweet has a big warning over it saying &quot;this is a contested matter&quot; or something would be better than the current situation.')
