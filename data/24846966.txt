Item(by='jjgreen', descendants=None, kids=[24850034], score=None, time=1603282079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843174, text='Please let&#x27;s keep this civil, &quot;die on a hill&quot;, &quot;infected by American-style hyper-individualism&quot;, &quot;on a ventilator&quot;.  I&#x27;d hope to have a conversation here, to exchange views, to increase understanding.<p>The idea that you masking me is reasonable is predicated on its triviality, &quot;it&#x27;s only a cloth&quot; right?  But it is <i>you</i> that decides that it is trivial, I have no say in that.  If I were to demand that you wear a pork chop on your head, equally trivial, would you? No, you must insist that there is some scientific basis that you masking me protects your health, but those numbers are thin on the ground.  Some high profile scientist <i>believe</i> that this is the case, some do not, so it is your adherence to this particular group of pro-mask scientists which justifies your (self admitted) denial of my liberty.  I adhere to the other group of scientists.  (Masks don&#x27;t work, the second wave in a masked Europe demonstrates that, but that is besides the point, mine is a reasonable belief, as is yours.)<p>So your beliefs lead you to think you can take my liberty, and to trivialise that.  My beliefs say you will not.  We call this situation bullying, and this is the reason why the unmasked push back against the maskers, simply because that is the only way to treat bullies: when they instruct you to draw a cock on your own forehead, to do so it to invite more of the same (&quot;it&#x27;s only a cock, don&#x27;t be such a baby&quot;, sound familiar?).')
