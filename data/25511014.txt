Modern MCUs can <i>idle</i> (not sleep!) at under a milliamp; it&#x27;s not difficult to get them to draw less average current than the leakage current of their battery. The lack of 5V operation is a little annoying in some scenarios, but is easily worked around with a 3.3V LDO -- which is frequently required anyway for interoperability with other components. (A switching converter is hardly necessary for a USB device drawing a couple milliamps.)')
