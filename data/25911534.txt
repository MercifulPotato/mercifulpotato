Freaking. Often. Companies take open source software private All The Damn Time. They hire the key devs away with just enough money. Then they release another version under a different license. And before you know it a previously open source project is now all but closed source.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even have to be with shenanigans this nefarious. Once you have the two or three devs all you have to do is release a value-added component and all but cripple the community one. <i>It&#x27;s roughly a million times cheaper than an acquisition.</i><p>If you want your hard-earned contributions to avoid this fate, <i>do not contribute to &quot;open source&quot; projects</i>. Find a copylefted project and contribute to that. Otherwise your work <i>will</i> end up being coopted by a profit-seeking enterprise.<p>Open source is the domain of large companies building fiefdoms. Just look at all those Apache projects and who contributes to them and who they&#x27;re for. You would have to pay me big bucks to contribute to that ecosystem.<p>GPL or bust.')
