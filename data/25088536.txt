The data on this does not require travel or social interaction.  The CDC (and other gov&#x27;t agencies throughout the world) literally has cooperation with sites around the world to monitor the rise of new flu strains.  These sites use technology like: the telephone, the internet, and the fax machine, to transmit the information the world uses to develop the current generation flu vaccine.')
