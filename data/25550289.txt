Based on this comment I wish I had half the wisdom that you do.<p>&gt; My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger.<p>Similar for me, but like you, I&#x27;m a different (I think better) person as a result, so it&#x27;s difficult to wish I&#x27;d had an easier time.<p>&gt; ...climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself.<p>I will be forever grateful to the people I had in my life that did this for me too.  I&#x27;ve been exceptionally lucky in this respect.<p>&gt; Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work.<p>This sounds awesome.  Good luck!!')
