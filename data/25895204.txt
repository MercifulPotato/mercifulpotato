There is nothing so valuable about Wordpress that you couldn’t just get a more reliable solution from scratch than by bolting more stuff onto WP. I’ve heard people say “oh, our users are already trained on WP, so it’s a good CMS” but I don’t buy that at all. I’ve had users praise my homegrown CMSes before. There’s not much difficulty in pairing a WYSIWYG text editor and some form fields with modern web stacks these days.')
