Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[25144088], score=None, time=1605740642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142521, text='That&#x27;s true.  &quot;Induction works in practice&quot; is merely an empirical fact.  But it is a fact.  Our bodies embed it already: evolution has worked because the environment has changed slowly enough for advantageous mutations to remain advantageous for long enough to become ubiquitous in the species.  But, again, the thesis &quot;empirical evidence doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; is immune to empirical evidence.<p>Now, if one were to try to construct a theoretical argument, I suspect it would go as follows: &quot;If we assume the world could change in every aspect from moment to moment (e.g. pieces of matter could teleport anywhere in the universe, physical constants might change by the second, laws of physics might change over time or space, the very concepts of space and time might become invalid, ...), then the space of possible worlds is enormous and incomprehensible.  If we don&#x27;t have any rational way of assigning probabilities to any of the possible worlds, then this method of thinking doesn&#x27;t have <i>any</i> implications for correct actions, because every action could be the best in some possible world; in that case, as long as you assign <i>nonzero</i> probability to the &quot;laws of physics remain constant&quot; universe most of us believe in, you may as well act as though it&#x27;s the truth.&quot;  If someone <i>does</i> claim to have a rational way of assigning probabilities to the possible worlds, then that would have to be addressed on its own terms, and any conclusion may be possible; but most such ways that people have proposed will tend to imply that &quot;simple&quot; possibilities are most likely, and &quot;the laws of physics remain constant&quot; will tend to rank highly among them.')
