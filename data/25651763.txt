Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609884078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649628, text='That still just seems like a band-aid (sorry, I don&#x27;t have a constructive alternative in mind).<p>If Massively-Evil-Plan™ increases profits from 10% to 20% then even after a 4% fine on revenue, real profits are still 15%. A company only motivated by profits and fines (which seems like a reasonable assumption if we&#x27;re using laws like GDPR to deter &quot;heinous shit&quot;) would be crazy not to continue with MEP™.<p>It&#x27;s really the same kind of calculation as with fixed fines or fines based on damage done. When profitable, they&#x27;re still written off as the cost of doing business. The only material difference would be that a fixed fine effectively allows large companies to do &quot;heinous shit&quot; while imposing fines so large that a small company can&#x27;t compete, whereas with a revenue calculation you instead just need to make sure that your &quot;heinous shit&quot; is scalable. That doesn&#x27;t apply in practice though, since GDPR has an alternative €20M fine which would go into effect, so in reality GDPR just says that to do &quot;heinous shit&quot; you need to be able to do a lot of it scalably and profitably.<p>The natural direction one might take this is just to say that the fines must not be big enough, but until you approach 100% of revenue the potential always exists for a new form of profitable &quot;heinous shit&quot; to crop up. If fines of that scale are on the table then that brings us to the other side of the coin: A single violation of any anti-MEP™ law will nearly certainly end the business. If a violation of an anti-MEP™ law necessarily meant that a corporation was doing &quot;heinous shit&quot; then that could plausibly be acceptable (definitely up for debate), but merely not appointing a data protection officer in the EU violates GDPR and potentially subjects a business to a 2% of revenue fine. The law will not perfectly align with what a reasonable person would consider &quot;heinous shit,&quot; and too severe of a penalty in such situations seems prone to abuse.')
