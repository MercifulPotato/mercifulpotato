Item(by='hypertele-Xii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611617765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903402, text='There is another category of homelessness rarely brought up: Finland is having a tiny crisis over moldy buildings. There are apparently people aggregating in tent villages who are unable to enter almost any building. Like, hyper-allergic to mold.<p>Construction techniques changed after the &#x27;60s to make buildings more airtight, cheaper of course, and built quickly; Moisture was often sealed within structures (from rain or snow) because it costs money to wait for things to dry (especially in winter). This has resulted in catastrophic instances of entire brand-new apartment buildings collapsing in value. Then there&#x27;s that one particular fungi that loves growing under those plastic carpets that were popular (cheap..). I&#x27;ve personally lived in multiple moldy buildings. Frequent eye and ear infections, strange irritability and headaches, etc. My whole neighborhood was just renovated because they found microbes, since these houses were built quick and cheap.<p>In my city there are not less than two public libraries where the architect thought it a good idea to put a water fountain inside the interior. One was shut off because it leaked water into the building; the other still runs to this day. Misty moisture among paper books. Yikes.<p>Recent cost-cutting measures of public schools shutting down their air circulation systems for the night have raised concerns over the air quality exposed on children. Teachers and nurses infamously suffer chronically from related issues since they spend most their time within these buildings.<p>And the worst part is perhaps that <i>owners</i> of buildings and apartments don&#x27;t <i>want</i> air quality inspections because they&#x27;d have to pay for the damn repairs. People get stuck in moving spirals where they have to get quickly out of their moldy homes only to move into another one. I personally know one person whose business failed leaving her with $100k in debt because she got super ill and the doctors couldn&#x27;t officially acknowledge that mold was the problem.')
