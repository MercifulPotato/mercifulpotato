Yes, different power cables disguised as the same is still a problem, but this is a step in the right direction if you ask me.<p>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that now peripherals are smaller and easier to get unplugged, like my HDMI to USB-C that I&#x27;m using right now for one of my  monitors.')
