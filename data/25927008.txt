I dare claim that this won&#x27;t happen (it would be far cheaper&#x2F;more efficient to leave those fossils and synthesize something from those trees up here)<p>Sometimes I wonder, as a mind experiment, how close we could get to practical carbon burial with a process based on sinking polymer blocks in the ocean: the specifics of the polymer blocks wouldn&#x27;t matter at all as long as the surface doesn&#x27;t degrade into spreading microplastics and total density would be high enough to sink, and they could be shaped like standard containers for easy logistics. The result of the mind experiment is always the same, even that could not possibly compete with leaving fossils underground.')
