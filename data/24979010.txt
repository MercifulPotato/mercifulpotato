The solution is to streamline the tax framework as to make its implementation almost unavoidable.<p>Long-story short, my bet is:<p>- Sales tax (VAT)<p>- Inflation<p>- UBI<p>Sales tax is far less gameable as it&#x27;s linked to concrete economic activity. It also has the benefit of tracking the added value produced by an economy (it has the right properties as a tax). It has a problem though, it&#x27;s regressive, see last point. Every economic activity should be included (e.g. stocks should have a VAT; you sell stock you collect VAT, you buy stocks, you pay VAT). Some progressiveness may be included by using different VAT rates for different products, to be done judiciously.<p>Inflation is a fantastic tax, very hard to game as it&#x27;s quite pervasive and taxes the accumulation of capital so it tends to be distributive, anti-regressive. Cash sitting idle does nothing for the economy so disincentivizing it makes sense. This doesn&#x27;t mean that inflation has to be high (the usual moderately low and positive that economists aim for may be reasonable), just that inflation should be seen as the taxation mechanism for the accumulation of capital. And we shouldn&#x27;t reduce it to a single number for the entire economy but understand how inflation is evolving in the different parts of the economy to make sure monetary and fiscal policy are hitting the targets.<p>UBI, fixes the regressiveness of VAT. UBI is not too different from having a lowest tax-free income bracket or even negative-tax income bracket if you prefer to look at it that way. UBI can also help hit the right inflation rates in consumer products which we have been having great trouble achieving through conventional central bank policies.<p>I think this mix is far less gameable, tracks better the size of the economy, places the right incentives and disincentives and will survive better the ongoing economic transformations (good luck taxing income when most of the economic output is produced by computers).')
