I am in a quest for a small e-ink display that might survive the rigours of being placed behind a car windshield. Is this an application that, in your opinion, can be handled with an e-ink display or will sun, extreme temperatures, etc destroy it. Is there any kind of hardened e-ink product out there? I hope it is ok to pick your brain on this. Thanks!')
