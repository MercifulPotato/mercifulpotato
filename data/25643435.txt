You&#x27;ll be searching for attributes&#x2F;skills you&#x27;re looking for, and then get a list.<p>If you&#x27;re an individual applying for a job, you&#x27;d link to your profile, so the recruiter who receives your application won&#x27;t need to search.<p>If you&#x27;re connecting with someone you know personally, then you should already have enough information at hand in order to know you have the right person based on their listed work experience.<p>The only time you might search is when you&#x27;re doing professional networking and only have a name.  But you usually have some other piece of info, like the company they work for, and possibly their broad job function or title.  99% of the time that should be enough to disambiguate people with the same name.  And if all you have is a name, maybe you haven&#x27;t really &quot;networked&quot; with them enough to warrant a connection?')
