It&#x27;s more of a method for thinking through a solution.<p>In more detail, the steps go like this.<p>Find as many solutions to a given problem as you can. Bad engineers run with the first solution that comes to mind, letting confirmation bias drive them.<p>Evaluate each solution for its costs and benefits. Imagine two steps in the future when the solution is implemented. What pains are there?<p>Search for creative new solutions that create win-win scenarios. That&#x27;s riding the solution curve.<p>Given all viable scenarios, compare the costs and benefits against the quality measures for your specific context. Some projects value speed over precision. Some projects value performance over extensibility. Some solutions are easier to change later than others. This is choosing a specific point on the solution curve that best fits your context.<p>You can apply that method of problem solving to any problem, large or small. You don&#x27;t need a ton of experience to practice it.')
