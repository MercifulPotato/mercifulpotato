The thing that&#x27;s clicked for me after reading the comments on wsb is that populism, amplified by the modern internet, is going to radically change the finance world in a similar way to how it radically changed our political landscape. These people aren&#x27;t just investing in GME to enrich themselves. They are doing it to spite the people who they percieve as rigging the game. They are doing it to poke in the eye of &quot;mainstream media talking heads&quot; whom they view as part of the controlled narrative of oligarchs. Does any of this sound familiar?<p>This is a once in a life time black swan. No one is factoring in populism in their investment thesis yet. Whoever can figure out populism well enough to predict it first stands to gain a lot of money.')
