Still, being a Frontend developer I really have a weak spot for beautiful interfaces like you find in VSCode or Sublime Text, so I&#x27;ve been trying to migrate plenty of times. BUT. Vim is just sooo comfortable to use once you get used to it, so I always ended up going back to (Neo)Vim. Being able to do <i>everything</i> with just a few surprisingly easy to remember&#x2F;remap keystrokes is not only satisfying, but in many cases really fast as well. Plus with coc.vim and vista.vim there&#x27;s just nothing useful an IDE can offer anymore.')
