The main thing is that they have a solid engineering culture and thus don’t have a ton of JavaScript in the critical path to rendering so you don’t get the AMP behavior of showing a blank page for many seconds when anything goes wrong loading Google’s multiple large JavaScript files. If you use a mobile device this happens surprisingly frequently - it was one of the factors motivating me to switch to DDG since Google favoring AMP meant I’d hit blank pages multiple times a day.')
