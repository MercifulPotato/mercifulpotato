It used to be a business cost, now it&#x27;s an externality. It reminds me of pollution - industrial processes that are &quot;cheap&quot; because no one is counting the damage done. Do you have more free time than your parents did when they were your age? I think our gains in &quot;efficiency&quot; are a shell game, that we&#x27;re actually paying more to maintain an increasingly byzantine system')
