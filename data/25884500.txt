People should be connecting with others in a rich, high context, cooperative and supportive environment - like we often have in our physical communities. That is by definition healthy and productive. I wish social platforms were the virtual version of what we have in the real world - not this twisted and broken imitation. Twitter is the worst but that doesn&#x27;t mean any of the other forums are much better. HN is often ok - but has its flaws too.<p>Tldr everyone thinks everyone is a bot AND there actually are bots too. That&#x27;s because twitter is virtual heroin and it is hurting us by design. :(')
