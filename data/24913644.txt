Nothing about it gives any indication that it does anything useful. Want to link to just the thread started by a given comment? Click the <i>timestamp</i>. What? Why? Oh well. Want to favorite a comment? Click the <i>timestamp</i>. Um, OK. That&#x27;s weird.<p>I would never think to do that and on mobile have accidentally hit it while trying to do other things and been thoroughly confused how I got there or what led me there. It seems like it would be reasonable to make each of its function into a specific link above each comment. I don&#x27;t think it would make the UI too much more cluttered, personally.<p>OK, rant over.')
