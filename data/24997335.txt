Temperature is, roughly speaking, the average kinetic energy of a material&#x27;s molecules, and you can accelerate particles to extremely kigh kinetic energy with electromagnetic fields. So if you need that kind of &quot;temperature&quot;, electricity is very suitable, even though it&#x27;s expensive per unit of energy.<p>Another example for how electricity is a very valuable type of energy.')
