Of course, it&#x27;s easier to say no to most of those, since they&#x27;re not actually things I <i>want</i>.  They&#x27;re just garbage offers.<p>But even of the ones I want... There are many places offering to sell me lunch today, and there are several places where I&#x27;d be interested in eating lunch.  I can only eat one lunch today, though.<p>So I think we have the same thing, just with much smaller offers.')
