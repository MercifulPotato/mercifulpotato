Christianity says humans were god&#x27;s best creation, Enlightement - the pinnacle of evolution. I heard Islam has, or used to have, a much friendlier approach(nothing related to goats) and it remains to this day in countries like Turkey. People are friendly towards stray animals and even build houses for them. The West instead divides them into pets, wild, and livestock.')
