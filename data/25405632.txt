Item(by='koonsolo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607856082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400265, text='&gt; In our era, arguing society needs to create new legal and policy structures to ensure social media and these global public squares best serve us all seems reasonable to propose.<p>I fully agree with that. But I think the point that I&#x27;m trying to make is different.<p>&gt; we have not been a position before where there are a few global scale &#x27;public squares&#x27; under centralized corporate control<p>I think that we differ in opinion here. The novelty from my point of view is not &#x27;centralized corporate control&#x27;, because we always had that. The novelty is &#x27;global scale public squares&#x27;, because we never had that at this scale.<p>So the real novelty and concern in my opinion is not that corporations try to control those squares, but more that those squares are opened up to everyone to say any crazy thing they want.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for or against it, because I think it&#x27;s a very complex topic. I dislike censorship just like anyone else, but I also dislike spreading disinformation to large groups of people.')
