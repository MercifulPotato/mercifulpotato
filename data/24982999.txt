It isn’t a rite of passage to delete a production database, it’s an extreme accident &#x2F; fuck up. Stop normalising this. The guy literally deleted the machine without even thinking about the impact.<p>2. There was no backup. At all. Not even one. Not even one from a week ago. I can’t have any sympathy for someone hosting a production database without any backups running at all. A backup didn’t fail - they literally had purposefully not set up a backup.<p>3. Using a cloud provider and hosting your entire infrastructure on one virtual machine including your critical persistence layer with no replication. This is so stupid I can’t even begin to feel sympathy.<p>There’s nothing to be learned from this article other than the fact the author makes it a habit to implement bad practices.')
