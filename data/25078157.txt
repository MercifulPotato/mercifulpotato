Taking into account the amount of combustible material in the target areas, they estimate 5 Tg of soot aerosol particles into the upper atmosphere.<p>They apply climate models to that and get a mean 1.8 C temperature reduction and 8% precipitation reduction for at least 5 years. Using state of the art crop models they estimate the food loss over that time, with the strongest effects in temperate regions of the US, Europe, and China for 10 to 15 years.<p>It&#x27;s not an end of humanity scenario, but it seems it would be a lot worse than any past volcanic eruptions. A lot of people would go hungry, and not just in the poorest countries.<p>This particular scenario seems particularly worrisome because both India and Pakistan depend on Himalayan glaciers for a large part of their fresh water, and climate change is hitting those. India and Pakistan already hate each other, so it is not hard to imagine a fight breaking out over dwindling regional water supplies.<p>Here&#x27;s an article about that paper that summarizes it well [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;13&#x2F;7071" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;13&#x2F;7071</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;even-limited-india-pakistan-nuclear-war-would-bring-global-famine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;even-limited-india-...</a>')
