They said yes, if I committed to another years lease.<p>Saving 5% of rent, at the cost of a one year commitment didn&#x27;t seem like a win, so I politely declined explaining my reasoning, and suggested we leave things as they are.<p>A week or so later, out of the blue by my rent got adjusted by 10%+ instead of 5% with no need to commit to stay.<p>Sufficed to say, if their intention was for me to stay put, it worked!')
