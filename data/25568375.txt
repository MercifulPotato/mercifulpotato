Why can&#x27;t I choose the keyboard layout?<p>This is actually a fantastic point! Some models of Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;Lenovo have easily removed keyboards by design in order to install additional RAM&#x2F;service parts etc. All they have keeping them connected other than some sliding plastic tabs is the ribbon cable. I can&#x27;t believe no one has ever made drop in replacements either from the manufacturer or as aftermarket parts. Having Ctrl&#x2F;Alt&#x2F;Super&#x2F;Fn keys in a dozen different configurations due to different vendors makes switching between different devices a huge pain.<p>Imagine if you could even get customised switches on your laptop!')
