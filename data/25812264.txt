A lack of failure is a sign of a lack of trying anything new.<p>Hasn’t SpaceX proved that?<p>The negative commentary around this seems a little in contrast to how we’d talk about a SpaceX “failure” on HN.<p>I know NASA and SpaceX are very different, but Elon is the king of drifting deadlines too. And SpaceX do fail, but they do a good job of “owning their failures” and they keep moving forwards.<p>Should we cut the NASA team a bit of slack?<p>Let’s not forget also that it’s NASA who have also drastically changed their strategy and have enabled private companies like SpaceX to shine through their partnerships.<p>NASA is big, wasteful, bureaucratic yes, but they are changing, slowly... and this “failure” is not the stick I’d choose to beat them with.')
