If you want to unseat Acrobat and PDF, I think you&#x27;ll have to provide something that has equivalent or greater power.<p>As for multi-image container formats, I think we already have that: cbz&#x2F;cbr.  Just a zip or rar archive with images in it, to be displayed in order by name.  This &#x27;format&#x27; is in common use already for scans of comic books.  There are numerous viewers you can use to open and browse these files.  Something to consider though; accessibility.  A screen reader needs to use OCR to read these files to people with impaired vision.  PDF files aren&#x27;t fantastic for screen readers either, but they&#x27;re <i>much</i> better than just a JPEG.  I&#x27;d love to see some sort of subtitle system for images (I think mpv could probably overlay a subtitle sidecar on a still image, but that&#x27;s not widely supported. \nText-based subtitles formats are easy to wire into text to speech though.)')
