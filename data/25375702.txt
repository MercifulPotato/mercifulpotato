That in itself is worth the skip level person knowing.<p>For this is less about being careful, and more about not going off on a spontaneous rant, which honestly, isn&#x27;t a good idea to do for the chain of command anyway. Spontaneous rants are for your peers. Deliberate communication up and down the COF.<p>My two cents anyway.')
