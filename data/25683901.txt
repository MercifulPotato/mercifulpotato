I was curious to know what HN readers have in mind about this topic.<p>For me, there are 2 objects I find wonderful and can look at it for hours:<p>- The RaspberryPI Zero because of its size and design. The circuit is wonderful (the mix of gold and green) and how powerful it is for its size. I&#x27;m still amazed that this is a computer.<p>- The MiniDisc because it looks like a something retro but also futuristic. I never had a player, I only have a blank disc I bought before it disappear. It&#x27;s also a format you will see in movies (like Matrix or Interstella 5555). I think because I never used one, it feels like I&#x27;m holding some kind some sci-fi object. I assume how silly it sounds for an old (and failed) music format.<p>What&#x27;s yours?')
