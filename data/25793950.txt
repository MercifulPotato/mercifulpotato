War in Europe began in September 1939.  So the US didn&#x27;t do anything until September 1943?  Bull.  (I mean, I guess they didn&#x27;t land in Europe until Italy, which was 1943.  But even though it wasn&#x27;t in Europe, they were still fighting Germany in Africa in 1942.)<p>&gt;  It only joined the war after Europeans had already killed more than 23 million Germans, and destroyed most of its military.<p>German military casualties were only 5.3 million by the high estimate.  Total German casualties were only 7.4 million by the high estimate - for the whole war.  So... I don&#x27;t know where you get your ideas, but they are objectively very wrong.')
