I really love Slate but the Android support was a non-starter for me, and I ended up using React-Quill.  It has its own share of issues, but at least the native editing was decent on Android.  I talked with Sunny about working on the Android port on Slate&#x27;s GitHub earlier in the year, and spent a few days working to add support myself based on his earlier work, but it was not what I wanted to focus on for my application at the time and I decided not to pursue Slate further.  It&#x27;s very impressive they can get the sponsorship to do this and it makes me really excited for Slate&#x27;s future.')
