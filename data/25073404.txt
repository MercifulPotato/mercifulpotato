The car doesn&#x27;t know how to navigate it. Neither will the driver.<p>I certainly hope both know how to handle it.   In your scenario there is no &quot;good&quot; option, but there definitely is a least-bad option.   Likely it&#x27;s to stand on the brakes and scrub off as much speed as you can before hitting the pedestrian.   It might change the collision from a fatal one into &quot;just&quot; broken bones.')
