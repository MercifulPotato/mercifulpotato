It&#x27;s titled &quot;Or, a case for using punctuation in Slack&quot;, and then spends almost the rest of the post discussing the issue with acronyms&#x2F;initialisms&#x2F;shorthand.<p>I totally agree about shorthand. It can be unnecessarily ambiguous. But punctuation isn&#x27;t related to acronyms, I don&#x27;t think? As others have pointed out, punctuation over instant-messaging services can add meaning you don&#x27;t intend. I generally don&#x27;t capitalize the first letter of sentences or end messages with periods in IM applications.<p>If they had just named it &quot;A case for avoiding use of shorthand in Slack&quot;, I&#x27;d 100% agree.')
