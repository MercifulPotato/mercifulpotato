Item(by='adolph', descendants=None, kids=[25851582], score=None, time=1611169427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846622, text='Clifford Stoll&#x27;s book <i>The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg</i> has an interesting and nuanced take on TIA advocate Adm. John Poindexter&#x27;s ideas. Late in the book Stoll comes to agree at least partly with what he describes as Poindexter&#x27;s idea that any particular piece of data the hackers acquired was not critical, but when enough information was gathered and organized the new insights available to an adversary were critical. On the other side, Stoll takes extraordinary steps to coordinate government response to the hackers, much of which was ensuring information flow.<p>Is any sufficiently information sensitive government different from the Stasi? I think the difference may be what is done with the information. Is the information used arbitrarily, unequally or as blackmail, or are laws and rules enforced without favor? Do people have incentives to report the transgressions of others? Does the system increase or decrease trust within a society?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_(book)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_(book)</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Poindexter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Poindexter</a>')
