Then they managed to design a problem, highly specific to their computer&#x27;s design, that would be too hard to solve on a classical computer (hence “«quantum supreme»”).<p>On the scale :<p>0. Computer solves a specifically crafted problem &lt; 1. computer solves one preexisting problem &lt; 2. computer solves several existing problems &lt; 3. computer solves all theoretically solvable problems.<p>Google&#x27;s result is at 0, while this is a 1.<p>(By solve&#x2F;theoretically solvable I mean: solve faster than a classical computer, and should be solvable faster with quantum than classical)')
