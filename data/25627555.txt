I am still using it in my personal web projects with a lot enjoyment.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t use it on any projects with more than maybe 3 team members for mainly three reasons:<p>- Very steep learning curve despite the seemly simple syntax.<p>- The community is shrinking with many high profile OSS projects being effectively abandoned, while most other languages&#x27; communities are growing.<p>- Clojure is just bringing too much freedom for most average developers.<p>If it&#x27;s just me, I will have no hesitation and always pick Clojure as my main language.')
