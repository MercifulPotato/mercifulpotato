This may change as specific institutions and programs gain a solid reputation, but an online degree from a virtual school no one has ever heard of has a very steep uphill battle. Programs from established bricks &amp; mortar universities have a better reputation but still fight the stigma. Some of this is fair. A university is not supposed to be a factory for pumping knowledge into your head as fast as possible; it should be a full community and we&#x27;ve learned this past year how hard it is to build fully online communities. Ironically as many successful in-person universities rush to hand out as many degrees as possible they are weakening their key differentiator from online competition. I suspect online-only will become more competitive and respected but it will take time.')
