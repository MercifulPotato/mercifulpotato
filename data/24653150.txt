Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[24654090, 24653501, 24653872], score=None, time=1601570797, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652710, text='&gt; The US system probably is overly harsh -- in Ireland it&#x27;s probaby overly lenient and the pendulum affect is that we&#x27;ve criminals being called in to court with literally hundreds of prior convictions and then they&#x27;re let off with suspended sentences and then go straight back to what they were doing.<p>FWIW, it&#x27;s not evenly distributed in the US. We have jurisdictions like Chicago where violent offenders are released on probation after a few months or years only to reoffend. Further, these violent crimes aren&#x27;t evenly distributed across Chicago, but rather they disproportionately affect poor, typically minority communities. It&#x27;s well-known that crime (esp violent) is driving businesses (and jobs) out of these communities and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Presumably these light-on-crime policies (and similarly &quot;defund the police&quot;) are a misguided attempt to help these communities, since the criminal justice system is biased against the poor and minorities (and men, but that seems to not factor into any calculus); however, they&#x27;re exacerbating the very problem they purport to solve. Indeed, Chicago appears to be on track for its most violent year since the gang wars of the early nineties, after <i>decades</i> of consistent, remarkable, commendable progress.<p>For me, this underscores the importance of properly understanding the dynamics of the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve--it&#x27;s not sufficient to be well-intentioned or to have the right bumper sticker. It also highlights the importance of free-speech and open inquiry, since we can&#x27;t collectively understand these dynamics without the kind of robust debate that proponents of political correctness and cancel culture aspire to suppress. And note that their intentions are presumably good--they don&#x27;t want (at least some) hateful talking points to be espoused; however, the well-being of these communities isn&#x27;t worth trading in exchange for the suppression of hateful talking points (never mind the more abstract reasons for preserving free speech, such as &quot;what happens when your ideological cohort falls out of power and someone else gets to decide what speech is permissible?&quot;) and moreover prior to the mainstreaming of restrictive-speech ideals (let&#x27;s say circa 2014-2015 but this is all pretty fuzzy), this really wasn&#x27;t a problem--American society did a pretty good job of marginalizing those who would openly espouse hateful viewpoints (although some will advocate for a meaninglessly broad definition of &#x27;hate&#x27; or would argue that any speech from anyone they don&#x27;t like can fairly be considered a &#x27;racist dogwhistle&#x27;, but those kinds of bad faith arguments notwithstanding...) and things were gradually improving for everyone.<p>Anyway, I apologize for going a bit off track. Hopefully this stream-of-consciousness prompts productive discussion and introspection.')
