Some of them can tell time using GPS with atomic precision. Quartz watches don&#x27;t require regular servicing, and are accurate to Â±5 seconds per year for the better models. If telling time is what you want, you won&#x27;t buy a mechanical watch, the same way you won&#x27;t buy a wood-burning stove for cooking. Smart watches like Apple watch can also do many other things. Buying a mechanical watch is utterly irrational, if you subtract the status, scarcity, and design components.')
