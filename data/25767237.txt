Item(by='randcraw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610568184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763714, text='True, but Q&amp;A makes up a tiny fraction of most lectures I&#x27;ve attended, and attention span can be improved by shortening the duration of each lecture.<p>However, I&#x27;d agree that lack of dynamic peer interaction is a big problem with video-based instruction that hasn&#x27;t yet been fixed.  I&#x27;ve seen attempts to address this like Piazza where students can post questions or answer others&#x27;, but text-based  forums lack graphical or temporal cues that many concept demand.  Maybe some sort of multiuser video supplement might help, where the question poser could snip the time mark of a puzzling section from the lecture or an illustration from another video and refer to it in source so others could visualize with a click the point being asked?')
