After a while they tend to develop this headache inducing high pitched tone almost akin to tinnitus that is emitted constantly while they&#x27;re powered on. It seems to be so high pitched most people cannot hear it at all but if you&#x27;re one of the lucky few who can it can actually be really disruptive. Unfortunately it&#x27;s also often loud enough to hear through doors, walls, etc... Please be mindful of this before setting up a CRT if you go down this path. For example a house might be better for this setup vs an apartment or condo.')
