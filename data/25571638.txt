I have 4 or more copies of the art of war, each with different translators. Dante’s inferno, the Illiad, Dostoyevsky, Beowulf, Confucius: some translations are unreadable and one or two incredible. Automation is just not going to produce the really good translations. The only benefit of a technique like this will be to generate unlicensed translations of work that will not otherwise get translated, which isn’t even that big a deal because the communities already produce unlicensed translations of just about everything.<p>Edit: The other use is to help create better context aware data scrapers that can combine bi-modal information streams and add some body language understanding. I guess it will probably end up in automated surveillance tech like security cameras&#x2F;mics etc if it works.')
