I don&#x27;t buy it, you even explained the type elision using standard mathematical notaion in your original comment.<p>So if there is some superior notation that would benefit all of maths, that sounds very interesting but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve made that point very well. Maybe a better example is needed, because on its own, eliding repetitive information from notation does not seem like a problem.')
