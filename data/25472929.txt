Microsoft? I cant see it... Windows has been able to run on x86&#x2F;x64, ARM, MIPS, Alpha, PPC and more since the beginning of time (well, NT4) and granted, they haven&#x27;t released a lot of that code in a while, but i would guess its still there... remember, xbox360 was based on PPC...<p>Also, given they sell an OS to other manufactures to install on their own machines, they are going to keep that running for a while. Same with servers... Even in the Azure side, they are allowing enterprise and OEMs build Azure Stack. I cant see them locking it down... But Apple? yes... its already locked down...')
