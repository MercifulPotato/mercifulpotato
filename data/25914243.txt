(I think it was also GPD who offered some retro consoles?)\nSo this was the main reason for that, but it took really long to come out, and while it was great, not least to the great community and their support, it was very niche, already a bit long in the tooth technically and maybe not as open as some had hoped.<p>I think they started plan for the pyra pretty soon after that, if memory serves, to improve on the pandoras shortcomings.<p>These days, I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would still want this. The form factor is great (Though the pandora did have production issues surrounding the case, not sure if they are ironed out), but retro games consoles are everywhere and you can buy SBCs for pocket change. And as others have pointed out, at the price this thing costs there are pretty good subnotebooks available again at the moment.<p>So while I really don&#x27;t know who wants this in 2021, If the could get you say a shell for a raspberry pi or similar in this form factor for a much more reasonable price, I would absolutely be on board myself.')
