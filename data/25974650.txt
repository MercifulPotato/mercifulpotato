A bit of background here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freedesktop.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;wayland-devel&#x2F;2013-May&#x2F;009497.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freedesktop.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;wayland-devel&#x2F;2013-Ma...</a><p>To illustrate, I usually use a simple example: How do you render a 20px tall font at scale 1 2&#x2F;3 without being blurry or without rounding errors? And if you wanted to avoid any additional scaling artifacts or rounding errors, how tall would you make the output buffer, in pixels? What happens when you try to stretch this window across multiple screens?')
