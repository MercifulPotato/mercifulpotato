There&#x27;s the bash as a CLI users and bash as a scripting language users. I&#x27;m firmly in camp one and I think it&#x27;s an important difference to realize.<p>I don&#x27;t want my CLI to be a REPL for a scripting language. It&#x27;s something I really disliked about PowerShell when I tried it. It just felt like a dotnet scripting language and not like a CLI.<p>If Oil provides a scripting interface with structured types etc. I&#x27;m all for it. I just don&#x27;t want to have to deal with it when using the shell interactively. I love it when writing scripts and programs, but not for interactive shell use.')
