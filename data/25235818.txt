Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=[25235981], score=None, time=1606546171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235476, text='&gt; I am optimistic that these kinds of devices will get more people on two-wheeled personal transportation but I’m concerned about the people going 30mph on bike paths or riding in the road with no education.<p>At 20MPH your turbo assist turns off completely leaving the rider in this weird state where 1MPH slower is easy and 1MPH faster is brutal. If you are going 30MPH anywhere on this, it&#x27;s because you are a world-class cyclist or are going downhill.<p>People ride on roads with no education all the time, we call them drivers. People going 20MPH on a 30 pound bike aren&#x27;t dangerous to others. People surfing the web while driving a 6 ton truck are dangerous to everyone.<p>&gt; Tangentially I’m disappointed that electric drive has translated to “no rules” on roads and bike paths.<p>This is literally every form of transportation. There were no&#x2F; terrible rules around cars when they came out as well.')
