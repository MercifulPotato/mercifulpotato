They&#x27;re not the same thing.<p>Actual racism is very rare in America. Prejudice is commonplace and has a lot more to do with the inherent tribalism of humanity than it does actual malice for someone&#x27;s &quot;race&quot;. And to take it even further, I think if people were honest, what they really dislike is cultural differences that vary dramatically from theirs.<p>To me this is just like trans issues... we&#x27;ll never get anywhere significant with this stuff, because in order to come up with meaningful answers, you have to ask meaningful, hard questions. No one wants to ask these kinds of questions, because no one wants to have to deal with the answers that <i>may</i> come up, because that will also invite further study and further difficult, unpleasant conversations.')
