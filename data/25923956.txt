If a web page fails to load properly with the absence of any scripts, then that site is poorly optimized and deserves to be ignored*.&quot;<p>As much as I would like for this to be true, it is unfortunately wrong.  I routinely browse with the NoScript Security Suite add-on, and more than half of the sites I visit require JavaScript.  In some cases the page will not even load.  In many cases the page will load, but none of the links will function.<p>I wish that web design standards required non-JavaScript enabled browsers to function, but I just don&#x27;t see it ever happening.')
