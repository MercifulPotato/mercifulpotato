I&#x27;ve been working a booth at a convention showing off some tech and asked a passing worker for an extension cord.  The response was that they asked on the radio, but the only person available to perform this role was on lunch so it&#x27;d be at least 45 minutes until I could get an extension cord.<p>I have had this happen in many different situations when working with union members.<p>Anecdotally, I do not want to be a part of any union that has these types of rules.')
