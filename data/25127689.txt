But the editorializing work is being done by other users.<p>I guess here it becomes a matter of responsibility. Since the platform is still the one publishing the content in an editorialized manner, I think you could argue they are still responsible for it.<p>Where as something where when you visit the platform you&#x27;d just see a list of posts in most recent order. And then it be the user navigating that would need to make &quot;editorial&quot; decision, by filtering or searching through the content on their own. Now you could say it is truly the user doing the editorializing.<p>I guess the distinction is, the user consuming content should be doing their own selection. If the platform selects things for you in any way, even if based on feedback from other users, it means as a user consuming content on it you are getting an editorial perspective.')
