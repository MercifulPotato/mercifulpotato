It&#x27;s easy to get induction wrong even in simple math problems let alone trying to pigeonhole humanity into tidy formula. The idea that the market will regulate itself because (... because what?) is also lazy. The bottom line is it really makes a great deal of sense to say,&quot;hey, don&#x27;t drink bleach,&quot; &quot;hey, no Nazis on this platform please!&quot;, &quot;hey, it&#x27;s highly unlikely Hillary Clinton is a pedophile&quot; - This is serious - this is real life and in good conscience we should all be supportive of this kind of &quot;censorship&quot; for the good of humanity.')
