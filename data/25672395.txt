(But now that it&#x27;s come up, in theory if this were to be implemented, I think there could possibly be ways of proactively providing as many people as possible with IDs without requiring them to spend money or time to obtain it; maybe this could be done over a years-long process before adding any requirements. I don&#x27;t know all the nuances, though.)<p>I was just trying to talk about this specific argument and how it&#x27;s often used in isolation to create a certain way of seeing things that I think is based on shaky grounds.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to take any ideological stance, but just discuss epistemology in general. (Though for the record, I&#x27;ve only ever voted and will very likely only ever vote Democrat. I promise I don&#x27;t have any ulterior motives regarding this topic and am a strong supporter of voter enfranchisement. Risk assessment in general just is a component of my job and hobbies.)')
