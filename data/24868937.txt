It is dirt simple and exposes their award-winning machine-learning powered search in useful ways.<p>Spotify&#x27;s looks attractive but daily use makes me miss Google&#x27;s app. Spotify&#x27;s web player loses pretty hard to Google&#x27;s for me, as well.<p>That said, I just can&#x27;t stomach YT Music. I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking. The new value proposition for Premium is ad-free YouTube, which I might just keep buying because I&#x27;m addicted to celebrity math professors, astronomy, and a few crafting&#x2F;DIY channels these days. But I&#x27;m struggling to like a music service anymore.')
