There are tons of people who graduated from a great school xyz whose only real accomplishment is graduating from xyz. Do not let labels define what you can do with your life, once you buy into that game, you are mentally boomed for the rest of your life. Einstein certainly never said &quot;oh i work at a patent office, which must mean i can&#x27;t become a world class physicist&quot;, no one (or institution) owns creativity, knowledge, passion or drive, and those are the most important qualities that drive the world.')
