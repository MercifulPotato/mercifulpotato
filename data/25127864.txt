Emojis allow one to instantly mark a piece of writing as informal&#x2F;non-serious with minimal effort. This includes irony - “eggplant_emojii” is often a non-serious reply indicating that “I am jokingly acting like this this is sexual or attractive”<p>It’s a proxy for longer writing. “Thumbsup_emoji” is a substitute for some marginally harder to articulate feelings of “looks good &#x2F; I like it”<p>Of course, there are many subcultures that use emoji in different ways and as proxies for other things as well. At a previous employer we’d often just send “taco_emoji?” to ask who was buying lunch. It’s the sort of thing that can be used&#x2F;abused in many different ways.')
