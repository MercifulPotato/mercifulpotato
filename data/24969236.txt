I work as a freelancer helping not-quite-startups-anymore with things like CI speedup and tuning the database queries emitted by their ORM. You know, things where it&#x27;s easy to build up technical debt.<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for a team of 3-4 to build so many tests and add so many linters and whatnot that CI takes more than an hour. Often, some basic love can bring it down to ~5 minutes but many teams are so focused on building new features that they will not take time to sharpen their tools.')
