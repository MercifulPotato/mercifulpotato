When I notice it veering into unhealthy territory, I try to use mindfulness techniques to reel it in. Still, it&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; in that it&#x27;s not indicative of mental illness other than maybe social anxiety.<p>But I disagree slightly on #3. My frame of reference is thru-hiking and&#x2F;or intense solo missions where I&#x27;m alone in the backcountry hiking for 10-14 hours a day for days on end. In that setting, I find it impossible to stay mindful continuously. Also, without news&#x2F;email&#x2F;social media&#x2F;etc. as input, I just find that my mind gravitates towards internal dialogues about the same big picture life issues. In that state, I&#x27;m actually listening to my body and mind more, not less. Personally, it can be frustrating to worry about whether I&#x27;m &quot;in the moment&quot; enough (the quintessential frustration with mindfulness, I know).<p>That said, I do try to mix it up between fully immersing myself in the wonderment of the wilderness, letting my mind chew on ideas, listening to podcasts&#x2F;music, and sometimes attempting actual meditation sessions.')
