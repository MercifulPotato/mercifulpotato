I didn&#x27;t realize those were Rumsfeld&#x27;s remarks - my fault, I didn&#x27;t bother to re-read the transcript after recognizing the {known, unknown} X {knowns, unknowns} thing, which I studied in the past. That said, this doesn&#x27;t change my response to it.<p>There&#x27;s a pattern of confusing&#x2F;faulty reasoning that I&#x27;ve noticed, which I highlighted in my previous comment. I don&#x27;t have a name for it yet - but it boils down to noticing a thing or possibility exists and arguing just from it, without bothering to ask how much of it there is &#x2F; how likely it is. It&#x27;s reasoning in an unnecessary fog of war, kind of similar to arguing from point statistics (e.g. average and stdev) instead of looking at the actual distributions.')
