Having a MIDI capture device always on could help me capture all that (and subsequently use in production, or more likely realize that I am no genius even with recording light off).<p>I can also see a MIDI recorder useful in DAWless modular synth setups and&#x2F;or live gigs.<p>One feature I could see being important is a hardware button to place a marker while recording, to make it easier to locate parts of longer performances.<p>&gt; To keep things simple, because we’re only writing this code for some debugging (and maybe fun), we’ll use the standard twelve tone equal temperament tuning<p>Question: which tuning would you use otherwise?<p>&gt; Tuscan DR-05<p>Looks like a funny autocorrection artifact.')
