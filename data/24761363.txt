If you don&#x27;t defend yourself in civil court and the plaintiff doesn&#x27;t make blatantly unreasonable demands, the court will issue a default judgement and wash their hands of it until you <i>do</i> go to court. If you&#x27;re blatantly flouting the law, you&#x27;re entitled to <i>much</i> better legal protections than this case seems to imply.')
