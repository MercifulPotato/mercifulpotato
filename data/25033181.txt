IMO the mistake that a lot of people are making here is to think that iOS devices should be more like computers. They are popular and successful because they are <i>less</i> like computers. They&#x27;re arcade machines, VCRs, appliances, and that is what people like about them, and what keeps them safe for people to use without lots of precautions and junk like antivirus software.<p>Like many of us, I am where I am today because I had access from a relatively young age, to computers that demanded you program them. I was there when you turned a computer on and it said &quot;READY&quot; and you were immediately in a BASIC interpreter. I absolutely recognise the value of that for future generations, which is why I&#x27;ll be buying a Raspberry Pi 400 for our eldest son&#x27;s upcoming 10th birthday, but I also recognise the value in being able to have had him use an iPad for the last few years and have it be nearly frictionless.')
