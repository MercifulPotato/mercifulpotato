It&#x27;s the simplest language of the three, and it&#x27;s the lingua franca of systems programming. You will have tons of resources and examples to work from. And you won&#x27;t get stuck&#x2F;frustrated over type system or lifetime issues. You&#x27;ll always be making progress with C even if it&#x27;s buggy.<p>While learning C, I highly recommend that you dabble in Rust. Rust has introduced important concepts to programming that will not go away, and just does a lot of things really well, including C integration. You also might appreciate the really easy cross compilation system for embedded development.')
