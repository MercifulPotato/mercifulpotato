I imagine one could write a paragraph (or more) on each, and one could setup a whole process of following through with all of them.<p>In fact, this is inspiring:  I&#x27;m going to put these in a list and review them regularly and try to take a (small) action on each.  Anyone wanna try it with me?<p>BTW - only two that I disagree with:<p>&gt; 13. When googling a recipe, precede it with ‘best’. You’ll find better recipes.<p>No.  You&#x27;ll find recipes whose authors did bare-minimum SEO, not produced better recipes.<p>&gt; 25. History remembers those who got to market first. Getting your creation out into the world is more important than getting it perfect.<p>Yes BUT:  First-mover advantage is a thing, but it is by no means THE thing.
