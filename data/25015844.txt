I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s one of the reasons I (and I&#x27;m guessing others) decided to try Arch. If that&#x27;s where you are getting the best info, it&#x27;s a good indication of the quality of the distribution and active community.<p>I know Arch users at times have a reputation of being not very newbie friendly, but when you have such a great resource like the wiki, it really does answer just about anything. I&#x27;ve used it to set up full disk encryption, resize partitions, and fix many random quirks in all sorts of programs. Happy to run Arch as my only OS on a desktop, laptop, and Pi.')
