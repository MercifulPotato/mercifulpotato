A Starlink satellite&#x27;s bandwidth is shared with everyone under its radius, so any throttling&#x2F;bandwidth caps is going to be even worse. A quick search says that each starlink satellite provides 20 Gbps each, which works out to 6.57PB per month, or around 5000 1.2TB&#x2F;month users. This is the best case scenario, assuming that their usage is uniformly distributed per month. Most bandwidth use is bursty (think netflix in the evening), so in reality it&#x27;s actually going to be much worse. Assuming a 4K stream at 25 Mb&#x2F;s, one satellite would only service 800 users. Given comcasts&#x27; statistics (5% of users use more than 1.2TB&#x2F;month), that would mean you need dozens of satellites to service all the heavy users in even a small town.')
