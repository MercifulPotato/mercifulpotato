Going to a dentist for a cleaning or whatever is <i>maybe</i> higher risk (more contact but medical professionals) but it also seems more important to stick with your schedule than getting your hair cut is.<p>(Their answers also are presumably influenced by how frequently they would normally do the activities in question as well as the degree to which they&#x27;re available at the moment. During normal times I&#x27;d be <i>much</i> more likely to have recently flown someplace than gone to a wedding or even a live sporting event.)')
