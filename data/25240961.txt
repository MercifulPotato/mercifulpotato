For many cities, riding at 35 km&#x2F;h on average also sounds pretty dangerous.<p>A range of 72 km seems excessive, too. That&#x27;s a 2-hour ride, which sounds like something you&#x27;d do as a leisure activity rather than on an everyday basis.<p>That said, I&#x27;m quite bullish on the future of bikes as a mode of transport in general.')
