A lot of the common criticisms levied at PHP have been corrected years ago, and PHP is responsible for hundreds of billions of dollars of turnover globally.<p>So does Java, Python, C and C++. This is also a shallow argument. No language is perfect but PHP still suffer from the same design issues a 10&#x2F;15 years ago, none of them have been correct and it&#x27;s perfectly valid to point that out.<p>&gt; My employer makes billions with PHP. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s rock solid for gigantic businesses.<p>And with C, since PHP is written in C and probably whatever fronts your PHP applications, and with Javascript because you sure ain&#x27;t running PHP on the client and so on and so forth...')
