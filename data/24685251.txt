Item(by='reificator', descendants=None, kids=[24685996], score=None, time=1601881435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683750, text='&gt; <i>Yes, get rid of the niceties when you&#x27;re under the kind of time pressure and situation you might find in an emergency room and you&#x27;re bleeding.</i><p>Again it&#x27;s my fault, I brought up storytelling and was complaining about that.  I&#x27;m not upset at the word &quot;please&quot; or something.  Your posts keep saying niceties and my posts keep saying stories, which makes me think either you&#x27;re not hearing my repeated admissions of sidetracking or you&#x27;re intentionally pushing an agenda.<p>&gt; &gt; <i>That&#x27;s fair, I waded in to discuss a related pet issue and it&#x27;s probably not fair to have posted the way I did.</i><p>Was my wording there.<p>&gt; <i>As to an emergency room not looking like a sausage fest, the stats don&#x27;t back you up.</i><p>As I understand it emergency rooms work with EMS but most people <i>in</i> the emergency room are not EMS.  If those stats do extend to the E.R. workers then I wonder whether my local E.R. does something different or if it&#x27;s purely chance, but I&#x27;d estimate 70% female at least.<p>Either way the point was an analogy.  Bug reports are for the bug details.  There are other venues to talk about how much this leftPad library changed your life.  That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m trying to say.<p>It&#x27;s very strange how in this thread maintainers who prefer ass kissing are egotistical and dominating, and maintainers who don&#x27;t require ass kissing and would be more comfortable if you left it off are also egotistical and dominating.  Is the message you want to convey simply that I should not volunteer my time to helping people?')
