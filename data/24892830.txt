As I see it the issue comes from the profit motive, which is a lot more complicated to solve than it might first appear. You could do something like give the fine revenue away in a lottery to charities, but even then you’d still have some issues.<p>The other side of that argument is that the payment of the fine to the government is supposed to play a restorative role in whatever crime you have committed against the community. But I don’t think there’s a way to operate a system like that that does lead to this type of corruption.')
