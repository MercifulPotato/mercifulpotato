The US has in fact been in a yin state due to regulatory capture of bad actors taking over and controlling systems, extracting value, for their own selfish reasons - and leaving less, distributing less for others. Policy wise the different complexes that have reenforced to allow this are easy to shift.<p>The ability for private companies to deplatform who they want is a feature, it&#x27;s a failsafe against authoritarianism and tyranny - and it&#x27;s not black and white, all or nothing - it&#x27;s a spectrum or gradient, and it can be evolved with good core policies like those that will break apart the duopoly and reduce the power of amalgamated mainstream media; I hope you&#x27;re aware of Andrew Yang and his core policy proposals which will do just that.<p>I&#x27;m mentally too tired to reply thoroughly to the rest of what you say, however you&#x27;re right in that there is a beast on both sides of the duopoly that&#x27;s integrated with mainstream media who will sensationalize - and stir up both sides however much they can for the sake of views and revenue. So I don&#x27;t agree with your premise that either side had actual control of what narrative was presented, which is a problem in of itself - and one pro of social media is people like Yang who can share what they&#x27;ve learned and interact with others online without the gatekeeping of TV channels and newspapers, a relatively direct connection to people interest in tuning into your individual channel; 3 days ago he also stated: &quot;For Cable News we should revive the Fairness Doctrine which the FCC had on the books until 1985 that required that you show both sides of a political issue. It was repealed by Reagan. If there was ever a time to bring it back itâ€™s now.&quot; - the thread is here where he discusses this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JanPerry&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347211706162769921" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JanPerry&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347211706162769921</a> - he begins by saying &quot;There are 3 problems with our media that are fueling polarization: ...&quot;<p>This is a perfectly fine place for your &quot;bullshit&quot; - you didn&#x27;t name call, so you&#x27;re all good in my books.')
