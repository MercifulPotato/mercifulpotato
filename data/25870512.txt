That means there&#x27;s no Virtual Machine or Hyper-V involved (unless you want), so Linux Containers run on Windows itself using Windows 10&#x27;s built in container support&quot;.<p>In any case, as Linux and macOS prove, there&#x27;s no need for docker to have to run on a VM. And it seems there&#x27;s no need on Windows either since 10.')
