Way better projects, way better fees and longer term ongoing clients are almost always from your personal network.<p>This means working with local small businesses vs working with Fortune 500 companies and NFL teams in my case.<p>So feel free to reach out, I think physical mailings would work better for local businesses.<p>I see cold pitch emails come in to contact forms all the time, they aren&#x27;t very polished though so if you craft them just right you might have success. Especially if you&#x27;re a customer or met the owner at some point, include that in the email. Or send them a link to a mock up of their website and list off issues&#x2F;improvements you would do for their site.<p>If you are at a visit in person and notice they need a new website that&#x27;s a great time to ask who you could talk to about a new website or get their email&#x2F;phone number to contact them when they aren&#x27;t busy (you can&#x27;t talk business during the busiest part of their day).<p>Cold email, it&#x27;s possible, but difficult.')
