Judging from your name, I guess that you know the following things, but I will argue the point for other readers:<p>ARD (the channel) has by far the biggest market share of all the channels in its union. As a viewer, I do not care whether the administration of those individual channels (in Germany called &quot;third channels&quot;) is sitting in the same office or not. They are producing the same program.<p>For exmaple there is a popular crime show (Tatort), which episodes are produced by different members of ARD, so they take place in different parts of Germany. It is still fundamentally the same show, much like crime shows in the US with a city attached to their name.<p>Anecdotally, the slogan of ARD is &quot;Wir sind eins&quot; (we are one), hinting that they are the first program, but also want to be seen as one program.<p>What is specific about ARD is, that it&#x27;s divisions are organized geographically at the top. But then again, BBC also has regional channels. So my argument is: It does not really matter for the viewer. Except when he is paying, then ARD is clearly worse.')
