Her being a junior congresswoman does not disqualify her from inciting riots. One does not need to be in government at all to incite a riot. The news article I linked was not slanderous afaik and casts AOC&#x27;s pro-rioting views in a positive light. \nIt is difficult for me to compare the impact of the BLM riots to Wednesday, but I view both as preventable tragedies caused by politicians. I won&#x27;t attempt to quantify the tragedy or weigh them against each other.\nIf you only want to view Trump as culpable, I wish you all the best but I think you would be wrong.')
