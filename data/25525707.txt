Item(by='Apocryphon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608794981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525496, text='&gt; San Francisco is functionally divided into a set of groups that, as far as I can tell, rarely talk to each other. [...] SF has all the pieces of a kaleidoscopically diverse city, and yet the pieces donâ€™t talk to each other. They walk the same streets but they live in parallel, non-interacting universes.<p>This reminds me of how LA is often described, to bring up a rival city that us NorCal denizens might bristle at being compared to. LA County is a hugely diverse area, but each distinct ethnic and immigrant group has its own enclave, its own self-sustaining community. So the need for them to intermingle is lessened.')
