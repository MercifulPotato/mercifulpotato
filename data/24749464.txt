People with really huge database deployments (like machines with 4TB of ram) must be crazy if they&#x27;re not aggressively using pgbouncer to keep the number of connections down.<p>I&#x27;m actually quite heartened to hear that the attitude among Postgres developers is changing. Back in the day whenever people would bring up threads vs processes they got shouted down because processes are clearly superior and threads were &quot;just implemented as processes on linux anyway&quot;. That&#x27;s going to be one hell of a job to change now though.<p>To Tom Lane: I told you so :)')
