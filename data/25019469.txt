You’re dealing with resistive heating elements that get incredibly hot and exposed conductive wires with lethal voltages present. The liability and risk around repair is so high that I’m not surprised there’s no support for field service of it.<p>I have 2 toasters at my house, one pulls 600W while on, the other 1400W. Both toast 2 slices of bread and are otherwise the same. If someone accidentally installed the 1400W elements in the 600W toaster something would melt and possibly start a fire. I’m all for promoting the repair of consumer devices but toasters are one device that I don’t think the general public has the knowledge and skill to repair safely.')
