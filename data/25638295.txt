You&#x27;re saying homosexuality should have remained criminalized... and if that had been so people would not have been having gay sex.. and a rising epidemic would have been entirely avoided. Furthermore, you believe the gay population who died from it regretted being gay on their deathbeds? You don&#x27;t see any logical leaps in any of that?<p>Do you also think we should make a policy banning sex because it will be &quot;good policy&quot;? Just use in vitro fertilization to procreate.
