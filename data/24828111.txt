Might kill me early, might not.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to cope with it in hundreds of ways, just like people cope with their career in hundreds of ways, or their kids, or their marriage. It&#x27;s a central faucet of my life. It&#x27;s destructive as hell to shove it aside and try to &quot;forget about&quot; all the small, daily issues.<p>So I&#x27;ve learned to co-exist with it by doing the following:<p>--Like another poster mentioned, pay attention to the little things. Sleep, exercise, diet, stress levels. Treat your body like a spoiled little princess, and it&#x27;ll be less likely to throw a fit.<p>--Stay away from online &quot;support groups&quot; for chronic illness. 99% of them are toxic as hell, especially the &quot;spoonie&quot; community. Instead, seek out people who have chronic illness and are living the sort of life you want. Develop individual friendships with them, and learn from them.<p>--Educate the people around you. The stigma of chronic illness is generally less than the stigma of &quot;that person who you can sometimes depend on, but then randomly blows deadlines, and appears to be hungover all the time.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re in a safe environment, talk to your boss. Talk to your coworkers. Tell them what&#x27;s up, don&#x27;t leave them guessing, because they&#x27;re not going to guess something you like.<p>If you&#x27;re not in a safe environment, GTFO as soon as possible, salary be damned.<p>--Educate yourself as well. Not knowing is the most stressful thing, and you can mitigate a lot of that stress by developing more knowledge of your disease. Try to avoid anecdotal evidence (random forum posts, ect), and stick to respected journals and textbooks.<p>--Advocate for yourself. I was misdiagnosed six times before they finally figured out my issue. If I hadn&#x27;t demanded further testing, I would most likely be dead at the moment. (This is another area where educating yourself really pays off.)<p>--Choose a supportive partner. If they treat you like a hypochondriac, or aren&#x27;t sympathetic to your issues, then get out.<p>(On a similar note, don&#x27;t believe anyone who says chronic illness kills any hope of relationships. I have a fantastic partner, and have many chronically ill friends who do as well.)<p>--Keep a detailed diary of your symptoms and your daily activities, even when you&#x27;re feeling good. This will help you figure out what helps, what doesn&#x27;t, and what your tolerance levels are for activities, exercise, medications, ect.<p>--Stay on top of medical developments related to your disease, and reach out to any trials that may benefit you.<p>I could add a hundred other things to this list, but I think those are the important ones.<p>So yeah. Keep fighting the good fight. Again, and again, and again, and again.<p>(Edit: Took out some identifying info.)')
