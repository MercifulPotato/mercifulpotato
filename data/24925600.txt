They&#x27;re better than e.g. HD579&#x2F;HD599, but that&#x27;s a low bar to meet.<p>&gt;HD6xx<p>Are just a massdrop&#x2F;drop brand for HD650, and thus everything regarding HD650 applies to them.\nAll in all, the price difference of 58x&#x2F;6xx&#x2F;650&#x2F;600 does not make it sensible to settle for a worse headphone than HD600. Particularly since it&#x27;ll last you a lifetime. This is unlike, say, your computer&#x27;s screen.<p>And the HD660S is, besides worse, dramatically more expensive.')
