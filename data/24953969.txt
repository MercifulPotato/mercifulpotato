This is a ridiculous interpretation and the mental gymnastics to try to distinguish “slapping” from abuse, or to do victim blaming by saying it’s qualified by the woman already abusing you (wtf?) - it’s really inappropriate and upsetting to see some on HN making this argument.<p>If you aren’t realizing that your comment is sincerely amplifying misogyny, you need a sensitivity training course or something of the sort.')
