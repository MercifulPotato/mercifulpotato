They assign a unique ID to each image&#x2F;video&#x2F;file and they don&#x27;t let you download if you try to remove that ID or change it. It changes every time you reload the page. Maybe something to do with that.<p>Plus there is also massive rate limiting. Especially instagram, since it is only images.')
