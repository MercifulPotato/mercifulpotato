Yet that disingenuous angle is used constantly when people get away with something for a while and suddenly aren&#x27;t.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s interesting that anyone thinks that making a big noise about this will cause Apple to revert their stance (as app using a pill as their icon, naming it after a controlled substance, and using narrative like &quot;the most awesome keep-awake&quot;). That is improbable. It seems much more likely that Apple will be very certain this app is renamed, and the narrative changed.')
