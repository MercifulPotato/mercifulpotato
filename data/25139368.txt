Apple can&#x27;t use App Store policy to commit crimes, like extortion (e.g. offering to buy an app developer, and saying they will ban them from the store or increase their commissions to 50% if they don&#x27;t accept the buyout).<p>As long as their policies have a justifiable and legal business purpose (whether you personally agree with the policy is irrelevant) that&#x27;s applied consistently (within human limits of consistency) they should be free to make their <i>own product</i> however they want, and charge what they want for it.')
