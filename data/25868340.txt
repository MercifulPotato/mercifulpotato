That doesn&#x27;t bode well for them either.<p>All that said, claiming that one side or the other is <i>factually</i> correct without having all the evidence seems both biased and premature.<p>I&#x27;ll wait until the truth comes out.  Because in the end, it always does.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;rules&#x2F;frcp&#x2F;rule_65" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;rules&#x2F;frcp&#x2F;rule_65</a>')
