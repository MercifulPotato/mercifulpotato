Meta: It&#x27;s weird when you assume some arcane tidbit you know is widely known. Been struggling with that my entire life &#x2F; career.<p>Now I&#x27;m gonna ask my bro, doctor, and nutritionist bestie, make sure I remember correctly. IIRC, insulin response for Type 1 and Type 2 are totally different. So advice does not transfer. (My bestie is a severe Type 1. They get upset about generalizations. Stuff that works for Type 2 is life threatening for them.)')
