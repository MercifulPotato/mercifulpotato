To say something sensical in any language requires (almost by definition) some logical consistency.  Otherwise you get non-sequiturs and insane ramblings.  The greater the coherency of a narrative (e.g. paragraph-to-paragraph like GPT-3, vs. just word-to-word like a Markov chain), the greater degree of consistent logical underpinnings are needed.  So that a tool trained to produce coherent human writing by necessity has embedded in itself a tool for logical reasoning is not too surprising (not to say it isn&#x27;t impressive!).')
