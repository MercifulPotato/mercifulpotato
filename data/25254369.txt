The vast majority of lithium batteries are in landfills, compressed between all our other garbage because maybe 2% of people on the planet properly dispose of e-waste.<p>As far as clean energy, have you watched Planet of the Humans (2020)? I want to say, I despise Michael Moore emotional bullshit, but despite his influence on the film&#x27;s production, the case it makes is solid: the vast majority of &quot;renewables&quot; are actually trees. When you hear &quot;woodchips&quot; .. there is no amount of industrial wood scrap waste that is viable without also cutting down trees. You start burning fast-growing trees (often planted for paper or lumber) for fuel and you get a system of power production that makes no sense over traditional gas or oil.<p>Solar and wind may have been growing exponentially, but they still require oil&#x2F;gas standby plants. They also take a lot of resources to make. Wind turbines aren&#x27;t currently recycled.<p>The fact of the matter is, we have one real hope left. The ITER. If real fusion power is possible, we&#x27;ll find out once it&#x27;s completed. If ITER fails to produce sustainable and efficient power, it&#x27;s unlikely anyone else will get the funding to build a bigger reactor.<p>It&#x27;s not coal that&#x27;s in terminal decline ... it&#x27;s everything. No amount of increasing consumption or building &quot;more green&quot; is going to change that. We need to consume less, and let&#x27;s face it ... that&#x27;s fucking impossible.')
