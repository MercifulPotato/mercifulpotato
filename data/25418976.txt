If you tell me that your bad luck compounds so much here that you become incapable of actually doing anything, you&#x27;re just some bourgeoisie upper class person that thinks they know what it&#x27;s like to be poor. Most poor people are poor primarily because of children. Full stop. Next stop is spending excessively beyond their means. If you only make $8&#x2F;hr, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t own an iphone X and a contract with AT&amp;T.<p>Most virtue signalling leftists think that being poor means you&#x27;re entitled to comparable standards that the middle class get. That&#x27;s not the case at all. You have to evaluate what you can do to cut costs. Literally live a spartan lifestyle. Do whatever it takes to inch forward or roll with the punches. Car breaks down? Bike. Can&#x27;t bike in winter? Take the crappy bus. You have plenty of options in the west. You can&#x27;t tell me there isn&#x27;t one or more solutions to every major problem that exists here. People who get dealt bad luck often are on occasion dealing it to themselves. Have type 2 diabetes at 30? Maybe put down the big Macs. It&#x27;s not as if the universe is looking at just screwing you over.<p>I mean the overall tl;dr here is:<p>&quot;Always look on the bright side of life.&quot;<p>Otherwise you&#x27;re no different than a boring do-nothing twitter-ite that complains constantly that the world isn&#x27;t perfect.')
