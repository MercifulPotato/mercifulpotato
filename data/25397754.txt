How much power can he consume? How much is he contributing to the climate change compared to me, his son, that starts the day at 9 am and at 18 is on 20% battery?<p>An I don&#x27;t even use the smartphone that much, but hey, WFH, slack and teams are constantly checking for new messages, that friend sent you a message in IG, of course I&#x27;m gonna check my timeline. Look, a new notification, Amazon is delivering the package, let me check on the news if the streets are still closed today because they are shooting that Tom Cruise movie (it really happened few days ago!)<p>Etc. etc. How much of this could be saved?<p>On the opposite side, the construction workers who renewed my house all used old phones like Nokia 3330 because they need something though and durable that won&#x27;t die on them after a few hours, in environments where electrical power is not granted, so they go for the thing with <i>the longest</i> battery life on the market which is also <i>the cheapest</i> option and, in the end, the most power efficient.')
