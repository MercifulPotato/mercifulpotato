Saw some soldiers in the international airport area, that was it.<p>I learnt about the Rohingya ethnic cleansing before going and how the leader wouldn&#x27;t publicly condemn military actions. It now seems like she didn&#x27;t want to ruffle some feathers.<p>What&#x27;s the general attitude over there? Did anyone see this coming? I was able to meet a few locals and ate at the same three places for one month. The youth were optimistic. The city felt alive.
