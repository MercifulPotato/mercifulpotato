Item(by='Mortiffer', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605620795, title='Ask HN: The Business Problem Podcast', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Problem: Many entrepreneurs are looking for a business problem, potentially in an industry they are not hugely familiar with, and thus generally have many calls with potential customers to understand the market prior to even honing in on the specific problem they want to  validate and then solve. This is a process which each entrepreneur repeats from square zero because the community doesnâ€™t have an incentive to share. \nSolution: The Business Problem podcast.  Every month I will choose an industry and interview the people who work there. I will collate the information and give an overview of where money and time is spent and describe recurrent specific business problems. Each industry will have two episodes: one for the customer side, and the second for the solution space, aka competition-analysis. For this second episode I will interview startups as well as larger established service providers and present their methods for solving the problems mentioned in the customer episode.<p>I hope that a podcast and associated content site could accelerate the rate of innovation as a whole, because it would give entrepreneurs a better jumping off point when they dive into their own customer research, or provide inspiration for what they think would be a better solution in an existing market.')
