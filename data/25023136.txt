That seems completely backwards to me. If you&#x27;re going class D, then why not eliminate what is often one of the <i>biggest and most obvious</i> expenses and replace the linear power supply with a switching power supply?<p>Typically in these projects you spend some chunk of the BOM cost on a few nice transistors or an amp chip, another big chunk on the transformer, smaller chunks of money on capacitors, then miscellaneous ICs&#x2F;amps&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;etc. There&#x27;s some variation here between components, but it just seems bonkers to pay for a big hunk of metal for a 1960s era solution for your power supply, when you are <i>already</i> using super fancy high-speed switching circuits in the amp.<p>There is no reason that these devices should have any appreciable mass beyond the heat sink. If you&#x27;ve got a massive transformer, you&#x27;re building an amp like you&#x27;ve traveled in time back to the 1980s, before class D amps existed (well, before they were feasible for these applications). Nothing <i>wrong</i> with that, it&#x27;s just that the linear power supply adds a lot of cost and mass for no reason.')
