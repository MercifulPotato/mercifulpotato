Try placing the piece of paper as it was at the beginning, so it&#x27;s readable to you again, and then &quot;show it&quot; again to the mirror, but this time flipping it with a vertical flip.<p>There you go, the text is left to right but upside down. Vertical flip!<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking &quot;yeah but the original is upside down too&quot; to which I would reply, yes, and in the first case the original was also right to left from your position - you just coudn&#x27;t see it because the paper is opaque. writing in a piece of glass , you can see it left to right in the mirror when it&#x27;s left to right in real life.')
