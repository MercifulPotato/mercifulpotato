Functions can do 90% of what you need in terms of code organization and maintainability.<p>2. Don&#x27;t try to get functions to do more than one job. Don&#x27;t try to spread one job across multiple functions.<p>3. Name functions using concrete, unambiguous verbs. No: handleX, doX, processX, updateX. Yes: get&#x2F;setX (from&#x2F;to memory), fetch&#x2F;sendX (over network), load&#x2F;saveX (from disk), calculateX (and return value), findX (in list).')
