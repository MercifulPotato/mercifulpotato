Then, as my usage expanded, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to use it for anything beyond org-mode, programming, and core text editing functions. Certainly not email or any of that other foolishness. Flash forward a couple of years and here I am, looking into making Emacs into my actual X window manager [1] so that I finally use it for everything, period.<p>I recognize that the practical arguments in favor of doing this are limited at best. Sometimes people &quot;Emacs evangelize&quot; by talking about how living entirely within the program allows them to have one text editing paradigm for everything in their lives; even though that is indeed nice, non-users aren&#x27;t wrong to be skeptical about the practical benefits, given the amount of effort that will probably be involved. The secret is that for many Emacs users, it&#x27;s just plain fun -- hence the things shown in this article, and also EXWM.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ch11ng&#x2F;exwm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ch11ng&#x2F;exwm</a>')
