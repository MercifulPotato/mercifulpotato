There is no deception in saying your band is playing a Beatles tune.<p>&gt; Music is only substantially different than software in that it isn&#x27;t maintained after creation that requires continual support payments by its consumers.<p>That is indeed an oddity created by copyright law. Though nothing stops people from creating new versions of music (except copyright law, of course). People are still creating new versions of Debussy tunes. I&#x27;m a little tired of hearing various versions of &quot;Roll over Beethoven&quot;, too.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re in a position where you can freely distribute your work to others, you&#x27;re in an incredibly privileged position to begin with.<p>A lot of people are paid very well to work on open source software. It&#x27;s analogous to a lot of people being paid very well to perform music.')
