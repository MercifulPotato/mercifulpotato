They should be - I think the regulations here in Norway are the EU regulations.<p>In Norway, they test more than just emissions. Brakes, emergency brakes, whether or not you have a safety triangle in your car and reflective vest - among other things.<p>Our car didn&#x27;t quite pass a couple years ago, and we were able to do some repairs. It was brake work that time. There was a deadline to get this done. This past summer, it didn&#x27;t pass, but it was an engine problem that was making some blue smoke. We let the state take it and just put the money towards a different 20-year-old car. It is possible to keep the car, but the government requires you to turn in your plates. You won&#x27;t get far in an unplated car.')
