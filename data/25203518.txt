Even for memory, if you assume it&#x27;s all L1 cache hits, performance is again perfectly predictable--and if it&#x27;s not all L1 cache hits, the optimization of the surrounding code basically doesn&#x27;t matter (not on the level of superoptimization).<p>The state-of-the-art for superoptimization would be Aiken&#x27;s work (linked elsewhere in the comments). The hardest part here is building the formal specifications of every single instruction, but their group also showed that it&#x27;s possible to automatically generate these from a small seed set by similar techniques.')
