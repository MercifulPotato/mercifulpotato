It has a matte texture with good grip, and overall seems really well built. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6-7 months.<p>My one minor complaint is that often when I erase something, I will accidentally and repeatedly &quot;click&quot; and the lead extends out.<p>It&#x27;s available on amazon as well.')
