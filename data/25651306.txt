Item(by='lilyball', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609881957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640971, text='My understanding is the poorly-worded emails are deliberate, to act as a filter to get rid of the folks who are unlikely to fall for the scam. This means the scammer isn&#x27;t wasting time talking to these folks when they&#x27;ll never pay up.<p>This doesn&#x27;t apply to the diagram. In this case, it wasn&#x27;t just laziness. The author actually added not just the &quot;5G Freq&quot; label, but added &quot;Bass&quot;, &quot;Treble&quot;, etc in the exact same style. And I know they added this because I dug up an original diagram where the labels look different. The author erased the original labels and re-did them (and added &quot;5G&quot; to the pre-existing &quot;Freq&quot;). This was clearly a joke. Someone doing this for real would have simply left off the other labels and only kept &quot;5G Freq&quot; (or would have added other suspicious labels).')
