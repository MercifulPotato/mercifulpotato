Murdoch was bad, but at least you didn&#x27;t have to communicate through his tabloids.<p>Underneath all of this seems to be this assumption that Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey etc. are benevolent, and won&#x27;t betray you. Putting aside whether that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s incredibly short-sighted. Jack Dorsey owns 2% of Twitter&#x27;s stock. Twitter is owned by index funds - they have control, not Jack.
