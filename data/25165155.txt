As far as political polls go, they are happy to consider anyone a Christian irrespective of whether they practice any of the traditions or aspire toward the ethics, so we probably shouldn&#x27;t expect generalizations about &quot;Christians&quot; to be very useful or intuitive. Anyway, I try not to criticize the bullied for how they manifest their scars--it doesn&#x27;t help them and anyone whose opinion matters is only going to think less of me for it.')
