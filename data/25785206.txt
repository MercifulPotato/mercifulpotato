Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610670467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783996, text='&gt; I can see how this would work for new things invented outside the Amish community. How does this work for new Amish inventions? How do they judge an effect a thing will have on society while they are still building that thing?<p>I&#x27;m no expert, but I believe they have walked back decisions to allow certain technologies, or allow things for trial periods before making a final decision.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not like the non-Amish haven&#x27;t rejected technologies because they came to dislike their effects on society, stuff like lead paint, asbestos, and chemical weapons come to mind as examples.<p>Also, their decisions aren&#x27;t arbitrary, but respect certain principles and customs, so I would assume an Amish inventor would take those into account.')
