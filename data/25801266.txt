I suppose this idealization is there to make the contrast between the highly-effective day and the low-effective day. That is just the blog post.<p>Leaving aside this funny idealization and its comic interpretation of the blog post, in real life there are good habits and bad habits that can make a team work more efficiently and less efficiently. I have had first-hand experience with developers from ThoughtWorks, the consulting company behind that blog, and I can tell that they are indeed trying to apply those principles and strategies in their projects.<p>The fact that they are a consulting company gives them an advantage when trying to apply these principles. They only need to worry about the &quot;small picture&quot; of the project they&#x27;re consulting on. They don&#x27;t have to deal with all the &quot;big picture&quot; issues that might affect the employees working within the company they&#x27;re consulting for (e.g. company politics, technical legacies, etc.)\nSo IMHO perhaps some of these techniques and strategies to become a more effective development team are less applicable if you&#x27;re working in $BIG_CO rather than in $CONSULTING_CO.')
