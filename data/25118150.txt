JDs don&#x27;t count. Would be helpful to know who is debasing the currency. Caltech definitely isn&#x27;t. One of the few actually elite institutions left. No fake subjects either.<p>I&#x27;m guessing places like Harvard, UCB and MIT each issued close to 1000 last year. Lower ranked schools, maybe 500 each; probably cumsum to significantly higher than CalTech even with short histories.')
