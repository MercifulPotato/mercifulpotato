They might care about local issues, wedge issues, but ethical and moral concerns in another country? not so much. Big luxury brands such as Apple pour billions in PR and marketing because they live or die by the reputation. The day their customers start caring more about it, things might change.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that one of the main reasons consumers &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; is the market is structured in a way to literally numb them to these issues.  It makes it difficult to even learn about these issues (in relation to particular products), have that knowledge when making a purchasing decision, and take action against it (all competitors may be doing the same thing).  The PR you mentioned also plays a part.<p>To give an slightly different example: Xinjiang produces a lot of cotton, and, IIRC, some of it is produced through forced labor.  How am I supposed to show I care by avoiding that cotton?  I can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for me to know if a particular shirt I&#x27;m buying is made from that cotton or not, and it might actually be impossible for <i>anyone</i> to know without a very expensive and time consuming investigation.<p>If Apple put up big signs in it&#x27;s stores saying &quot;iPhones are made with forced labor,&quot; with compelling product storytelling about the forced labor practices involved, I think you&#x27;d Apple&#x27;s sales drop as consumers show they <i>do</i> care.  But that&#x27;s not going to happen, all the market incentives are to obscure that kind of information.')
