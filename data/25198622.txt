At the risk of reopening a rather heated discussion from yesterday, &quot;science&quot; cannot <i>answer</i> the question of whether it is reasonable to have a policy allowing outdoor dining in, say, NYC.<p>ADDED: Science can (probably and imperfectly) help you estimate how risky a given behavior is likely to be. However, it cannot tell you whether, say, a presumably low risk activity (both personally and in terms of disease spread) should be allowed given economic impact, people&#x27;s social needs&#x2F;wants, etc.')
