Most of the fuel mass goes to CO2 no matter what you do: whether you slap on 1.5 H atoms or 3 for each C, it makes up a small part of the molecular weight.<p>Of course, it could be that the C-H bonds contribute much more to the energy released by burning the fuel than the C-C. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to be case. Here&#x27;s a paper <i>in favour of</i> switching to lighter fuels for ships: it argues that the total supply chain CO2 contribution would be higher (it takes energy to refine those fuels), but only by 1%.<p>I think that &quot;bunker fuel is really bad and ships switching to lighter cleaner fuels is important for the environment&quot; is a seductively easy but bad target for carbon reduction. There are way better places to spend our efforts.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.3155&#x2F;1047-3289.58.4.538" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.3155&#x2F;1047-3289.58.4.5...</a>')
