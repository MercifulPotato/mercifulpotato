Item(by='RussianCow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610670903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25784254, text='In my experience, egg white foams are thicker and more stable than those made with aquafaba, and the egg white has a softening effect on booze. Whether this is desirable depends on the cocktail, the booze, and your personal preference. For instance, I don&#x27;t think a whiskey sour tastes quite the same with aquafaba (it&#x27;s a bit harsher and the flavors don&#x27;t quite marry as well), but I don&#x27;t notice a difference in a sour made with a clear spirit like pisco. On the other hand, I actually prefer aquafaba in a Ramos Gin Fizz; I find the egg white foam to be too thick, to the point where it just floats on top of the drink and you can&#x27;t really sip through it.<p>Pro tip: Instead of doing a dry shake with the egg white, as is traditionally done, try blending it into the cocktail before adding ice. (I use an immersion blender for quicker setup and easier cleanup.) I&#x27;ve found the texture of the foam to be smoother if you do this.')
