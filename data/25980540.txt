People making decisions don&#x27;t understand the things they&#x27;re deciding. This is broken. And there&#x27;s nobody sane in a position where they can say &quot;STOP, this is dumb&quot; and demote people to the level of their competence or fire them.<p>A harmless example is movie &#x2F; tv show plots not making sense - there&#x27;s nobody willing to call out bullshit like obvious plot holes. This is how GoT went from a masterpiece of scheming characters driven by their motivation, making decisions based on information they had and dealing with the consequences to &quot;she kinda forgot&quot;.<p>A dangerous example is the government being full of people who are too incompetent, stupid or useless to get a real job. Sometimes the number of them in the system is so large that competent people can&#x27;t get anything done to fix things.<p>We need to do something to fix this. Positions of decision making power should require an IQ and&#x2F;or knowledge test.')
