Even major journals sometimes let papers with significant methodological flaws through, (e.g. the disastrous mistake of publishing the vaccine-autism fraud, which has cost many lives).<p>I do retrospective research of a different kind, and struggle with making causal inference from non-experimental data. This is an inescapable philosophical and scientific problem, and the very fact they talk about a &quot;causal channel&quot; (novel verbiage to me, btw) raises an eyebrow.<p>As a starting point, the publisher, SSRN, recently sold out to the Elsevier monster. SSRN, according to first line of its FAQ, &quot;is a platform for the dissemination of early-stage research.&quot;<p>Why is this research &quot;early stage?&quot; I suggest it simply failed to meet submission standards for more reputable journals. This is hardly breaking news, likely just low quality work.<p>If I cared more, I would also, in addition to reviewing the actual article, check the credentials of the authors for bias due to religious, business, funding or political affiliations.<p>The authors force us to consider the competing implicit demands that people may procreate without external constraint, and that all children&#x27;s welfare is to a degree the responsibility of society. On the first, what law doesn&#x27;t (somehow, via a &quot;causal channel!&quot;) affect people&#x27;s ability to procreate?')
