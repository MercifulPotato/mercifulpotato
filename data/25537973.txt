Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608919573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537545, text='&gt; Not really that new of [an] idea...<p>I think you missed the contribution of the paper by condensing my summary to the closest related concept you are aware of. I too initially thought &quot;well duh, great filter&quot; after reading the headline&#x2F;article. But then I read the paper to figure out what exactly the novel aspect was supposed to be, and the answer (more accurate spatial&#x2F;temporal galactic model, exploring influence of different parameters) seems reasonably nontrivial.<p>Of course our knowledge hasn&#x27;t made a fundamental step forward (no new data to inform our priors has been obtained), but it does provide a better understanding of our current model(s) and their parameters, as well as where to best look for obtaining more data. That&#x27;s what scientific progress looks like. (Again, I cannot vouch for the results beyond &quot;assumptions seem generally reasonable to a layman&quot;).')
