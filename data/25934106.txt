Not all white people, just the vast majority who refuse to accept the existence of structural racism and its symptoms.&quot;</i><p>It sounds like you have answered the above poster&#x27;s question about how to join in: by &quot;accept[ing] the existence of structural racism and its symptoms&quot;.<p><i>&gt; The word &quot;planted&quot; implies that an idea with no basis in reality was put into this person&#x27;s head.</i><p>As I explain in my post, it cannot have basis in reality due to the provable existence of democratic decisions in favor of POC that have not merely included white voters, but often were comprised of a majority of white voters.<p>To say that someone is telling whites to &quot;shut up&quot; is to misrepresent your own cited headlines: &quot;shut up and listen&quot;. If someone wants you to listen, it is self-evident that they want your help. You don&#x27;t ask someone to listen if you don&#x27;t care what they think or what they do. If someone in need asks another for help, the very first thing they will want to do is have the other person listen to what they need. And if someone is telling someone else to shut up so they can ask for help, that suggests that they think their cry for help is being drowned out.')
