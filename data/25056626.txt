How could you generalize this across all of &quot;Linux&quot;? Or did you mean something else?<p>I know what you&#x27;re talking about, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a very GNOME-specific problem (or gdm, or whatever login manager they use by default...) because when I started out on Ubuntu earlier this year, there was a very active bug report about it. I could actually probably find it if anyone was curious.<p>But I&#x27;ve long since ditched gnome because well, I hate it. On KDE now and never had this problem. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not an &quot;all of linux&quot; problem at all though.')
