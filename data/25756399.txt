This is why I didn&#x27;t manage to achieve the perfect result with AppArmor - many of the apps I used on Linux are non-native so it seemed I could only allow&#x2F;block the entire Python or a JVM (or curl, but I rarely use it so not a problem for me). Perhaps there was a way to analyse the parent process and&#x2F;or the command line, perhaps whatever, AppArmor (let alone SELinux) felt too complicated (and cumbersome to operate) to waste time.<p>On Windows and Mac I don&#x27;t really mind enabling&#x2F;disabling whole Python&#x2F;Java&#x2F;whatever because I can do so in a couple of clicks (and I use more native apps there anyway, many untrusted native apps in particular).<p>By the way there are many processes on Linux which I would like to silence and theoretically could silence by just removing them as I never need them: I mean Avahi, Samba etc. However, today distros have all sorts of essential packages depending on these and won&#x27;t let you uninstall them without destroying everything.')
