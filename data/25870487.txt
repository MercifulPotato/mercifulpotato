LAMP is not dead and actually evolving quite well, so there are definitely ways to improve the stability and speed of a LAMP application without rewriting it in Golang (even Facebook still uses PHP, albeit with some modifications). Having written extensive applications in both scripting languages and Golang I can say that the latter has its advantages but is also slower to develop in and in many respects not as agile as a scripting language like PHP or Python.<p>Doing a rewrite of a popular project with thousands of deploys in the wild will also force you to split your attention between keeping the old system running and building the new one. Since most of your users will want to migrate from one system to the other without losing their existing data and configuration you&#x27;ll have to ensure that there is a clear migration path that works, which can be quite hard. Also, all external systems that are interacting with existing installations (e.g. via APIs) will also need to be supported by the new system.<p>In the end it might be possible to make it, but in my humble experience I think a complete rewrite is almost never a good idea and the energy you put into it is often better invested in making gradual improvements to your existing codebase. But that&#x27;s just my 2c of course.')
