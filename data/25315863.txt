Because trickle down doesn&#x27;t have much support in terms of evidence. Often it&#x27;s actually the wealth that <i>causes</i> the homelessness. As wealthy people move into an area and rents skyrocket, people who once could afford to live there end up on the street.<p>And where are homeless people getting all this money to relocate a thousand miles away based on the hopes that they might get a job in a city with a much higher cost of living? None of this even passes a quick common sense test.')
