It&#x27;s relatively easy to make accurate short-term predictions with such data, the challenge is being fast enough that behemoths like Jump and Citadel don&#x27;t get all the good trades before you, leaving you with just the bad predictions. This requires a huge investment in infrastructure and connectivity, beyond the reach of individuals who aren&#x27;t already quite wealthy.')
