That is, indeed, a problem. However, if you work only with internal files, you can simply abstain from upgrading to new version and keep working on the version that works for you. Moreover, Sketch licences do not &#x27;expire&#x27;, you simply can&#x27;t receive updates any longer. So you can still work with your files as long as you need, not relying on someone else&#x27;s actions.')
