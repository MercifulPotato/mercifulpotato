Insinuating that a colleague of holds an opinion because they watch too much online porn is in no way civil, and is absolutely a personal attack.<p>- Given the &quot;disagreement&quot; between Domingos and Anandkumar, who as others mention, sits on the ACM editorial board, this could be an attempt to censure or &quot;cancel&quot; her for her personal views. This is antithetical to the values held in the letter itself, and leaves a sour taste.')
