Item(by='db48x', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603411462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24860512, text='You&#x27;re not exactly wrong, but the test suite for Reposurgeon has a number of test cases derived from malformations caused by other tools, or made worse by other tools. The real problem here is that they were gathered over a decade, and nobody (myself included) really documented them very well. They all made sense when we committed themâ€¦<p>Also, most conversion tools will handle the most common cases OK, and only generate garbage in oddball situations. They don&#x27;t print out a warning when the oddball situations happen, so unless you go back and look at every commit you&#x27;ll never notice the damage. Most of those situations only happen because of accidents, like creating a Subversion branch the wrong way, then deleting it and making it the correct way. Or adding files to a CVS repository by copying ,v files from a different CVS repository.')
