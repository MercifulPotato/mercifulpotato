There are some quirks and limitations, but IMO no more than you get with any other mobile stack. The big differences are that it bundles python packages with it, meaning you have access to hundreds of thousands of libraries via pip, and the design and iteration time are ridiculously low.<p>The downsides of Kivy are also the downsides of python; there is almost no design enforcement, no typing; if you want to do something stupid and dangerous, you&#x27;re free to do so with no warnings, and you may not know it&#x27;s stupid and dangerous. These are usually made up for by the large amount of time you&#x27;ll have for testing, since you won&#x27;t spend all the time you normally would fighting the IDE, toolchain, compiler, etc.<p>The part I like most about Kivy is that it&#x27;s cross platform, android, ios, windows, Linux, mac, with almost no changes other than OS semantics like paths. I&#x27;ve built 5 large projects this year with it, mostly for custom CNC and motion control applications.')
