It&#x27;s like all of the pretentious devops leadership that comes in, or the tool-bags that advocate for tools as if they were culture. I don&#x27;t care what you say, using slack &#x2F; zoom &#x2F; github doesn&#x27;t really say anything about your culture, nor is it in and of itself indicative of a &quot;good engineering culture&quot;.<p>We never learn our lessons, you can&#x27;t just hire someone into a role and have them change your company.

As far as I&#x27;m concerned, hiring a head of remote for a remote company or a head of culture or a head of digital or a head of innovation is a sign that your leadership doesn&#x27;t know what to do or doesn&#x27;t think the thing is important enough to spend their time listening to their employees, diving into themselves and cultivating the &quot;head of&quot; _____ .
