Item(by='parliament32', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611081054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829883, text='Contrary to popular opinion: our ancestors survived just fine without dentists for a very long time. Yes, you risk dying, but it&#x27;s less likely than you think -- your body is pretty good at fixing itself. Wisdom tooth extraction and braces and whatever new money-extraction-technique-du-jour will come out tomorrow is probably not necessary.<p>Anecdote: when I was a kid, I used to visit a dentist who would always &quot;find&quot; 5-6 cavities every year. After a few years my parents took me for a second opinion elsewhere, and it turned out those cavities weren&#x27;t really there. Ever since then, I&#x27;ve somewhat distrusted dentists... When I was in my early teens, I was told I needed braces. I declined, and two decades later, my teeth look straight and are fine. In my late teens I was told I needed my wisdom teeth extracted... I declined, and same as before, my teeth are fine now almost 20 years later.<p>My personal stance now is: avoid processed sugar (for teeth and health in general), brush your teeth, and go to the dentist if something hurts and don&#x27;t go away within a few weeks. Otherwise dentistry is pretty scammy as a whole.')
