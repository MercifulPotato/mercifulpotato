Then I don&#x27;t eat lunch until 2-3pm. I find I can pretty much eat whatever I want for lunch and dinner but I still try to keep it low&#x2F;medium GI foods and opt for fattier stuff if I can.<p>I don&#x27;t have any problems with blood sugar, and I don&#x27;t get crazy hungry (I actually forget to eat pretty often, I find it more of an inconvenience, hah). I WFH so it&#x27;s not like I burn many calories sitting on my biscuit anyway. My main problem with it is weight loss. I&#x27;m not overweight and I like to exercise, so I need to make sure I eat enough. Another downside (I&#x27;m guessing) is electrolytes or vitamins. Maybe I&#x27;m simply underfed but I seem more prone to muscle tightness&#x2F;cramps.<p>I find I can break the &quot;diet&quot; regularly and not lose therapeutic effect. I do it 4-5x&#x2F;week. I&#x27;m down to 1-2 partial seizures a month, whereas previously I was hitting 30+. I have neocortical TLE (likely focal cortical dysplasia, adult onset), so the partial seizure numbers tend to be higher than your standard hippocampal&#x2F;mesial TLE. Overall my seizure control is pretty good lately. I&#x27;m hoping it stays good - but as you probably know, can&#x27;t let your guard down.<p>I ended up here after failing to maintain keto and the low gi (&quot;south beach&quot;) diets. They seemed to improve seizure control a bit, but I had real problems sticking to them. Fasting is all the rage now, so I figured I&#x27;d borrow the easy&#x2F;good parts from both of those diets, while trying out a simple, loose version of fasting. I&#x27;m glad I gave it a shot. Good luck!')
