They are a key component in the lives of at least a hundred million people. Given this, $5,000 is, in my opinion, negligible, and the proper payout would have been at least double.<p>Given that Discord permanently stores so many chat logs, personal information, analytics, etc, there should be no higher priority than maximizing security and user trust, and $5K would make me, as a potential user, think it&#x27;s a second priority.')
