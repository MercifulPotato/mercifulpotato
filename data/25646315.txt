She had mentioned she really wanted to visit America, but with the recent election of Donald Trump she was a bit scared.<p>Not all of us like Eastern European women, Trump blocked my game right there.<p>The point of this story is anyone can meet anyone from anywhere and the nasty racist system the US has for blocking certain people because they have the wrong last names or whatever doesn&#x27;t do anyone any service.<p>I also don&#x27;t think embargo serve anything aside from radicalizing other people&#x27;s. Take Vietnam, now you have Coca-Cola, and McDonald&#x27;s succeeding to do what 20 to 30 years of Western imposition couldn&#x27;t, they&#x27;ve made Vietnam capitalist. That was accomplished once the embargoes were removed in the nineties. Even with Cuba ,I&#x27;d imagine if the embargo didn&#x27;t exist you&#x27;d see much more reform as individuals would eventually be able to succeed on their own merits.')
