With Git, a branch is just a kind of moving tag on the last commit.<p>The problem mentioned in this thread is rolling back a feature that was merged. The only solution I know is navigating the log to find the first commit on the branch from which to revert. Don&#x27;t forget there may have been several merges from and to master, as well as commits shared with other git branches that should not be reverted.<p>In a Mercurial branch, each commit is tagged with the branch name. Unamed branches, Ã  la Git, are called &quot;bookmarks&quot;.')
