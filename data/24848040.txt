I got it as a side-effect of some horse-trading in the late &#x27;90s&#x2F;early 2000s and I wanted another UNIX box to play with, so it seemed perfectly reasonable at the time. It was a 68LC040 model so I couldn&#x27;t do A&#x2F;UX on it without a CPU swap, and IIRC neither Linux&#x2F;m68k nor mkLinux supported the hardware at the time, making NetBSD the only practical choice without spending money. It was a quirky little machine, and I destroyed it repeatedly trying things, but that means it did its job well.<p>I was recently working out using NetBSD 5.1 (..the last version that could be booted to a usable shell from only two floppies) to image the hard drive of an old Pre-USB laptop I picked up for a dumb retrocomputing project.<p>(The beginning of that project burbled up on HN a few months ago: A ThinkPad 560E because I want a fully supported period-correct machine to run OpenStep&#x2F;Rhapsody on.  I&#x27;m backing up the original Windows95 install by DDing the drive to a virtual SCSI disc on a SCSI2SD, plugged in to an Adaptec SlimSCSI 1460D PCMCIA SCSI Adapter.  Both because getting the HD out of a 560 chassis is a pain, and because I set myself a &quot;don&#x27;t physically open the machine&quot; conduct challenge for sport).<p>Having a tiny, absolutely consistent little UNIX that can just do things like the above because it supports a staggering array of hardware is really pretty delightful.')
