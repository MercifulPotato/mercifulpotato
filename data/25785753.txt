Item(by='stevbov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610674244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783969, text='I took a look at ExVenture when I first started working on this.  A lot seems to have changed since then, but from what I could tell at the time there were some potential races.   For example, movement processing seemed like it allowed for the possibility of players to seemingly move through doors that were closed (at least, from the players&#x27; point of view).  I could easily have been wrong though since I&#x27;m new to Elixir.<p>That said, a requirement for scripting I have is the ability to chain together arbitrary actions in an atomic fashion without any races or deadlocks.  Content creators can create really complex scripts that involve arbitrary locations and actions.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would achieve this goal with ExVenture.')
