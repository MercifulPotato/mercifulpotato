Perhaps the more important one are things like: ensuring that your social media service doesn&#x27;t have a bad reputation so that people other than disaffected white guys will actually want to use it.<p>If your site is overrun with porn, then sure, each user <i>could</i> just block those millions of posters with your open standard... but every new user still sees it, and decides &quot;this service isn&#x27;t built for me&quot; and never comes back.<p>At the core of community moderation is <i>community</i>. If the community looks like it&#x27;s full of people doing gray-illegal things, then normal people (and advertisers) will generally shy away... and lawsuits will not be far behind.')
