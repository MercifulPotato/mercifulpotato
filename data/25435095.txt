XHTML is a hypertext based on XML.  (HTML itself isn&#x27;t proper XML.)<p>There are hypertext specs based on JSON, such as: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;json-schema.org&#x2F;draft-04&#x2F;json-schema-hypermedia.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;json-schema.org&#x2F;draft-04&#x2F;json-schema-hypermedia.html</a><p>But, without clients that treat the data as a uniform interface, it&#x27;s all mostly pointless, which is why most JSON APIs stop at Level 2 of the Richardson Maturity Model, and why things like GraphQL are becoming more and more popular.<p>In the original model of the web (which is what Fielding was describing w&#x2F; REST) where HTML was being delivered to a browser, the uniform interface works: a browser has no idea what the HTML document means but can render it to a form that the human looking at it can make sense of.')
