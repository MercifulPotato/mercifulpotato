It&#x27;s really dreadfully obvious once you know to look for it.<p>People are so afraid of making a bad decision that they refuse to make any decision at all, and then make a giant mess in the process. What you should do is spend your energy on finding reversible decisions, and then not spend a lot of effort on actually making them. We know where the paint store is, we know they can make up paint in 15 minutes, fuck it, paint it blue, we can always paint over it later. Hard no to black, though, since you can&#x27;t paint over that shit.<p>People are so used to avoiding decisions that on a few occasions I&#x27;ve entirely flustered someone who wanted to tear into me (sometimes with an audience) but cutting them off and saying, &quot;Yeah that was a mistake, and here&#x27;s how we&#x27;re going to fix it.&quot;  None of them had any idea how to recover from someone saying &quot;I was wrong&quot; and going on to try to fix the problem. I still have a little video in my head of one guy&#x27;s eyes bugging out when he realized what I just said.')
