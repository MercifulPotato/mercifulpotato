They don&#x27;t really have expertise in it, and it&#x27;s probably suffering as a result. But then, they also have a ton of money to burn on it, so it&#x27;s not without its merits. I think this will be very hard for them to do, and I think they&#x27;ll look like they&#x27;re making dumb mistakes for a while. But if they really want to go this way, they&#x27;ll probably succeed in some form.')
