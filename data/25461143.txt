If there is one thing I know about the rich it&#x27;s that they won&#x27;t pass up an oportunity to earn more.<p>There is some number x that is the minimum net profit after tax that entrepreneurs&#x2F;investors will accept depending on how much pain in the butt the business is to take on.<p>This number stays the same whether taxes and wages go up or not. People just don&#x27;t take on new projects unless what they can put in their pockets at the end of the day is actually worth their time and effort.<p>If taxes or wages go up, the prices must go up in kind for x to stay the same.
