The result was ~500,000 people.<p>I would like to make a more detailed design and simulate it.  The simulation could even include things like sunlight entering living spaces and workspaces and sunlight on walking paths during commutes, over the year.  A new city could maintain such simulations as it builds and develops, and end up with much higher quality of life for all residents.')
