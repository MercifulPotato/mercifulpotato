Item(by='herodoturtle', descendants=3, kids=[25817456, 25816983, 25817685], score=3, time=1610928368, title='Ask HN: Mechanical Keyboard Advice', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Dear HNers,<p>I&#x27;m an old(ish) programmer (25 years XP) and have only recently discovered the vast and fascinating sub-culture dedicated to mechanical keyboards - specifically around the optimisation of the key-pressing experience.<p>I tried to read up on this topic, but holy chopsticks I drowned in a deluge of the steepest learning curve.<p>I&#x27;m also the sort of guy that will go to town on optimising every aspect of my life - down to the most minute detail (such as the orientation of my toothbrush when putting it back in its place, to minimise the energy I&#x27;ll next expend to pick it up again).<p>So if you&#x27;ll indulge me... could you please recommend a keyboard for me?<p>When I was faced with the prospect of researching this topic of mechanical keyboards, I quickly came to the realisation that if I went down this very deep rabbit hole, I&#x27;d unpack its variables to the point of being able to write a novel on <i>Mechanical Keyboard Design Patterns</i> that would honour the original Gang of Four in its exhaustiveness.<p>So I thought it would be wise to first ask you lot. Primarily because I honestly don&#x27;t have the time to give this decision the attention it deserves (I&#x27;m a dad with young kids and a wife working in healthcare, so time is limited these days). But secondarily because I&#x27;m darn curious what you have figured out already.<p>I&#x27;d particularly value insightful stories of your actual experience - the design(s) you&#x27;ve gone with, the Pros and Cons, what you would change if you could, cool war stories, etc.<p>As for the keyboard recommendation - anything goes - and I am prepared to invest in this, much like I did with my monitor setup and Aeron.<p>Aesthetically, I&#x27;d prefer something that&#x27;s matte black, with subtle &#x2F; minimal key faces. And it would be a massive bonus if it could be wireless (and not via Bluetooth, but via a little USB receiver, like my Logitech mouse).<p>Thanks!')
