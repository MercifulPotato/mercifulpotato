Not sure if it&#x27;s a zoom-based error but never had this issue in irl meetings.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s less easy to read body language cues when the person is finishing.<p>Has anyone else had this problem?  And what are some suggestions to improve your listening style over Zoom?<p>I researched some historical threads about &quot;active listening&quot; which I will be reading and checking out the resources, but haven&#x27;t found anything zoom specific.  TY!')
