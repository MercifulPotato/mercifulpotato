Moreover, only <i>broadcast</i> television and radio are censored (perhaps because radio waves are a public platform?). I&#x27;m not going to argue that censoring broadcast is ideal or valid, but I&#x27;m certainly less sympathetic to the plight of massive media companies than I am to millions of private citizens.')
