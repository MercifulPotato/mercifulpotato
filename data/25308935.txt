The parts you don&#x27;t test are the parts that break.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a case where I incremented the wrong metric:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;alertmanager-status&#x2F;commit&#x2F;fccaeb576d27c3f79563aa10ecefd303aa4dce27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;alertmanager-status&#x2F;commit&#x2F;fccae...</a><p>I noticed the bug when I went to look at a dashboard with that metric on it, and noticed it had the wrong name.  If go&#x27;s Prometheus library had an easy way to run &quot;metric.CurrentValue()&quot;, I would have tested it... but it didn&#x27;t, so I didn&#x27;t.  And then had to patch it, release it, and update all my servers.  Writing the test (with that API) would have taken less than a second.  Finding the bug in production and fixing it took an hour.<p>(That codebase has 100% line coverage, but of course, I know that 100% test coverage is a meaningless metric.  That the code ran is a prerequisite to the program behaving correctly, but it also has to do the right thing.)')
