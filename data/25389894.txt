There should be an educational route that is between pure academia which focusses on esoterica that is only relevant to research and vocational courses that don&#x27;t include much innthe way of theory at all. The idea that industry ought to pay for it presumably comes from a background where universities are private an expensive. But I&#x27;d like to live in a world where these kind of courses were government subsidised and available for free or cheap.')
