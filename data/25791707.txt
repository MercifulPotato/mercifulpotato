Item(by='shawnz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610722932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789405, text='&gt; it barely caters to developers at all. Take for example the &quot;Developer&quot; menu item, which is two levels deep in Chrome.<p>Sure, but it&#x27;s also in every single right click menu on every page and has several keyboard shortcuts (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I)<p>In my opinion, having to go two menus deep is not &quot;barely catering to the audience at all&quot;. The vendor of that product just likes to have clean menus.')
