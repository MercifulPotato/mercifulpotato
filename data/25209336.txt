In the West, it looks like much of the rewards of intensification goes towards making people obese. And in societies where more people don&#x27;t have enough to eat, it still isn&#x27;t clear whether more intensive farming resolves that. The move to cash crops seems to lead to less local food security for example. And perhaps landless people moving to the city ultimately creates a higher demand for food than can be matched by the output of farming modernization?')
