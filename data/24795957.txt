Most Government funding of software development goes to contractors, where that rule does not apply.<p>The no copyright only applies to the US, not necessarily outside. Outside the US it definitely can have a copyright.<p>There are also some weird exceptions for government employees, specifically for the u.s. postal service and for certain materials created by NIST.')
