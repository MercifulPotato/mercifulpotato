I&#x27;d love a tablet that could replace my notebooks, but for some reason, needing a second screen to read my textbooks (color is nonnegotiable for diagram-heavy some textbooks, in my experience) makes me reticent. The ReMarkable 2 looks fantastic, and I love the idea of a distraction-free, dedicated writing&#x2F;reading tablet, but $450 feels just a touch too far for a device that will require me to use a second device to read textbooks.')
