Replacing them one a time maintains the body. The structure of the body is more than the sum of it&#x27;s parts though.<p>The robots need a body to orient their brain in spacetime. AIs classifying images from pure theory requires a body to relate to all the other objects in the world. Tagging a door knob as &#x27;turnable, openable&#x27; requires the robot to have a hand that can do it. A banana only looks edible and life sustaining because we have a body. A floating head loses all interest in a lot of things, I&#x27;d guess.')
