I have always been a dopamine addict with a short attention span. If I find something exciting it will be easy for me to get sucked into it.<p>I now have an issue(addiction) with competitive multiplayer games. I get really good at them very quickly, I even won tournaments before it became a career option. However, I realized these are causing massive anxiety in my life, hurt my ability to concentrate, hurt my ability to stick to a project and destroyed my sleeping schedule. One of the worst games was Rocket League. I uninstalled multiple times and like an addict told myself I will be responsible this time and reinstalled it.....to end up where I began...angry at 3 AM....at a dumb video game. Since then, I completely uninstalled it but Warzone has filled that void....I have to stop playing that too as it is too addicting for me.<p>Single player games are not an issue and are actually calming as it seems that it is the competitive aspect that keeps me engaged.<p>Reading books also helps me significantly and has improvement my attention span.')
