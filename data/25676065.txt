It isn&#x27;t designed to give you a choice of a ventilator to remove a nurse. It&#x27;s for situations when you don&#x27;t have another choice... for when a hospital has run out of proper ventilators or there isn&#x27;t a nurse available. This is not a first-choice device (even if it could be adapted to that in the future).')
