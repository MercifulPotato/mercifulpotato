Allow me to explain:<p>To quote the wikipedia source: &quot;hanging a piece of meat in several places for a few days and deciding in favor of the place where meat was found to be least infected.&quot;   Infected definition = &quot;contaminated with an infective agent (such as a bacterium or virus).&quot;<p>I think they could likely see some infective agents such as flies, maggots, and spoilage in meat, and translate this to their own flesh as analogous to meat.  In terms of theory, my best guess is simply one of &quot;meat goes bad when it is infected by parasites (i.e. maggots as well as perhaps stuff we do not&#x2F;cannot see)&quot;<p>Note that per [1] &quot;Basic forms of germ theory were proposed in the late Middle Ages by physicians including Ibn Sina in 1025&quot;<p>Whereas, from OP&#x27;s source: &quot;The Al-Adudi Hospital was founded in 981 by the then ruler of Baghdad, Adud al-Dawlah, and was also named after him&quot;<p>Given the proximity of those dates (981 vs 1025)-- the proposal of Germ Theory by Middle Eastern (specifically, Persian in the case of Ibn Sina) doctors, and the hospital&#x27;s founding in the near Middle Eastern region of Turkey a few years decades earlier, and the prolific nature of science in the Medieval Islamic-sphere of influence&#x2F;Middle Eastern world, I think it&#x27;s a decently strong argument that the basis is very early germ theory.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Germ_theory_of_disease" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Germ_theory_of_disease</a>')
