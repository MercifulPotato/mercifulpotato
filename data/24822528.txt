Right?<p>I suspect that even a non-profit, running this code or a derivative of it on their own servers would run afoul of the additional restrictions.<p>This means that a researcher that uses any of this code or it&#x27;s derivatives in their own research is planting a huge downstream landmine into their own code.')
