Of course many, if not most cases can not be traced, many certainly can be. Some people know exactly where they got covid, and who they exposed, and where.<p>The US has 50,000 full time contact tracers working to collect this information. Surely there is some data by now?<p>&gt;Your questions are unanswerable.<p>IF the question is categorically unanswerable (which I don&#x27;t believe), contact tracing programs should be disbanded.')
