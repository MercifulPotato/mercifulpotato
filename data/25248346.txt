If the government&#x27;s goal is to reduce water usage, then all they have to do is increase the tax.  If the usage doesn&#x27;t go down, then increase the tax even more.  At some point, the people paying for the water be unable to afford consuming the same amount of water, whether or not the tax is explicitly shown is irrelevant.   If producers can absorb the tax, then keep raising the tax until the water consumption goes down.')
