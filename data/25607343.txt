Each is in their own bubble. Both bubbles are around the same size.<p>This article is from an outlet in one bubble labeling everything from the other bubble as misinformation, and asking rethorically: &#x27;can the divide be healed?&#x27; Without realizing they actually mean: &#x27;how can we make them understand they are wrong?&#x27;<p>This happens on both sides. Until both bubbles will ask themselves: &#x27;is it possible the other side has some points, so let&#x27;s give it a good look&#x27;, there will be NO healing at all.<p>And actually both sides are as often wrong as they are right on many issues.')
