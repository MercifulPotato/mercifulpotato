I think it&#x27;s because Hacker News indentation is larger (with upvote&#x2F;downvote arrows), and standard HN uses almost the entire width of my 4K display (which makes almost every comment only 1 or 2 lines long), compared to your website which has a narrow column so wraps each comment into many paragraphs (which makes it harder to view the comment tree in a compact way).<p>I&#x27;m sure other users prefer the narrow column view, so take my feedback with a grain of salt.')
