But internally in a library or a function that gets ran over and over again and needs to run super fast often isn&#x27;t a lot of lines of code.  So what I mean by a researcher may not even write a function is, they write the meat of the algorithm, it gets handed off to software engineers, and they turn it into a library or OOP it or whatever, and then run it on servers.<p>My current project in Python is massive compared to a normal one atm and it&#x27;s about 2-3 pages of code in Jupyter.  In Rust, if the libraries are there, it would be about the same size.  I have 8 functions atm.  It&#x27;s also the end of the project and I&#x27;m in talks with data engineers to wrap it in OOP.  They&#x27;ll handle the IO.  Or at least, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve always done it and I&#x27;ve done a project in Rust.')
