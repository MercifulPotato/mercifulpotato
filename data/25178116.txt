They only have that issue now because of lack of support from the Senate (specifically Sen. McConnell, who by rules controls what is voted on).\nYet many of the people that attend anti-mask rallies also are ardent Republicans (same as Sen. McConnell).  So I have trouble squaring your argument that it is about government over-reach.  Likewise, if it about government spending causing issue, where were the rallies about the tax cuts for the highest earning segment last year?  That law caused a lot more debt than the stimulus to support lockdown.')
