A lot of traders would sell your BTCEMA tokens to buy more real BTC expecting a recovery or get into stable coins expecting a further drop. At any rate, the exchange price of BTCEMA would drop due to sell pressure.<p>Your indicator has &quot;broken peg&quot; which is an ugly situation that threatens every artificial instrument in that space. The whole miracle mixture for algorithmical and asset-backed stable coins is to prevent such a situation to happen for a longer time. It&#x27;s a bit too much to explain but they try to defend against this in different ways, e.g. reducing supply to hike price.<p>In your case, you&#x27;d need to buy BTCEMA from the market to prop up price for as long as it takes the moving average to digest the sudden price jump. You&#x27;d find yourself in the situation of the Bank of England trying to defend the Pound in 1992 and only making Soros rich instead.')
