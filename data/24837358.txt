England&#x27;s population density is high too, but public transport is what it is. They can make it better, if they can. We can&#x27;t just look at population density, conclude that it could be like the netherlands and proceed as if it is.  It isn&#x27;t.<p>Regardless, reducing rural car ownership in most places means reducing quality of life. It also reduces economic well being.
