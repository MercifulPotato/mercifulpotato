We went through that before, too.  You&#x27;re right that one should always validate it themselves and I should&#x27;ve said that I don&#x27;t think many journalists know how to work it, because honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen anyone but Wikileaks actually do that validation, ever.<p>&gt; With all respect: you clearly seem inclined to believe this nonsense about the emails with only the barest of evidence.<p>I haven&#x27;t said <i>anything</i> about the email content, though.  I investigated a <i>photo</i> of Hunter sleeping with a meth pipe using hackerfactor.com&#x27;s tools to look for manipulation and did not find any.  That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re real, but it gives them some level of credence, given that there are old reports about his rental car substantiated by police reports.<p>You&#x27;re right that it doesn&#x27;t validate the email content.  I plan to withhold judgement until we have more data, but it looks like they do have some files of his.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the last time we went through this sort of thing, there were spurious claims of manipulated documents which were actively disproved and some of the denials I&#x27;ve read parse very narrowly, which isn&#x27;t right.')
