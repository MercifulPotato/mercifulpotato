Interruptions are fine for certain things, but not the vast majority of them.<p>The biggest one I&#x27;ve switched off is email notifications and it&#x27;s made me so much more organized. Instead of swiping away an interruption when I can&#x27;t respond properly I&#x27;ll pull the information when I do have time&#x2F;ability to respond, bills now get paid on time for example.<p>Google is one of the biggest offenders at re-enabling it&#x27;s own notification though. Youtube, an app I don&#x27;t want and can&#x27;t remove decided to start spamming me again last week.')
