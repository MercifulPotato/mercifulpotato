Techniques such as reflection and meta programming can make Static Analysis difficult, while explicit type systems can make tooling easier.<p>Static Analysis can help find errors, allow code completion, etc etc.<p>I&#x27;m wondering, how would you order commercial languages on a scale of easiest to hardest to analyze? And does there exist a language that has been built with the goal of providing tooling? Java comes to mind, but I&#x27;m not sure if the ease of Static Analysis was intended from the beginning or just a side-effect of Javas verboseness?')
