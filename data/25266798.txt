I think a little vertical scalability from a JIT raises the throughout of the system without really changing how it works or what you use it for. If anything, maybe you write less stuff in native code.<p>A great deal of research has been published in the last 25 years, and some of it invalidates earlier wisdom due to changes in processor design. Just following this trail and applying the 80&#x2F;20 rule could get a lot done for a little effort. And a simple JIT has half a prayer of being correct.')
