If you&#x27;re just playing around, that&#x27;s a different matter. Power-management equipment alone would cost more than what you&#x27;d spend on AWS. Even if you somehow got all your hardware for free, the time spent setting up would cost far more than AWS are asking.<p>&gt; $74 isn&#x27;t a lot; but then, it&#x27;s still much more expensive than something like a raspberry pi 4 with a USB SSD<p>Serious cloud computing instances are backed by server-grade hardware, with automatic recovery systems to help cope with hardware failures if they do occur, in a dedicated facility with measures in place for everything from burglary to fire to power outages to network outages. The major cloud providers can offer all this for a few pounds&#x2F;dollars a month due to economies of scale.<p>If it&#x27;s your intent to just play around, a Raspberry Pi might be a fine choice, but a Raspberry Pi plugged into the wall isn&#x27;t close to a proper server setup.<p>&gt; the network isn&#x27;t that relevant when going this low, since you won&#x27;t be serving anything substantial out of it<p>Firstly, that&#x27;s not necessarily true. If you&#x27;re running something like an SFTP&#x2F;FTPS server, you might make good use of the connection speed, despite only using a lightweight VM. Even if you&#x27;re hosting a proper Web 2.0 site, an efficient architecture goes a long way. HackerNews and StackOverflow use famously few servers, for instance.<p>Secondly, a lot of ISPs are hostile to web hosting from home connections, so a Raspberry Pi might not be an option even if you&#x27;re only hosting a &#x27;toy&#x27; site.<p>Thirdly, it&#x27;s not just performance, it&#x27;s also reliability. AWS invest in redundancy and robustness. A home&#x2F;small office connection isn&#x27;t in the same league.<p>&gt; getting into the cloud without using any cloud-native features isn&#x27;t money well spent<p>If you can get a serious virtual&#x2F;physical server for a better price elsewhere, that might be worth considering, sure. GitHub does this - they&#x27;re hosted with a company called Carpathia, rather than with one of the major cloud providers. [0] The &#x27;cloudy features&#x27; of a platform like EC2 are powerful though, features like automatic recovery from hardware failure, the ability to easily change the hardware spec of your instance with just a reboot of downtime, the ability to easily transform your virtual HDD into a virtual SSD, etc.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;holman&#x2F;ama&#x2F;issues&#x2F;553" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;holman&#x2F;ama&#x2F;issues&#x2F;553</a>')
