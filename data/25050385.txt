You seem to be constructing a strawman.<p>Freedom of speech does not exclude the possibility of explicitly labeling certain speech as wrong, and what twitter is doing here is definitely better that removing tweets outright.<p>It would be even better to explicitly include opposite sources when marking disinformation. The primary concern is that this &quot;labeling&quot; is just a prelude to removal.<p>&gt; Free-speech is mainly about avoiding situations in which there is an authoritarian bias towards the speech of one group over another.<p>Allowing a heavily annotated of speech is a minimum guarantee of &quot;freedom&quot;, and vastly better than outright suppression.')
