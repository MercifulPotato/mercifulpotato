If you prove the plant exist<i>ed</i> widespread in the wild before the patent holder tried to apply for the patent, then yes, the plant is not patentable. Furthermore, if the variety is not reproduced asexually, then it is not patentable. This is basically plant prior art. You cant patent air conditioners because they already exist.<p>However, if you do what you mentioned in the first paragraph and go and propagated a ton of plants and <i>make</i> them widespread <i>after</i> the fact, then no you haven&#x27;t invalidated the patent. You just infringed on it even more and probably have to pay a bigger fine. In general, you don&#x27;t get to escape the legal consequences of an action by doing the action even more times. That just makes the consequences worse.')
