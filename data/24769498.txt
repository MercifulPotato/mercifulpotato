The article has some W3C validation errors, but they seem to be caused by a few CSS errors they made themselves, the choice by their chosen CSS framework to put &lt;style&gt; tags for components directly in the page body next to their component elements, and their chosen code highlighter&#x27;s choice to use &lt;div&gt; tags inside of &lt;pre&gt; tags. I find it surprising those two tools do that, though I wouldn&#x27;t describe those issues as having anything to do with the rest of the ecosystem. (I have a Gatsby site using the component CSS library Styled-JSX and the code highlighter PrismJS which don&#x27;t have those issues, and the site only has a few validation warnings that are purely from my own html. Apparently &lt;section&gt; tags are expected to have headers.)')
