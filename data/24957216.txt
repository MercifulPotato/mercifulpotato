I&#x27;m currently running Lubuntu on a very cheap laptop and while its usable, most applications are get pretty irresponsive. I&#x27;ve also tried running some BSD&#x27;s on it whith very bare bones wm&#x27;s (i.e. ctwm) and that became unusable quickly. Although, I think the issue there was lack of proper graphics drivers and being stuck with the framebuffer driver.')
