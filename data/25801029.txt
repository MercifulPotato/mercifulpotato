On average, might as well be OSS that&#x27;s popular, well documented and has a community around it.  Think about it, what would you rather inherit?<p>Of course, there are counter arguments.  We want everything in golang because our Engineers know golang and most the CNCF toolset we use is in golang;  Our usecase is simpler or specific and thus the general OSS solution would require to be tailored and that&#x27;s more work than rolling our own;  The OSS solution just isn&#x27;t that good, and we think we can do better and have a competitive advantage by doing it internally; loads really.<p>Understanding it better though?  On average seems like short term thinking.')
