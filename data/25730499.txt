To me, Data Engineering is a specialization of software engineering, and not something like an analyst who writes SQL all day.<p>As DE has evolved, the role has transitioned away from traditional low code ETL tools towards code heavy tools. Airflow, Dagster, DBT, to name a few.<p>I work on a small DE team. We don&#x27;t have the human power to grind out SQL queries for analysts and other teams.
