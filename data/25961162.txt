There are significant selection biases about what stories you hear.  Anecdotally - whenever I have read about a company I work for (F500), the outside perspective gets a lot of very basic facts wrong.  Often they take small incidences and turn them into broad generalizations.  Sometimes their sources have agendas.  Etc.<p>This is one case where it&#x27;s important to tag information that comes in.  The spectrum extremes, IMO, range from &quot;did I observe this fact&quot; to &quot;is this someone else&#x27;s conclusion&quot;.  The more from the latter you have, the less faith you should put in your own conclusions drawn from it.')
