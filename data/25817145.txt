You don&#x27;t need to close a larger part of the ocean for a bigger rocket.<p>SpaceX is actually building its own rocket launch facilities in South Texas. They are also already evaluating sea platforms.<p>Insurance rates for Falcon 9 are already very low, the lowest in the industry. If Starship can double or triple the flight rate insurance will go down by quite a bit. Also the costumers pay for insurance, its not part of the SpaceX price quoted here. In addition, government don&#x27;t actually insure things like Artemis program.<p>&gt; That USAF person in the back of the room with their finger on the destruct button.<p>That job doesn&#x27;t exist anymore for SpaceX launches.<p>In fact, if you look at the total labour for launch, its going down considerably and it will continue to go down. Look at SpaceX operation in South Texas, an explicit goal of their whole design process is to make things cheaper and faster and that goes for operations as well.<p>Another example is the capsule retrieval operations. During Appollo damn near a whole battle fleet was sent, now its one ship and some available cost guard.<p>2 million $ per launch is quite extreme however there is absolutely no reason why it should cost over 100 million. Even with the Falcon 9 today, the second stage is actually large part of the cost and a fully reusable system would reduce that consderably. The fuel for Starship is actually cheaper then for the Falcon 9 as the Falcon 9 uses RP-1, helium and a couple other things Starship no longer has.<p>The steel construction should actually end less expensive then the Falcon 9 construction. This of course doesn&#x27;t go for the full human capable Starship, but just the Cargo version of the rocket compared.<p>The Raptor rocket engine is more complex then Merlin and will likely be somewhat more expensive until it significantly overtakes it in production rate. However SpaceX has shown to be able to make engine quite cheaply and with reuse the per flight cost is trivial.<p>Please explain why Starship should cost (internal cost) more then 2x of Falcon 9.')
