How come we only consider irs as unjustified money deduction? When in reality irs&#x2F;taxation is the only lever to feed the skimmed cash back into the pockets who actually did the work?<p>i just want to touch upon this from the pov of ag and ag subsidies that is tax payer funded.<p>the primary motivation for ag subsidies and the &#x27;new deal&#x27; was a good one. but it was from a different era and i am afraid that it has outgrown it&#x27;s usefulness.<p>subsidies were given to american farmers to grow food, to reduce surpluses and to protect prices.<p>An Act to relieve the existing national economic emergency by increasing agricultural purchasing power, to raise revenue for extraordinary expenses incurred by reason of such emergency, to provide emergency relief with respect to agricultural indebtedness, to provide for the orderly liquidation of joint-stock land banks, and for other purposes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Agricultural_Adjustment_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Agricultural_Adjustment_Act</a> :<p>[..]The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was a United States federal law of the New Deal era designed to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses. The government bought livestock for slaughter and paid farmers subsidies not to plant on part of their land. The money for these subsidies was generated through an exclusive tax on companies which processed farm products. The Act created a new agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to oversee the distribution of the subsidies.[2][3][4] The Agriculture Marketing Act, which established the Federal Farm Board in 1929, was seen as an important precursor to this act.[5][6] The AAA, along with other New Deal programs, represented the federal government&#x27;s first substantial effort to address economic welfare in the United States.[7][..]<p>further reading: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;roomfordebate&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;do-farm-subsidies-protect-national-security&#x2F;fdrs-disastrous-experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;roomfordebate&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;do-farm-sub...</a>\nand\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minneapolisfed.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;1996&#x2F;farm-bills-and-farmers-the-effects-of-subsidies-over-time" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minneapolisfed.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;1996&#x2F;farm-bills-and-f...</a><p>i believe that we need an overhaul of ag in the usa. it gets mired in social justice and equality and how to redistribute land and creating villains and victims.<p>all that has it&#x27;s place..but there are also another important and relevant aspects to this. 1. automation of ag. 2. food sufficiency for our population and excess&#x2F;surplus for trade 3. protection of habitat and environment. keeping farm land safe and protected from development and speculation.<p>this isnt an easy topic and finding answers needs a lot of teasing and tugging to undo the knots. but ultimately, subsidies cannot be completely eliminated either because we dont want people to starve because they cant afford food. perhaps we need income supports rather than price supports.<p>i dont harbour dogma on the subject of subsidies and am still learning. but in my experience of reading and learning and observing, subsidies are always messy. they have been net net harmful than good. there has to be a better way. we need creative solutions.<p>i am sure we will get there. someday.')
