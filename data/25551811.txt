Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=[25552318], score=None, time=1609084419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551524, text='&gt; The moral of the story here isn&#x27;t that companies need to stop storing data, or that we need to run ML researchers out of town.<p>There is a lot of space between “user data and ML research on that data needs to be closely regulated” and “run the ML researchers out of town.”  This uncharitable exaggeration makes critics sound like an uninformed mob and closes yourself off to legitimate ideas. This directly leads to logically flawed and morally gross suggestions like:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s that people really need to start using the encryption technologies that were built decades ago to protect some of their most valuable assets, their mental model of the world.<p>It is simply not reasonable to expect most Facebook&#x2F;Skype&#x2F;etc users to know enough about encryption to make good decisions here - for the same reason that you can’t expect people to have detailed understanding of food science to protect themselves from unscrupulous grocers, or to have a detailed understanding of medicine to protect themselves from fraudulent doctors. It really doesn’t matter if this knowledge has been around for “decades” since it’s still specialist knowledge.<p>Protecting digital privacy from unscrupulous tech companies and unethical ML researchers is a job for the government. Suggesting otherwise is victim-blaming. “The problem is that society is dumb and needs to become smart through the power of self-righteous scolding” is not helpful.')
