That&#x27;s the same people as the &quot;anti-drug&quot; people.<p>It turns out that the anti-drug, anti-transgender, anti-gay, anti-science, anti-abortion, anti-vaccine, anti-education, anti-environmentalist, anti-healthcare, anti-mask, pro-police, pro-prison, pro-corporation, pro-pollution, pro-inequality, pro-torture, pro-religion group are all the same people.<p>The anti-drug laws are just a symptom of a much wider societal corruption.<p>We can&#x27;t be handing out forgiveness to our oppressors while they are still actively oppressing.')
