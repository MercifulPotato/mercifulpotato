Latent antibody bombs (on slitghest signal antibodies go from zero to hero) and antibody deserts (where even at late stages of desease only low antibody counts are produced).\nThose which easily make antibodies, kill off the virus quick enough to get significantly less side effects compared to the other group.<p>IF such model would hold, then it would be natural that antibody deserts dont produce much antibodies when reacting to vaccine, so there would be corellation between succeptible to covid mortality and vaccine innefectiveness.')
