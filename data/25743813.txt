Some bugs even prevented me from finishing a quest.<p>Despite this, I still enjoyed the game a lot. I wonder why the reaction is so different this time, as CDPR is not known for their &quot;perfect&quot; gameplay. That said, given their style of releasing, I&#x27;d prefer playing it later for patches and free additional content.')
