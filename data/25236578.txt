Item(by='kolinko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606556866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236544, text='+1, around half of the things the author mentions seems like a pure nostalgia.<p>Some of the points contradict with each other - he praises having independent OSes (and read-only disks) in one point, and then he wishes for settings to be consistent through OSes.<p>Also, some of the things he mentions already exist in MacOS, which is weird because he uses an old MacOS as an example. For example one application-one file is still true - most apps are packages, and you can have multiple versions of each app on the same MacOS, and it doesn&#x27;t matter where you run them from.<p>Sure, the settings are stored in separate directories, but this was also a conscious decision. In the times of DOS, you had your user files and folders scattered everywhere, and now it&#x27;s in your home folder.<p>He also postulates for an abandonment of linking (&quot;each object representing a file, not a link to a file&quot;) - that&#x27;s actually quite interesting. I think it would go badly quick, but a nice idea.<p>Ah, and finally - no auto updates. Sorry, but if we have persistent internet, we need auto-updates for security reasons. I absolutely hate it at times (especially on Windows), but it&#x27;s a necessity to keep the security :&#x2F;')
