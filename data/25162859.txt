We can sue if a doctor amputates the wrong limb.<p>How is software any different?<p>It&#x27;s simply a matter of making companies pay for externalities. If you pollute the environment with your business, you need to pay for that. If you pollute the world with buggy software, you need to pay for that. But all companies have externalities?! Yes, and they should all pay for their externalities and if the cost is high enough that the business is no longer profitable, it needs to close.<p>Software without bugs isn&#x27;t some pipe dream - the people writing software will simply be elevated to the level of a surgeon. Do you want your surgeon introducing &#x27;bugs&#x27; during your operation? I don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s why surgeons get extensive training and are highly compensated.<p>People want to pay people peanuts for software that barely works, so that they can capture and monopolize as much of the market as quickly as possible. Uh, that&#x27;s not my problem that people who want to get rich will have difficulty, I want shit that actually works.')
