Item(by='mbreese', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605491532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106715, text='<i>&gt; Are you comparing the cost to manufacture M1 to what costs Intel to make chips</i><p>Me personally? I have no way of knowing or estimating those costs either way. But that was how I interpreted the parent comment.<p>If you allow that R&amp;D costs for the M1 are largely aligned with the A* series for iPad that they would have already been paying (from your comment), then you&#x27;re left with the manufacturing costs.<p>For Intel, they have: 1) chip design R&amp;D, 2) fab method R&amp;D, 3) fab costs, 4) sales&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;profit margin<p>By switching to their own chips, Apple has absorbed #1 and #4, and left #2 and #3 to be outsourced to TSMC. If the main costs for #1 are duplicated from the iPad chip, then you&#x27;re left with fab costs (and fab R&amp;D).<p>But, again, even with the likely cost benefits of making your own chips (and avoiding the Intel profit margin), I doubt that was the deciding factor in switching. The costs probably made the switch possible, but wouldn&#x27;t have been the primary factor. Apple would gladly pay more per chip if it was more efficient (heat and power) and if they could control the release schedule. Even if their total costs for a single M1 chip are more than for an Intel chip, they probably still would have made the switch.')
