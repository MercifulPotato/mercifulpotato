However there are several things that some would take issue with.<p>The first being your framing. The discussion is frequently framed in the following manner: Complaints about having their content remove or discussion groups removed is some sort of nazi-larping shitposter or other undesirable looking to cause trouble. I am sure there are quite a few that may fit into that, but you cannot lump all complainants into that category because it just isn&#x27;t true.<p>The second is that is fundamentally doesn&#x27;t address the actual complaint itself. When people are complaining about removal of content on social media, they aren&#x27;t actually complaining about the rules per se. They are complaining about how they feel the rules are enforced.<p>Frequently the compliants are (but not limited to):<p>* That enforcement of the rules is applied arbitrarily and overwhelmingly favours one particular group based on the personal politics of the moderators. Whether that is true or not is another matter, they perceive it to be so and this isn&#x27;t frequently addressed.<p>* Context is frequently ignored within a discussion and because it has certain verboten terms it is removed. This is true because this has happened when content in the UK have been removed because people have used local colloquisms that are considered offensive outside of those communities but not within them.<p>e.g.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;home-news&#x2F;faggots-peas-advert-banned-google-fanny-s-cafe-newport-wales-a9099061.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;home-news&#x2F;faggots-peas...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;article-7911927&#x2F;Meat-lover-banned-Facebook-hate-speech-praising-butchers-faggots.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;article-7911927&#x2F;Meat-lover-...</a><p>* Enforcement is more lenient if someone is well-known (a presumably makes signifcant income for the site and themselves).')
