Tune the deck to only give you 2-3 new problems and 2-3 review problems (because these take time). Solve them, rate them, just like any other deck.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to practice programming exercises, but rather memorize facts, Anki is fine. Go through the common algorithms&#x2F;data structures (and the less common ones) and create cards that ask you things about it. &quot;What&#x27;s the big-O for inserting into a sorted linked list?&quot;<p>Or do like me, and skip those interviews because they&#x27;re usually a miserable experience and don&#x27;t really gauge the quality of the hire.')
