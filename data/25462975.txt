I don&#x27;t use facebook&#x2F;instagram very often (open maybe once a week?), all my interactions with people have been through stories this year.<p>I like that it is a DM when I reply and that I can easily skip, I also like that they&#x27;re &quot;now&quot; and someone is more likely to reply back or that I do not need to scroll endlessly to see someone&#x27;s life.<p>I post stories myself probably once per quarter, it is a good way of people interacting with you without leaving too much of an online footprint.<p>IMO is a welcome trend.')
