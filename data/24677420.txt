My home machine is a mid 2015 with 4 cores and 16gb ram.<p>For the life of me, I cannot discern any performance difference between the two. One thing I can discern is that the screen on the newer one has a big yellowish blob all around the edges of it, its left command key works half the time and it crashes constantly. I am so happy when I get to return to working on my home machine and god forbid it finally shits the bed on me because I have no idea what I would get next.')
