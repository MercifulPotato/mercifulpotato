IMO it&#x27;s almost completely unreasonable to expect Rust to be as nice as more-established ecosystems, so it being &quot;hard(er)&quot; is expected.  The community isn&#x27;t as large nor has it existed as long, so of course it&#x27;s not up to par yet.  Given the community is generally more focused on performance and safety, I&#x27;d honestly expect it to take the Rust community <i>longer</i> to reach &quot;nice for web projects&quot; than e.g. Go and Node took.')
