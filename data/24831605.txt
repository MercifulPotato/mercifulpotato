Item(by='Arathorn', descendants=None, kids=[24848579, 24831943], score=None, time=1603145569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831049, text='&gt; My own experience (particularly in online communities) is that once groups achieve a certain momentum, the average participant in the group cares very little about policies that impact a tiny minority of users no matter how draconian they are.<p>Agreed this can be a problem - but I wonder if it can be solved with UX?  If the filtering rules are really obvious, and the clients give you the ability to actually visualise and curate the filters being applied, I&#x27;d hope that it would be much easier to spot toxic moderation.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m just deeply disappointed to see it -- social credit styled systems like this penalize people for having bad mental health days, or who have unusual interests or points of view, or who are LGBTQ+, or belong to some other vulnerable minority group, and I think generally have a chilling effect on communities -- or rather on these specific subcultures within those communities, clearly not all of whom are &quot;bad faith&quot; actors.<p>Hm, &quot;social credit&quot; implies an absolute reputation system (like Reddit, HN, China etc ;) which this categorically isn&#x27;t.<p>The idea is that if you as a user want to subscribe to a reputation feed which prejudices against minority groups - then that&#x27;s your bad choice to make.  You&#x27;ll find yourself having to explicitly remove the filter to follow the conversations around you.  Alternatively, if you find yourself in a community which has engaged a blanket ban or filter on minorities, you may want to find a different community.<p>We get that there is a massive responsibility on the Matrix team to implement UX for this which is designed against factionalism, censorship, filter bubbles, absolutist social credit, persecution, polarisation, antagonism etc.  But we also feel a massive responsibility to stop users getting spammed with invites to child abuse&#x2F;gore&#x2F;hate rooms, or from accidentally hosting content which could get them incarcerated.<p>Critically, this stuff doesn&#x27;t really exist yet - the first developer hired to work fulltime on it hasn&#x27;t started yet.  So this is the perfect time to give feedback to help ensure this rep system actually works (at least as well as real life society does) and not go toxic like so many others have done before it.')
