You are a brain fighting for survival, against the monstrous odds.<p>What you now choose to do with that shell is up to you. You can train that brain, you can choose habits that are good or bad, and you can decide how to apply the bag of random accident that is you and your life to deliver on a purpose.<p>You may have certain privileges over others to help you on your way - richer family, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. can all make certain doors open or shut for you - but your meaningless life, born with no purpose, is yours to shape as you see fit.<p>You don&#x27;t need God to find purpose. In fact, defining your life as being in service to a deity narrows your potential. You might be happy with that, and I won&#x27;t try and convince you otherwise.<p>But your stance that not grabbing life for what it is and needing to believe in God to give yourself a sense of meaning and purpose - that&#x27;s the dark and depressing version of the story for many of us.')
