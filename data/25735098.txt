When the great famine happened under Mao, it was because Mao had surrounded himself by yes-men who were competing to be the most loyal. When the famine hit, the provinces all reported better yields than actual, collectivism happened based on reported and not actual yield, and millions of farmers starved.<p>His successor, Deng Xiaoping started a lot of really great reforms, including term limits on leadership and granting Shenzhen &amp; some other cities special&#x2F;experimental economic status, to basically run autonomously as capitalist.<p>Several decades later, paranoia is too strong. Xi Jinping removed term limits because he doesn&#x27;t trust others to run the country better than him. The One China policy has killed a number of vibrant cultures including those of Tibet, Hong Kong, and the Uyghurs. A social credit system is being implemented. Now Alibaba is being nationalized.<p>These issues will likely only get worse, until another great famine event.')
