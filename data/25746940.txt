They got fat on hosted server revenue and never iterated. Both of them had years (decade?) on discord and never thought to make their product free, web based or have a better chat. Ventrilo still has no official ios&#x2F;android app (lol). Both remind me of craigslist, actually- Except that craigslist is still going strong (for now).<p>Both still exist, granted- And many still use them. Its just that discord really shouldnt exist, it should have been one of these players. The head start they had should have been insurmountable.<p>Also, apologies for not really commenting on the subject at hand (TS supporting matrix) - Its just I so rarely hear about TS&#x2F;Vent that I thought it worth me shouting into the ether my disappointment I am not talking to all my friends on vent&#x2F;ts in 2021.')
