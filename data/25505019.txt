How did this practice ever become a defensible one? I guess there will plenty of US citizens who have found a way to rationalize&#x2F;defend this process, but I sincerely wonder if that might not be the most fundamental mistake of them all.<p>Seriously though .. why does anyone consider the USA a democratic state of law? I mean, both in absolute terms and in comparison with many other countries, it simply appears to be neither .. that despite unparalleled volumes of systemic propaganda to the contrary and many of its citizens stubbornly holding on to this belief that the USA is somehow a beacon and example to the rest of the world.<p>I grew up, as many others who grew up in NATO countries during the 80s, with horror stories about USSR and Chinese state propaganda. I have no doubt that a lot of that was actually true and certainly devastating. However, with the years, it increasingly appears as if the USA might actually be (and may always have been) the worst of them all. Just that most of its propaganda hides in plain sight, under banners of individual freedom and prosperity. Sure, you can say whatever you want, as long as you don&#x27;t pose any real threat to anything of importance. But that is actually not all that different in most parts of the world (Russia and China included; despite the US trying to convince everyone to the contrary). Sure, the USA appears to act less oppressive towards its citizens (or at least compared to the stories they tell about events in other countries). But with a population so thoroughly brainwashed since birth, and being able to do what they do (most lucrative&#x2F;criminal things almost exclusive in other countries) unopposed either way, maybe they just don&#x27;t need it as much.<p>Feel free to down vote and flag, I honestly don&#x27;t care (anymore). In fact, I would prefer to delete this account if HN allowed that. Because sincerely, I&#x27;m done with this site and this &quot;community&quot;. Good luck to you all.<p>Just don&#x27;t expect any sympathy, for anyone who will argue something along the lines of &quot;we didn&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;we could not have seen that coming&quot;.')
