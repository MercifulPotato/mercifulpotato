It sounded out of this world, like nothing else I had heard.<p>After listening to Eddie play guitar (on&#x2F;off) for decades, I&#x27;ve come to love his dynamics and touch, as well as his rhythm playing. He mastered the the technique of blending lead and rhythm into one, in a tight yet loose-feeling way.<p>There are, and have been, many much more advanced guitar players since Eddie started - but few are as fun to listen to as Eddie, and most of them (in hard-rock and metal) stand on the shoulders of greats like Eddie, either through his playing and style, or gear used. He made 80&#x27;s superstrats what they are today, he made hot-rodded&#x2F;modified Marshalls what the are today, hell, he even made the Peavey 5150 what it is today - which in turn spawned a whole slew of metal amps.<p>It&#x27;s been a tough year so far, as far as my heroes dying goes. I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to not have lost too many idols in the past, but with the passing of Neil Peart and Eddie - two of my top 5 musicians and music idols of all time, it&#x27;s been a real blow.<p>It&#x27;s been no secret that Eddie has suffered from cancer for years now, but still, you kind of forget about that, until the day comes.')
