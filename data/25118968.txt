For example, if you&#x27;re concerned that your ISP is going to tell people your IP address and say you own a Mac, you might want to think about whether having a VPN installed would prevent them from doing so, which will not be the case unless you set it up at the router level, configure it to drop traffic if the VPN connection fails, spread your traffic across multiple providers to make things like download profiling harder, etc.<p>Trying to conceal such general signals from a network-level attacker is a very hard game but once you stop to think about why you care, it becomes clear that it&#x27;s a waste of time. The two stories from a decade ago were about businesses presenting different rates based on the user-agent. If you&#x27;re not masking that, you&#x27;re giving away more detailed information to every site you visit. If you are masking that, you might say that the problem is your ISP selling your IP association to third-parties as part of a “can pay more” list and that clarifies that the real concern isn&#x27;t what your ISP can see — they do, after, all have your address, billing information, logs from your access to their services, and probably a credit score — but whether they resell it.<p>Putting it all together, your threat is “third-parties can obtain information which they would not otherwise have about me from my ISP”. That tells you that you need to think about breaking ways they&#x27;d make that link: using a VPN for web browsing can make a difference there since it means that Shady Bank™ can&#x27;t use an IP lookup (assuming your VPN provider wasn&#x27;t the threat you really needed to worry about) but trying to force Apple system services through it is just wasting time to make things slower and less reliable, and you&#x27;re much better off spending your time making sure that you use unique contact info, browser containers, etc. to limit the ability of third parties to link your data. In a world where most people use cell phones, Google, Facebook, etc. it&#x27;s just not that valuable to have a signal which says “IP x uses products from one of the most popular consumer electronics companies”.')
