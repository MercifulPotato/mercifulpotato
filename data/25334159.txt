Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607361120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330468, text='One unfortunate dangling problem with the historical nomenclature is this:<p><pre><code>   &quot;scales have modes&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis is wrong. A scale is an interval series. A mode is an interval series. There is no difference between them.<p>It just so happens that there are ways to permute some interval series to generate others. Because western music is so focused on the interval series we call the major scale,  people noted that you can permute this into a series of other interval series. But none of those interval series (Aeolian, Phrygian, Lydian etc) &quot;own&quot; or are the basis for the others: they are all related by permutation. You could just as easily say &quot;Modes of the Phrygian scale&quot; and you would still be referring to the same set of interval series.')
