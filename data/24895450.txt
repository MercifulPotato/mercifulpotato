This time around I&#x27;m going Green. I think Creepy Joe is kind of fun, but I have no doubt that the inexorable drumbeat for sanctions and wars will intensify when he is president. We still haven&#x27;t left Syria, so whoever it is on the &quot;democrat&quot; side of the party who has such a hard-on for pipelines will get to kill more innocents there. Even better for them, Trump has destroyed the one decent diplomatic thing Obama did (Iran), so they won&#x27;t have to pretend not to undermine the work of their &quot;own side&quot;. (Keep in mind that Syria and Iran are allies, even though Republicans pretend to hate Iran while Democrats pretend to hate Syria.)<p>I don&#x27;t vote for lesser evils. Because of that I never have to regret how I voted.')
