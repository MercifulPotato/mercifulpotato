For the 2 scanners, these were scanned fully &quot;raw&quot;, without any software colour correction or sharpening (FlexColor for the Imacon, Epson Scan 2 for the V600). The camera scan is using my 2012 Fuji X-E1 with a Micro-Nikkor 55mm @ f&#x2F;8, and the V600 negative carrier, with an iPad as a light source (there&#x27;s some barrel distortion; i&#x27;m still ironing out my rig). Final results corrected by my meatbag eye in Affinity (I had to increase saturation of the V600 scans to match the other two), hence the slightly different colour rendition, but the difference in grain resolution and overall detail should be pretty clear.')
