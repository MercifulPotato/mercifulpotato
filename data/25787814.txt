I think I recently deliberated on this point about ideas being cheap because they can so deceptively sit in the realm of the ideal where everything is unconstrained and unchallenged. Grounding ideas and putting them to the test is where you begin to discover all the boundaries and tradeoffs and messy details that must be sorted through. Real work has a way of illuminating all those sticky messy points that must line up first for an idea to have a legging in the real world. Our imaginations are free to come up with all sorts of inconsistent and conflicting ideas that just never come to the foreground because of the centration on the beautiful perfect idea.')
