Alphafold won&#x27;t tell you anything about protein dynamics, side-chain positions, water interactions, charges, binding pockets or induced conformational changes. All of these things matter as much or more than the structure of the backbone itself.<p>One way to think about it is this: alphafold gives you the rough shape of the skeleton, but a protein, just a like a human, has a lot more going on than just the skeleton.')
