AWS is a $44 billion run-rate business.\n2. This estimate from the Duckbill group has EC2 at 60% of the AWS bills of &quot;large accounts&quot;. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckbillgroup.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;public-cloud-analysis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckbillgroup.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;public-cloud-analysis...</a>\n3. I used to work in EC2 Networking and looked at the graphs with the server counts for all of EC2 on a weekly basis, so I can&#x27;t say the actual numbers here, but I have a very good idea how big the EC2 fleet is.\n4. 60% of 44 billion gives us an estimate of 26 billion run rate for just EC2.\n5. In my time at Amazon where I was on multiple teams that ran large fleets (thousands of machines), and I heard about utilization numbers for services like Lambda and Fargate, 50% utilization would be a very, very good number for VMs in the cloud.\n6. 50% of 26 billion is over 10 billion per year of wasted server capacity (that people are paying AWS for)<p>So yeah, tens of billions of dollars of AWS and the other cloud providers revenue are likely &quot;waste&quot; from the POV of customers.')
