They&#x27;re voluntary<p>The problem is that they are a lot less voluntary then you think in certain segments.<p>* Running ads against a blog without using Google Adsense puts you at a disadvantage.<p>* Running an online store without Google Shopping puts you at a big disadvantage.<p>* Bootstrapping an online video show without YouTube is effectively impossible.<p>So if you are, say, an independent videographer, YouTube is not voluntary. The alternative is to not be an independent videographer, or to kludge together 5 other services that will get you 10% of the viewership and 10% of the revenue.')
