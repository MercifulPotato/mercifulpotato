If you&#x27;re not in a super-large library with full anonymity, your librarians will definitely know when you&#x27;re reading a lot of books that suggest some ideology. They may not keep a profile written down, but they definitely will remember. And they do keep a list of books you took home, at least our local library does.<p>Regarding new ideas: might be different in other places of the world, but public libraries over here aren&#x27;t that well stocked and feel like they primarily offer what the librarians value (which will largely mirror the mainstream opinion of the general population, as they&#x27;re state employees). That&#x27;s different for university libraries, which do keep a more diverse collection.')
