I remember working for an ISP in the dialup days. I saw the separation of roles between those concerned with the platform and those concerned with the running applications even back then.<p>To call it a brief fad, I think, misses a lot of what&#x27;s happened in the market and the different roles with their different concerns.<p>&gt; Every platform has constraints.<p>We live in a world where you have a platform built on a platform. To a node.js or PHP developer you&#x27;ll have people thinking of those as the platforms. They aren&#x27;t thinking about Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows, or the other lower level systems.<p>This is why a JS dev will code something up on a Mac and then run it on Linux in production. node.js is the platform for them.<p>But, with containers we&#x27;re also asking them to make the Linux distro with all the things related to that as part of their platform. Not to just make it work but keep up on security. This is the wrong level in the stack for them. If they put a bunch of time into being concerned with that it will slow their velocity on the node.js work and be a big context switch (along with different knowledge in this context).<p>It looks like I see a bunch of Ops&#x2F;DevOps people saying that app devs should be concerned with their stuff in addition or in displacement to their own. That&#x27;s not happening well for a reason.')
