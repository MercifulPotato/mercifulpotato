A lot of the taxes and expensive regulations are certainly well intentioned, but making them mandatory prevents a lot of people with entrepreneurial drive but low resources from getting into the game. It also creates a higher cost for people who would be glad to get a cheaper option with some risk of discomfort. It&#x27;s so hard to roll back regulations once they&#x27;ve been put in place, though, that the only way you can create these options is to build entirely new models that skirt the entire structure.')
