I&#x27;d always joked that I&#x27;d be happy being in jail as long as I could read all the books I&#x27;ve ever wanted to read.  Figured this was a good chance to put my money where my mouth is.  Haven&#x27;t gotten to Anna Karenina yet but did finish the Brothers Karamazov, The Winter of Our Discontent, Moby Dick, Lolita, East of Eden, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Breakfast of Champions and The Idiot.')
