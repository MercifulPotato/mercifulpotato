Arguably docker is just another abstraction for &quot;statically linked executable&quot;. But we&#x27;ve had static executables for years; and they work well, and the ABI for the linux kernel is very stable. So increasingly I&#x27;m not convinced docker is worth it, compared to just building and deploying bundled executables. And executables can be run anywhere, they don&#x27;t need a separate testing environment, they can be debugged easily[1], and so on.<p>[1] Well, if you like systemd or have a reasonable replacement.')
