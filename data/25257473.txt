In particular the 80&#x27;s come to mind. Yes the practitioners think that there&#x27;s no technical barriers stopping them from eating the world, but that&#x27;s exactly what people thought about other so-called revolutionary advances.<p>Although to be pedantic, &quot;expert systems&quot; is the technology behind AI boom of the 80&#x27;s. At the time people were saying expert systems can&#x27;t be as good as existing algorithms (including what we would now call &quot;machine learning&quot; techniques), then suddenly the expert systems were better and there was rampant speculation real AI was around the corner. Then they plateaued.<p>We <i>appear</i> to be at the tail end of the maximum hype part of the boom-bust cycle. Thinking that the rapid gains being made by the current deep learning approaches will soon hit a wall is a reasonable outside-view prediction to make: nearly every time we&#x27;ve had a similarly transformative technology in the AI space and elsewhere, hitting the wall is exactly what happened. The onus would be on practitioners to show that this time really is different.')
