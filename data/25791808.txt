You <i>can</i> buy a last generation laptop with a 4500u however there is merit to buying a new laptop with all new features the laptop itself provides. Also, the design might be &#x27;last generation&#x27; however that does not mean its exactly the same. which is important because architectural changes can and have caused problems that were adressed in later revisions of the same cpu. You&#x27;d be surprised how much effort most people put in to researching consumer electronics decisions. their knowledge might scratch the surface of what technical people know months in advance to a cpu launch but it is significant nonetheless.')
