Literacy.<p>I saw many beginners who treat a compiler like a black box and attempting hand fuzzing until it happened to match the well-formed syntax and behaviour they wanted, while they literally holding a paper text book or opening a browser tab for a tutorial which clearly explain how it works and what they should write in a plain natural and native language of theirs.<p>One time, I was told by a beginner who copied an example code from a text book that it doesn&#x27;t work. I looked at it. It was a fizzbuzz code, less than 10 lines. And she typed it wrong. Not just an ordinary typo. She conjured up really strange ill-formed syntax she believe it works somehow. There is a parse error message but she ignored. I pointed out the place on display with a finger and she still didn&#x27;t get it. I place a text book beside the display but it requires a considerable effort convincing her the cause of the error.<p>Other time, I was asked why for(;;) ; else ; doesn&#x27;t work in JavaScript. I kept saying because there is no syntax like that in JavaScript. You have to accept it as is or create your own language.<p>Sometimes, I wonder some people read natural language text by simple keyword pattern matching. People like above example weren&#x27;t dumb. Far from it. They are smarter in their field than me. Yet, they failed at this basic literacy level.')
