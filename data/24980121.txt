Harmony Explorer also lets you listen to the chords, not just view them.<p>It is interesting to see how similar our approaches to note algebra is. While my project is written in Rust, it looks like we calculate note names in a very similar way [1].<p>I also really like the way you are handling accidentals - by storing accidentals including double-sharps and double-flats alongside the notes. I am using a global variable which picks between using sharps or flats when showing accidentals - works fine for now but definitely does not cover all use cases. I&#x27;ll see if your approach can solve some of the problems I&#x27;ve encountered.<p>Thank you again for sharing, I feel like I learned many useful things from just a cursory glance at Kord. Likewise, I hope you find Harmony Explorer interesting!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tiniuclx&#x2F;harmony-explorer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tiniuclx&#x2F;harmony-explorer</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tiniuclx&#x2F;harmony-explorer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;music_theory.rs#L239" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tiniuclx&#x2F;harmony-explorer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src...</a>')
