Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607246542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321566, text='^H is the ASCII control character for backspace. It has nothing to do with vi, and everything to do with a terminal. It used to be common knowledge that when you press Backspace, sometimes ^H appears on your screen (if the program in question couldn&#x27;t handle control characters natively). Naturally, in forum posts it started to have the meaning of &quot;delete&quot; for humorous purpose.<p>Its modern equivalent is HTML tag &lt;del&gt;&lt;&#x2F;del&gt;, which also means &quot;delete&quot; due to the common knowledge of its meaning. One doesn&#x27;t have to be a front-end developer to understand &lt;del&gt;, and one didn&#x27;t have to be a vi user to understand ^H.')
