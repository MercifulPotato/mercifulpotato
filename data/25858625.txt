To make it clearer:<p>Client &lt;--&gt; Server.\nThe server is AGPL licenced.<p>I can write a client to talk to the server and I don&#x27;t have any licence restrictions. For example - if I write a web client to talk to an AGPL web server, I don&#x27;t have to open source the client.<p>If I modify the AGPL server, and then put that modified server on the internet then the AGPL terms require me to make available the modified source code.<p>I am not a lawyer, but this is my understanding of this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;choosealicense.com&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;agpl-3.0&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;choosealicense.com&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;agpl-3.0&#x2F;</a>')
