Adam Smith and Ricardo already showed that you should abolish your own trade barriers unilaterally regardless of what the other guy is doing, no need for any agreements.<p>(But that&#x27;s a digression.  I agree that free trade agreements are largely seen as pro-market by the general public.)<p>In any case, NAFTA stems from the bygone era of the Washington Consensus.  It mostly predates the time I am talking about.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a tiny bit of market in the American healthcare system.  But it&#x27;s a very small sliver.<p>Have a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;considerations-on-cost-disease&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;considerations-on-cost...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;highlights-from-the-comments-on-cost-disease&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;highlights-from-the-co...</a> for a more in-depth and even-handed discussion than I could give you.  Especially the &#x27;certificate of need&#x27; is interesting.  (Basically, existing hospitals in an area can veto any new hospital.)<p>Yes, if you by &quot;market&quot; you mean &quot;corporate welfare&quot; and &quot;crony capitalism&quot;, than what your comment makes total sense.<p>A perfect free market might never have existed, but good enough approximations do; and it&#x27;s useful to move more areas in that direction.')
