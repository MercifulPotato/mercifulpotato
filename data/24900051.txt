It&#x27;s meant to point out that I follow media outlets with major influence for their respective audience. Breitbart is unfortunately a favorite for Republican audiences alongside Fox News, which is why they&#x27;re mentioned. It&#x27;s important to track media outlets that have large influence over Democrat and Republican audiences to be aware of what the parties will use as &quot;evidence&quot; to their position and the downfall of those sources.')
