Hoover was a criminal in the literal sense of the word: he repeatedly and brazenly violated US laws, and fostered a culture of illegality in the FBI. His crimes are well attested by both his own records and the official records of the FBI. The FBI is a law enforcement organization; anybody who knows this history of LEOs in the US shouldn&#x27;t be particularly surprised that they defend their own.<p>Many Americans <i>do</i> hate him. But it&#x27;s important to note that Hoover&#x27;s criminality did not extend to the average White American: his efforts focused on Black Americans, gays, and anybody sufficiently &quot;radical&quot; by the standards of cold war America.<p>Ronald Reagan also has buildings named after him, mind you.')
