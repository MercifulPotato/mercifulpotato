One particularly topical observation (topical because HN has recently featured discussions about ways to merge statistical and symbolic approaches to AI), from Section 4.2.3: certain cutting-edge number systems such as Conway&#x27;s &quot;surreal numbers&quot; are so sophisticated that they require lots of symbolic logic just to do basic operations with. Of course this makes these number systems hard to work with, but they do not suffer the flaws pointed out in the paper, which the easier-to-work-with real numbers suffer. Since surreal numbers inherently require symbolic logical methods to work with, it follows that any sort of statistics-based RL agent for environments with surreal number rewards, would <i>automatically</i> combine symbolic logic and statistics.')
