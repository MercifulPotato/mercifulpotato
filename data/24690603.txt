If your ideas are any good, you&#x27;ll have to ram them down people&#x27;s throats.&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Howard_H._Aiken" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Howard_H._Aiken</a><p>Also, the same skills required to come up with good ideas are probably the same skills required to make those ideas work. If you&#x27;re experienced enough to know there&#x27;s a need in some market, you&#x27;ll only succeed if you have experience enough to develop and sell a solution. So, if someone successfully takes the market from under you they were probably already ahead of you even when you were first.<p>But the above quote is also why I&#x27;m skeptical of validating ideas in the landing page stage. The walkman was just as good as the iPod until I spent 5 minutes using the iPod, but no landing page would&#x27;ve convinced me.')
