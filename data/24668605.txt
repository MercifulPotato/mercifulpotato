All the major brands of smartphones have offerings at similar price points to the iPhone lineup. And in the United States, iPhones have around 50% of the smartphone market share.<p>The same largely applies to Apple&#x27;s other product lines too, which the exception that they simply don&#x27;t attempt to compete in the bottom-dollar markets for laptops or desktop PCs. So I would definitely say that Apple doesn&#x27;t make junk for the race-to-the-bottom market, but I&#x27;m hesitant to call them a luxury brand.')
