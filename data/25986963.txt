Just use gemini:&#x2F;&#x2F; rather than <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> to refer to that specific subset of https + html. Maybe also add a header to the server response that says x-gemini: true or whatever.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s difficult or even impossible to deactivate support for all the unwanted features in mainstream browsers<p>Just do not use mainstream browsers then. Make your own like you do for gemini. They address it a bit later with:<p>&gt; Writing a dumbed down web browser which gracefully ignores all the unwanted features is much harder than writing a Gemini client from scratch<p>And I will disagree on this part, http 1.0 is actually easier to implement than the gemini protocol.<p>&gt; Even if you did it, you&#x27;d have a very difficult time discovering the minuscule fraction of websites it could render.<p>Except gemini browsers render even less websites right now.<p>It seems to me that the gemini developers can&#x27;t really think outside the box. This is further proven by their dependence on things like TCP, TLS, and DNS.')
