The issue is with you.<p>The idea that having a negative outlook about the tech workplace is cause for professional intervention to tinker around in someones brain is exactly the kind of lopsided conventional wisdom that doesn&#x27;t do anyone any good.  It&#x27;s OK to hate your job.  Lots of jobs suck.  Even jobs some people find a way to like can be miserable.  Industries where it&#x27;s normal for people to expect work to not be fun but have to do it anyway, they have better collective coping mechanisms than tech does.  People don&#x27;t feel wrong for hating their job, and don&#x27;t have to be afraid to admit it when looking for support.<p>Pedantically, yes someone suffering from burnout would benefit from talking with a therapist.  But in a practical sense going after someone with &quot;The issue is with you&quot; for trying to have a casual talk about burnout among peers is a brutal over-reaction.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve been in tech for far longer, I love it. We really live in the future, when I see the advances that have been made and stop and really contrast with 20yrs or even 10yrs ago, I&#x27;m very humbled.<p>The idea that technology and&#x2F;or progress in and of themselves could or should offset any of the negatives in the workplace is not only bullshit, but a really dumb thing to say to someone dealing with the stressors that lead to burnout.')
