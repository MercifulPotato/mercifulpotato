The closest thing might be a plea agreement, but that happens after an indictment. You still have the right to a trial, but you may forego it if you choose.<p>I suppose if you&#x27;re saying that a security clearance is like an NDA with the state, it&#x27;s a reasonable comparison in function, but the means of prosecution is entirely different. It&#x27;s like saying that everyone could be subject to UCMJ because of conscription.')
