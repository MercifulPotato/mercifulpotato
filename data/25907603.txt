They probably don&#x27;t care, since they&#x27;re clearly motivated purely by greed, not by any sense of pride in what they&#x27;re building.<p>I don&#x27;t normally have opinions this strong about a company, but man do they take pride in insulting the intelligence of every user who sees their ads.')
