Item(by='ghaberek', descendants=None, kids=[25308535], score=None, time=1607116440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307697, text='&gt; this breaks the identity `arr[idx] == <i>(arr + idx)`. as a c++ (and sometimes c) dev, I tend to consider &quot;index&quot; and &quot;offset&quot; to be functionally equivalent. hard pass.<p>And I think that&#x27;s the problem. Programmers have collectively conflated the concept of &quot;offset from the address&quot; and &quot;position in the list&quot; as the same concept, and they&#x27;re not the same thing. Both concepts have their uses but they&#x27;re separate distinct concepts. C and C++ don&#x27;t </i>index* a list, they simply <i>offset</i> it, and too many other languages that don&#x27;t care about in-memory addresses or offsets have carried the concept from <i>offset</i> over to <i>index</i> erroneously.')
