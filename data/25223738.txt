If I take the bait, then I&#x27;m a sucker, and I&#x27;d rather keep my money and not be a sucker. To turn phrases in that way is sensationalism, and while I&#x27;m sure it works for you, I believe it trades short term cash for long term trust. When the next sucker finds that he can&#x27;t reproduce your results, there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;ll feel shafted.')
