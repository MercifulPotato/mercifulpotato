These tend to have the same crap (to me) approach. But they&#x27;re drive by the same exigencies - to help  deliver advertising, to foil the most garbagy SEO and monetize the rest, to provide &quot;answers&quot; rather than just key-word search (IE, dumb things down for the masses).<p><i>Google has a browser monopoly and it has been integral to providing a moat for their search monopoly</i><p>I&#x27;m writing on Firefox, I love firefox and I&#x27;ve heard good things about Edge. Of course, Firefox is supported by Google and uses Google by default but I spent a year on Duck Duck Go and unlike Firefox, it really does suck. To expand, it&#x27;s suckiness isn&#x27;t lack of money but because it&#x27;s clearly trying to do everything, all the bad things interface-wise, that Google does (&quot;answers&quot;, weight-to-new-and-recent result, etc) but worse.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s really terrible that all interfaces have become interfaces for morons, that the paradigm for any company is &quot;we give you few choices and use sophisticated AI to give you the choice we think you&#x27;d want &#x27;cause giving you choices and tools means you might not decide what we want you to decide&quot;. But this paradigm doesn&#x27;t actually relate to companies being monopolies. It really is what some portion of people want&#x2F;need and it serves any company that doesn&#x27;t have organized nerds as their customer base. I&#x27;d love to get past this but &quot;break up Google&quot; doesn&#x27;t address this.')
