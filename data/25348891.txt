I saw an earlier comment mentioning that these use &quot;plastic&quot; drivers, as a sign that they are cheap. Generally speaking, the greatest speakers in the world use plastic or paper material for the cones in their drivers. (Google SEAS or Scan-Speak drivers for some examples). A minority of speakers use aluminum or other lightweight metals instead, but generally it is not preferred.<p>Third, most of the comments on this article are comparing them to traditional, passive headphones in the ~$500 range. These are active headphones with onboard DSP. The physical construction of a speaker matters much less when you can simply shape the response via DSP. If you&#x27;ve ever listened to Bose QC headphones with and without the onboard electronics engaged, you know there&#x27;s a night and day difference and in addition to the noise cancellation, that difference is due to DSP EQ&#x27;ing of the headphone&#x27;s output.<p>Fourth, Apple has a solid track record when it comes to audio engineering. They&#x27;ve had some misses, but their laptops, phones, tablets, and other devices tend to measure very well[1][2] in the audio department. So trusting Apple to &quot;do the right thing&quot; with an audio product (if perhaps not at a desirable price) is a reasonable proposition.<p>_____<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=site%3Aaudiosciencereview.com+apple+measurements" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=site%3Aaudiosciencereview.co...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kenrockwell.com&#x2F;audio&#x2F;index.htm#reviews" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kenrockwell.com&#x2F;audio&#x2F;index.htm#reviews</a>')
