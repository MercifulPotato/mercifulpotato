This is the first time in decades that we see a serious non-x86 competitor for general purpose consumer-level computing. This is significant in and of itself.<p>2. Power consumption. These things seem to consume 2&#x2F;3rds as many watts to offer the same performance levels than their x86 counterparts. This is big in the laptop space.')
