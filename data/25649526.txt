A regime change is not a likely consequence of sanctions, it&#x27;s much more likely that the Iranian government looks at the economic toll of it&#x27;s choice to pursue nuclear weapons development and decides to change course. Without a doubt these sanctions cause much misery - the bulk of it inflicted on everyday people who are not decision makers in the country. But allowing a country that regularly threatens to wipe other countries off the map to develop nuclear weapons stands to create orders of magnitude more misery than economic sanctions.')
