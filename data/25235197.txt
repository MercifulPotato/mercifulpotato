Item(by='pksebben', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606536694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227651, text='There is some really, really good advice in here for those folks who might be struggling with identity and self-valuation in today&#x27;s excessively connected culture.  There are a couple of indelicate points, however, that I think bear addressing.<p>&quot;Independent-mindedness&quot; is a very, very leaky abstraction.  It is certainly not a scalar quantity (as Paul seems to suggest), nor is it something one is born with.  At best, it is a measurement of distance from the cultural mean, and culture is n-dimensional.<p>Culture is also contextual.  Paul trades a little paint with this concept but fails to impact it fully.  If you&#x27;re trying to expand your understanding of the world (and consequently your ability to reason about it, which <i>will</i> help you think for yourself), one of the best things you can do is to travel &#x2F; move &#x2F; change jobs &#x2F; insert contextual mix-up here.<p>He touches on some qualities adjacent to these concepts with stunningly good advice.  Think for yourself.  Be curious.  Ask what&#x27;s missing.  Step back and see how people think.  However, he notably avoids giving a name to one of the most important components of curiosity; that of humility.  He talks around it quite a bit - but somehow misses calling it out explicitly.  This feels like the kind of thing that someone of his considerable success might take a little for granted.  Not that he doesn&#x27;t have it himself, I cannot make an assessment as to that one way or the other.<p>This leads me to one of the things I found most dissonant about this piece; Paul absolutely <i>nails</i> it when he talks about having sovereignty over your thoughts.  In the context of an article that&#x27;s about &quot;how to make it&quot;.  Pressure to succeed financially or to gain social recognition is one of the most deleterious forces to a diverse culture of thought.  Forgive me for getting a little political here, but IMHO it&#x27;s the core reason that capitalism has an upper bound.  Fiscal incentives are by their nature (and design) reductive.<p>From there, I have a couple of other, relatively minor, gripes.  I&#x27;m as uncomfortable as many of the rest of you with how specific the prescriptions for &quot;thinking for yourself&quot; get.  Furthermore, the idea that you have to insulate yourself against those who are different from you (even if you perceive that difference to be I&#x27;m weird and they&#x27;re not) is fundamentally antithetical to expanding your worldview.<p>That being said, if you&#x27;re struggling with feeling like the world is trying to put you in a box, the things Paul suggests here are helpful:  Indulge your curiosity.  Don&#x27;t hang out with people who get down on you for being you.  Humor and ingenuity are sibling concepts.  Don&#x27;t participate in intellectual fashion.<p>Most importantly, don&#x27;t let people tell you how to think.')
