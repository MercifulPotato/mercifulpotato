It doesn&#x27;t matter what term is worse. Calling people lazy and crazy is also a form of subhumanization.<p>Besides, you only have to check geenstijl.nl (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geenstijl.nl&#x2F;5155500&#x2F;et-tu-francisco&#x2F;#comments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geenstijl.nl&#x2F;5155500&#x2F;et-tu-francisco&#x2F;#comments</a>) for worse: the left are terrorism enablers, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t link directly but I quote: &quot;Moslims zijn beter te vergelijken met linkse activisten, andere meningen worden niet getolereerd en desnoods met geweld onderdrukt.&quot;<p>(Translation: You can compare muslim with leftist activists, other opinions are not tolerated and are repressed, with violence if needed).<p>So your point that the left is somehow worse at demonizing is invalid. People of both sides do it, and both are wrong.<p>So I hope you can focus on policy instead, because the statement that one party is worse at name calling is biased and doesn&#x27;t lead us anywhere.')
