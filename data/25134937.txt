Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=[25135717], score=None, time=1605692897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134619, text='&gt; The US won a land war against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraqi military, twice, easily.<p>That&#x27;s one way to look at it. Another (and IMO more correct) way to look at it is that the US <i>lost</i> there once (hence the second invasion), and will lose again in 10-20 years as the Iraqi elites wait it out and things revert to the mean. Oh, and we lost in Syria as well, although not funding and not arming ISIS did help to alleviate some of the problems in the last few years. Assad is still right where he was, and he will remain there for decades to come.<p>This is much like Napoleon &quot;winning&quot; the war against Russia in 1812. Captured Moscow. Pissed on the floor in the Kremlin. And then he got chased back all the way to Paris and exiled.<p>Except in the Middle East it&#x27;s even worse than that. The US tends to forget that those folks represent much older civilizations and they live on a different time scale. They can literally sit it out for 20-30 years while we sink trillions of taxpayer dollars there and while our soldiers are torn apart with an occasional IED. They also culturally don&#x27;t give a flying fuck about &quot;democracy&quot; or whatever. There&#x27;s really not a hell of a lot that can be done about that, and there&#x27;s no way to &quot;win&quot; under such circumstances.<p>If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.<p>That&#x27;s why there won&#x27;t be a permanent &quot;victory&quot; there, in any sense of the word.')
