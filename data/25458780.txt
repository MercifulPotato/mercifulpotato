That said, software is not some abstract thing that exists (or at least exists usefully) outside of the context of computer hardware--which is clearly in the domain of electrical engineering.<p>That <i>can</i> be less true today given the additional layers of abstraction we continue to pile on in general. But I&#x27;d still argue that computer science is closely tied to the hardware that computer science concepts as implemented in software runs on. And therefore, it can make sense to lump it in with the engineering and, specifically, electrical engineering.<p>(Certainly my opinion is probably flavored by the fact that, where I got a different engineering degree, electrical engineers and CS majors typically get the same Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering degree.)')
