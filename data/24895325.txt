You can argue that intelij does it better but that just a subjective opinion. Even when it&#x27;s true that is just doing things slightly better, in no way &quot;light year ahead&quot;, with a major downsize of being a jvm resource hog. Even electron apps perform better. I&#x27;ve never had to wait for vscode running index on a project.<p>Vscode is actually &quot;light year ahead&quot; across the board with newer&#x2F;niche languages like rust or ocaml. They invented LSP which makes supporting new languages way easier without compromising intelligence.')
