Item(by='samatman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609610119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613352, text='I upvoted this because, y&#x27;know, you&#x27;re right.<p>I take a different conclusion from the facts you present, but I know better than to get into it in HN, other than maybe to say: wow, lots of the primary discoverers of scientific principles, and inventors of basic technology, had this shamanic side, maybe there&#x27;s something to that.<p>You&#x27;re probably getting dinged for describing Shockley as &quot;basically a Nazi&quot;. I mean, I hope it&#x27;s not for describing <i>Henry Ford</i> that way, since yeah, that&#x27;s accurate. Shockley sued someone for that characterization and won. I&#x27;d hazard that characterizing him as a racist, and proponent of eugenics, would be less controversial; I&#x27;m not at all interested in litigating William Shockley&#x27;s reputation.<p>Worth point out, though, that both Ford and Shockley were pretty boring &quot;normies&quot; whose opinions were widely held by others. So your point would have been better made by dropping the first sentence, or even burying it a bit further down.')
