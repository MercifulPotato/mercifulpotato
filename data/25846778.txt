Item(by='dan-robertson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611152840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25845583, text='Well there is a language that lets you decide how to handle errors separately from the code that actually handles them (eg separating the code that says “please retry” from the code that retries). That language is Common Lisp. But error handling in it is still a pain.<p>The one advantage it has over most exception systems in my opinion is that the equivalent of try-finally is much more common than try-catch. With exceptions, code often does weird things because it isn’t expecting to lose control flow when an exception is raised, but most languages don’t make it easy to catch stack unwinding a and clean up. In Common Lisp unwind-protect plus the style of with-foo macros tends to make it more common for functions to work when control transfers out of them in abnormal ways.')
