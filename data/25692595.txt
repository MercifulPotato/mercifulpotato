People talk about &quot;Proud Boys&quot; as if that&#x27;s equivalent and I just have to roll my eyes.<p>There is an immense reservoir of anger within America in people who feel overlooked and the system is stacked against them.  If they receive the downsides of civil strife even though they haven&#x27;t participated in violence, they might decide they want the upsides of civil strife as well.  This culture, unlike the sadly tolerated insurrections of Antifa, has the ability to have real power through violence if it ever came to it.')
