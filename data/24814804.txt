Serious crime isn&#x27;t evenly distributed over time, so a police force has to have enough armed officers available on duty to handle spikes in demand. Statistical modelling is getting better, but the failure scenario here of &quot;oh sorry, we couldn&#x27;t respond to your home invasion for an hour because we were busy&quot; is absolutely unacceptable to the general population. Here&#x27;s an example of this, where the police were pilloried by the media (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oregonlive.com&#x2F;crime&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;intruder-with-knife-boy-being-held-no-portland-police-response-for-1-hour-36-minutes.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oregonlive.com&#x2F;crime&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;intruder-with-knife...</a>).
