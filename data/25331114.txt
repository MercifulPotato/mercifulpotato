In my experience (never worked at FAANG), the brilliant C programmer hypothesis is almost untested, since most companies hire mostly average C programmers. It&#x27;s only logical that non-brilliant programmers will be working somewhere.<p>Even if a company has a few brilliant C programmers on staff, they won&#x27;t be able to find all the issues the mediocre programmers produce.<p>This is why I think it&#x27;s about time that any safety critical industry should think of retiring C in favor of safer alternatives.<p>Rust would personally be my favorite since it solves most of the really terrible issues around memory management in C and C++ (mediocre programmers not being able to compile due to the borrow checker is a feature).<p>Of course Rust doesn&#x27;t have the necessary certifications yet, but industry would be wise to contribute. Such efforts are underway (Sealed Rust by Ferrous Systems), but I don&#x27;t see big aerospace, automotive and industry sponsorship here, i.e. those who would benefit the most.<p>There is a safer language that is certified that is often ignored, which is ADA. It&#x27;s actually quite modern in terms of features since the 2012 release. It has some other concepts than Rust for safety, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s worse. The heavy lifting in terms of design and certification here has been paid for by the DoD and aerospace companies, so there&#x27;s no reason other industries couldn&#x27;t use it.')
