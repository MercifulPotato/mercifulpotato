In an older GitHub where he requested contributions, I pointed out that he had barely worked on the project for many months (at that time), and not published a new version to npm in years[1], despite making a $600 withdrawal from his Open Collective fund in June 2018 with the explicit purpose of releasing v5[2].<p>In the thread, I suggested that I and others might be willing to contribute, but I wanted more certainty on what exactly my contribution would be paying for. As I saw it, at that point he had a number of regular donors who were essentially paying him to do nothing.<p>He responded very angrily, saying nobody had any right to question his actions or to expect anything from him, even if they were paying him. He then deleted my comment entirely and banned me from commenting further. This interaction didn&#x27;t exactly leave me with a strong desire to contribute. I think he&#x27;s a rather volatile individual and the community would indeed be better off forking this project than indulging his sense of grievance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;faker.js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;faker.js</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;fakerjs&#x2F;expenses&#x2F;3972" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;fakerjs&#x2F;expenses&#x2F;3972</a>')
