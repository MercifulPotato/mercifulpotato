Yes the IO calls themselves are blocking but you can easily wrap them in separate OS threads.<p>The GVL will release when the IO call blocks allowing another OS thread, including the parent, to continue.<p>That allows you to make blocking calls in parallel but is heavier weight than using the new scheduler and fibres for those parallel IO calls.<p>In the case of ActiveRecord I think it’s down to the database driver implementation, anyone who knows care to comment?')
