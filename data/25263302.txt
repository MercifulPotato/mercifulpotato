Few games are popular enough in themselves to have a big enough market to make it profitable to run a competing alternate currency market.<p>With Robux you can buy 100 Robux for real money and then spend 20 Robux in one game, 15 in another, 40 for a skin you can use in all games and save the rest for use in some future game that you haven&#x27;t discovered yet. This flexibility makes Robux much more &#x27;desirable&#x27; than any single in game currency.')
