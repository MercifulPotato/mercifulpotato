The POWER version was called &quot;PowerVM Lx86&quot;. It seems to have achieved similar performance to Rosetta 2, but was discontinued in the early 2010s.<p>The wikipedia page for QuickTransit has, since at least 2015, had a <i>totally unsubstantiated</i> claim that &quot;most&quot; of the original QuickTransit team now works for Apple (and ARM)[0]. Makes me wonder.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=QuickTransit&amp;oldid=664532833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=QuickTransit&amp;oldi...</a>')
