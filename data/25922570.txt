Man, if I had a nickel for each time this has happened:<p>I’m discussing a refactor with a DRY engineer, and they say something like “So what do <i>you</i> suggest? Just replacing that name in - every - single - place - it’s used? That would be error prone and time consuming.” Then I run a find&#x2F;replace, the unit tests run, the green light flashes, heads explode.<p>Again: DRY vs DAMP is often a very good thing to be debating, but in my personal experience the DRY advocates have gotten way too dogmatic.')
