Where I live the growth is so absurd fast, possibly the second fastest among major US cities, that we can&#x27;t get the city improve the highways between housing neighborhoods and freeways or keep up with other basic services.  Everything is a struggle for the city to keep up with the growth.  In this rarest of cases municipal broadband would probably be a nightmare.  Fortunately I have 1gb up and down to the house from my local ISP at $70 per month.')
