If you get 501 validations back, then you have a block.<p>The attack I always thought about but never got an answer to was: what if you pay for the lottery winners to collude? Certainly if you offer some amount of money for the block producers only on the condition that you get 501+the block creator in a given block you could probably sign a bad block, right? It’s unclear what the consequences of that would be if the block’s signatures still have to be valid but you could maybe craft something bad.<p>I don’t know, all of this thinking is from when I first talked to Silvio at IACR so it’s been a long time. It’s possible all of my knowledge is way out of date or wrong.<p>Anyways, I wish them luck, they’ve certainly got a big thing going.')
