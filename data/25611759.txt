They originally made an equivalence claim between Japan and China and I wanted to add information explaining that this stat doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean what it&#x27;s often at first glance interpreted to mean. The parent then replied to my comment with a reply that suggests their edit was in fact malicious. But I can&#x27;t be sure of that.')
