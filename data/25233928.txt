Yes, it worked well for me, but I can&#x27;t help but think the real intention of the visas is just to bring &quot;extraordinary people&quot; to the US. Saying that, I have no idea how to devise a fairer criteria to judge that (because I&#x27;m not that extraordinary, obviously). In my mind, I&#x27;m thinking of some people I know who are definitely a lot smarter than me but just don&#x27;t have a PhD and publications. Some of the best people I know don&#x27;t even have degrees. How can an immigration official with little knowledge of the area of expertise differentiate those people and bring them here?')
