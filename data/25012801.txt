Because Ballmer was there from basically the start (employee #30).  He held positions of leadership all over the company and quite frankly knew it inside and out.  Agree or disagree with how he ran the ship he knew the ship and it was his life.<p>The current Intel CEO has been there for 4 years as a CFO prior to taking over as CEO.  We know he can spell Intel... we know he isn&#x27;t even a little bit technical (his degrees are business administration and MBA and just about all of his previous positions of note are as CFO).  So basically he&#x27;s going to run the company like a beancounter... which always works out well at companies that need heavy R&amp;D to stay competitive.')
