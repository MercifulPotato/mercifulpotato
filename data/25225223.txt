(Example from one of the links in this thread, which had an example of a repetition flash card app, saying that UDP is connectionless.  I don&#x27;t know what good purpose would be served by having that info on a flash card for interview prep, other than to help someone who knows absolutely nothing about it to bluff their way through an interview that asks about it.)')
