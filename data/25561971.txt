Item(by='maxsilver', descendants=None, kids=[25567061], score=None, time=1609181604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559736, text='&gt; The sudden COVID-related rent price drop indicates that this theory is nonsense, and that the high rents are solely a function of supply and demand,<p>Except your own example demonstrates that it&#x27;s not. If it was &quot;solely supply and demand&quot;, then rents should drop far more dramatically than they have, down to levels comparable to other cities that used to be equally unpopular. Yet there&#x27;s a <i>literal pandemic</i> and even though demand for San Francisco housing is at a ~20-year low, with newly-empty units everywhere, San Francisco still remains one of the priciest cities in the nation. Short of like, an earthquake wiping SF off the map or similar sized event,  demand for SF housing will never get lower than this, and it&#x27;s still not enough to bring rents remotely back into the real world.<p>Supply and demand have an impact on housing prices, but are definitely not the &quot;sole&quot; source of them. Landlord behaviour, city tax goals, investment banking demands, private equity involvement, and much more all dramatically impact the price of rent far more than &quot;supply v demand&quot; or any &quot;regulation&quot; does.<p>This is hard to understand for folks used to megacity pricing, where &quot;high demand&quot; (i.e., a small-but-consistent influx of new residents) is until recently, an automatic given thing you could just always point to as blame for any problem. For those of us out in the midwest, where demand is regularly <i>falling</i> in many places, where new construction <i>always</i> outpaces population growth every single year, and yet the housing prices <i>still always rise</i>, the disconnect between prices and supply&#x2F;demand is quite a bit more obvious.')
