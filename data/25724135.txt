What&#x27;s disappointing about this is not _that_ they cancelled — most of my friends agree that it&#x27;s the prudent thing to do — but that they waited so long to cancel (for context, classes start tomorrow [0]).<p>Just a few weeks ago, they sent us an email reaffirming their plan to bring us back, yet COVID cases in California have remained relatively flat since then.
