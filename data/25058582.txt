Item(by='zeveb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605104408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055564, text='I think it would be interesting to have <i>three</i> Houses: Senate, with individual senators appointed by the state legislatures; Representatives, with individuals elected by popular vote; and Citizens, selected by sortition.  Legislation could originate in either the Senate or the House of Representatives, but would have to be ratified by the House of Citizens, unless their veto were overridden by super-majorities.  The number of citizens per state would be the sum of the state&#x27;s senators &amp; representatives.<p>This would take the veto away from the President, and give it to a random selection of people.<p>Maybe combine it with an amendment stating that all <i>regulations</i> must be passed by the Congress, or at least be ratified by the House of Citizens â€¦')
