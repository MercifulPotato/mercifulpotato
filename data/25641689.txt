They tried to make icloud end to end encrypted but then didn&#x27;t do it at the behest of the US government. They employ the same tactics as zoom by claiming that icloud <i>is</i> encrypted, trying to make people believe that it&#x27;s end to end encrypted. The encryption key still sits with them though.<p>Yes, there are some high profile cases where they very publicly refused the feds. Got a lot of publicity. That was their main goal, to paint an image of them not turning over user data.<p>Maybe apple indeed collects less user data than Google. But they still collect <i>many</i> things, and it&#x27;s way harder to escape apple&#x27;s collection than to escape Google&#x27;s collection as their OSs are so locked down.')
