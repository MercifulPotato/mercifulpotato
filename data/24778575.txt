Kind of a blast from the past, if you ask me<p>If you like that, you should give The Orville a try. A lot of people dismissed it thinking it was going to be full of crude humor, essentially &quot;Family Guy in Space&quot;, because it was from Seth MacFarlane.<p>But that is not the case at all. What MacFarlane was going for exactly was that naive optimism, although from TOS not TNG. Later science fiction, he has said, has been a lot less optimistic.<p>Yes, The Orville has some comedy--sometimes quite funny, but it almost all fits in with the serious elements. The crew, at least for a long time, is not full of highly competent natural heroes like TOS or TNG, because The Orville is not the flagship of the fleet that everyone wants to be on and only the very best qualify. It is the opposite of that. It&#x27;s a minor ship where you put average or below people who you don&#x27;t expect much from, captained by a man who had problems in his personal life that tanked his career, given The Orville because some friends called in favors to get one more try to turn him around before kicking him out of the service.<p>The first season was a bit hit or miss for the first few episodes, as they figured out the right balance of comedy and drama, but it did not take long to get good. The second season continued on from that. That&#x27;s all there was been so far, with a third season coming.<p>I agree on DS9. My one complaint is that I think they should have went another direction with the ending. It could have ended in a way that served as a launching point for the biggest Star Trek arc yet.<p>Much of the series involved the conflict between the Federation and the Founders from the gamma quadrant, with the Federation being the good guys. The Founders were perhaps not necessarily evil, but they had a strong distrust of others and a belief that the non-shapeshifters would wipe them out if they got a chance.<p>The thing about the Founders is that with their shapeshifting abilities they were pretty much the best spies and infiltrators in the galaxy. We know they infiltrated to the highest levels of Klingon government.<p>I don&#x27;t remember if it was ever confirmed that they made it to high levels in the Federation, too, but you have to assume they did. But then they should be able to figure out that Federation really are the good guys. The Federation really wants peace between every intelligent species. They really should join the Federation rather than fear it.<p>So why didn&#x27;t they?<p>Perhaps it is because they aren&#x27;t the only ones who have infiltrated and placed people high in the Federation government? From TOS and TNG we know that others have tried or succeeded at that before.<p>So maybe the reason the Founders absolutely distrust the Federation is because they <i>know</i> that the people who appear to be in charge and are pushing the peace and unity message are actually not the ones running things. The peace and unity people are just clueless puppets of the real masters.<p>End DS9 with Sisko discovering the truth, the Federation&#x27;s masters discovering that Sisko is on to them, and Sisko going on the run.<p>That sets up at least two more series.<p>The first one could cover Sisko on the run, working in the shadows to build up secret opposition to the Federation&#x27;s evil masters, slowly spreading the word to others he can trust, like Picard on the Enterprise, and convincing Federation enemies like the Cardassians that they are better off with a Federation that really is what is claims to be rather than a Federation secretly run by evil aliens and so should help save the Federation.<p>The second series, &quot;Star Trek: Civil War&quot;, could cover when matters get to a head, and open hostilities break out withing The Federation.<p>You could still have Voyager in there...have the civil war start while Voyager is lost. They can come back into the middle of it.<p>There&#x27;s probably even plenty for a third series after Civil War.')
