C++ has - against the odds, in my opinion - been dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. It is not exactly design by committee, because there are a lot of (semi)independent developers driving the design choices. The choice of features for a given release is by committee, however, and reflects a wide variety of opinions and interests. Not the least of which are the people actually providing compiler support.
