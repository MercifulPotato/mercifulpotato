Item(by='GVIrish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608229865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25456718, text='&gt; I&#x27;m curious: why is ignoring too much relevant research not a good reason to demand retraction? Isn&#x27;t this one of the most common embarrassing mistakes that inexperienced researchers tend to make? I can fully understand if Google does not want to associate itself with work that might be viewed by the wider research community as shoddy.<p>For starters if the academic content of the paper were shoddy, that is what peer review is for.  Secondly, if it was really about the paper lacking some new context, why did Google demand retraction while refusing to share why?  That&#x27;s what doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>It seems like there&#x27;s some missing context in the situation because on the surface Google&#x27;s actions don&#x27;t line up with their stated reasoning.<p>Notice how in Jeff Dean&#x27;s email he made no reference to the fact that they refused to share the reasons for the retraction with Gebru in that first meeting.  He also skipped over where Gebru asked for the reasoning and a manager read it to her rather than letting her read for herself.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand the secrecy and cageyness if the only problem with the paper was some academic omissions.')
