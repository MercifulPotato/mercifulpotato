Then, upon deciding that Bitcoin is worth the risk, one must tolerate derision and scoffing from their peers year after year. Many people in one&#x27;s life will loudly express their desire for you to fail. It is very alienating. One must often create a completely new life for themselves. This is why revolutionary change is so difficult. The resistance to change is so massive that people will openly hate those who push for it.<p>That you view it as gambling and low-effort makes it clear you haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time understanding Bitcoin&#x27;s value proposition. That&#x27;s fine, but just know that there are a lot of people who have spent years of their lives researching and working on this technology. It is not gambling to them.')
