But about 30 years ago I noticed their messaging changing: less about racial civil rights and a move toward sexual civil rights. I met someone who worked with their local offices and in conversations it became apparent that ACLU was undergoing a shift in management style: persons from the gay community were moving into local and national positions in their organization.<p>Fast forward to 20 years later ACLU was (also) now concerned about bullying in schools. I had seen <i>one</i> bullying incident in my <i>entire life</i>, despite exposure to all types of people. Seeing  their fallback from black civil rights, the advancement of LGBT causes to the forefront, and the support of such causes as &quot;bullying&quot;, I surmised that ACLU had &quot;gone off the rails&quot;. It was no longer the organization I once admired. I ceased my contributions.')
