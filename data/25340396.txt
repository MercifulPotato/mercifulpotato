While they do rotate, ISPs do this with law enforcement a fair amount and I&#x27;m pretty sure they keep track of who owns which IP at any given moment.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s assuming nothing proxying that connection at all.<p>A clever knowledgeable person would proxy, most people wouldn&#x27;t know how. This is why I said it would be a foolish hacker. It&#x27;s also possible someone else tapped into her wifi and did it. Or maybe there was no IP.<p>I&#x27;m just suggesting what is the most obvious piece of evidence which a judge would accept to grant a warrant here.')
