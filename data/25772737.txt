A lot of the effort is now focused on very efficient experiment comparison capabilities - talking about 1000s of them. Lots of challenges on the UI and the backend. When loading TB or any other tool really with lots of experiments it&#x27;s super slow and becomes useless.\nAlso no way to do effective comparison of runs by hyperparams or other metadata on the tensorboard or MLFlow. Quite basic capabilities.')
