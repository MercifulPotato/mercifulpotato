I think the more closely our tools adhere to that model, the better off we will fare in the long run.<p>&gt; So maybe we need to ask fundamental questions about the compilation model and examine some beliefs we hold (For example “Compilers and build system need to be kept separated”. Do they? To what extent?).<p>I think you just put your finger on why Google is a monorepo - Blaze&#x2F;Bazel kinda suck horribly (they feel super dated and could have been made much friendlier if they&#x27;d been designed from the ground up knowing what the pain points are, and <i>esp</i> if they weren&#x27;t basically an ad-hoc set of new languages&#x2F;syntaxes), but they&#x27;re also awesome. The huge benefit is that you can make tools that work across <i>everything</i> and track monstrous dependency graphs.')
