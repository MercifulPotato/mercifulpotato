Back then, there were fewer distractions to soak up the free time of young tech enthusiasts. Old IRC chatrooms feel like a trickle of distraction relative to the firehose of Twitter, Reddit, 24&#x2F;7 news cycles, and modern distractions.<p>A common complaint among the younger engineers I mentor is that they feel like they never have enough time. It&#x27;s strange to watch a young, single person without kids and with a cushy 9-5 (or often 11am to 5pm at modern flex&#x2F;remote companies) job complain about lack of free time. Digging deeper, it&#x27;s usually because they&#x27;re so tapped in to social media, news, video games, and other digital distractions that their free time evaporates before they even think about planning their days out.<p>It&#x27;s amazing what one can accomplish by simply sitting down and focusing on a problem. You may not reach the levels of someone like Alyssa, but you&#x27;ll get much farther than you might expect. And most importantly, you probably won&#x27;t miss the media firehose.')
