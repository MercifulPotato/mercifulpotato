My interests are science, history, computing, polictics<p>Well I don&#x27;t know what to say apart from that absolutely astounds me. They&#x27;re the background noise of many British homes and you&#x27;re severely missing out if these are your interests.<p>For example, In Our Time alone is <i>900</i> 45-minute episodes each about an individual topic of science, history, maths, politics, art, culture, religion, etc, sometimes even computing, with genuine experts coming to discuss and debate it starting with a basic introduction anyone can follow and then going into the details.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_In_Our_Time_programmes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_In_Our_Time_programmes</a><p>I think literally nobody else in the world produces this kind of super-high-quality and enduring intelligent spoken-word content. Even the NPR in the US is very poor in comparison.<p>And have you really never heard of the Today Programme or are you exaggerating for effect? It really sets the national daily political agenda in the UK like nothing else. I can&#x27;t practically understand how you can follow politics and never had heard anyone say &#x27;they said on the Today Programme...&#x27;<p>&gt; I felt it wasn&#x27;t worth paying Â£120 to the BBC every year<p>...but you don&#x27;t have to, for radio.')
