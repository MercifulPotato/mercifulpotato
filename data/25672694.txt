Many Antifa and BLM-aligned groups have spent much of the last year rioting, looting and committing arson. Throughout, they have been protected and excused by the mainstream US media and the intellectual Left, and the relatively small number of individuals that have been arrested during these events have mostly been released immediately - often to commit further violent crimes the same day.<p>I find that hard to square with your assertion that the protesters yesterday received preferential treatment due to their race and political leanings. As far as I can tell, the only difference in yesterday&#x27;s events was that the Trump supporters didn&#x27;t feel the need to burn the Capitol down.')
