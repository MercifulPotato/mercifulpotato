If I lived in SF during the first lock downs, upgrading to a unit with a full kitchen would be very high on my housing priority list.<p>When we moved out of Santa Monica, our craptastic unit was re-rented inside the 30 day window and occupied two days after we left. Why? Because it had a tiny sliver of outdoor space, which suddenly mattered a lot. I imagine that all of the tiny condos in the area are staying on the market longer because the idea of WFH from less than 500sq ft. sounds awful to pretty much everyone now.')
