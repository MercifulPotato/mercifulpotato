Similarly, there are a lot of very rude things you can say to people, but none of it should be illegal, and frankly I don&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s a website somewhere that people say nasty things. So long as none of it gets out of hand.<p>While the top commenters bit about Thai, local law and &#x27;face saving&#x27; is fine, it&#x27;s also obviously unjust. Justice takes many forms but there is some degree of universality to it.')
