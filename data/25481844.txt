They didn&#x27;t explicitly say it was enough, but since that was their main criticism of how London is responding, it read like that.<p>Here&#x27;s what Biden said:<p>&gt; The first day I&#x27;m inaugurated to say I&#x27;m going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days.<p>Again, he didn&#x27;t <i>say</i> that wearing a mask is enough, but with the 100-day timeline, reading between the lines, he&#x27;s saying it will drive down the case count.')
