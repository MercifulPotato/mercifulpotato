Item(by='dagmx', descendants=None, kids=[25202093], score=None, time=1606243436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201193, text='&gt; I haven&#x27;t worked long enough with C or C++ to complain about them (only about a decade or so), but I don&#x27;t have any issues with those languages<p>This may be part of the reason. Rust improves on those languages in many ways including better safety, package and build setups as well as doc setups. It&#x27;s genuinely a breath of fresh air setting up and maintaining rust projects versus C++ or even Python.<p>&gt; I find it wholly unappealing to abandon the existing corpus of literal decades of knowledge having been poured into those language ecosystems<p>Rust builds on these ecosystems. It uses LLVM as its backend compiler, much like clang does for C++.<p>Additionally it has great support for CFFI so it can integrate very well into existing codebases with other languages.<p>&gt; I just have too much experience in the industry to throw away my time and play with toys.<p>I read this as prejudice. Rust isn&#x27;t a toy as can be seen by the large number of companies and projects that are putting significant efforts into it.<p>Conversely, perhaps having entrenched experience in the industry means you&#x27;re predisposed to approaching new paradigms in the field with higher cynicism than may be warranted?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s ugly as sin, and I know I&#x27;m not alone in that opinion.<p>I think that&#x27;s very much subjective. I do know many programmers who find it ugly, but many like myself who find it write clean to read.<p>Certainly I find it significantly easier to grok than C++ or Objective C for example. It&#x27;s possible to write very elegant rust code that can verge on being Pythonic in nature. It&#x27;s also possible to write very ugly code too.<p>&gt; there was literally no one using Servo, the site didn&#x27;t tell you how to actually use it<p>Servo is a research project from which portions have been taken and integrated into Firefox. That means a lot of people are using servo whether directly or indirectly.')
