In a simplified case, imagine that the company had simply stuffed all of its profits in a mattress. A buyer will have to offer stockholders at least as much money as is in that mattress.<p>The price of that stock is never going to be as simple to calculate as the price of the mattress, because of uncertainties in future revenue. In theory a company consisting just of a mattress would have a true fixed price that never changes, but there isn&#x27;t any such company.<p>The closest you get is a &quot;blue chip&quot; stock, very large and very consistent in its revenue, often in manufacturing (because there&#x27;s less innovation and high barrier to entry). Their prices indeed don&#x27;t change much.')
