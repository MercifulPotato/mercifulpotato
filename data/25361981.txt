Item(by='cmehdy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607538606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361819, text='I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it works well though..<p>The FN (yeah yeah they changed names, who cares) still spews its hatred behind closed doors, our police forces are amongst the worst offenders of any developed countries when it comes to racism and systemic issues (and consistently proving that even the police unions are a bunch of thugs), we have people like Zemmour on TV spewing hateful nonsense that even Fox News would probably frown at by now, and our own current government has been trying to get a law in place to prevent freedom of press so significantly that the UN and most of the world looking at those pieces of news have actually been ringing the alarms in every possible way.<p>While on a personal and biased level I certainly don&#x27;t mind that daddy Le Pen was fined multiple times throughout the years for calling the Holocaust &quot;a detail of history&quot;, we don&#x27;t really have any proof that it does anything more than make people who dislike him (like me) happy to see him fined, and unfortunately give reasons for supporters of his bullshit to feel vindicated (i.e. rise of the extreme right everywhere with a very salient point regarding being &quot;silenced&quot;, which crystallizes to the extreme in stuff coming from the US like Qanon).<p>Youtube is having a tough time because they&#x27;re almost always pointed at first and foremost for being THE rabbit hole of misinformation&#x2F;radicalization and other things, but they&#x27;re stepping into a minefield by touching on one such hot subject without having a broader policy (extending beyond whatever the current US issue is at any moment), backed by an army of lawyers.<p>(I&#x27;ve stopped following the battles of up and downvotes on this message instead of any actual reply.. I&#x27;m only left to wonder how many of either are emotional responses over valuing the argument itself, and on this subject even HN isn&#x27;t proving to be very different from reddit today)')
