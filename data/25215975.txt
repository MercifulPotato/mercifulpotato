I haven&#x27;t found a satisfactory solution so I&#x27;ve been building one, but I keep feeling like I&#x27;m wasting my time and that there must be something else available. In any case I am planning on releasing it as a desktop app and mobile (Android, iOS) at some point. Right now I just use Syncthing to sync across devices - you just point the app to a directory of Markdown files.')
