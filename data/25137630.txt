I&#x27;ve done some simple volunteer dev work for Z3 (just creating a nuget package &amp; improving their build&#x2F;release pipeline mostly) but my impression is there is a ton of work that could be done if one were to really sink their teeth into the codebase. Really tricky, interesting, applied-theory type work too.<p>I&#x27;m biased but if I had any purse string authority at Microsoft, RiSE&#x27;s budget would be a multiple of what it currently is.')
