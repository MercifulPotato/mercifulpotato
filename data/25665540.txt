There&#x27;s been some reporting that large numbers of people have caught it in hospital (and indeed I have a personal interest here as a close relative of mine caught it in hospital just before Christmas, though a very minor case and now fully recovered).<p>It makes sense to try to stop spread in hospitals but unless I&#x27;ve missed something there seems to have been very limited work done on if any of the protocols as actually implemented (ie not just in a theoretical world where they were designed) - and especially the costlier ones in terms of bed space - have worked, or at least worked enough to offset their cost in health terms.<p>Does anyone know if there&#x27;s any data on this?')
