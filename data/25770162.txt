SQL databases are a storage and query system. They&#x27;re intended to be slow, but efficient, like a bodybuilder. You don&#x27;t ask a bodybuilder to run the 500m dash.<p>Second, they had a 150MB dataset, and they moved to... a distributed decentralized key-value store? They went from the simplest thing imaginable to the most complicated thing imaginable. I guess SQL is just complex in a direct way, and etcd is complex in an indirect way. But the end results of both are drastically different. And doesn&#x27;t etcd have a whole lot of functional limitations SQL databases don&#x27;t? Not to mention its dependence on gRPC makes it a PITA to work with REST APIs. Consul has a much better general-purpose design, imo.<p>And more of it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Is this a backend component? Client side, server side? Why was it using JSON if resources mattered (you coulda saved like 20% of that 150MB with something less bloated). Why a single process? Why global locks? Like, I really don&#x27;t understand the implementation at all. It seems like they threw away a common-sense solution to make a weird toy.')
