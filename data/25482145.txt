You can&#x27;t go very far without encountering a road. This makes it fairly hostile to be a pedestrian since you&#x27;re relegated to walking on sidewalks (or in front of traffic if you&#x27;re daring).<p>A city built around pedestrians could have a much different environment, like open green spaces, cobblestone paths, proactive NPCs engaging in little dialogues with shopkeepers, people trying to sell you stuff on the streets, etc. A real &quot;night out on the city&quot; vibe that I don&#x27;t think any city-style game has tried going for yet.')
