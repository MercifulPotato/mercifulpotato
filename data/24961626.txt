It happens to have a front facing charging port. The mouse worked well and I recommended it to colleagues. On occasions when the battery died, I left a USB cable plugged in and assumed I was using the mouse by USB. At some point I realized it was for charging only after wasting time on “i don’t understand, even after I turn off Bluetooth, the USB interface doesn’t work.” A few times since then I’ve helped colleagues troubleshoot by informing them that there is no USB data interface and they should be checking Bluetooth and not swapping out cables.<p>In both cases (Apple and Logitech), a “charge only” label would have been nice.')
