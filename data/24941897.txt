Lots of developers scratch itches they can&#x27;t scratch at their day job that way; new tech, greenfield ideas instead of maintaining someone else&#x27;s garbage, etc.<p>And sometimes those devs go into business for themselves and realize that they don&#x27;t get to spend all their time building product -- now they&#x27;ve got to build the marketing page and write a bunch of copy and take a ton of screenshots (of features they know they&#x27;re going to change), and figure out how sales funnels work, and all the other things that go into running a business.<p>Building and running your own company is the fastest way to get <i>out</i> of pure product development I&#x27;ve ever seen.')
