It would be nice if I could add more than three authors because my reading is already extremely diverse, like music listening there is very little that I dislike (According to spotify, I listened to over 500 genres of music this year -- although I&#x27;m not really sure how useful that is because of how every piece of music seems to be categorized into it&#x27;s own genre).<p>For example, I put in:<p><pre><code>    Mort - Terry Pratchett\n    Mortal Engines - Stanis≈Çaw Lem\n    My Lesbian Experience With\n       Loneliness - Kabi Nagata\n</code></pre>\nAnd Judith Butler was in the search results. So instead I realised that Mort and Mortal Engines are adjacent, genre-wise and tried:<p><pre><code>    Mort - Terry Pratchett\n    My Lesbian Experience With\n       Loneliness - Kabi Nagata\n    Gender Trouble - Judith Butler\n</code></pre>\nand in the search results I got:<p><pre><code>    The Far Side comics\n    &quot;This Book Is Full of Spiders&quot;\n    Douglas Adams\n    Kurt Vonnegut\n    Brian Lee O&#x27;Mally\n    Calvin and Hobbes\n</code></pre>\nAll of these works I have enjoyed quite a lot -- I used to be able to quote the radio show of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy from memory, I own all of the John Dies at the End series, and I&#x27;m wondering about getting the special edition of Calvin and Hobbes because there&#x27;s quite a lot I haven&#x27;t seen and it&#x27;s pretty timeless.<p>The rest, mostly consisting of PG Wodehouse and Oscar Wilde, are works that I consider myself interested in yet unexposed to, but they are hardly opposites of the books I put in?<p>So I&#x27;m not really convinced of the utility of this tool as it stands.<p>Perhaps it is tailored to a single type of reader that only reads books within their purview (Perhaps, political history books, or purely science fiction books) to the exclusion of many other interesting and worthwhile genres?<p>----------------------------<p><i></i>Edit<i></i> : What is especially interesting about this is that when I enter only<p><pre><code>    My Lesbian Experience With\n       Loneliness - Kabi Nagata\n    Gender Trouble - Judith Butler\n</code></pre>\nI get a book by Sappho(!) and a literal deluge of mostly-feminist literature with only a handful of anti-feminist works -- with the touchpoint that those anti-feminist works are trying to sound and look feminist!<p>I&#x27;m not sure how Sappho is directly in opposition to Nagata&#x27;s work, and it strikes me that anyone who has read both Nagata and Butler would also be familiar with the works of Sappho?')
