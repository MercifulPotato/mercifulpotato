Item(by='mattip', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1603868456, title="What's up with travis ci open source builds", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I am very appreciative of all the CI providers do to support open source projects. They make massive resources available at no cost. Without travis, circleci, azure pipelines, appveyor, github actions, and many other smaller services, open source could not afford to test and build.<p>With that, over the past week we have seen a massive backlog of linux jobs on travis. Here is the status page https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traviscistatus.com&#x2F;#month. In the past, travis added resources when the backlog grew, but now it seems capped at 555. Does anyone know if this is a temporary glitch or if it is permanent? The support forum threads have hints this may be connected to the move from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com, (like the comment in this thread https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis-ci.community&#x2F;t&#x2F;builds-hang-in-queued-state&#x2F;10250&#x2F;9) but does that mean the status page is only for travis-ci.org?')
