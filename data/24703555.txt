And an obvious part of population control is shooting the hinds...<p>...which makes me somewhat unpopular with other recreational hunters. Although trophy hunters, at least, realise that lower populations lead to better antlers due to better nutrition for an individual animal.<p>[1]: Not a real beech - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nothofagus_solandri_var._cliffortioides" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nothofagus_solandri_var._cliff...</a>')
