It is in the best interest of individual corporations to hire the best candidate. It is in the best interest of the industry to create a strong pool of candidates. An industry consists of individual corporations that act self-interested unless they cooperate to achieve long term goals together.<p>This dovetails with the free rider problem too. A corporation does not want to train (invest in) a subpar individual and then lose them to a free rider corporation in the industry that only hires the best candidates.')
