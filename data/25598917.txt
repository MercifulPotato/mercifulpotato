It&#x27;s also floating verically by a pixel. I&#x27;m sure there are other effects I haven&#x27;t noticed immediately. This is exactly what I&#x27;m talking about on how it&#x27;s not just free, there is work to making it work exactly the way the developer wanted it for the project.<p>Maybe you think a button shouldn&#x27;t look like that. Maybe you think a button should prioritize &lt;list of things&gt; before style. Maybe you just like to do something your own way. That&#x27;s great, go ahead on your own project or hire this person for it. None of that has anything to do with why this person built this tool the way they wanted or makes it any easier for them to do so while adding better accessibility.')
