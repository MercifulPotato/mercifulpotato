That is, I suspect that many sport stars will at some moment of their life meet a &quot;financial advisor&quot; with references from fellow sport stars, who offers to take care of their finance, and they go &quot;lucky me, now I can focus 100% on my training&quot;, only to find out later that the money is gone.<p>To get rich, you need two different skills -- one to make money, and one to keep it -- and they both compete for your time. If you only focus on being good at what you do professionally, you may see lot of money flowing through your hands, but the part that you don&#x27;t spend will somehow disappear anyway.<p>&gt; Most people who get rich get that way by saving money. That means living on less money than you can make. Indefinitely.<p>That&#x27;s true, but it is much easier to save money if you already started with a large amount. With enough starting money, it simply means not spending more than the interest you get (after adjusting for inflation).')
