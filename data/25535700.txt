I&#x27;m not sure when it appeared on Windows, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t a Windows first DAW. The Apple versions of Logic were never &quot;very much inferior&quot; to the Windows versions. In fact, it was the other way around.<p>&gt; Indeed, the whole point of Apple buying Logic (and discontinuing the Windows releases) was that they needed a DAW on MacOS to get audio professionals to consider the OS.<p>The fact of the matter is, practically all &quot;audio professionals&quot; of the time period of which you refer, used Apple computers - either for MIDI sequencing, or Digital Audio Workstations. Windows computers weren&#x27;t even a serious consideration. Those who didn&#x27;t, still used Ataris, or hardware sequencers&#x2F;recorders.<p>Pro Tools, originally by Digidesign, was Mac only for years also.')
