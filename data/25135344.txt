OOH, these things do really need time to work. OOH, the zero-emissions date is 2050, post-singularity<p>Second is coordination. If the plan is &quot;<i>Once there are electric cars, we&#x27;ll buy some.</i>&quot; The industry&#x27;s response will be &quot;<i>once it&#x27;s cheap enough, we&#x27;ll make some.</i>&quot; That days seems to be coming anyway, but that really makes this a weak policy.<p>My third thought is &quot;industrial policy.&quot; That is, a policy that actually affects the availability and price performance of electric cars. If the policy is agreed, but doesn&#x27;t meaningfully change what engineers are doing now, then it&#x27;s not really affecting much.<p>An actual industrial policy probably needs to act across a bigger market than UK only in order to actually affect timelines.<p>All that said, I like it. A ban bootstrapped by cross subsidies is a far better way to go than carbon consumption taxes.')
