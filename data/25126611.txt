However, we don&#x27;t fully understand the long term physical and mental health implications of having it (both neurological and psychological), we don&#x27;t understand it from a &#x27;pre-existing condition&#x27; standpoint, and hey who knows it could hit me like a train and do me serious harm or kill me. Plus, I would like to further the goal of eliminating the virus entirely, and not spreading it to others helps that.<p>I can&#x27;t believe there are still people out there clamoring to the idea that there is any other way.')
