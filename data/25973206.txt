So a few people are breaking laws, you disconnect the internet? That&#x27;s not two sides, that&#x27;s only one side. If someone in my neighborhood is a criminal, they don&#x27;t cut the power to my neighborhood and throw flair bombs at it. How is that the &quot;other side&quot;? Instead they just go after that criminal. To me it looks like a massive imbalance in power from one side over the other.')
