Why to send from place to place a radio signal when we could set up a bunch of planets in an improbable&#x2F;impossible regular configuration to be noticed from everywhere during a very long time frame?<p>Intuitively, for signalling purposes, setting up six planets in a weird orbital configuration to attract attention seems like it would take WAY more energy to do.
