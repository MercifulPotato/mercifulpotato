This kind of legislature is pointless. Either fix everything at once, or don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s zero point in making small incremental changes that do not benefit everyone, and still allow a proportion of thugs to get away with it. It is obviously a political stunt by a government desperate to score some &#x27;wins&#x27; on its way out.')
