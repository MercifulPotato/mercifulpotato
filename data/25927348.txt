Some people really view it as a day trip. Especially the showroom part. I always skip that entirely :P<p>I know, I don&#x27;t know how someone can love it either.. I hate the way they have these predefined paths so you can&#x27;t quickly get what you need. And if you try to use the shortcut they make it as difficult as possible.<p>Usually I pick everything online and find out the storage locations, and just walk in through the checkouts to get what I need straight from the warehouse. Only issue is that some of the smaller knicknacks are only on the shop floor :(')
