Yes, the type system is rather complicated, but one can progressively use the advanced type, starting with typing numbers, strings, interfaces etc.<p>Having worked with Clojure for 4 years, and a  JS (ES6 and +) codebase, static typing is amazing.<p>There are far fewer bugs at runtime because of incorrectly setting or forgetting to set keys in a map or a property or accidentally passing the wrong value to the property. Yes, interop with JS is a little  messy, because of the dynamic nature of JS, but a large class of errors can be significantly reduced by Typescript.<p>As for the argument , unit tests can catch most of the problems Typescript solves, my counter is that<p>It reduces the amount of tests you need, to check getter&#x2F;setters,types etc  SIGNIFICANTLY. You can focus your unit tests on the more functional aspects than having to worry about basic property access.<p>All high-level languages have a learning curve. I don&#x27;t expect to pick up the nuances and all the little bits of Typescript in a matter of weeks or months.It might even take years, but I think Typescript and its experimentation with providing a well typed Frontend interface is amazing !')
