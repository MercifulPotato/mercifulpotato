Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608061905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25422701, text='In hindsight, it probably would have been better to define standard prefixes, let people just sort of register their own for non-standard ones in whatever manner is suitable for their particular top-level document type, and if somebody, somewhere out there did finally manage to stomp on each other, let that particular type of document where that happened deal with it.<p>While technically suboptimal compared to what currently exists, it would match people&#x27;s expectations better, and in practice, I can&#x27;t speak for everybody, but I just don&#x27;t see a whole lot of documents with hundreds+ namespaces such that collisions are a realistic possibility. And when I do see documents with a lot of namespaces (XMPP, for instance, or XHTML+SVG+some other thing), there&#x27;s still a top-level type that could keep its own registry just fine. A bit of guidance on naming extensions probably (&quot;don&#x27;t call it e:, work your name in somehow like with the initial of your company or something&quot;) would have 99.9% solved the problem.<p>Prior to seeing what happened I&#x27;d probably still have argued for the current namespaces spec. In principle it doesn&#x27;t seem that complicated to me. But I&#x27;m obviously wrong in practice, because, like I said, I can hardly cite an example of them being used correctly at all.<p>(Likewise, in hindsight, entities shouldn&#x27;t have been able to be recursive, and if we were spec&#x27;ing out the next generation of XML I&#x27;d straght-up remove them except for the ones necessary to XML itself, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;amp; because UTF covers the major use case of entities now. I&#x27;d discard the &quot;terrible, terrible templating language&quot; use case entirely.)')
