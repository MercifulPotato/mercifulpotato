The reason that I&#x27;ve become so good at my craft is by giving a shit. The reason that my projects always succeed is because I give a shit. Not giving a shit puts a ceiling on your career as a developer. Not giving a shit will prevent you from learning. The irony in my situation is that I am investing in myself by doing the work, I am learning and improving myself while others stagnate. I try to remind myself of that.<p>&gt; And IMHO, this sounds a lot like sour grapes. To be rewarded for good work your management needs to know you&#x27;re doing good work. For them to know you&#x27;re doing good work you need to tell them. This is just a basic fact of life. And it&#x27;s not super hard. You just need to maintain a relationship with your boss and ideally your boss&#x27;s boss.<p>Sour grapes? Only one or two sentences complained about recognition. I&#x27;m talking generally about the majority of developers at big orgs. Deal with management? I work in a global org that already has plenty of communication issues, people don&#x27;t want to be bothered. Moreover I don&#x27;t want to deal with politics as I am a long-term contractor. I try to remind myself that I just need to bill my hours and forget about it, but I&#x27;m essentially treated as an employee and my insane efforts carry a team of 8 people (including other contractors) that literally do nothing while reaping the pay and recognition. They run mouse movers all day and enjoy their paid staycations. &quot;Spend the budget&quot; -- since I provide 10x the value then give me 10x the pay, the other guys are doing nothing while it&#x27;s expected that I work my ass off. A manager that I befriended once told me &quot;yeah that&#x27;s usually how it goes, team of 8 but one or two guys do all the work. typical&quot; How is this acceptable? If I give up like the others then I am no better, I become the person I despise and I contribute to the horrible culture that has taken over the industry in big orgs.')
