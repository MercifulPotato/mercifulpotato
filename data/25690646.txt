The law simply can&#x27;t handle what the internet and social media have become.<p>When a platform is curating and recommending content to users, it should be treated more like a publisher and be held responsible for the content it promotes. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the curation is done by hand or with algorithms.<p>Providers that simply allow the hosting and basic browsing of content should be protected as long as they are willing to remove illegal content when it is found.<p>Also, I wouldn&#x27;t call it censorship at all. If a newspaper publishes an article they claim some responsibility for its content. The same should apply if Facebook highlights an article or YouTube recommends a video.')
