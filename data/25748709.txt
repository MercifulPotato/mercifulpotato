With the tariffs China has slapped on American (93%) and Australian (200% !) wine Europeans have what is now the largest international market (and growing) all to themselves.<p>In fact the US have tried to prop up (and placate) their wine producers since that because the Chinese market completely dried up for them. So I see these tariffs on European wine as killing two birds with one stone for the US government but not necessarily hitting European producers that hard (as said, at this point Chinese will buy as much wine as Europeans are able to sell them...)')
