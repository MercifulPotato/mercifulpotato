This is of course a headache for me, when I started I just worked on the concept that I thought would be fun to have for online entertainment. Obviously as a single person I can&#x27;t moderate everything so even if I would like to do strong centralized moderation it&#x27;s not really possible. Also I believe in free speech and that&#x27;s by definition means allowing people to express their opinion even if you don&#x27;t like it.\nModeration will be achieved by the owners and moderators of each channel. You can also hide posts or all posts by a particular user  yourself. I also do have some tools to ban IP and users from the whole site or delete all of their posts in case of spam or posting illegal content. I hope that will be enough. Right now it&#x27;s not really a worry because there are no users so I will focus on that :)')
