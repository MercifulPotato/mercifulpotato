Item(by='hunter2_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609225938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564992, text='&gt; If someone counts me down, I expect them to say &quot;5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO&quot;, and I expect a timer to do the exact same thing.<p>&quot;Exact same thing&quot; isn&#x27;t really possible here because the timer needs to show each integer for a duration of 1 second, while the spoken words each have a duration of much less than 1 second. So much less that they&#x27;re really identifying a moment (perhaps the initial consonant, or the peak amplitude) rather than a window of time. This is why &quot;go&quot; is able to be intuitively anticipated accurately.<p>If the timer app flashed each number briefly, with no display for the vast majority of each second, then it could do the &quot;exact same thing&quot; as spoken English. Considering the transition from displaying one number to displaying the next as analogous to a spoken word is about as good as we&#x27;ll get, in which case &quot;1&quot; ought to be displayed for one second immediately prior to &quot;go&quot; (don&#x27;t display &quot;0&quot; for the last second and certainly not for a half second).')
