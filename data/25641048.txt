Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25641727], score=None, time=1609811370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640797, text='&gt;<i>I would enjoy macOS if it subscribed to open source ideals, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be Apple right</i><p>Yes, and what&#x27;s more troubling, I think it also wouldn&#x27;t be macOS.<p>macOS can be more open, but it can&#x27;t &quot;subscribe to open source ideals&quot; (and even less so the &quot;bazaar model&quot;) without stopping being macOS.<p>It offers something else, and some of it could be replicated in FOSS (e.g. Gnome has copied tons of those, as have certain distros), but part of it stems from it being walled, and curated.<p>And it&#x27;s not cut and dry which parts are the latter ones.<p>E.g. I think that &quot;deprecating things&quot; the way Apple does and no FOSS would dare do (due to inertia and community-driven nature) makes macOS able to adopt new stuff faster, and adopt it more wholly (e.g. with no leftover apps with 10 layers of old GUIs like in Windows).<p>Similarly the &quot;my way or the highway&quot; from Apple helps keep the platform focused (as opposed to all the FOSS hoopla, X vs Wayland, KDE vs Gnome vs XFCE etc, systemd vs init, and tons of other minituae and duplication of effort). We&#x27;d still be discussing Metal in FOSS land (well, we have 10 years of moving from X to Wayland and it&#x27;s still going on). In macOS it&#x27;s a done deal.<p>(That&#x27;s irrelevant of whether that new stuff is better or worse, btw. It can be either - but it can be either faster, and more uniformly. That&#x27;s a quality FOSS lacks, and which I appreciate over customizability).')
