My theory is that given any long-enough amount of time, a small group of actors will amass hugely disproportional wealth, and then start gaming&#x2F;breaking the system for everyone else, as seems to be human nature.)</i><p>It gets really tiring (especially in modern tech culture) to say &quot;I&#x27;m a capitalist&quot; and then have people dogpile on you, asking why you want to pillage the environment and steal all the wealth, etc etc.<p>And then you have to explain, &quot;I want none of that. I just don&#x27;t want anyone telling you how to live your life, and to have as many opportunities as you can create for yourself.&quot;<p>I say all of this as someone who grew up exceedingly poor, in trailer parks eating peanut butter and crackers, with no higher education.<p>There are shitty people everywhere. Because some humans are murderers, does not mean all humans are murderers. Become some people are twisted, unethical capitalists, does not mean all capitalists are twisted and unethical.<p>At some stage of hyper-capitalism, when you hit &quot;oligarch&quot; levels, you&#x27;ve stopped representing capitalistic ideals because you have created a less-free market than when you entered.')
