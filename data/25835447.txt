At each level, you lose the benefits of a central structure - such as coordination, support, management of risk etc.<p>Sure, one can get rid of the EU. But you&#x27;ll notice that most countries actually don&#x27;t want this - especially Euro-critical countries in eastern Europe profit hugely from the EU and would never seriously consider going back to the previous state of things.<p>No, I think the EU is far too decentralized in areas that matter.
