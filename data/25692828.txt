However, those &quot;mostly peaceful&quot; riots this past sumer resulted in billions of dollars in property damage, dozens of deaths, and a massive spike in crime (including violent crime).  Many of these rioters were either bailed out by politicians (including the incoming VP) or simply refused to be prosecuted by local DAs.<p>Now, I have no doubt that there was police brutality against peaceful protesters, which is horrible and inexcusable.  I also think there are many legitimate grievances against the police.  I even understand (though do not condone) the attacks made against police precincts and federal buildings.<p>But the suffering inflicted upon innocent civilians by the rioters is completely monstrous and likewise inexcusable. There is no honest moral framework to justify it.<p>It was also incredibly counterproductive.  With the excesses taken by police on behalf many governors during the lockdowns, this past year has possibly been the best time in decades to introduce bi-partisan police reform. The riots effectively killed that because many people would rather support the police (who are at least nominally there to protect them, even if they frequently stood down to the rioters) than they are to support the people threatening to loot and burn their homes and businesses.<p>&gt; I take issue with the emphasis on &quot;property damage&quot; as property is fairly meaningless when you fear for your live or live paycheck-to-paycheck.<p>That&#x27;s pretty obviously not true.  If you are living paycheck-to-paycheck and your home (apartment, house, whatever) or the place where you work is destroyed you are going to care a great deal.  Even if it is just your car - you might night be able to afford a new car, but without the car you might not be able to get to work and thus lose your job.<p>&gt; America has an unhealthy obsession with &quot;property damage&quot; as if it should be the driver for any sort of discussion on societal issues, when in fact, it should not be.<p>&quot;Property damage&quot; isn&#x27;t some abstract thing. It&#x27;s the destruction of peoples homes and livelihoods.  It is the very means by which we live.  Even if we lived in a perfect socialist utopia with no private property, it should be fairly obvious that the destruction of the communal property that houses and supports the community would be a serious offense.')
