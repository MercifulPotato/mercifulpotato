It&#x27;s never really been tried at this level. If it doesn&#x27;t work, we&#x27;ll try something else later.<p>No, unfairly cancelling the opposition has been tried on an even bigger level. Many, many times. The results are truly catastrophic for all the poor people ho actually live in the country.<p>Seriously, I am old enough to know that you cannot take democracy, or free speech, or equality for granted. And any attempt to unfairly remove any of those rights is a truly slippery slope.<p>---<p>Please understand the following. Ask almost anyone on Team Red and they will tell you:<p>All you need to know about team red vs team blue.<p>1. Team Red is working to stop future riots of that style.<p>2. Team Blue doesn&#x27;t even have a plan, and is fully paralyzed by their decision making framework.<p>---<p>There are a lot of Republicans in the country. Are they really ALL crazy? Are they really ALL evil?<p>I think that stepping back, and trying to understand that there is another point of view, even if it is in error, would do much more for you than you can imagine.<p>BTW, I am not identifying with Red or Blue here - I am upset about dishonest behavior, and I don&#x27;t care if it is from CNN or Fox.')
