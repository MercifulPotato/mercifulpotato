They&#x27;re self sufficient. There is no international pressure that can be brought to bear that will be of consequence. The only thing I see being effective is providing technology to their citizens to fight their way out of it. Provide them ways to communicate and disrupt, providing resources and broadcasting their message and documenting their efforts to the world, so they don&#x27;t die in the dark and their government doesn&#x27;t respond with impunity. Combined with the private wealth creation already happening, I see that as a feasible way forward. Then they can join us in living in a self directed democracy mediated by the dark money of corporations and uber wealthy individuals lol.')
