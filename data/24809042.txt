I can tune things like arena allocators and make string operations insanely fast, things I agree most problems simply don&#x27;t require, but still, its a craft that I feel very proud of conquering, and every day you learn something new.<p>It&#x27;s important to distinguish professional from hobby programming.<p>Challenge for the sake of challenge is certainly interesting&#x2F;fun, but, no employer would pay employees to write programs in Brainfuck just because it&#x27;s challenging, while it&#x27;s ok in hobby programming, because the resources (=time) are virtually infinite. Of course, there&#x27;s a value in an employer allowing a certain amount of extra resources for the employees&#x27; &quot;growth for the sake of growth&quot;.<p>I think the article grossly misses the point of what makes C++ problematic, as it considers a programming language in the context of a single programmer solving a simple problem, while the real-world issues of C++ are in the context of a team and memory management of large programs.')
