Item(by='philh', descendants=None, kids=[25096592], score=None, time=1605394248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094988, text='The new type signature is<p><pre><code>    updatePersonalInformation\n       : PersonalInformationMsg\n      -&gt; Model\n      -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)\n      -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)\n</code></pre>\nI know the point was &quot;this is a bad type signature&quot;, but I guess I&#x27;m still confused. I can&#x27;t think what problems someone is trying to solve by writing a function like this.<p>I can maybe see why it might have both `Model` and `PersonalInformationModel`: the author doesn&#x27;t want to prefix everything with `model.personalInformation` so they pass both `model` and `model.personalInformation` to it. (Maybe they forget that they can start the function with `let personalInformation = model.personalInformation`?) So I can maybe guess why `PersonalInformationModel` might be there, and if my guess is right I agree it&#x27;s silly.<p>But I have no idea what the `Cmd PersonalInformationMsg` is doing, and it makes me think I don&#x27;t understand the `PersonalInformationModel` either. Where does that input come from, and what does the function do with it?')
