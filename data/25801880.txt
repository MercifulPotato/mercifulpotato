First because it’s not true that all symptomatic people have X-ray findings, otherwise we wouldn’t struggle with false negatives as much! \nSecondly “severe” pathology on a chest X-ray doesn’t mean scarring. You can have consolidation or collapse without permanent damage, and most X-rays I have seen of people who have had Covid people have normal appearing X-rays a few months down the line. Some have severe scarring still visible months later but they are the exception not the rule.')
