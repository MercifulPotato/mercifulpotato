The M1 is a great mobile chip. But high performance is not what you should expect from a mobile chip. You can hope for high performance (for a mobile chip).<p>I don&#x27;t think you can learn much from this presentation. It&#x27;s not that special compared to how other companies present performance differences.<p>&quot;Performance vs. power&quot; is also confusing, speaking as someone who looks at benchmark results for things all the time and who counts as a hardware enthusiast. What is &quot;latest laptop PC chip?&quot; A Wintel laptop on 14nm++? Duh. I don&#x27;t understand it, and I know someone who doesn&#x27;t focus on hardware won&#x27;t understand it either.<p>The presentation is generally pretty deceptive. There are other much less confusing charts showing relative performance of the M1 in laptop benchmarks that reflect realistic workloads. And this new set of hardware releases has been very well received even among the typically Mac-critical.<p>The ML slide he&#x27;s writing about undermines what he&#x27;s talking about in terms of clarity and &#x27;talking like a human.&#x27; It is just gibberish, equivalent to Star Trek nonsense about dilithium crystals transfobulating the warp core. All it means is &quot;has the same features that have been standard for a decade or more on every operating system except a little better, working on more cores than before.&quot;<p>This is not Apple&#x27;s best marketing work, but it is their best actual laptop product in a while: go figure.')
