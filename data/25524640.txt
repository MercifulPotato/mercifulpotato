Not everybody in a <i>team</i> has the same level of expertise.<p>And Rust is not an interpreted language. IMHO, interpreted languages should just drop to a compiled one to keep it KISS. Instead of going the async road, just to discover in production, it is unstable because back-pressure was not taken into account. And, in Rust, it is probably not worth the effort and ultimately bloat most of the time.')
