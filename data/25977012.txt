The only real way I know to do this without causing artifacts or error build-up is to have to compositor only do the rounding as the last step, which is the way it works now, and you have to use an integer scale for that. As you describe, this is the &quot;easily solved&quot; way, but it&#x27;s only really easy because the compositor gets to handle it internally -- once you push that problem to clients it gets significantly harder.')
