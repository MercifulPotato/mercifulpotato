Inconsolata on google fonts was however pretty close.<p>Only issue, there would be this ugliness for a half second when the page loaded while the font loaded, monospace has bigger size letters on the same font size, and its worse on firefox, so the banners would often wrap text that was suppose to be contained to one line while this loading happened. I couldn&#x27;t preload the font, because cross-origin and doing the thing that is suppose to fix that didn&#x27;t work in chrome.<p>So I just self hosted it, we already have cloudflare in front. Killed most of the delay, the preload tag killed the rest.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tgstation13.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tgstation13.org</a>')
