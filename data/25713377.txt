To be criminally charged but allowed to avoid jail time. If they, I donâ€™t know, refrain from breaking into federal property for a few years and pass a community college civics course, the record is sealed.<p>What they did was serious. Little different from people who jump the White House fence. But many of us on this forum can look to their youth and remember when being in a crowd doing something feloniously mischevious was something they would have gone along with. I can. We have enough of a problem with mass incarceration to not add to it.')
