Used components should be open-source on the other hand. We cannot guarantee them to be in order to provide the service.<p>Open Hardware is the same. It must be transparent regarding components being used, so bill of materials, PCB design files etc must be available so that anyone can rebuild a product. All components then should be open-source, but it cannot be guaranteed that they are.<p>When you instead insist on &quot;must be open-source&quot; you may end up without a solution or something very expensive or very slow for which there may be no market. Or you can make a competitive product, which must be transparent, can be replicated and should be open. Then invest over time to open-source the remaining non-open components. The openRRH project fits into this principle.<p>More info on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdl-lef.org&#x2F;FDL-Hyper.Open.Initiative" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdl-lef.org&#x2F;FDL-Hyper.Open.Initiative</a>')
