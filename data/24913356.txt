If someone somehow put a fake QR code over a merchant&#x27;s real one, the merchant or person you&#x27;re paying would not get a notification when you scanned their code to pay them. Thus, both parties involved in the transaction would be alerted to the situation immediately. The wrong QR code would be tied to someone&#x27;s account and be easily found by the system.')
