It seems to encourage a lot of loud geocities&#x2F;MySpace-era visuals.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in a top-down 2D space (like a million games, but just for example: Among Us) with spatial audio. That&#x27;d be pretty interesting.<p>Judging by what my kids like to play, I could see a place in the market for a 2D virtual world with this kind of feature. Create your own spaces, &quot;decorate&quot; them, plus spatial audio. That sounds like a winning combo.')
