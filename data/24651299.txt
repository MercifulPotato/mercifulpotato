In this age of populism those of us who live in Commonwealth parliamentary democracies are quickly learning that the Westminster system we inherited from Britain is designed to be operated by a bunch of aristocrats who all largely adhere to the same social contract.  I.e. Britain with its vaunted &quot;unwritten constitution&quot; only worked in the past because the people in power largely toed the line of convention.  The system is built on mutual trust and cooperation.<p>With the influx of populists and political outsiders or other non-establishment types who (correctly) recognize that convention isn&#x27;t binding, we see that governmental systems choke and come to a halt.  I&#x27;m Canadian and our government as an institution is just about wholly incompetent, being carried on the tired shoulders of a few upstanding individuals who are either blissfully ignorant of the massive corruption and idiocy around them, or else determined to plod on through the sea of mediocrity.<p>Either way, as much as we like to rag on the US, one of the really nice things about their government is that it&#x27;s designed with less inherent trust that ours.  A majority government here in Canada is basically an elected dictatorship.  It feels good to say you trust the government when they happen to wear the same colours as your preferred ideology but trusting government to do the right thing is a recipe for disappointment in my opinion.')
