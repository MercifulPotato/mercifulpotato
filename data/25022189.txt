That leaves to options for the future: Not be so centrist, because you can&#x27;t sell it anyway, or be centrist, but actually sell it. But being centrist and looking leftist seems like a lose-lose, whether you prefer a more leftist or more centrist approach.<p>That being said, it might be interesting to look at Germany, where Merkel moved the CDU left from a center&#x2F;right position to the center. This secured the CDU a rather long stretch in power, essentially spelled doom for the center&#x2F;left SPD, but also gave rise to a more hard-left Die Linke and, worse, an ultra-right AfD, whicht started as a conservative party, but  essentially was taken over by neo-nazis.')
