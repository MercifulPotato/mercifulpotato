The type hierarchy of Python is painfully intertwined with the implementation of its type system. That implementation varies <i>by Python implementation</i>, and since the Python language is as old as Visual Basic, Borland Pascal, Werther&#x27;s caramels, and trilobites, it varies dramatically over time. Add to that the fact that Python has a philosophy of wearing leaky abstractions proudly on its sleeve and barfing implementation-level details at its users.<p>Python really is one of the most complex, arbitrary, and poorly abstracted languages in popular use. I have no idea how anyone lives with it for anything except writing extremely repetitive, formulaic, and superficial code, because having to dig into its guts feels like a nightmare. Even <i>Java&#x27;s</i> type system, as antiquated and simplistic as it is, is easier to understand and work with by comparison.')
