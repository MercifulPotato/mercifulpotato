They may already be seeing advertisers complaining that no matter how much they try to screen they are still getting complaints of their ads showing up in prerolls for conspiracy videos. So they are making a public show of letting everyone know that they don&#x27;t want to be in that business and they are doing all they can to stay out of it.<p>If they will do all they can or not, who knows? It is not like they have done all that much about QAnon.')
