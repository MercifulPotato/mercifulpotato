It pattern matches to a loss of free speech, and when society sees free speech being violated, it <i>should</i> evoke strong emotions (hopefully even more severe than sadness).<p>This is not, however, a violation of free speech, even if you believe in the general concept that a private company should allow dissenting opinions on its platform.  This user has violated the &quot;yelling fire in a crowded theatre&quot; exception to free speech, which even the most ardent supporters of the concept admit is important to protect.<p>These private institutions aren&#x27;t perfect, and judging if speech breaks the one exception to the moral concept of &quot;free speech&quot; is hard.  We&#x27;ll get it wrong.  The alternative, however, is to let the panic incited to occur unabated, which seems substantially worse.')
