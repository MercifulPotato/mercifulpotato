I have much fewer questions now than I had when I started to program 30 years ago.<p>I would guess poster above doesn&#x27;t yet have 30 years experience. Perhaps 10 or less.<p>My experience echoes both yours and the above poster&#x27;s - following a sort of bell curve - after initial ramp up, there was a significant period where every question led to several more. At some point that peaked, and by the time I&#x27;d been writing code for 20 years the rate of questions was dropping quickly.<p>Also the character of problems changed a lot. There&#x27;s a point where QA sites like StackOverflow become largely useless for your problems, as they&#x27;re too broad, complex, and dependent on specifics to fit the QA format. Even relevant blogs and academic papers become thin after 20 years.')
