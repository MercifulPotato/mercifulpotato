However, now that iOS apps are looking to be pushed to desktop, do you really think that is gonna continue in the future?<p>As soon as universal binaries&#x2F;iOS apps becomes fully fledged on ARM Mac I can imagine Apple just removing support completely. It&#x27;s almost inevitable the way Apple is progressing to basically move to the iOS style platform control to OS X.<p>Even from Mozilla&#x27;s economics perspective, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for Mozilla to be spending engineering effort maintaining both the iOS and OS X  variants for something like 4% of desktop. If it was up to me, I would have just migrated&#x2F;maintained the Firefox Wrapper iOS and called it a day.')
