If you are using something like React to do client-only rendering, you&#x27;re gonna be waiting a lot for blocking critical path JS to run, as well as the actual paint time (which alone can easily be in the hundreds of milliseconds).<p>&gt; Ship your users an app including a copy of the data ahead of time<p>That&#x27;s not really feasible though, is it? Most SPAs in the wild fetch data on demand, so you still get the network latency no matter what (on top of the delay due to no streaming each time). This is why you get those skeleton placeholders on sites like Facebook.')
