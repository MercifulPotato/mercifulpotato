Businesses would quickly move to other states if the tax difference became too high.<p>The only reason California can get away with the worker protections it has is because of its uniquely favorable weather, geography, productive land, and other resources.<p>No state can offer taxpayer funded healthcare, because then the people receiving more from healthcare than paying in will start to increase and the people paying in more than they receive will start to leave.  It&#x27;s the same problem for pretty much all other minimum standards of living, and the same one that exists between people in cheaper US states complaining about China and Mexico taking all their jobs.')
