One problem of the early Copernican heliocentric model was that it stated that the orbits of planets around the sun were perfect circles. It wasn&#x27;t until Kepler showed that a) the orbits were actually elliptical and b) the planets speeded up when they approached the sun and slowed down as they moved away that the actual movements of the planets could be more accurately predicted. Until this time, the older earth-centric models with all of the epicycles were &#x27;better&#x27;, even though totally unrelated to reality.')
