Conversely, only 1% work in livestock when 90% would do so if they had access to the same asset wealth as the middle and upper classes. Overall, this implies that 96% of households are forced to misallocate their labor.<p>So the authors suggest that currently 1% of the labor pool is working in livestock, but an optimal allocation would be 90% of the labor pool?  Ridiculous.')
