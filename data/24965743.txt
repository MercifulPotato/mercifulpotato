ARM server projects being canceled is the &quot;default state&quot; of ARM. The first ARM server company on the market called Calxeda was shut down before they launched anything. Qualcomm had a decent ARM server project and it was canceled too and nobody attributed that to RISC-V.<p>If you think this is good for RISC-V then think again. It means there is no demand for alternative ISAs in data centers. If ARM processors can&#x27;t enter the server space then RISC-V will have an even harder time.')
