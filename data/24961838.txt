Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604259033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958631, text='Physical goods are mutable but when we say they are scarce we mean that the same physical good can only be used by a limited number of people at the same time in the same way. For your example, a 200m2 house can be divided into 2 100m2 houses but the amount of physical living space hasn&#x27;t increased. If there is one hammer between the two of us, we cannot both use it to nail different nails at the same time. We can even come up with a timeshare agreement but that just codifies the reality that when you are using the hammer to nail something, it is unavailable to me for the same purpose. You can replace a swimming pool with a house but that means no one can swim there anymore.<p>&gt; what we actually charge for is pretty intangible, e.g., time of people, utility of a location.<p>Yes there are interesting metaphysical dimensions that the philosophers can explore and we could all learn from them. Of course when you pay for someone&#x27;s time it usually comes attached with some form of labor because what you really want is the product of that labor (which may itself be intangible). And when you pay for a location because it is useful, that use is grounded in the material relations, i.e. putting a gas station next to a thoroughfare rather than in a wilderness area. Note that both time of a person and location are also scarce in the economic sense.')
