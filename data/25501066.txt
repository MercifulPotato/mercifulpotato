You don&#x27;t work at a startup to maximize your net worth.  You&#x27;d be better off working almost anywhere else and come out on average with a higher net worth.<p>you work at a startup because the salary is sufficient for your needs&#x2F;goals and its work you want to be doing and dont think you would be able to do elsewhere (at least with the same ease).  If either of those 2 choices aren&#x27;t being met, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be working at a startup.  If both are met, you might not be caring that you aren&#x27;t maximizing your net worth and hence why are willing to work there.')
