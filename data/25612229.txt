On the creation side, it requires someone be comfortable with Python (or other Jupyter language) to some degree. Right now, programming is still considered a career skill rather than something &quot;ordinary people&quot; should be expected to know. Perhaps layering a graphical programming interface on top of this, which UE4 seems to have had some success with with their Blueprint system, would get &quot;ordinary people&quot; over the mental hurdle of being intimidated by code-as-text. Just look at the mental gymnastics people will engage with in Excel while thinking it&#x27;s not programming.<p>I see this as more of a social problem than a technical one, at any rate.<p>2. Once you build an interactive Jupyter document (especially if you use interactive widgets), it&#x27;s not necessarily that easy to share in its original state without requiring the reader also have a Jupyter environment set up or access a server running Jupyter. I would like to be able to share the document in a way that can be accessed offline by someone without them needing to set up the whole environment. Maybe an &quot;Adobe Reader&quot;-like application for Jupyter notebooks that &quot;ordinary people&quot; can just install with a click?')
