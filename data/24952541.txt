If social media companies returned to their original roles, there would be no slippery slope of political bias or opportunism; they would assume the same status as telephone companies.<p>The author seems to believe the original role of social media platforms was to provide censorship resistant channels for maximal free speech under the presumption that this was the original &quot;intent&quot; of the internet, and thus the only valid utility for any site on the internet. Apparently forums that moderated content didn&#x27;t exist before Facebook, etc.<p>But this is historical revisionism. The intent of social media is to monetize user-supplied content and data. They are not and have never been utilities, the are and have always been businesses.<p>And it&#x27;s ironic for someone arguing &quot;internet originalism&quot; to invoke the First Amendment in the spirit of &quot;Constitutional&quot; originalism to support an argument that the First Amendment is <i>explicitly</i> not intended to support. A truly originalist interpretation of both the First Amendment <i>and</i> the internet would support the right of social media platforms to do exactly what they&#x27;re doing, and strictly oppose attempts by the government to interfere by, for instance, forcing them to act as &quot;utilities&quot; and publish speech against their will.')
