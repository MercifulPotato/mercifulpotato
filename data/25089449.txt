Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25089582], score=None, time=1605316865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25089260, text='&quot;The rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s (under Reagan in the US; Thatcher in the UK; Mulroney in Canada; etc) and the disinvestment that followed made the stagnation in living standards--and increasing socioeconomic insecurity--for the median person inevitable.&quot;<p>If you meant to say the total opposite of that, then maybe!<p>Inequality may be up, but material standards of living for everyone but the poorest are way, way up, and it&#x27;s a little ridiculous because it&#x27;s obvious and palpable for anyone who was alive at the time.<p>By almost conceivable material measure: the amount of travel, safety, life choices, entertainment, access to healthcare (we used to go in when we were sick, now we go in due to age related issues) - &#x27;Heart Surgery&#x27; used to be a very scary thing, now it&#x27;s literally &#x27;outpatient&#x27; basis (my aunt got a &#x27;heart stunt&#x27; home same day - this is like Science Fiction). Cars are faster, better safer, we have access to all the world&#x27;s information (to know what &#x27;Russia&#x27; was in the 1980&#x27;s you had to go down to a library and check out a book to read about it).<p>Tthe notion you can go in this magical thing called a &#x27;mobile phone&#x27; and have any number of super cheap gadgets delivered to you from literally all the way around the world - China - for just a few dollars, was unthinkable.<p>Walmart is the most benevolent thing imaginable for poor people: they can buy every material need under the sun for very little, something impossible before.<p>I have family members with &#x27;regular government jobs&#x27; - not part of the elite, they live in a giant new home, new cars, every toy under the sun for their kids.<p>When I was young got fruit and candy in my stocking at Christmas, everyone I knew wore &#x27;hand-me-downs&#x27;, nobody took foreign vacations (we drive to Florida and stayed in motels), people did not have fancy sporting gear, &#x27;long distance&#x27; calls on the telephone were <i>very</i> expensive.<p>Material prosperity has exploded, and it really strains credibility for people trying to argue otherwise.<p><i>Ownership</i> and <i>capital</i> has not been spread evenly - the financial surpluses of globalisation has gone into the pockets of the 1%, but the productive surpluses have mostly gone into the pockets of the 85%. The &#x27;losers&#x27; of the economy of those who lost their jobs due to globalisation and can&#x27;t afford to participate in the game.')
