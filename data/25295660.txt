Item(by='sebmellen', descendants=None, kids=[25295787], score=None, time=1607032275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294458, text='What a shame that the flight attendants are either<p>1) so scared of their management that they won&#x27;t listen to people explaining the masks are filtered or<p>2) simply unable to understand that a non-standard mask could have a filtered exhale valve (which is much safer than a cloth mask for others, too).<p>I had the exact same thing happen to me on 4 different flights, with the flight attendants becoming very aggressive. I brought a short note with a diagram of how the filtration works, and pointed it out to them, and they just told me &quot;sorry, Mayo Clinic guidelines say you can&#x27;t wear that.&quot; This was on United, American Airlines, and Delta.<p>The tip I figured out on my last flight was to wear a hoodie that covered up the respirator on the side, and then wear two surgical masks over the respirator in front. Haven&#x27;t gotten a second look since then. I don&#x27;t think this would be possible with the narwhal mask (unfortunately).')
