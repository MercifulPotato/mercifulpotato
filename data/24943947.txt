I don&#x27;t know.<p>It is nice to be able to show your support for third party candidates in the way that matters most, by actually voting for them, even if they still have little chance of winning. It&#x27;s nice to be able to do this without throwing your vote away. You no longer have to choose between strategic voting and showing support for your favorite candidate.<p>Even with RCV there will still be political parties with varying popularity, and there will still be 2 at the top that are most popular. At least we wont have to have candidates strategically drop out to avoid being a spoiler any more.')
