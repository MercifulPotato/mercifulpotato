If you have a tool that is hard to do complex things with (i.e., complex Makefile operations), the solution should _not_ be a tool to generate input for that tool (i.e., CMake&#x2F;autotools generating makefiles). We shouldn&#x27;t use a build system whose artifacts are scripts in a cruftier build system; we should replace the universal build system whole-cloth. Even the portability argument fails: if any modifications to the build system require installing the respective meta-tool (cmake&#x2F;autotools), the generated Makefile is nearly-useless for anyone trying to modify that codebase in any substantial way. We need tools that do the actual building, not Makefile meta-languages.')
