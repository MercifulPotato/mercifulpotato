Obviously there&#x27;s some personal preference here, but California grown San Marzano-style tomatoes (not true San Marzanos as that&#x27;s a protected designation of origin) can be just as good. Canned tomatoes also just taste better in some applications, like pizza, so they&#x27;re always going to be better than GP poster&#x27;s parents&#x27; home-grown fresh tomatoes.')
