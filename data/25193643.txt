If the Sheriff said, &quot;Hey it would be cool if you guys gave me some iPads maybe I could grease the wheels on your gun permit,&quot; then I don&#x27;t buy it. A reasonable person should not be afraid of the sheriff at that point. There&#x27;s some risk in reporting the situation, but it&#x27;s not that serious. Maybe you don&#x27;t feel comfortable reporting him, so perhaps you decide you don&#x27;t need that CCW after all. Giving the bribe is far from the only option, and the presence of any element of risk is not carte blanche for illegal activities.<p>If the sheriff said gimme the iPads or I&#x27;ll blow your brains out, that&#x27;s another story. But I guess that&#x27;s not what happened here.')
