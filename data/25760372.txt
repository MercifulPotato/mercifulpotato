Normally I would already by logged in. But not always, for instance I mostly use Firefox on my phone, and those sessions aren&#x27;t shared with webviews. So one can never know.<p>There&#x27;s really nothing stopping anyone from making an entirely fake &quot;Sign in with X&quot; popup and people would believe it (me included), I think teaching people to give away their Google, FB, GH etc credentials on random pages is  scary.')
