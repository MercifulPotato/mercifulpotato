My wife did not do well without a solid nights sleep, and I was used to oncall work, all night nursing was me.  This was equitable, as well as playing to our strengths and weaknesses.<p>There is no reason to have iron rules of we must each do every parenting action in equal amounts, but to find equitable split of the work that needs to be done.')
