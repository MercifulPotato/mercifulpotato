Item(by='314', descendants=None, kids=[25125651, 25126564], score=None, time=1605629672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125332, text='&gt; This is a very misleading statement. They primarily only used the 5950X in single-core tests, and in those tests it doesn&#x27;t come remotely close to 105W. In fact per Anandtech&#x27;s own results[1] the 5950X CPU core in a single-core load draws around 20w.<p>It would seem that the switching of AMD chips in the various graphs have caused some confusion. I was referring to the  &quot;Geekbench 5 Multi-Thread&quot; graph on page 2. This shows a score of 15,726 for the 5950x vs 7715 for the M1. This is about 2x. I do not see any notes that the benchmark is using less cores than the chip has available.<p>I don&#x27;t follow your argument for why it is misleading to characterize the 5950x as a 105W TDP in this benchmark. Could you expand a little on why you believe this is misleading? The article that you have linked to shows over 105W of power consumption from 4 cores - 16.<p>Edit: I put in the wrong page number in the clarification :) Also, I see later in the linked article that the 15726 score is from 16C&#x2F;32T.')
