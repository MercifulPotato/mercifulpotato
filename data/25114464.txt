First 3% mortality sounds way high - <i>even</i> given health system collapse (basically turning every ventilator survivor into a dead patient).<p>And on the other hand, mostly the old and those with pre-conditions will die - we <i>all</i>take the vaccine to protect <i>everyone</i>. That way we might avoid a population wide 0.5% (or thereabouts) mortality rate.<p>That would still 1 in 200 - most people would likely know a handful of people dying from the disease if there&#x27;s no mitigation.')
