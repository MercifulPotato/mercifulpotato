However they are notoriously difficult to use for actual programming, especially in larger projects.<p>Rust&#x27;s borrow checker is approximately affine types plus regions.  Its proof theory gets very complicated if you spell out all the details.  However mere mortals can actually write large, complex, and correct programs with it, as has now been empirically demonstrated many times.')
