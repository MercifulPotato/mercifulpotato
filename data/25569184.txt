As others have pointed out already it’s getting more difficult to find items that are still available for purchase. When they are still available they might not be built to the same specifications as before. I’ll swing over to the site and upload a few products I’ve been happy with that are still built to the same specifications. There is a thread somewhere over in the mrmoneymustache forums where you can likely attract some interest if the mods allow you to post. Best of luck!')
