If you put something like Vantablack next to it, it would become very obvious that it&#x27;s merely dark gray. It&#x27;s still reflecting a <i>significant</i> amount of light from the environment.<p>And then it appears even lighter when you&#x27;ve got &quot;black&quot; text on a white background, because on our retina the white background &quot;bleeds&quot; into the black as well.<p>Painters, photographers -- these people are very aware that with real-world common objects, &quot;black&quot; is never actually black. Unless you&#x27;re literally in a room with no light at all, it&#x27;s only ever dark gray. Computer screens are <i>nowhere near</i> capable of producing any kind of &quot;unnatural true black&quot;. It&#x27;s not a thing to worry about.')
