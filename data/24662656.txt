You can&#x27;t load freight trains full of land and ship them to an auction across the country where used land dealers buy them for resale.<p>Since the 1950s many states have adopted laws (and some states have adopted, repealed and re-adopted) and practices with the effect of increasing the price point of the &quot;minimum viable shitbox&quot;.  The bottom of the market is just a ton higher in some states than others.  It&#x27;s like how you can&#x27;t buy a mobile home in Manhatten but with cars.<p>Used car dealers compete with exporters for cars.  If Brazil (or wheverver) has an economic boom they remove used cars from the market in places like the US and Canada increasing cost.<p>The qualities of a new car and the life-cycle of a car has changed dramatically since the 1950s whereas houses are fundamentally just land prices plus some (with the &quot;some&quot; being a reflection of developers saying &quot;well if I&#x27;m gonna buy this expensive-ass land I might as well put an expensive-ass McMansion on it)<p>Alternative (mostly public) transit options in various places has waxed and waned since the 1950s.<p>So yes, you could use cars for your point of comparison but you&#x27;d basically get the same thing as with housing but with the added downside of more variables to control for any time you want to make a cross-time or cross-location comparison with the data.')
