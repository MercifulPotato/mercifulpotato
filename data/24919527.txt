That&#x27;s some serious delusion in 2020. Wireless cards and higher end network interface cards are independent computers. Your processor has another processor (Intel ME and others) in it. Baseband Management Controllers are also independent computers on their own right.<p>With closed firmware and wireless capabilities, you can never know what they&#x27;re doing at a given time.<p>Stuxnet reached systems which were seriously air gapped. Consider a what a laptop with a <i>witty</i> wireless card firmware can do.<p>I&#x27;m not getting into TEMPEST attacks and their newer versions, passive surveillance, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve listened tales about Cisco devices which were configured to isolate and prevent internet traffic but, they <i>mistakenly forgot</i> to drop some magic packets. Uh.<p>---<p>Random facts about this stuff:<p>- Your Intel system runs a special version of Minix on its Management Engine. A version of Minix customized for Intel by its original developer.<p>- There are photos of Cisco devices which were <i>delightfully enchanced</i> by NSA before shipping to its customer via special firmware and&#x2F;or hardware. NSA still retains this capability.')
