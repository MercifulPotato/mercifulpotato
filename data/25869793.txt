Something I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to match again.<p>When I joined the company as a sysadmin there were 30 staff, and they really liked the work I did and eventually they put me on this innovation incentive scheme that basically said &quot;If you keep delivering innovative solutions and driving the technology direction in the way that you are, we will pay you a bonus of 1.5% of the profit made from e-commerce sales every 4&quot;<p>At the time sales profit from e-commerce channels was about 250k for each period, so a very nice $3500~ bonus every 4 months.<p>When I left the company ~15 years later:<p>- 5000+ staff<p>- Had moved into a role managing a large team of sysadmins and was responsible for the technical innovation strategy&#x2F;direction of the business overall.<p>- Same CEO and and my original &quot;IT manager&quot; was now the CTO who I still reported into.<p>- They kept me on the same bonus scheme for my whole time at the company.<p>- By the time I left online sales profit for each 4 month period was $50,000,000.<p>Right place, right time, right people.<p>:-)<p>I gave up a lot for that job and worked damn hard though.
