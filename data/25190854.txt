If anything, it would be proof that the game is actually harmful as it leads to absurd historical conclusions.<p>&gt; The willingness not to ask what that victory means for the hidden jewish populations of the conquered is common to both camps too.<p>Do you even know what German military goals were? Or what ideology the leadership believed in and military commanders were throughly indoctrinated in? They did actually believed things and their project.<p>Because it sounds to me that you are projecting your in game motivations into actually real and complex people.')
