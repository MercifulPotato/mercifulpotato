There is nothing its citizen can do. 85 % of Nevada is federally owned and there zero recourse for its citizens on how that is used.<p>49% of land in Wyoming is owned by the Federal government and the federal can and will do as it pleases with the land. The two senators are not why Wyoming is a nuclear waste dump.<p>The Senate structure all through U.S. history is vestige of the comprise between souther slave owning and northern factions. The number of states, or what area actually should be state was never carefully planned or designed to protect any minorities, it was always political decision to keep power balanced from day 1.<p>It is political fiction to explain it as  to give minorities rights, rural rights were never the intent, no document ( Bill of rights, Constitution etc) actually talks about any rural or minority rights being protected , they instead talk about 3&#x2F;5ths instead. It was always about slaves,  it was a <i>huge</i> part of the economy for the southern states.')
