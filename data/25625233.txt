Item(by='sweeneyrod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609707915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623661, text='I think the artificial shape example does not adequately show how variant types&#x2F;pattern matching are actually used in languages like SML&#x2F;F#&#x2F;Haskell. It combines two different cases.<p>Suppose you have a type `colour` defined as `RGB(int, int, int) | HSL(int, int, int)` and then you add representation as CIE. Then having to update each match on a colour is absolutely a feature not a bug. If you miss some out then your code will be wrong.<p>On the other hand, suppose you have various ways of serialization (JSON&#x2F;XML&#x2F;s-expressions). In this case, it would probably be nice if you could add a way to serialize to e.g. protobufs without having to jump around your codebase and all its clients fixing type errors. But in most languages of the kind we&#x27;re discussing, you can do! You just have to represent the different serialization methods in some way other than a variant type. For instance, in OCaml you could just use classes and inheritance (although in practice you probably wouldn&#x27;t because the language provides nicer tools).')
