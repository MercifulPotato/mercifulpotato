Even then eventually you will need to trade your animals with someone else just so your breeding stock doesn&#x27;t get inbred too much.<p>Most people wouldn&#x27;t want true self sufficiency if they could have it. I admire people who &quot;go into the woods&quot; for years (they are generally more hunter&#x2F;gathers than farmers); but even as introverted as I am, I still like to have a larger group of people around me.')
