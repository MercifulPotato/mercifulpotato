Its important to push Texas a little bit since there&#x27;s a chance for victory.<p>In the most likely event: Texas goes red (as it has gone for the past several decades), and we&#x27;re left wondering about Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania as usual.<p>If Florida has an insurmountable lead on election night (like 5% or something), then Biden probably wins. But if its a 2% differential (too close to call by the media, and a serious counting effort starts to take place), like is currently projected in the polls, then Florida could very well drag out this election for a week or longer. Just like back in 2000.')
