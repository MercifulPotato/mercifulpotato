Given it&#x27;s apple, probably not long, but I think it&#x27;s worth pointing out backwards compat was only broken when both the OS and the CPU were changed (twice in the CPU&#x27;s case).<p>My understanding is that running 16 bit code on a modern CPU is itself a sort of backwards compat mode which isn&#x27;t supported in 64 bit operation, so you need a full emulator to run the executable. Neither Apple nor Microsoft seem keen on keeping CPU emulators around long term (IIRC Windows used to have something like this built-in for emulating 80286s for Win16, mostly for non-x86 arches like Alpha&#x2F;MIPS&#x2F;PowerPC, I think?)')
