Fine, you can judge that for your own life. But I will say that life is SO much better when you are able to deploy this absolutist hammer with a force of an anvil. I DON&#x27;T use Facebook or Twitter or Instagram so I just don&#x27;t know how much of a cesspit those places really are. There is SO much life to live beyond staring at a rectangular lamp. As my mum says, if it&#x27;s a chronic problem, either accept it or find a coping mechanism.')
