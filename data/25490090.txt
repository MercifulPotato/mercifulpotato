The outer door, in bronze and glass, is placed centrally in a symmetrical facade. Polished shoes glide quietly over shining rubber to the glittering and silent elevator. The overpoweringly cultured receptionist will murmur with carmine lips into an ice-blue receiver. She will wave you into a chromium armchair, consoling you with a dazzling smile for any slight but inevitable delay. Looking up from a glossy magazine, you will observe how the wide corridors radiate toward departments A, B, and C. From behind closed doors will come the subdued noise of an ordered activity. A minute later and you are ankle deep in the director&#x27;s carpet, plodding sturdily toward his distant, tidy desk.

But the stages of its progress toward completion correspond with so many steps in political collapse.... It would be possible, though tedious, to trace the whole story down to the day when the British finally withdrew, showing how each phase of the retreat was exactly paralleled with the completion of another triumph in civic design. What was finally achieved was no more and no less than a mausoleum.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sas2.elte.hu&#x2F;tg&#x2F;ptorv&#x2F;Parkinson-s-Law.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sas2.elte.hu&#x2F;tg&#x2F;ptorv&#x2F;Parkinson-s-Law.pdf</a>')
