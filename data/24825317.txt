On the kid desk I bought from them, the chairs broke. Same thing happened to my friends who bought the same set.<p>I&#x27;m more optimistic about motivations. Most people don&#x27;t have time to sell (or even give away) something they bought for $200 now worth $30 on the second-hand market. If I could dispose of this stuff safely, freely, and easily, I definitely would.<p>Heck, if Ikea keeps this up, I bet there will be a third-hand market where people haul this junk away to Ikea, and resell vouchers&#x2F;new furniture. That&#x27;d be awesome. If I could dump this stuff on the curb, and know it won&#x27;t end up in a landfill, I&#x27;d totally do it.')
