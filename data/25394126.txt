If none of them work for you, you can get a VPS and start hosting videos on your own web site.<p>The difference between YouTube censorship and ISP censorship is the amount of capital you need to circumvent it. If ISPs start filtering traffic, you need tens-to-hundreds of millions of dollars to build hardware infrastructure to run a competing ISP.
