There are pitfalls both with and without frameworks (e.g. it&#x27;s equally easy to accidentally plop a hi-res image into a Next.js app), but generally speaking, limiting the tech stack means there&#x27;s less potential stack-specific pitfalls.<p>If &quot;I&#x27;m gonna restrict myself to HTML and CSS only&quot; gets them 80% of the way to their performance goals then IMHO, that&#x27;s a perfectly valid approach.<p>As far as images go, the reality is that most mainstream sites with image&#x2F;video content are heavy sites with multi-second page load times, despite literal millions of dollars being spent on engineer salaries. In that context, does it really matter if a random blog decides to just use pngcrush and a dumb img tag for the occasional eye candy imagery, instead of whatever is the state of art multi-resolution technology?')
