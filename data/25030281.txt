It&#x27;s just a collection of assertions without any of the insight necessary to have a useful conversation on the subject.<p>They also completely fail to address the elephant in the room: bad actors already have access to strong encryption and they don&#x27;t need the blessings of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or any organization to use it.  Encryption is an idea, not a product.  They cannot prevent terrorists from using strong encryption any more than they can prevent terrorists from using algebra.')
