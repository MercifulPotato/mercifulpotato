We&#x27;re talking about people&#x27;s lives.<p>I&#x27;ve felt tired before and you know what I do? I nap in the parking lot. Because the remote chance I kill or maim myself or someone else is not worth the momentary discomfort. It&#x27;s not fun, and sometimes people harass you, but it&#x27;s far better than driving drowsy.<p>&gt; reasons to be tired and drive: rotating shiftwork, working multiple jobs, caring for a newborn, caring for the sick.<p>None of that is an excuse to get behind a many thousand pound piece of equipment and not be able to control it.<p>&gt; &quot;You should never get behind the wheel if there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll fall asleep!&quot; is an absurd thing to say.<p>I stand behind my assertion and hope you&#x27;ll come around.')
