For example, can users ask to have their data removed from a model’s training data? Moreover, if such a request were granted, must the model be retrained from scratch? The fact that models can memorize and misuse an individual’s personal information certainly makes the case for data deletion and retraining more compelling.<p>This is an interesting angle I had not considered before. It seems like “right to be forgotten” requests could be quite damaging to the “train once run anywhere” promise of some of these models. (Or this could just mean that the training data needs to be more carefully vetted for personal data, but probably both as no vetting process can be 100% successful).')
