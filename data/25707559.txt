The cardholder makes 1-2% depending on the card and the rewards structure. The remainder goes to the issuing bank and covers the cost of loan origination. It is after all an unsecured loan at a rate of 0% for the first month.<p>Even this is a social policy issue as Europe has capped debit interchange at 0.2% and credit at 0.3%. Guess what they don’t have? Reward programs.<p>Ok so what does this fee get you as a merchant? 20% higher average ticket sizes.<p>Then there’s bitcoins $10 fee or $100 if you factor in the socialized cost of block reward.<p>So no, it’s not a 3%+, it’s much more nuanced than you’re making it out to be, and it is by no means a clear win.<p>Every other hypothetical actor you provided has their use case solved by permission limited accounts with your merchant acquirer.<p>[edit] if you knew you were making a disingenuous statement to make your position sound compelling when it just isn’t.
