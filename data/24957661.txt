A lot of people do not know how bookmarks or even ‘windows’ work so they leave open the websites they visit so they do not forget them or have to open them again... How would they know that this is bad? The browser supports it and no one told them. For them there is no correlation between tabs and computer slow. Just as many people, when you say ‘your memory is full’ start throwing away picture from their drive. I think you vastly overestimate computer users... I am ‘the computer guy’ of the village because ‘I do stuff with computers’ and I run into the strangest things all the time. There is, for instance, a large stack of perfectly fine laptops in my house because some people just bought new ones because the old one ‘was slow’ and they were fed up.<p>Also, what do tabs open have to do with IQ?')
