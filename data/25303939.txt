There have been tests which have been safe thus far, and in my opinion there is less risk in moving forward with testing and distribution of the vaccines then not doing so.<p>&gt;  Let&#x27;s not pressure strangers&#x27; decisions either way.<p>I&#x27;m of mixed feelings on this, and my overall opinion is that it depends on who all is able to take the vaccine.<p>If there are few restrictions, maybe this would be okay. However, if there are enough restrictions that there will be a sizable number of people who cannot take it, we need to get as many as possible out to try to protect them.<p>[Edit: This is referring to legal pressure. I am of the opinion that it is not unreasonable to encourage others to take vaccines if they are able.]<p>&gt; Far more money in this career path. I&#x27;ve made more some days writing junk code than I ever made in a year in a lab. It&#x27;s easy to see why some scientists might be incentivised by external factors...<p>First of all, I&#x27;d like to apologize for my ad hominem attack earlier. That was uncalled for.<p>Second, I find it hard to believe that scientists would be pushed to do something actually dangerous on this sort of scale, and like I said earlier, I find the idea of not combating the virus more dangerous then moving forward as quickly with vaccines as can be safely done. However, it&#x27;s quite possible that I just have too much faith left in humanity.')
