Apple&#x27;s main argument against Epic is that the iPhone (and related devices) wouldn&#x27;t be successful without the app store and the app store wouldn&#x27;t be a thing without the iPhone, thus they&#x27;re both a part of the same product (the Apple ecosystem). It&#x27;s hard to argue against that, so there&#x27;s not many more places where it would make sense for an Apple break-up.')
