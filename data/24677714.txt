We&#x27;ve forgotten the warnings of Stallman.<p>AGPL does a decent job against hosted services. It&#x27;s a shame cloud companies have co-opted various open source database and server products and ceased contributions back to the world. With the same hand, they lock people into their managed versions.<p>Another thing we need to fight against is providing software to companies that put users into walled gardens. We need licenses that require data export and right to forget. Encode the GDPR into our licenses.<p>Finally, we have to fight back against embrace, extend, extinguish. Apple is trying to take over computing and prevent us from running our own code on our own devices without going through their store. We should prevent them and anyone else trying to do this from using our software.<p>There&#x27;s a lot we need to defend or we&#x27;ll all wind up using opaque thin clients to access walled silos.')
