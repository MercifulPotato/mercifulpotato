It forces you to write files over files and no one wants that, so they fall back to primitive types.<p>For the abstraction bloat it is actually similar. Here the reason is that for the longest time (and even nowadays) Java makes it painful to work with functions. So now instead of just a plain function, you have to create a class with an interface that has one method... and instantiate it. Great... not.')
