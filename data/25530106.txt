Item(by='mabbo', descendants=None, kids=[25530969, 25530331, 25530666, 25530715], score=None, time=1608835174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527018, text='It cannot be a person, unless there is some incredible breakthrough in energy storage density.<p>Whatever that object is, it&#x27;s too small to hold enough batteries to contain the energy needed to lift a human being for any serious length of time. Even using chemical storage like gasoline or kerosine, you&#x27;d need to bring a very large tank with you to stay airborne any length of time. There&#x27;s no lifting body, like wings, to make staying aloft more efficient either, like an airplane uses.<p>My guess is that it&#x27;s a prank. A fairly large drone loosely carrying a very light dummy. And as far as pranks go, they have succeeded.')
