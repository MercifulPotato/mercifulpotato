Or is this not such a problem to bother with the expense of a Lidar?<p>If you know exactly the distance to something you want in focus, and it no longer has to be &quot;solved&quot; by phase detection, or edge sharpness?  Or is this even already being used with phones having Lidars built in?  I guess if your lens isn&#x27;t perfectly distance calibrated then it fails though.')
