Ie. mandatory paid sick leave, mandatory overtime pay, paid maternity leave, socialized disability pay, higher minimum wage floors, etc. Hell, even support for single payer healthcare hovers between 55-60% depending on the poll. These are all likely to happen within the next 10-30 years.<p>And you might think, but that&#x27;s impossible in our current climate! This time is different! But looking at it historically, the US changes course and its public opinion shifts dramatically <i>all the time.</i> All it takes is a few viral news stories and some hit TV Shows and we (as a group) change our opinion.<p>When public opinion changes, policy changes follow (with a 10-20 year lag or so) since the US is a democracy. Think Marijuana legalization, Gay marriage legalization, etc. etc.<p>If you don&#x27;t like interacting with the law making political machine, you can try to help influence the public opinion side. Create media, PR campaigns, etc. There&#x27;s tons of things you can do instead of spending time&#x2F;money to avoid Amazon. They are doing nothing wrong based on the rules of the game we set up for them.')
