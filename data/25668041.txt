Item(by='skylanh', descendants=None, kids=[25673933], score=None, time=1610002547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659382, text='I think I have the answer, and it&#x27;s a lot less interesting than it appears at face value.<p>These titles are created by an IT company that is selling software &#x2F; services.  The software appears to do platform price matching &#x2F; analytics, and one of those is on Amazon.<p>My understanding &#x2F; assumption is that it appears that if they are a high frequency sellerid paired to their developerid, then they can increase their requests per second (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.developer.amazonservices.com&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;dev_guide&#x2F;DG_Throttling.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.developer.amazonservices.com&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;dev_guide&#x2F;DG_...</a>) either by requesting a change, or maybe via background quotas set by Amazon.<p>The IT company has some promotional stuff, and they indicate a number of VM&#x27;s using multiple public IPs to avoid throttling, and in addition:<p>&gt; [as a top seller we get 8 rp&#x2F;s, instead of the newbie 0.5 rp&#x2F;s against 20 items per request]<p>I went through some of the sellers, and noted some have some complete shite ratings, but that their ratings are consistently at a certain value even over 30&#x2F;90&#x2F;12 months.  Lifetime values are highly skewed as it appears they pre-stuffed the hat.  So for every real person that gets screwed by a cancelled order, they create a number of fake reviews.<p>So my conclusion based on what I see is that this is their place-holder author, each of the clients they&#x27;ve sold this to has a store front stocked with these titles, the clients generate a ton of fake sales at a reduced price, request a quota increase as &quot;we&#x27;re a large seller&quot;, and then happily do whatever system gaming they actually intended to do.<p>I could go further down this rabbit hole, but this hypothesis has been exhausted.  I wish I was this interested in my actual job.')
