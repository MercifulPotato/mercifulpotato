Item(by='hliyan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602992662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24814171, text='I do believe that &quot;do something for a set period and see what happens&quot; is the wrong way to look at timeboxing.<p>Rather, (at least to me) it&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t extend the deadline, instead reduce the scope&quot;. You slice your deliverables small enough so that if you miss the deadline, it&#x27;s not an all-or-nothing situation. You can always deliver a usable subset of what you planned&#x2F;forecast.<p>Take your example, &quot;writing those two missing features today&quot;. You might just end up delivering one of those features if your forecast turns out to be inaccurate. It&#x27;s more effective if the timebox is larger and the tasks are smaller.')
