It really doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a start up or not either, plenty of people put everything into new jobs including moving and failing sucks just as much.<p>I finally figured out how to succeed but it was a difficult and deeply personal struggle that took a long time.<p>There are still times I just want to pack it all in and give up.<p>Infact I just had a meltdown a month or so ago and almost sold off everything. I think it&#x27;s a part of my personality to never be completely satisfied.<p>Lastly I chuckled a bit when I read about him feeling bad about his girlfriend, at least he still has one! He should be thankful that she stuck around and should show her the appreciation she deserves for supporting him.')
