I live in Poland.<p>Do you know how many guns I saw in my life that did not belong to a uniformed or undercover Police officer, soldier guarding an embassy or security guard guarding taking money to or from ATM?<p>Exactly zero. And I am 38.<p>Here in Poland it is quite difficult to get a gun. Basically, you need exceptional circumstances to be allowed to own one and even then you are not allowed to just carry it around.<p>There are people who own a gun but most of them, from what I understand, will not take it anywhere.<p>Do people get beaten or stabbed here like in US? Sure. There&#x27;s just no guns involved even for the ones that do own gun legally, because they would prefer to get beaten than bring out a gun.<p>Because of gun regulation, people learned to not consider guns to be a solution to their problems. Maybe if they fear their house might get robbed rather than buy a gun they will put bars on their windows and better security system.<p>And I strongly feel that this also affects you <i>if</i> you own a gun, in that it causes you to think more critically rather than just whip out a gun when you think a little bit threatened.')
