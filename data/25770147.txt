The freelance market is more volatile than the rigidly regulated traditional labor markets allowing for larger pay increases during good times (and also decreases during bad times), in general, it approaches a more realistic compensation of real added value.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve greatly benefited from becoming a freelancer in Europe and have never been one day unemployed since I started over 7 years ago (4 different customers in total). The significantly higher income (almost 3 times my old, already decently above average, _net_ income) royally compensates the lack of unemployment benefits or reduced pensions.<p>I feel that if more devs would become freelancers it would create real upward pressure towards compensation because compensation isn&#x27;t entrenched in company policies and regulations.<p>One downside is the proliferation of those in-between rent-seeking businesses, they&#x27;re probably needed to get started initially but they take huge cuts and have a lot of absurd contract requirements so it&#x27;s wise to develop an active strategy to find jobs without them.')
