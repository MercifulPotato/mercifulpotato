I have friends outside work, I do not have an urge to socialize with people and potentially interrupting them from  doing their job.<p>2. My manager has better things to do. Being in the office doesn&#x27;t mean you are being productive. Sometimes you get distracted by noise, or some local office jerk, or some random event... e.g.: in a large company, every day is someone&#x27;s birthday. Or someone wants to go for a walk and grab coffee...<p>3. I can live closer to the office and pay as much as twice in rent, or live farther from the office but have a larger place that my family can enjoy more, at the cost of spending more time away from home.\nIf I work remotely, I have up to 2 extra hours every day. I can use that time sleeping, exercising, interacting with my family, cleaning, or do whatever needs to be done that is more useful than spending 2 hours stressing out in a car every day, polluting the atmosphere and congesting road infrastructure, or worrying about being mugged in a train.<p>4. Trying to escape from your problems won&#x27;t make the situation better. You still have to go home at the end of the day and deal with your problems.<p>All that money wasted in a desk&#x2F;cubicle&#x2F;office, meeting rooms, cleaning crew, security crew, facilities crew... who do you think is paying all that money? your employer is. It&#x27;s a lot of money that could rather go to something else, like your compensation, or hiring more people so you have less work to do.<p>If you are an engineer, offices = a lot of resources and effort put into making your life worse.')
