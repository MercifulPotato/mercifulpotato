What I observe is that people mistake &quot;fact&quot; for &quot;truth&quot;. A &quot;fact&quot; is the _interpretation_ of something that has happened. While truth is what objectively really happened. Most people can&#x27;t detach their personal world view from an &quot;absolute&quot; reality and hence their &quot;facts&quot; are biased by the way how they _perceive_ the objective reality. But what&#x27;s an objective reality? Everyone lives in their own subjective reality! And this is where their &quot;facts&quot; come from.<p>TLDR; The discussions around &quot;facts&quot; are totally useless to me. Unless you accept that someone who pushes through their &quot;facts&quot; does nothing else than pushing their worldview onto you. Everyone is free to learn &quot;truth&quot; through their own perception. Other people&#x27;s &quot;facts&quot; don&#x27;t support this much.')
