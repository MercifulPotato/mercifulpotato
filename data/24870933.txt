And what change do individual choices make here?<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too late. Firefox exists because the same situation was happening in the late 90s&#x2F;early 2000s - replace Chrome with Internet Explorer and I could believe this was written in 2002.<p>It&#x27;s a different landscape today[1], but I maintain it wasn&#x27;t too late then and it isn&#x27;t now - the fact that we&#x27;re talking about FF almost 20 years after its first release is a testament to that.<p>I&#x27;m not a daily FF user, but I am part of the install base.  I think that diversity in the browser ecosystem is extremely important and I&#x27;m not a &quot;Mozilla advocate&quot;.<p>[1] I&#x27;m guessing part of the early success of FF was its support for OSX&#x2F;Linux where IE had no reach and it gained them a lot of early traction&#x2F;users so it isn&#x27;t an apples to apples comparison with Chrome today. But, I remember the times, and many (even non-techie) people would adamantly install and switch to FF as the first action when they got a new PC&#x2F;fresh Windows install - those individual choices added up to a very large user base.')
