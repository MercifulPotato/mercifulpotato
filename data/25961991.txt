If you are e.g. driving to a job that you can&#x27;t afford to lose, it may be that avoiding a night in jail for a wrongful arrest is more important than your eventual principled triumph over the system.<p>Especially given that neither is guaranteed. Maybe the cop decides you&#x27;re not worth the trouble and lets you go. Maybe they plant drugs and lie that you did consent to a search, and a jury believes them. Maybe your overworked public defender advises you to just take a plea. There are no silver bullets here, and the most likely bad outcome is entirely situational.')
