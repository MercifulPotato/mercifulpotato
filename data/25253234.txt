Maybe even replacing them with more trees in a wider area), drying them and cutting them with the impact of mining, smelting and producing Steel for more traditional ships. I assume mining also involves removing trees and wildlife to clear the area.<p>These things aren&#x27;t always as obvious as &quot;cutting down trees is bad&quot;, if it&#x27;s better than the alternatives and we can offset the impact then its an improvement right?')
