While this is a common scenario on application processors and FPGAs, this is unusual on a modern microcontroller. It&#x27;s not really a problem... XIP flash is cheap and ubiquitous... I&#x27;m just curious what the reasoning here was. Cost? Process restrictions? Silicon IP licensing issues? Not necessary if 99% of the chips are used on this RPi carrier board?<p>The (hard) boot rom is open source! I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw this.')
