It&#x27;s a fun way of learning coding, especially if you are into rivalry.<p>There is also a growing need of creating new tasks. Actual approach is using a command line tools to work with solutions, generating tests and checking correctness. It works but I feel like every time I need to reinvent those methods and repeat same mistakes. It&#x27;s a tedious process.<p>I aim to create an SPA with elegant interface which will simplify this process as much as possible. Templates of LaTex statements, input generators, verification pipeline, user accounts, everything in one place! Additionally, I want to put there many guidelines for educational purposes.<p>I&#x27;m really excited about this project, working on it with my younger brother and we already learned a lot. My dream is to finally share this tool with a community ;)')
