Windsocks wear out fairly quickly.  It&#x27; gives you the direction fairly accurately, and the speed say +- 5 knots, which is adequate to choose a runway and have a good initial guess of how to correct for a crosswind.  Once you&#x27;ve started your takeoff&#x2F;approach, you make corrections based on the observed behavior of the plane, e.g. on final approach, if you drift a little to the right of centerline, you correct a little to the left.')
