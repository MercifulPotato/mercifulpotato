However, I couldn&#x27;t share what I made, so I started seeing the hours of work I&#x27;d need to make something substantial as a waste.<p>I think having an easy way to share your game should be a priority. Clearly the web can be used to emulate and share almost anything now, so some kind of exporting system and web player would be ideal.')
