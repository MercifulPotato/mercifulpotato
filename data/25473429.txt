Certainly this makes some sense for the Surface Pro X, which is their very unpopular, poor-performing ARM device. And Microsoft has partnered with AMD for lightly customized AMD Ryzen APUs for their Surface Laptop. But Surface devices are a very small slice of Windows devices sold, because they are &quot;premium&quot; devices merely showing off what can be done with some integration between hardware and software. Most Windows computers are sold by HP, Dell, Acer and other smaller players. And most of them will be choosing between AMD and Intel for the next several years, at least, unless someone surprises with a high-performing ARM chip (and Microsoft fixes x86 emulation performance on ARM.)')
