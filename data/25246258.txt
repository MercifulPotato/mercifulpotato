WSL1 used little (if any?) of the historical NT subsystem concepts and WSL2 even less.<p>SFU and its successor were, but that was a completely different architecture, never intended for binary compat. The short lived and of limited scope OS&#x2F;2 subsys was for binary compat, but given the origin and NT and the similarities of some techs it is not surprising. MS-DOS support was way more a low level and VM thing and the bulk of it not that much different from the Dosemu approach.<p>The classical NT subsys was more of a userspace thing than a kernel space one. And Linux is already way more userspace neutral than the NT kernel is, anyway. You could do a Win compat userspace on top of the Linux syscall if you wanted. Of course it is heavily inspired by Posix, but NT syscall are heavily mapped to Win32.')
