Compare the best text generator models from 10 years ago with GPT-3. Now do the same for image generators. Now project these improvements 20 years into the future. The amount of investment this work is getting grows with every such breakthrough. It seems likely to me we will figure out general-purpose human-level AI in a few decades.<p>And what then? There are so many ways this could turn into a dystopian future.<p>Imagine for example huge mostly-ML operated drone armies, tens of millions strong, that only need a small number of humans to supervise them. Terrified yet? What happens to democracy when power doesn&#x27;t need to flow through a large number of people? When a dozen people and a few million armed drones can oppress a hundred million people?<p>If there&#x27;s even a 5% chance of such an outcome (personally I think it&#x27;s higher), then we should be taking it seriously.')
