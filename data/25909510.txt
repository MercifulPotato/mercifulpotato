I dated a younger girl recently who worked hard every week while also finishing her university courses. She prided herself on being a hard worker and assumes I work hard too since I make a lot of money. But the truth is I can make what she makes in a week by selling a couple option contracts while on my phone taking a dump. To me it pretty much feels like sheâ€™s a slave. All that youth being wasted chasing small amounts of money.<p>Of course, I would never want to give up my income stream just to feel better.')
