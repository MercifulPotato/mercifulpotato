A couple movies with friends, but I can count those on one hand. I don&#x27;t really miss it. Some friends find t weird and try to push recommendations still, and I thank them and tell them I&#x27;ll put it on the list. Then I promptly forget what they talked about, but they seem to have been satisfied with this. No harm done, right?<p>On the other hand, they seem to be all about audio books while I tell them they are not the same as sitting down with a real one. They tell me they don&#x27;t have time for books, and listening to them while working our, jogging, cycling is how they &#x27;read&#x27;. I don&#x27;t think they are getting the same thing out of it that I do actually reading the physical book in a single tasking way, but then again, I shouldn&#x27;t be bothered by other people&#x27;s habits.')
