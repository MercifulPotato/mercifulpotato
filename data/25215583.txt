In theory, it sounds like a plan to fix your supposedly inadequate performance. In practice, like 99% of the time it means somebody decided to fire you for some reason before you have even seen the first one, and they&#x27;re just creating documentation for why they fired you to head off HR requirements and any future complaints. They&#x27;ll run you through a few rounds of supposedly evaluating your improvements as inadequate and eventually fire you, unless you quit first.')
