Creative Cloud has no business installing itself as root.<p>I realize that&#x27;s probably not feasible if you e.g. need Creative Cloud professionally, and that&#x27;s a perfectly valid reason to leave SIP on, if applicable. Although Adobe and similar vendors still need to be yelled at.<p>I think SIP—like Gatekeeper—is a <i>great</i> default setting for novices, who <i>should</i> trust Apple over themselves. But if you&#x27;re a power user, turning off SIP is not going to spell disaster. It leaves you with equivalent security to most Linux distros like Debian.<p>More importantly, there&#x27;s no way to have a feature like SIP while also granting users full control. I get really frustrated when I see people say they&#x27;re switching to Linux because macOS is too locked down. If you want to switch to Linux, that&#x27;s wonderful, Linux is great! But if you otherwise prefer macOS, just go ahead and open it up for yourself.')
