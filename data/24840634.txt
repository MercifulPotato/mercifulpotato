It&#x27;s easy to accidentally go out of bounds on stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve arguably got a lot more experience doing scientific programming in c++ and FORTAN, than I do in python. Yet for quick prototyping where performance is almost never an issue, I still elect to use python because it lets me wrap my head around the problem faster.  I spend less time fixing stupid errors and thinking about coding and more problem thinking about the problem I really need to solve.<p>Julia might be even better, I&#x27;ve heard good things, I&#x27;ve just never used it though.  In the scientific computing and data science world that I deal with, I&#x27;d say at least 95% of the time there&#x27;s never a need to jump from a hacked together prototype to a more production level product.')
