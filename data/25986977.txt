My parents only got me a cell-phone with a pre-paid SIM for &quot;emergencies&quot; and didn&#x27;t have enough credit on it to text too many people so IM over yahoo! messenger on the PC was used by teens for chatting at the time.<p>Growing up in Eastern Europe with a basic cell-phone plan, before the days of all you can talk&#x2F;text, it was common to &quot;beep&quot;[1] people when you were on a prepaid SIM and had little or no credit on it.<p>[1]Calling someone and quickly hanging up after hearing the phone &quot;ring&quot; or &quot;beep&quot;, and hope the person on the other end heard it and cares enough about you to spend their dime calling you back. It was also a sign of stinginess&#x2F;poverty if you did this but it was very popular due to the high cost and low wages at the time.')
