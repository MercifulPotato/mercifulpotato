That makes is rather hard to convince people to switch.<p>So yeah, pretty damn close to critical infrastructure.  I&#x27;m still going to delete my account and see what happens, but unlike the siblings here I can&#x27;t disagree with parent, at least for Brazil.<p>[Edit] When I delete my account I&#x27;m going to lose old conversations, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore because I already recently lost them once when I switched from Android to iOS... WhatsApp has no way of keeping your history in that case.  And otherwise there&#x27;s really no friction to deleting an account, since you can always recreate it.')
