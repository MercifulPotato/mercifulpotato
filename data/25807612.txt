I can&#x27;t see the utility of disabling all images, but that extension was nice because you could use it to remove things you were tired of seeing like obnoxious backgrounds, avatar photos, and even some ads.  Once you right-clicked on an image and told it to remove it, you&#x27;d never see it again, even in subsequent browsing sessions.<p>This extension died during one of Firefox&#x27;s periodic Purges of Useful Functionality(tm), and I&#x27;ve been looking for another one ever since.  So to some extent I see where you&#x27;re coming from, but a general jihad against sound and images in the browser seems pretty radical.')
