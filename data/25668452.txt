And indeed, investigations revealed that a number of the worst instances of vandalism were in fact instigated or committed by undercover police officers or members of the right wing, including the head of the Proud Boys (and he has admitted as much in public interviews). (The BLM bears some blame for organizing events knowing that non-protestors would use their protests as cover for committing unrelated crimes. The LA organizer admits that they deliberately disregarded this risk.)<p>Today, the <i>protestors themselves</i> were engaged in the acts of violence with the stated intention of intimidating legislators into disregarding their statutory duties. Several of the people breaking into the Capitol building organized the protest, and at least two of them are far-right-wing legislators and members of right-wing terrorist groups like the Proud Boys. The female protestor shot and killed today was shot in the act of attempting to break into the legislative chambers and her social media reveals extremist views supporting violence against legislators, which strongly suggests her plan, had she succeeded, would have involved threats of violence to intimidate the legislators trapped in the building.<p>The violence today was so different from the BLM protests that 3 White House staffers resigned, almost all of the Republican senators walked back their electoral objections and spent their time during the debate excoriating the President, and <i>Republican leadership</i> and cabinet members have openly begun planning to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president before his term expires in 14 days because of the danger they think he will attempt to inflict in the next 2 weeks.')
