And it&#x27;s definitely more useful to consider terms like &quot;IO bound&quot; and &quot;CPU bound&quot; as relative and approximate, rather than unattainable absolutes.<p>Using the original numbers of 5 seconds IO, 1 second CPU: If doubling the speed of the CPU portion only makes the overall process 8% faster, it&#x27;s not meaningfully CPU bound. But doubling the IO speed would reduce the total job time by 41%, which <i>is</i> a pretty big speedup overall.<p>Using your example of 5 seconds IO and 0.05 seconds CPU: doubling the CPU speed gives a 0.5% overall reduction in job time, and doubling the IO performance gives a 49.5% overall reduction. So this example can be meaningfully said to be <i>more</i> IO bound than the first example.')
