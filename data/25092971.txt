My father works in a labor field. I think he has to pay something like $7 an hour in insurance apart from an hourly salary. His field is full of undocumented workers whose employers don’t pay this insurance (it’s all cash).<p>When undocumented laborers are hurt or injured, local hospitals pay for medical care for undocumented individuals. So they don’t really need insurance anyway.<p>In that way my father can’t really compete with foreign labor. How we reconcile with this is a good question.')
