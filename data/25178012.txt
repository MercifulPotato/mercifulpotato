There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;experts&quot; saying different things. Also getting actual science on this is really hard as you need to do an ethical study on this in a controlled environment.<p>What we do know is that China is owning this pandemic in every possible way. Life is already back to normal in that country. They also all wear masks. Whether the masks were effective is unknown.<p>So basically we know that something or multiple things that China did are effective at suppressing the spread of Covid. If one of the things they did included using masks... then it may be that masks are very effective or partially effective in conjunction with everything else china did to stop the disease.<p>Keep in mind there&#x27;s no hard science on any of this. Nobody knows for sure. We just know China did many things to suppress the disease but we don&#x27;t know which thing or which subset of things China did was actually effective at curtailing the disease.<p>But we do know by copying everything China is doing we will for sure his that subset of effective countermeasures.<p>If they wear masks in China... we should be wearing masks too.')
