If you find yourself not doing your best, then choose not to do it. If you can&#x27;t choose not to do it, that means this is essential, and so go see #1 again. Do your best.<p>I think of it from the same perspective of business. Instead of doing OK support do your BEST support. If you are struggling, then choose to do no support - if your customers leave because support is critical, then guess what, you will probably get more benefit from doing your best.<p>So I think that advice works well as a way to really minimize your engagements, and figure out which ones are essential, by not just doing them just cause, by trying to cancel them entirely otherwise.')
