Some of it might have been shown when I was a student (Java), and other things are just requirements of the times (I want to try making a mobile app -&gt; either web or native languages). Didn&#x27;t see .NET at university, and early jobs didn&#x27;t involve that, so now it feels like a missed train somehow.<p>Is it worth focusing on when you&#x27;re not already living in that ecosystem and you&#x27;re on your own?')
