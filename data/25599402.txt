They use the same tactics against anarchists and anti-authoritarians, or really any threat to institutional power.<p>An obvious recent example on the other side being their campaign against Trump, e.g. Steele Dossier, and the apparently true Hunter Biden story being derided as &quot;Russian disinformation&quot; by &quot;intelligence sources&quot; in the run up to the election. Because Trump, for all his faults, was one of the most prominent threats to institutional power in recent history. And Trump sucks, let&#x27;s be clear about that, but it&#x27;s the same dynamic and it&#x27;s important to see it for what it is even when it&#x27;s being deployed against someone you don&#x27;t like.')
