It has to solve the problem of end-to-end encryption in a way that users can manage to not lose their keys too easily, which is a hard problem. It only has to solve this, when email did not (at least in an easily usable way for most people) because it already exists in messaging, but that doesn&#x27;t stop it not being well solved holding back the situation.<p>Anything that uses an open source client is a meaningful step better than WhatsApp, because it is easier to make and maintain a bridge from something better, like Matrix, IMHO. At least recently, I did not think Matrix was easy enough to use and stable enough to recomend to people, but them moving to something with an open source client, is better than nothing IMHO.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced Signal is better than Telegram, as an alternative, since Telegram is so much easier to use if you don&#x27;t care about end-to-end encryption (most users don&#x27;t sadly), and basically as easy to use (but much less trustworthy) if you do. I&#x27;m not sure which is better TBH, but I expect more people will stay off WhatsApp if they try Telegram than if they only try Signal, which is an advantage of recomending that (though I&#x27;m not sure it out-weighs the advantage of there being less end-to-end encryption).')
