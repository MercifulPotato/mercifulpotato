It took it to adopt capitalist real estate model to get where it is now, and even today, Beijing has no viable recipe how to house 60% of population that got to stay behind in the industrialisation drive.<p>The bling-bling Chinese 1st tier cities most Westerners get to see only represent how 5% of China population live, and even they get to house most of its citizens in rather gloomy &quot;bedroom district&quot; type suburbs which most outsiders lauding &quot;Chinese housing model&quot; never see.<p>The quality of housing in China drops with inverse square root of a distance from nearest 1st tier city, and from downtown to suburb.<p>&gt; Why haven&#x27;t we better stardized housing, education, and food to scale?<p>In other words, some most essential living needs are hardest one to scale, and mostly not for physical, but for social, and organisational reasons.')
