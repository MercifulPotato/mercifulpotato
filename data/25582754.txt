One was a salt grinder that had a plastic replacement where it should have been metal and was lacking the lettering but was sold on Amazon from the official page. Somewhere in their system Amazon is accepting product that isn&#x27;t official and happily selling it under than companies brand. If it was a one off I might agree it was a mistake but that has happened three times this year and while Amazon replaces them it is clearly happening commonly now.<p>Amazon has lost my trust this year, when my prime runs out I wont be renewing.')
