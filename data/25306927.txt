As it is, very few people are stupid enough to buy a &quot;textbook&quot; that comes with auto-self-destruct DRM that renders it unusable at the end of the semester.<p>Of course many college kids are just kids fresh out of highschool with no financial skills or haggling skills so I guess I take back what I said about there not being enough dumb-dumbs to fuel a market for DRM &quot;textbooks&quot;. People do still take out loans to finance their English major, after all.')
