This is the point that seems so blatantly missed.<p>Increasing taxes shouldn&#x27;t be the one jerk reaction because there is scant evidence that governments are remotely effective at using the money we already give them hand over fist.

Instead we&#x27;ll handed money out to people who will many times buy the next Samsung, Apple Amazon whatever feeding the big corps that everyone here loves to hate.<p>It&#x27;s so obvious that this is what happens that i can&#x27;t understand how so many can be wilfully blind to it.')
