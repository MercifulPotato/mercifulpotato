But then, randomly, they might accept one for which they could get caught?<p>How about just don&#x27;t take bribes? Seriously.<p>I really enjoyed reading this however, I wish there was more real data to analyze as often, it&#x27;s hard to really ascertain how much of these things are really true or just things that even people with experience and insight happen to believe.')
