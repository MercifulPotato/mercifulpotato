So they deprecate a product, and expect people to wait for an announcement that may or may not work for them? Who is making these decisions???<p>Why on earth not announce the free RHEL offering now. Or wait until those details are ready to deprecate CentOS 8.<p>It sounds like some CentOS users might be able to migrate to some free version of RHEL, but it&#x27;s unclear how restricted that free version will be. Probably good for home users, but how about medium or large businesses? And then, why should anyone even use a restricted RHEL when Rocky will be full RHEL for free.')
