My impact is low enough as it is.</i><p>Could be lower. That stuff you spend your money on, it has a lot of embodied energy in it. Shame to have it manufactured when you could reuse it from someone who doesn&#x27;t need it anymore. Shame to throw it away if someone else could make use of it.<p>Out of ways to be more environmentally friendly, this is one of the most low-effort, high-impact ones.')
