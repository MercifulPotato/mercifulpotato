That said... the locals dislike everyone who isn&#x27;t local, and the city attracts people in many different areas and not just Tech.<p>Austin is huge and there is no shortage of land and no pesky regulations (or at least less of them) that it can continue to support the influx for quite a while now. I don&#x27;t expect it to be the next SV until we see a few Austin-incubated startups really make it big and hopefully kickstart its own substantial startup ecosystem.')
