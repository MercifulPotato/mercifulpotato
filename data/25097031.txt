The features are all great, now &quot;all&quot; that&#x27;s needed is to make them work. We had jankiness like keying problems, messages that wouldn&#x27;t send or receive, and general problems that made it not &quot;just work&quot;.<p>My personal pet peeve is that I have no idea what the difference is between &quot;people&quot; and &quot;rooms&quot;, and why when I try to talk to a friend our chat is sometimes in one and sometimes in the other. Maybe you&#x27;d like to take a page out of the Telegram&#x2F;Whatsapp book and not distinguish between the two, since they&#x27;re all chats, they just sometimes have two people and sometimes more.<p>Best of luck, I&#x27;m really hoping to switch to Element for all my chats one day!')
