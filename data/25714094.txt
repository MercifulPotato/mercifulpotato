The appetite for compromise seems to be at an unhealthy nadir.<p>I understand that, when you think you are right and the other side is wrong or even evil, it can be difficult to want to compromise.<p>People are quick to cite polarization as the source, and yes, sure; but what causes and has caused this polarization? It&#x27;s not like the world was never polarized before.<p>If the general decline in violence is true, such as claimed by e.g. Pinker (Better Angels etc), then maybe we are not actually more polarized than ever before? But the evidence seems conflicting at best.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t have any answers.')
