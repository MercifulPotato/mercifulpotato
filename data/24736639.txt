I wasn&#x27;t thinking of developing complex textual formats that need to be parsed as input to a CLI program, I was thinking more like simple flags like `--do-operation=value` as opposed to a button in a GUI doing the same thing. If you have a function you want to call named foo() it should be pretty easy to just look for a `--foo` flag and run it. The problem becomes trickier if you have to parse some inputs from text. However, most CLIs I&#x27;ve seen for third party services use mostly simple flags, each of which corresponds to some simple operation. They may take an arg or two (e.g. `cli-client --foo 34 --title &quot;Hello&quot;`). If there is a more or less one-to-one mapping between functions and CLI flags, then it should be pretty easy to test. Testing a full-on parser for complex CLI commands is definitely harder, though.')
