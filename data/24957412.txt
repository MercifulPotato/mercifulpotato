The long-standing conventions of how web sites work are mostly irrelevant to fancy web apps, and to the extent that they <i>are</i> relevant, web apps break them left and right. Just look at how many web sites&#x2F;apps hijack or break scrolling or the back button or the ability to middle-click on a link and get a new tab or the ability to <i>highlight text</i>. Web apps are <i>all about</i> breaking the usability standards for web <i>sites</i> and replacing them with a bastardized version of the usability conventions from various native OS toolkits. But in spite of that, nobody ever really expects drag and drop or rich copy and paste or any other data exchange mechanism to work between web apps.')
