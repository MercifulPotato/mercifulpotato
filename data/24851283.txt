If it really is random, there will be outliers by luck.  But not just some - <i>all</i> investors would eventually gravitate towards the overall trend of the market with enough time (again, assuming you can&#x27;t beat the market).<p>So yeah, until I make a falsifiable model it&#x27;s just intellectual masturbation.')
