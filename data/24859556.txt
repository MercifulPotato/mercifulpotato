If this is a day in day out experience perhaps a &#x27;pattern interupt&#x27; is a good thing.<p>I don&#x27;t really agree with the rest of your post, but this i do think is probably the best usage of hallucinogens as far as therapy goes. I don&#x27;t really think microdosing is the way to go about it. In my experience, that &#x27;big reset&#x27; to harmful thoughts and patterns of actions is the primary benefit to theraputic hallucinogen use.<p>I liken it to when you&#x27;ve got like 50 apps open on a desktop, a few with memory leaks, CPU&#x27;s running hard all cores, memory usage is at 100%, swap&#x27;s totally used.<p>So you reset, everything shuts down and restarts, all that&#x27;s running are the system init processes and memory&#x27;s cleared and ready to go.<p>I don&#x27;t really feel like microdosing is the best way to go about this and i&#x27;m not even sure if LSD is a very good drug for that. I&#x27;ve never really had any introspective experiences with LSD. They&#x27;ve just been kind of shallow and fun. Psilocybin on the hand gave me far more of a theraputic trip with one high dose. I tried the microdosing thing. It just made feel like I was stoned all the time.')
