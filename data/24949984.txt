I had no idea. I remember seeing a movie long ago [1] but not its story. It was either about them or the turkish mafia.<p>I&#x27;m glad that we had this process of coming to terms with our past here in Germany [2]. While not everything is rosy for sure, we are basically aware of our past while not being overly affected by it anymore in the sense that old grudges or unsolved conflicts would still exist. It must have been not easy for earlier generations here at all and it is still a recurring topic in history classes in german schools but I think we are in a good place in this regard now.<p>Must suck to never have dealt with the past (think: Armenian Genocide [3], look for &quot;Turkey denies that the word genocide is an accurate term for these crimes&quot;) and have that stuck in your society.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grey_Wolves_(organization)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grey_Wolves_(organization)</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Empire_of_the_Wolves" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Empire_of_the_Wolves</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vergangenheitsbew%C3%A4ltigung" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vergangenheitsbew%C3%A4ltigung</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Armenian_Genocide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Armenian_Genocide</a>')
