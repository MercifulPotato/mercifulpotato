Some of the earliest subsidy recipients are now passing that period, so they invented new schemes which are to the effect the same except for &quot;go to technology park A, or factory park B.&quot;<p>Given this is an <i>income</i> tax, companies don&#x27;t benefit much themselves if they are working on low margins, but it helps to lure in more companies who got themselves into stockmarket play.<p>As it is China, another factor is that company owner who is a sole shareholder&#x2F;board head&#x2F;CEO would&#x27;ve been taxed to oblivion if he were to simply give himself a giant salary to extract profits (60%-70%.)<p>When it all began, dividends were completely tax free, and there were no capital gains tax. Now they aren&#x27;t, but the policy somehow continues to drive on the same rails.')
