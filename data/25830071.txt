Burr killing Hamilton had no effect on the outcome of the election, which was already over and decided.  Also, Hamilton agreed to the duel.<p>Trump incited the mob to attack people he saw as opponents, which included Mike Pence.  He spoke of saving the country from a rigged election, which heavily implies changing the results of the election.  And I really doubt the politicians hiding in rooms behind armed security had agreed to dueling an angry mob.')
