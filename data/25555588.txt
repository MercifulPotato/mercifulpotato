Savings accounts, CDs, and money markets - even high-yield online ones like Ally and Goldman Sachs - pay zero interest or close to it. Simultaneously the government has printed an absolutely incredible amount of money this year that has almost exclusively gone to the wealthy. This is because the fed is buying treasuries &#x2F; corporate junk bonds and backstopping our entire economy while the actual economy has shrank maybe 10%. A tiny amount of the printed money is airdropped to citizens with direct checks or extended unemployment but this is a tiny amount that is primarily to buy off the commoners so they don’t complain about the enormous wealth transfer happening right now.<p>What this means is scarce financial assets are going to go up, and up, and up. Every person who doesn’t want to lose money needs to become a risk manager and start investing because there is no other option.')
