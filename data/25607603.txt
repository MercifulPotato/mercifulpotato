There&#x27;s a lot of applauding people throwing healthier aspects of their lives away for game addiction on places like reddit or facebook. The story of the addict ignoring his kids, jobs, health, etc almost never gets out. It did briefly for WoW when &quot;warcraft wives&quot; made a fuss, but that died out, I imagine who no small PR effort from Blizzard, and now game addiction is rarely talked about, which is odd, considering so many mobile games are pretty much casinos.')
