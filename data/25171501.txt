But maybe consider that &quot;taking advantage of HTTP&quot; != &quot;REST&quot;.<p>&gt; PostgREST is REST.<p>The primary if not sole distinction of a REST system according to the creator of the concept is hyperlinking. From what I understand of postgrest, hyperlinking is nonexistent.<p>&gt; For example URLs map to resources<p>Which doesn&#x27;t really matter when these URLs are magic strings. It&#x27;s also not really true, URLs are a mix of procedures (&#x2F;tsearch, literally everything below &#x2F;rpc) and function names, really, to be passed a bundle of parameters through query strings.<p>And the project itself recommends using stored procedures (and views) when exposing the system to any sort of untrusted environments.<p>&gt; it uses HTTP verbs<p>Not actually relevant to REST, and serving as little more than a form of namespacing.')
