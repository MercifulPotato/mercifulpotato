And it&#x27;s a gulf that seeks almost impossible to bridge, any time soon at least - it encompasses race, education, financial status, social class, even history.<p>Trump&#x27;s actions this week have been utterly shameful. He and his cronies have lied and lied in an organised effort to sow discontent among the huge segment of republicans that appear to believe their every word (regardless of how baseless or ridiculous they may be).<p>It seems like such a blatant attempt to subvert democracy - the kind of thing we&#x27;d expect in a tinpot dictatorship, not the &quot;land of the free&quot;. This is not only shameful, but downright <i>dangerous</i>, especially with the level of gun ownership in the US.<p>As a European, it seemed utterly incomprehensible how he has been able to get away with his actions, inactions and lies over the past few years - and I have not the words to describe how incomprehensible it is that many of his supporters are behind the past week&#x27;s events.')
