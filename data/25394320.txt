Unfortunately, science and medicine are fields that are largely driven by money. Laboratories don&#x27;t really care about a vaccine for a disease in Africa that nobody will be able to afford or invest in. They will turn to better markets. There are multiple reasons, the most obvious one is that they&#x27;re private companies, their goal is to make profit. The second one is that it&#x27;s a field that requires a lot of resources. So you need a big ROI.<p>One of the reasons the vaccine for COVID-19 was produced so quickly is not because of some sort of conspiracy, like they had the antidote all along or something. It&#x27;s just that when there&#x27;s a real buck to make, it becomes a race between these big pockets companies.<p>That&#x27;s one side of it and I don&#x27;t know enough to cover every aspect of it. Also, it&#x27;s just my opinion of course and how I see this.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m doubtful about a zombie vaccine being given for free. Most likely in a Walking Dead type scenario, where the economy would completely go down, there wouldn&#x27;t be any financial incentive to keep the searches going, and no money to back up the researches either. So we&#x27;d be scr*wed I think. :o)')
