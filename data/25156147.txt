Change yourself, leave me my technical language I’ve been using for decades, please. \nAlso a fun part of it is that in my (non-english speaking) country the terms master&#x2F;slave are being used in their technical meaning only (as loan words). Why do we need to change our technical language and adjust to the concept of guilt that is completely foreign to us? I find this offensive.')
