The legal system isn’t for that. Constitutional rights should never be able to be removed.<p>Can you imagine if we allowed someone’s entire right to the courts be removed? In that instance, you wouldn’t even be able to <i>challenge</i> your lack of rights. <i>That’s not right.</i> But by advocating for no access to the courts in one instance, there <i>will</i> be people advocating for more. So we draw the line somewhere and say your right to the courts <i>can’t</i> be taken away.<p>I’m also ignoring how <i>you’re</i> ignoring the actual reality of the Prenda scandal. It wasn’t over copyright infringements lawsuits. It was about <i>lying to the court</i>. Sure, they filed frivolous lawsuits, but that wasn’t why they were arrested.')
