This model of distribution doesn&#x27;t really make much sense for distributing Haskell binaries, though.<p>There&#x27;s a few reasons for this: 1) since most people don&#x27;t have many Haskell binaries and the few that people use don&#x27;t share many libraries, 2) Haskell packages are normally statically linked when building executables.<p>If linux maintainers would simply build&#x2F;ship pandoc as a single static executable all these issues disappear.')
