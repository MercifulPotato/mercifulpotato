That would fit your second scenario: &quot;an engineer who agrees who by luck or skill gains extraordinary power, implements this new power structure&quot;.  I think we have seen cases of engineer founders who were in a position to do that kind of thing.<p>The blog post links to a story about Larry Page &quot;firing&quot; all the project managers; while they didn&#x27;t exit the company, they were moved to another organization, and it seems Page got his wish of &quot;no managers&quot; in his organization for some time, until there were problems and complaints and &quot;eventually&quot; they started hiring more managers.  If he had a fully workable approach in mind, it seems he could have implemented it for long enough to demonstrate its success.')
