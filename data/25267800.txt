Last I looked into it AWS&#x27; SAM tooling for running locally actually worked by using third-party docker images that were somehow built by ripping the file system from Lambda, and hooking your code up as a volume (and optionally adding layers as volumes) and then pointing `aws lambda invoke` commands at it.
