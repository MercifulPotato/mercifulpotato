It was an intensely unpleasant experience; you&#x27;re trying to vomit for most of the time the cable is there.<p>Anesthesia was not even recommended, but they really wanted me to take something that would inhibit memory formation. I asked if people who took the drug struggled or retched any less. &quot;No.&quot; (I declined to take it.)<p>This is also how women were drugged for childbirth in the mid-20th century. No anesthesia, but memory inhibitors so they couldn&#x27;t remember what had happened. That was eventually &quot;discovered&quot; by the press and became a huge scandal.
