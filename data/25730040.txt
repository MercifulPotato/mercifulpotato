Renewable gas accounts for about, at best, 10% of gas consumed in a year. As in, that&#x27;s about as much renewable gas we could make. And it&#x27;s not exactly an instantaneous process, so we would still be wasting energy. The best existing solution is storing that energy as water that we would pump up a basin, to be released later and used in a dam. That would work, if we did not need to flood areas where major cities are to make it work.')
