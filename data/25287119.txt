Nobody talks about alternatives to the NHS in the UK, even though it&#x27;s an obvious topic that should be talked about all the time (the UK&#x27;s a highly visible exception to the consensus of other rich countries and that would normally provoke debate). You don&#x27;t actually know what the alternatives to the NHS are because any attempt to be honest about the system&#x27;s problems are immediately met with a horde of leftists yelling things like &quot;Tory propaganda&quot;, and insisting that anyone who criticises the NHS inexplicably hates nurses&#x2F;babies&#x2F;life saving operations, etc. They successfully shut down political debate every time.<p>It&#x27;s entirely plausible that if there was a serious, honest and rational debate in the UK about healthcare then the country would move towards a European system. Why not? The UK aligns with European neighbours far more often than it does with the USA and that will likely continue even after Brexit.<p>Re: Bupa. Aren&#x27;t you agreeing with me here, then? The private healthcare sector in the UK is anaemic compared to other countries because it&#x27;s so hard to compete against &quot;free&quot;. They end up trying to offer slightly better quality around the edges. They can offer complicated or expensive operations too, but people are already being forced to pay the government for them regardless of their own personal evaluation of quality or need, so hardly any market exists. Bupa is a minnow compared to its equivalents in the rest of the world, and how many competitors to Bupa can you name? The British healthcare market exists forgotten in the shadows because the NHS drowns it.<p><i>[Unpleasant facts] Unsourced Tory propaganda.</i><p>This is what I mean. It&#x27;s not propaganda, it&#x27;s actual reality that Labour and leftists live in denial of. Literally the first result for [nhs maintenance backlogs] is this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kingsfund.org.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;ERIC-data-nhs-estate#:~:text=The%20latest%20data%2C%20published%20today,staff%20(see%20Figure%201)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kingsfund.org.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;ERIC-data-nhs-esta...</a>.<p><i>&quot;In 2018&#x2F;19, the total cost of tackling the backlog of maintenance issues in NHS trusts rose by 8.4 per cent to £6.5 billion. And of this over half, £3.4 billion, was for issues that present a high or significant risk to patients and staff (see Figure 1). Now, if these numbers don’t quicken the pulse, a little more context is needed. High-risk issues are identified where repairing or replacing NHS facilities or equipment ‘must be addressed with urgent priority in order to prevent catastrophic failure, major disruption to clinical services or deficiencies in safety liable to cause serious injury and&#x2F;or prosecution’&quot;</i><p>Or you can read about it direct from Parliament (see section 2):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;committees.parliament.uk&#x2F;publications&#x2F;1779&#x2F;documents&#x2F;17455&#x2F;default&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;committees.parliament.uk&#x2F;publications&#x2F;1779&#x2F;documents...</a><p>Note that this backlog is just to restore physical objects to an &quot;acceptable state&quot; (quoting the Parliament document here). It&#x27;s not to actually make the NHS better than it used to be, just the cost to stop it being so degraded it&#x27;s actually dangerous: <i>&quot;One director of an NHS trust told me that broken gutters in his hospital lead to water seeping through the walls when it rains heavily. This happens so frequently that nurses now give ‘water updates’ in their shift handovers, so incoming team members know when they will have to start unplugging electrical equipment&quot;</i>.<p>That was the backlog <i>before</i> an epidemic of bad data and advice from government run bureaucracies destroyed the economy that has to pay for it. The government no longer has any financial strength left to tackle this issue, and risks triggering serious inflation by trying to print its way out.<p>There are many other places you can read about this. The NHS is decaying away because its managers are terminally incapable of making the difficult decisions management requires. Given a choice between paying down their maintenance backlog or giving nurses a pay rise, they do the latter every single time even when commanded by ministers not to. Sometimes they even fail to spend the money they were given and end up with a &quot;surplus&quot;, just through managerial incompetence.<p>That&#x27;s not &quot;Tory propaganda&quot;. It&#x27;s reality, and exactly how the Soviet union looked at the end of its days.')
