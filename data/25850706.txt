Otherwise most of the users there are also users of Twitter and Facebook, where they go to get radicalized and pick up nonsense conspiracy theories and vitriol which they then bring everywhere they go.<p>Also, you&#x27;re wrong and most parts of the Fediverse are already much less toxic than most of Twitter.<p>And notice that you would otherwise expect the opposite of this if the major platforms are booting off any significant number of actual asshats for legitimate reasons, who then move to invade any alternatives. The relative success with which most decentralized alternatives have fended off this onslaught is a  very good sign.')
