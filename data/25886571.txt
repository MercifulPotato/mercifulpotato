If they were armed, they were not armed lawfully either in DC as a whole or in the Capitol specifically. Therefore, we have to ask: were they armed?<p>Regardless, this line is scary at first glance: <i>&quot;All members are in the tunnels under capital seal them in. Turn on gas.&quot;</i> but I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what it means.<p>I worked on the Hill for years and used some of the tunnels frequently. If they mean the &quot;tunnels&quot; in general, they&#x27;re huge and expansive so it&#x27;d take a huge amount of effort across numerous entry points in almost a dozen buildings to &quot;seal them in.&quot;<p>Alternatively, if they mean one of the secure areas (think: bunkers), they&#x27;re <i>designed</i> to be buttoned up but &quot;turn on gas&quot; still doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Regardless, thanks for the link. It will be interesting to see how the trials play out.')
