But that was not the topic.<p>A discipline of single-writer  is as easily composed in C++, and, encapsulated in a library, as easily maintained. Nothing about Rust makes this unavailable in C++. The library itself, then, becomes responsible for maintaining the discipline, not the compiler. But once encoded there, it is done.<p>Rust&#x27;s compiler provides safety advantages, but there is no need to exaggerate them. (Exaggeration is a liability to your language community.)')
