I think the general consensus is that YouTube tries to stay on MPAA&#x27;s and RIAA&#x27;s good side to keep them from lobbying for stricter laws. As long as it&#x27;s easier to talk to YouTube than to write a new law everyone profits (except the independent content creators).<p>Paid porn doesn&#x27;t have a strong lobby, so there is no similar pressure on PornHub&#x2F;MindGeek.')
