More recently, there&#x27;s been a trend towards specialization in the framing hammer alone. 100 years ago most hammers looked like the classic hammers I remember from childhood: relatively small, sharply curved claws, a smooth face. As production framing exploded in the US after WWII, framers were pushing for more efficiency.<p>The framing hammer got heavier with a longer handle, broader face, straighter claw, and waffled face better for gripping nails (also why most loose framing nails have a cross-hatched pattern: so they can mate with the hammer face). From there, materials science really kicked in, and we saw steel-handled models, followed by fiberglass and other composite handles.<p>The latest developments (that I&#x27;m aware of) are products like the Stiletto (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stiletto.com&#x2F;p-80-ti-bone-iii-hammer-with-milled-face-and-18in-curved-handle.aspx" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stiletto.com&#x2F;p-80-ti-bone-iii-hammer-with-milled-...</a>), which leverage materials like titanium to reduce weight while maintaining driving power, and include a replaceable steel face to prolong hammer life and allow using different faces for different applications.<p>Modern hammers with advanced material properties and functions can cost hundreds of dollars, but deliver much higher efficiency with less fatigue and a longer life. I compare that with the Sears hammer in my grandfather&#x27;s garage and see a whole new generation of evolution.<p>There&#x27;s a great article about hammer history at Fine Homebuilding: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finehomebuilding.com&#x2F;project-guides&#x2F;framing&#x2F;hammered-the-history-of-hammer-design" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finehomebuilding.com&#x2F;project-guides&#x2F;framing&#x2F;hamm...</a><p>edited: Fix link formatting.')
