It would fall into musical ruts and just repeat the same handful of songs forever. It wouldn&#x27;t work to thumbs-down those songs because I did like them, but I also wanted to hear new recommendations.<p>Spotify by comparison will also often recycle stuff I&#x27;ve already heard, but there&#x27;s still always some new stuff in their weekly recommendations. Sometimes it&#x27;s a hit, sometimes not, but at least it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t heard before.')
