It isn&#x27;t just a niggling little thing, and it isn&#x27;t &quot;dismissal&quot; to put something into perspective.<p>The world&#x27;s economies have thrown <i>tens of trillions of dollars into the response to Covid</i> (not to mention the incalculable follow-on costs in terms of mental health, missed diagnoses and the like), and nary a thought was given to what the side-effects of that response might be, or whether those resources might have been better spent elsewhere. We just did it, and it turns out that the disease will have an impact on par with something else that we spend drastically less money on in any given year.<p>If you literally <i>cannot fathom</i> why a cost&#x2F;benefit calculation might be appropriate here, you have lost perspective, and the OP&#x27;s point is well-taken.')
