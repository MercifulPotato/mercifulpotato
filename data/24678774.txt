Then when I was a student, in 1995, I installed Linux for the free X server (free as in beer as I had not a lot of money), to be able to display softwares running on Unix machines on my PC.<p>In 2004, I created the Kaella Linux, a live-CD distribution based in Knoppix (a Debian-based distro). I maintained it during 3 years. The goal was 2 folds: learn how a Linux distro worked, especially a live one, and make Linux more popular among people not familiar with English, as the Kaella was basically a French version of the Knoppix (with added bonuses such as automatic scripts for ADSL modems which were a pain in the a*s to use at the time).<p>I am now working in industrial cybersecurity, I still have Linux at home though ;-)')
