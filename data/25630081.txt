I tried to make a new one about a year ago and could not do it without phone verification.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll let you sign up without a phone number via Tor or something though.<p>It&#x27;s not just Facebook that requires a phone verification now, I can&#x27;t even make a Google or Yahoo Japan account without it. At least on these services you can &quot;reuse&quot; previously used numbers by unlinking them, at least a few times. But services like Discord lets you verify with each number once and only once as far as I know.<p>On the one hand I get that there&#x27;s a room for abuse by spams, but on the other hand, I really wish I could freely sign up to services.')
