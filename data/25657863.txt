It is perhaps the worst health care in the country, particularly if you get sick as the budget runs out (&quot;don&#x27;t get sick after June&quot; is a documentary on the subject).  If the United States is incapable of providing decent health care for a very small percentage of the population then what chance does it have for the greater population?  I will believe in US universal health care when they can do it right at a small scale.')
