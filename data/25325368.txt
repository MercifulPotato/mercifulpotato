It fits some facts fairly well, modulated microwaves could induce audible frequencies at various points of the head involved in audio perception.<p>As mentioned elsewhere though, signals intelligence at diplomatic posts (see Stateroom and the SCS) would likely have detected at least lower frequency microwave energy. At higher frequencies it is less commonly used for communications and hence less likely to be monitored.<p>Don&#x27;t know why everyone is expecting solid proof here. There&#x27;s a reasonable chance this would have been detected, but we&#x27;re unlikely to know even if it was. Microwaves are still a plausible explanation.')
