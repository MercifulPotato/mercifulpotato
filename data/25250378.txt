It’s easy to get in sunk cost traps, including bad marriages and startups.<p>Life is short. Sometimes (as I learned) you need something new. Sometimes it just doesn’t seem to be working and being a kajillionare isn’t what’s most important in life. Sometimes whatever mission or product isn’t what you prioritize or even believe in anymore.<p>And that can be a good thing!<p>There’s nothing wrong with regularly reevaluating priorities. In fact too many people say they’re being “persistent” when they’re really just on autopilot and never gaining perspective.
