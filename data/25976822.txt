Sensible world governments usually put pressure on deviant administrations elsewhere. Followed by sanctions. As far as I know, India&#x27;s current party is a hate mob re-branded. I saw some videos of the police siding with ruling party rioters running down people belonging to other religions  in the country&#x27;s capital. Shameful.')
