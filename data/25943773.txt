If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.<p>AFAIK, the PATH modification route is no longer recommended. Instead one should use, eg `. miniconda3&#x2F;etc&#x2F;profile.d&#x2F;conda.sh` to add a particular miniconda installaiton to the environment.')
