It&#x27;s always possible that there&#x27;s a compiler bug which only affects one platform but that&#x27;s relatively uncommon. At one point I was supporting Debian on x86, x86_64, MIPS, and PowerPC. The major portability concern was drivers, which is irrelevant for Docker, and sometimes you&#x27;d find performance issues with e.g. OpenSSL having a hand-tuned x86 ASM implementation but relying on the C compiler for another platform but it was rather uncommon.<p>I am skeptical that anyone will notice a problem unless their workflow is to build a container on their laptop and push it straight to production without testing.')
