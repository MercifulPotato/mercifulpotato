Theming was fizzling out by 2005, which starts to correspond to the rise of OS X and Macbooks.<p>I don&#x27;t know man, it&#x27;s what I saw as more and more people came to Ubuntu with Windows Vista flopping, and they came with expectations of a flashy UX and a dynamic growth of the platform. Lots of theming, lots of hopeful mockups and GTK+ struggling to support transparency as theming engines hacked it in, the race to incorporate compositing and having everyone&#x27;s graphics cards actually work.<p>I get it that there was a lull during the transition between GNOME 2 and GNOME 1, many of the myriad themes you found on repos in 2005 were ports of GTK 1.X themes, no more. But the influx of Windows users injected a lot of vitality into the theming scene.<p>&gt; I mean. Did you even read the article you&#x27;re commenting on? Windows 3.11 had themes.
