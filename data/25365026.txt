Companies are paid $0 in most models but it&#x27;s backed by a monetization model that&#x27;s non-zero. Basically, more work == more value == more pay.<p>With proprietary software, developers are still paid ∆V, but companies are paid for V∆t -- value times the duration of usage. While some of this is just compensation for risking investor money, the ultimate model is rent-seeking and lock-in. This is extractive because the company keeps getting paid even when they don&#x27;t add value.<p>You may raise concern that volunteer developers don&#x27;t get compensation, but use that a problem for a voluntary activity? People program as a hobby, to scratch an itch, to develop mastery, to solve a problem they already have, to advance an ideology, or for a chance at recognition&#x2F;popularity. Only that last one is anything near a problem, and it&#x27;s the same boat as first time authors or artists.')
