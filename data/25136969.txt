I wasn&#x27;t trying to say that it was bad or universally hated, and even if it was you&#x27;d find a niche that likes it ;-)<p>It&#x27;s just that it wasn&#x27;t loved by the masses, just like Zune wasn&#x27;t loved by the masses, Windows S-mode isn&#x27;t loved by the masses, and pretty much any Windows-on-ARM effort isn&#x27;t loved by the masses.<p>Regarding YouTube: odd that they wouldn&#x27;t make an app, you&#x27;d think that even with trident support they could at least put a web view in an app or something. You can&#x27;t force a company to maken an app for another company, and with the current media&#x2F;rights laws you can&#x27;t make one yourself either, so not much of a lawsuit there.')
