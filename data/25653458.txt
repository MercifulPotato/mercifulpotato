The omnidirectional transmitter will lose more by not being MIMO than the MIMO system will lose from the interference.<p>MIMO isn&#x27;t expensive these days with the availability of integrated chip sets, and the cost is only dropping.  It will get to the point where apart from broadcasters no one runs a non-MIMO system because the cost of not being MIMO (loss of channel capacity) will exceed the cost of the MIMO hardware.')
