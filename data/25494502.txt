I myself have rarely been paid to code, but still do it in my spare time. So I think I understand what the difference between a job and a hobby is, but at the same time I see how much more productive I get, the closer my work comes to my hobby.<p>Yes, it is important to understand that at work you sometimes have to do things which you aren&#x27;t doing for the immediate fun. But at the same time the closer the hobbies are to the actual work, the more engaged the employee will be. You might think of it as a symbiosis of trying new things as a hobby and bringing the proven things to work while knowing exactly what you are doing.')
