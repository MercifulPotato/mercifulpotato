It&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to find anything when searching on Discord. There are no threads, just channels which easily get thousands of messages per day. Maybe it&#x27;d help if those programming servers had logger bots which would index everything and upload it to a website where one could search it, but it still wouldn&#x27;t solve everything. It feels sad because most of that content is likely going to be lost (it&#x27;s not searchable anyway). IRC isn&#x27;t much better in this aspect, but at least it is a more open protocol and one can easily write a program&#x2F;script to archive the content. Discord on the other hand bans &quot;self-bots&quot; and unofficial clients.<p>Another problem is being unable to continue a thread after some time, but Reddit has the same problem with their &quot;archived&quot; posts. I personally don&#x27;t see much value in &quot;archiving&quot; posts except perhaps lowering mental overhead of the moderators. It&#x27;s frustrating when I almost have the solution to my problem but end up having to open a completely new thread, wait for the right people to notice it and then hope it gets answered in time before it&#x27;s &quot;archived&quot;.<p>Edit: typo')
