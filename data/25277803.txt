Animals can eat things that humans can&#x27;t like grass cellulose. Biology is ridiculously complex and they have no idea what the full list of vitamins, enzymes, minerals, and proteins required to make up a human. Example: Nobody talks about choline or vitamin K. They don&#x27;t know if humans even have the biological machinery to process some of those things. Example: Males convert ALA to EHA and DHA worse than females. Male vegans do worse than female vegans.<p>The only way to make this safe is by testing performance on mice or rats fed lab-grown meat vs. regular meat. Testing needs to be done at a high level(how long did take mice to travel the maze) and not at a low level(for a specific vitamin). Do not let them turn us into their experiment. You will suffer death by a thousand cuts if this food isn&#x27;t good.<p>Regardless, this is pretty cool and very useful if successful but proper tests need to be put in place.')
