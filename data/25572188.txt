From a very high-level viewpoint, the market optimizes to capture disposable income, both through offering new things to buy, and price increases on the old things (the more disposable income you have, the less likely you are to seek out alternatives if something you like becomes more expensive). So, as more and more household became double-income, the market compensated, locking female workforce participation from a choice into a necessity.')
