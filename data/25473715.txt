Withholding opportunities to develop these skills from people denies their need for autonomy and efficacy in their healing.<p>I would ask him if he wants to know of anything simple that can boost his recovery. I would also propose he prepare to mourn many losses immediately after, since there&#x27;s possibly a lot of opportunity for regret when someone learns so much of the things they&#x27;ve done in their lives may have been unnecessary and within their power to heal from. Some people can get stuck in grieving&#x2F;regret and this slows the healing process down, so I consider it important to learn to grieve efficiently for quick healing.')
