There isn&#x27;t an inherent &quot;political&quot; quality sitting in things.<p>That&#x27;s true in a sense (e.g. plate tectonics is not political), but it&#x27;s false you start dealing with things that intersect with human society.  For instance: anything to do with power over others, the makeup of society, or the kind of actions people are allowed, encouraged, or forbidden to do is inherently political.<p>&gt; By analogy, most things in the world are apolitical until quarrelsome people with pet issues show up and make them political.<p>Not really, and that&#x27;s just a pretty typical (political!) ad hominem argument made by people who want to maintain the status quo, whatever that is.  Stated another way, you&#x27;re saying the people who want change are troublemakers who should know their place.')
