Is violent Islam hateful? \nObviously gangs are hateful, Antifa certainly is, etc..<p>Free speech means allowing that which you hate.<p>What bugs me is that someone, with obvious ideology , determine that someone else is wrong and shut it down.  That is against everything that America stands for, against what Internet is, and against what civilized people do.\nThat&#x27;s how you get hate, violence and wars, by having no tolerance for that which you hate.<p>I never been on parlor, and I don&#x27;t care, but I do care that people with agenda, people who are hypocritical ( no action against Antifa, BLM, and other rioters ), are not taken into account.<p>Are they private company? yes, they have a right to do so, but there should be a generic outrcry and NOT praise vs it.')
