It was my first larger open source project. Back then the faculty I was studying in had some really inconvenient timetables for students and I initially made Tablix to show that better scheduling of lectures was possible. It used a parallel evolutionary algorithm and was written in C. Code and everything else is still on-line but it&#x27;s been abandoned for a long time.<p>It was a mildly successful open source project around 2005 with a small community of contributors. The idea was that a school could boot a classroom of computers from bootable CDs and that would instantly create a cluster (using the PVM framework) that was then used to construct the timetable. High schools at the time were just getting equipped with such classrooms for teaching computer science.<p>I demonstrated it at a few institutions, applied for government grants and held some open workshops, but never was able to get any local school or faculty to use it. I learned that timetabling in institutions was as much a challenge in office politics as it was a technical problem. The largest successes that I can recall right now was that it was used in some published study of ship scheduling in the Rotterdam port and that I was paid by some Asian organization to develop some extensions they needed.')
