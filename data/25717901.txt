I was thinking of it as &quot;Rust doesn&#x27;t just do whatever LLVM does, see, we have semantics and LLVM compiles them wrong, so this is an example of that&quot; but I forgot that actually, we <i>do</i> specify &quot;this follows what LLVM does&quot; currently, and the miscompilation is just a plain bug. Extra embarrassing because IIRC I was the one who made the PR saying that.<p>The former though is an area of significant divergence between Rust and C++ semantics, and LLVM directly following C++ semantics.')
