More cars. Where I live, there&#x27;s about 1000x more needles than when I grew up. Way more crazy people roaming around. Maybe statistically they aren&#x27;t causing any problems, but they sure harass me enough. Especially when it comes to &quot;playing in the woods&quot;. The woods around town are the worst place now. We used to find camps and places where teenagers would party here and there but now when I walk in the woods (unregulated, non-protected &quot;parks&quot;, or outskirts of real parks) there&#x27;s people camping out and smoking, drinking, doing whatever. Both my hometown and where I live now are like this. It&#x27;s not my imagination. My parents see the same thing. I don&#x27;t care if the statistics say it&#x27;s better.')
