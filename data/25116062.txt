I think he chose the blackmail example because it&#x27;s easy to understand on a personal level: we all use repudiatable protocols in other contexts (like Signal), so why wouldn&#x27;t we want it on our emails?<p>Second: That&#x27;s not how blackmail works. It&#x27;s contingent on what the extorted party <i>thinks</i>, not the cryptographic integrity of the blackmail material. That&#x27;s why mass blackmail spam campaigns (that DKIM fails to prevent, ironically enough)  are remarkably effective. Publishing DKIM secret keys after their expiry doesn&#x27;t magically prevent blackmail; it just removes one more tool from the blackmailer&#x27;s toolbelt for instilling fear in the target.')
