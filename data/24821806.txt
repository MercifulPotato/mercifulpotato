Back-end interoperability, yes. No more locking out TweetDeck, and common applications for all message transports.<p>In particular, back-end interoperability needs to be mandatory for Internet of Things stuff. The lifespan of a cloud service is short, maybe 5 years. That&#x27;s a big problem for house components.<p>Delegability needs thought. There&#x27;s bots. There&#x27;s Snooping as a Service. Technically, back-end interoperabilty implies the ability to delegate. It&#x27;s more of a contractual issue. Can a service forbid it? Intermediaries and aggregators have their own headaches.')
