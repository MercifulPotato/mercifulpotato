Both to me AND to the developer.<p>If the developer treats my time as precious, and enables me to skip his software altogether or to use it without having issues, then I will waste zero of his time. I will also waste less of my own time, but that is probably less important from their perspective. Since there is one of them and hundreds or more of me, this pays dividends very quickly for them.')
