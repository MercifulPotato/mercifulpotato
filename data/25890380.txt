For instance, workers can face layoffs, many people are coerced into working over 8 hours, and there are various other harmful practices. The Kickstarter union managed to limit the company&#x27;s layoff policy by securing gains such as 4-months pay for laid-off workers. It also stopped Kickstarter&#x27;s attempts to censor anti-racist content, such as the comic series &quot;Always Punch Nazis&quot;. Meanwhile, writers for app developer Voltage Entertainment increased their wages by 78% through a strike.<p>If a workplace&#x27;s conditions don&#x27;t make the workers happy for whatever reason, virtually anything can be changed by unions. They could make a tremendous impact in tech workers&#x27; lives by changing many aspects of work-life balance, which is certainly not ideal right now.

I will answer people&#x27;s questions in the comments.')
