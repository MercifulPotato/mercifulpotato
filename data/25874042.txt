This was after seeing 5+ human specialists who either couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong, or (more commonly) didn&#x27;t believe anything was wrong.<p>Addison&#x27;s is deadly if left untreated. According to my endocrinologist, I was scarily close to death.<p>Doctors are quick to discourage patients from &quot;Googling their symptoms&quot;, but patients (and their veterinary friends, lol) need to advocate for themselves. If I hadn&#x27;t taken the tip about Addison&#x27;s seriously and demanded tests from my primary care, I could very well be dead.')
