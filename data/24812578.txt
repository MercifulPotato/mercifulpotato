Remember, we&#x27;re trying to minimize excess death of <i>all causes</i>, not just COVID-19.<p>&gt; Second, every successful preemptive measure is by definition an overreaction. Perhaps you don&#x27;t see more overwhelmed hospitals precisely because lockdowns are effectively preventing that.<p>Sure, but that insight doesn&#x27;t really help. Maybe that&#x27;s true, maybe it isn&#x27;t. Given that neither Brazil nor Sweden had a lockdown and given that neither of their healthcare systems collapsed as some models predicted, my guess would be that a lockdown isn&#x27;t necessary to prevent such a collapse.')
