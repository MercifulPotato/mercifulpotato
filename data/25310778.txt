He owns mines, in Africa. Can you guess which country? Yes exactly, the one that prospers much more than the others.<p>Basically, the &quot;work&quot; has to come from somewhere. The reason FB is rich is because 2+B people choose to work for free. The reason Google is rich is because they do not have to create the content (in fact, &quot;content creators&quot; are pushed to the back seat). The reason Amazon is rich is because you can use cheap labor and sprinkle tech-efficiency on it. The reason all gig-companies are rich is because they can circumvent many &quot;worker-rights&quot;. The reason Microsoft is rich is because they give a damn about compatibility and competition (the will extinguish probably even the classic &quot;open source&quot;, given enough time).<p>Some hedge funds are rich, because they buy the order-flow data of poor people playing with their money - maybe they use it against them, maybe not.<p>I cannot see non-exploitation in any of these. Another  grandiosely self-serving essay by a rich man, who thinks he has figured out how the world works.<p>If he really had, he would probably want to change it. For the better - which is probably much harder then just doing more of the same.<p>Edit: I sometimes think people who write these things are painfully aware of the kind of illusion they create and choose to create it nevertheless.
