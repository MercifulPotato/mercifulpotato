Item(by='nexuist', descendants=None, kids=[25479244], score=None, time=1608356791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470385, text='&gt; If they had cut off the driving completely for instance<p>This is one of my biggest gripes with the game. You literally have self driving cars built into the lore (and the story - Delamain) AND flying cars (Trauma Team, police officers), why the hell does anyone care about owning a car or driving it? We have cybernetic eyes and our cars drive&#x2F;fly themselves and we <i>still</i> need to put up LED traffic lights?<p>Sure it makes sure in the outskirts to pick up a 4x4 offroader and do some cool desert driving for side missions. But in Night City? It should be modeled after pedestrians, and it is in some cases, but the road layout clearly looks like it was modeled for a city in 2012 and not 2077.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m loving the story (watching let&#x27;s plays no less, I don&#x27;t have the specs to run the game myself). I think it&#x27;s a great game despite the bugs and performance issues that will unfortunately haunt CDPR for a great deal of time. But some of the plot holes are just so deep, it hurts to think about because of how much better the story would be.<p>For example, I know the breaching minigame where you have to click through the matrix to complete the sequence of hex codes is unrealistic and not how you would hack a real computer. Obviously, I&#x27;m not going to gripe about that, it&#x27;s a minigame inside of a video game and it&#x27;s meant for entertainment, not realism. But, come on, you introduce us to cybernetic eye implants and we still have to use a 27&quot; monitor to check our email? Why would you ever use a monitor again?')
