There&#x27;s always a huge amount of open PHP jobs and if more elite devs are passing over those jobs then it means an opportunity for somebody. And some of those people who start with PHP will move on to more modern or better languages after they get their legs. It&#x27;s a smart path to get on the dev career track, especially if you don&#x27;t come from a traditional CS or dev background.')
