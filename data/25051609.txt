Relevant sections:<p>&gt; &quot;[S]ince at least 2016, Zoom misled users by touting that it offered &#x27;end-to-end, 256-bit encryption&#x27; to secure users&#x27; communications, when in fact it provided a lower level of security,&quot; the FTC said today in the announcement of its complaint against Zoom and the tentative settlement. Despite promising end-to-end encryption, the FTC said that &quot;Zoom maintained the cryptographic keys that could allow Zoom to access the content of its customers&#x27; meetings, and secured its Zoom Meetings, in part, with a lower level of encryption than promised.&quot;<p>&gt; The FTC complaint says that Zoom claimed it offers end-to-end encryption in its June 2016 and July 2017 HIPAA compliance guides, which were intended for health-care industry users of the video conferencing service. Zoom also claimed it offered end-to-end encryption in a January 2019 white paper, in an April 2017 blog post, and in direct responses to inquiries from customers and potential customers, the complaint said.')
