For many reasons, I recognize it&#x27;s extremely difficult to make it work to acquire a language with the help of a romantic partner. I even had a friend who&#x27;s wife was a doctorate in French language education but completely failed to use her as a resource.<p>I&#x27;ve identified some of the pitfalls and am developing a system to get native speaking partners more involved in language learner&#x27;s journeys in a fun and encouraging way (not as a teacher).<p>This is my second startup! Went through YC once on my first one (related to VR). Been using YC Startup School this time around.')
