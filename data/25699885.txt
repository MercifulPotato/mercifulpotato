Yes, they allow for convenient notation to express things within specific domains, but they also create more barriers.  It is both more impressive and more useful if one is able to create abstractions in mechanical sympathy with idiomatic uses of existing languages.  Of course, this is harder to do.<p>I think DSLs are a bit of a lazy cop-out.<p>This is not a new idea.  The myth of the tower of Babel and the observation that by creating lots and lots of communication barriers and interfaces, you lose the ability to coordinate major efforts is indeed very old.')
