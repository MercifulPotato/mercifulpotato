Item(by='MayeulC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611331017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25872465, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve driven several manual transmission cars and its always so awkward for the first couple minutes as there is no standard &quot;feel&quot;. EU test inspectors must provide enormous amounts of leeway during testing. Every time I&#x27;ve driven a new manual car the very first time I let the clutch out is always at least somewhat unexpected.<p>That&#x27;s true, but in my experience (France), the car being driven during the exam is one of your driving school&#x27;s cars, which you are probably familiar with, since a number of driving lessons are mandated before the exam.<p>Plus, all these cars feature dual controls as a safety measure, not only for pedals, but for blinkers, honk, etc. If the inspector touches their break pedal, you automatically fail the exam.')
