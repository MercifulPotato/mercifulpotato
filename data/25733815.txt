I just put it that way to express the idea of the &quot;Like&quot; button being a page element available anywhere on the web, rather than only inside a walled garden.<p>What is really required is a database protocol for tracking Likes, or &quot;a client&#x2F;server API for creating, updating, and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content.&quot;<p>But they have that!  I didn&#x27;t know about ActivityPub until I read mxuribe&#x27;s comment above.  That&#x27;s a good start.<p>As mxuribe says, &quot;having an existing standard doesn&#x27;t mean that the Facebooks&#x27;s of the world will choose to adopt it.&quot;  I would expect FB to resist it.  But if the backlash and dissatisfaction with FB grows, a protocol like ActivityPub is a necessary enabler for something new to happen.  By allowing multiple providers to share content in a federated model, the protocol could grow organically without requiring one big new player to migrate all the FB users to a new monopoly.<p>Once it starts to happen, FB customers could be bridged into the new federated universe with translators that mirror content from FB into the new ecosystem.')
