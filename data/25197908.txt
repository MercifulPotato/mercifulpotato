Even then, we frequently drive 30-50% of our range on pure electric, because of regenerative charging. In practice it means that our big dirty 2.5L engine, even though it pollutes more, actually gets us to 20 km&#x2F;l in the city. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s great, but if i could charge the car, all those city drives would effectively be pure electric. On the open road i think we currently average about 18 km&#x2F;l, and i have a heavy foot :)<p>In comparison, my previous car a 2016 Ford Focus EcoBoost, ran on average 10-12 km&#x2F;l.')
