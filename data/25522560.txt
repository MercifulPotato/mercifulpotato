I&#x27;m pointing out your flawed argument where you somehow believe that &quot;free speech&quot; exists if there are social consequences for speaking. I provide a counter example where severe social consequences, effectively suppress speech.<p>As pointed out by another commenter on your post, freedom of speech is much more than the letter of the law. It is a much wider concept for exchanging ideas. Your claim that &quot;not free from consequences&quot; by the letter of the law while legally correct, is ironically, the polar opposite of what freedom of speech actually is.')
