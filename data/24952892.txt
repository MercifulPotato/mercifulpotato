It&#x27;s basically asking people who claim they&#x27;ve been hurt or discriminated against. The only actual legal case in all these stories is the one against Cisco, and that&#x27;s still in progress. Of course there will be casteists among the Indians in the Bay Area (India has enormous numbers of them). But it&#x27;s not clear they have any ability to inflict discrimination on the lower castes.<p>If they do, I haven&#x27;t seen evidence of it. Stories claim that lower-caste employees have had their Indian upper caste managers discriminate, hurt their careers and even sexually harrass them, but HR departments say they can&#x27;t do anything because caste is not a protected category.<p>I work in Silicon Valley, and have a hard time with this picture of the culture and HR departments in the area.')
