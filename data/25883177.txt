I don&#x27;t want to buy a sub for all the newspapers I might read and it saves a hell of lot of time worrying about whether I&#x27;ve already read too many articles for the month. It&#x27;s a few cents per read, and as I don&#x27;t have all day to browse the papers anyway it is very good value. I hope they, or someone like them, really succeed in the long-term. It feels good to be giving money to journalists.')
