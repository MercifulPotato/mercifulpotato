Under light load, it will get away with this, but if the load is heavy enough, it will either <i>guarantee</i> that every process waiting for the lock runs at once, trampling each other&#x27;s work, <i>or</i> almost-serialize them, making the race condition even more intermittent than if they didn&#x27;t lock at all. Which failure mode you hit depends on how your scheduler works.')
