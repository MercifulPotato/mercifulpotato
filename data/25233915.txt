HN has already played out this debate on the original post so I&#x27;ll save going into it here, but it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that Russ didn&#x27;t quit because of race-related policy, whether or not you think the policy is race-related.<p>That said, putting out that &quot;apolitical stance&quot; in the direct wake of George Floyd&#x2F;BLM is unavoidably tied. As others have said, timing is key. If they had the policy from day 1, they might have a leg to stand on. It seems likely in context with this article (and frankly, to many before this) that Coinbase&#x27;s apolitical stance is not a rejection of all politics but a tacit rejection of George Floyd&#x2F;BLM. No one should be surprised about a diversity problem in such a company.<p>This &quot;what else can they do?&quot; question stems from a criminal judicial standard of guilt and conviction, but that is not where this discussion exists. To think that Coinbase <i>must</i> be innocent and needs to prove that over many former employees being on the record + clear statistical issues that all align with the narrative the company has set with previous actions shows a central flaw in the tech community&#x27;s approach to racism and politics.<p>I realize the question does not direct say that they must be innocent, but the implications and assumptions here are important to note, and certainly lean in that direction.')
