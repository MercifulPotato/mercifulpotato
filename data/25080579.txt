I understand how you feel, and i just feel differently about it.<p>The logos do represent my company and its products. I could pick some to attach to a particular product.<p>But so could you. Then that logo would come to represent the thing you attach it to.<p>Also, you&#x27;re free to modify these however you like. All in the MIT license.<p>For me there&#x27;s no other purpose to these beside being logos. I get if you feel differently about it and that&#x27;s okay.<p>If you see them as designs, graphics, alien hieroglyphs, I don&#x27;t feel angry at you, I&#x27;m totally okay with that.<p>If you want to call them that, I have no problem. But please don&#x27;t expect me to participate in your naming of the things when my naming of the things makes perfect sense to me.<p>I feel happy for you that your naming of the things makes sense to you.<p>In a more general sense...This is not programming, we don&#x27;t have to have singular unambiguous definitions. There&#x27;s room for a variety of interpretations. If you want to insist there&#x27;s only one true way, you go ahead, I&#x27;m not stopping you, but please don&#x27;t expect me to participate in your way, nor in naming things the way you want them to be named. I&#x27;ll name the things my way, and if you name them differently, I&#x27;m okay with that. I hope I&#x27;ve made that clear how i feel about it, and I hope we can all try to understand each other&#x27;s point of view, rather than pretending that our way is the one right way and everybody else must be wrong. Thank you for helping to provide me with this chance to say clearly what i feel about it.')
