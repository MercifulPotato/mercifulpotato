I would say in the 1st year of my PhD the path was more like this: read the paper slowly top to bottom, understand nothing, now look for the part which looks the most interesting&#x2F;approachable, read that again. Go to the citations of this section and repeat the process (recursive algorithm). Take note of any papers beiing cited by most of the papers, invest time in this paper. Look for papers citing the paper you read (not possible for cutting edge of course). This process takes probably 2-3 month. Then do own research on that topic, then go back to the paper and now things are clearer. Do the same process with a related paper in the field. Then one more. Probable now you are in year two and one can transition to your approach.')
