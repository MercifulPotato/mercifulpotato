As said, JIT employs absolute addresses a lot, and for instance, you can use `lea` to compute the absolute address of a variable at runtime (with PC-relative addressing mode). Said that, I still see `movabs` of an hardcoded address (not necessarily a hardware register) into a register and then a call to it (and this continues to be position-independent code). Also, if I remember correctly, the __TEXT segment is not randomized by default on Linux.')
