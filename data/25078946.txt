We bought our first leaf, a 2011 model, for $4,900 last year.<p>the range is down &quot;2 bars&quot;, so it&#x27;s legit only a ~70 mile car, but it absorbed a ton of our city trips and did great.<p>Then Oregon passed a $2,500 incentive on used cars, so we sold it for $7,500 and moved up to an i3.<p>Our local EV used car dealer, Platt Auto in Portland, has a few 2016+ leafs for $8900, so I bet his two older ones listed at $Call could be had sub-8K.')
