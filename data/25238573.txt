Kind of, since I just don&#x27;t drink any soda but I still find that skipping breakfast and having late lunch (or dinner only) is much easier if I didn&#x27;t have carbs for breakfast.

Coffee only or with butter&#x2F;coconut oil means no hunger until much later.<p>It&#x27;s like the body &quot;knows&quot; there must be more carbs out there if you recently had some and wants more. If there were no carbs it &quot;assumes&quot; there aren&#x27;t more so if no extra food is added (we ate all the mammoth meat yesterday and now we gotta go hunt first) I&#x27;ll just use up the fat stores.')
