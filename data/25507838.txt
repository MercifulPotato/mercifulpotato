There is no official way to stream the image to a PC so I ended up using a HDMI capture box (costs around $50). The image quality with a nice prime lens is fantastic. You get a blurry background and some nice bokeh, something no Logitech camera can give you and it looks great. The camera and the capture box support up to FullHD.<p>I recently bought a better camera, the Panasonic DC-G9. Panasonic offers a (beta) webcam software for this camera so you can use it as a 1280x720 webcam via USB 3.0.\nIt also looks fantastic. The resolution is high enough! There is no audio though. For now i use a separate microphone.<p>If you care about your webcam&#x27;s image quality, here&#x27;s my main advice:<p>- Put the camera at eye height (using a small tripod)! This alone makes a big difference<p>- Put some light sources behind the camera and not behind the user<p>- If you want to use the virtual background feature of Zoom etc, use a real greenscreen behind you. They are very cheap and the quality of the virtual background with chroma keying is just so much better!')
