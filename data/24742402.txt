There were old campus dormitories with dirty toilets at the end of the floor and dense network, having up to 3-4 PCs in the room, dozens of wires attached to the ceilings by the aluminium strips made of the beer cans. I&#x27;ve paid $50, half of my income at that time, for an Ethernet port (we owned the local network equipment) and got a static IP address - still remember it.')
