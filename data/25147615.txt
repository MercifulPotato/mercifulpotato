Us city kids, we didn&#x27;t get to spend so much time in the woods, to see so many different kinds of plants and animals - and the ones we did, we&#x27;ve already known by their laymen names.<p>Tangential: it would be helpful if schools explained to kids that <i>all classifications are arbitrary</i>, in biology and otherwise. Their value is in being useful, not correct to some magic metadata tags attached to things.<p>In context of school biology, I wish we spent more time approaching the classification like: &quot;See that thing in the picture? We classify it as X, because it has $property; subtype Y, because it has $different-property; ... subtype ABC, because initially biologists thought this is different from BCD; now we know it isn&#x27;t, but the classification remains for now&quot;. It would all feel much less boring this way.')
