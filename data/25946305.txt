The bank is just a vault. Not only are they not responsible for helping someone pick a mortgage and house, they aren’t even competent to do so.<p>I can’t imagine some retail bank even employing people who could competently assess individual debt&#x2F;income ratios.<p>The training is that individuals should have financial literacy enough to know what banks do and don’t do well. And to recognize cross-marketing.<p>I knew tons of people who made dumb decisions in the 00s and bought way too much house. The bank letting them was part of the problem. But people being stupid was a big part too. I knew families making $50k&#x2F;year buying $400k houses and refinancing every six months for cash out to pay the mortgage. The bank shouldn’t have done that. But people were really stupid to do this once much less multiple times.')
