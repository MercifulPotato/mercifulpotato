Use it with Visual Studio code or your FOSS variant of it with the Flutter plugin. That works really well.<p>&gt; <i>Also dart is a real PITA coming from typescripts which is basically c#.</i><p>That&#x27;s surprising to me. Coming from Ruby Dart was great.

Very powerful and at the same time manageable, a smart small concept at its core, with much around it that makes it powerful. Combine it with GetX and the code you get can also be really nice.<p>But for Linux? No way, not until they have got a proper beta that is not tied to snap.
