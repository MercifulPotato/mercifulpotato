But if he wants to live in a new place by a new set of laws in the future, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with that.<p>It seems more like you regret the laws in the US during the decades he was here, and you are hoping future changes in the law will retroactively address your concerns. But I see no moral basis for that stance.<p>If we want to change the law, we should be forced to consider the effects on the future, and whether those laws will negatively impact the wealth created in the future. If we start going back and seizing wealth from the past, that will give us a false sense that the laws are working, until the old money runs out and we look around and don&#x27;t see anyone creating new wealth.')
