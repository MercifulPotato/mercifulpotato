My PI wanted a new line that produced a certain transgenic protein. When I explained that it wasn&#x27;t possible I was asked if one set of results from another assay could be &quot;used&quot; in the current project. I said no but still provided all the the necessary data to lie if that was what they wanted to do. The lab ended up getting a $75k plus grant because of the fabricated data and I was left disillusioned and quit soon afterward.<p>Ever since I have told anyone that would listen that science is broken and I rarely believe anything until there is a working product. It is beyond sickening how much and how often people lie and how it is constantly covered up by their colleagues who don&#x27;t want to cause a fuss.')
