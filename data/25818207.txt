So a recipe that calls for &quot;5 onions, finely chopped&quot; won&#x27;t count the peeling &amp; chopping time. But when it says &quot;sautee onions for 5 minutes&quot; that&#x27;s where the &quot;5 minutes of prep&quot; comes from. &quot;Cooking time&quot; is usually the unattended cooking time, where something is just boiling in a pot or baking in an oven.')
