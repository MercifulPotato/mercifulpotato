News is other people doing things, learning is other people teaching us, chatting is with other people, etc.<p>I can perhaps see a sci-fi take on internet usage being given out through world-government prescriptions, rationed access to the &quot;escape world&quot;. Which reminds me of the setting for Ready Player One and its slums, just without the fanservice and with a much more realistic and grim vibe.')
