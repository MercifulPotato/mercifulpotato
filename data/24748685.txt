Instead of doing one thing well, it forces users to consume something meant as a jack of all trades, which may not meet their use case.<p>I wish such a thing wasn’t forced in a standard package - rather split into different ones. Then I can easily compose them according to my needs, instead of having the stdlib force feed me some set of tradeoffs I might not want.<p>I’m sure these extra third party libraries exist or will exist in Julia just as they do in Python and users will have lots of good options - but what a shame for people to take a needlessly myopic view that core libraries need to be obsessed either with performance or with breadth of use case coverage coupled into one library, which seems to purely be for macho bragging rights or something?')
