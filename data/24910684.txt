Chess has too many pieces that can move across the entire board: 2 bishops, 2 rooks, queen... And pawns capture diagonally which I have always found very weird.<p>In shogi there is no queen and there is only 1 bishop and 1 rook. Pawns capture forward and can move only 1 tile at a time and there is no en passant.\nThere are lances which are like rooks but can only move forward. Knights have 2 ways of moving instead of 8.<p>There are many more differences, like drops, different promotion rules, etc. It is a cool game.<p>Shogi gets pretty exciting towards the endgame.<p>An easy way to play shogi is in 81dojo. That site is available in English and is pretty active.<p>It can take a while to get used to reading the pieces and memorizing moves and promotions, but there are piece sets available that show you the available moves for each piece.<p>Illegal moves are the easiest way of losing. e.g.: nifu. And, you are expected to recognize a checkmate and resign.<p>And there is a &quot;beginner&quot; version, doubutsu shogi. Which consists of fewer pieces and a smaller board.')
