Item(by='tibbon', descendants=None, kids=[24727510], score=None, time=1602186357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714070, text='Generally, i&#x27;d agree with you except my current experience...<p>I borrowed a 2019 Tesla 3 last summer from a friend while he was out of the country. Really fun, and I overall really enjoyed the electronics on it.<p>Afterward I had my finger over the buy button to order a Tesla, but after finding out that in my state, the insurance for someone with an entirely clean driving record in their 30&#x27;s was still around $400&#x2F;month, making the total cost including loan nearly $1000&#x2F;month. I just didn&#x27;t need that type of expense in my life right now, given I work from home (I made this decision Oct 2019, and in retrospect, wow how right I was).<p>This spring, I bought a 2005 Porsche Boxster instead for $15k. What a car! It&#x27;s not as fast as the Tesla, but is <i>way</i> more fun to drive, turns more heads, and has held up significantly better than I can imagine a Tesla holding up. It doesn&#x27;t have auto driving, but even on a 13 hours road trip you <i>want</i> to drive it the entire time. More comfortable in every regard, with a much better suspension too!')
