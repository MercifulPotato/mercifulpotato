It&#x27;s entirely in-determinate how useful it is, because only a handful of people have stepped up to try. There is a lot of trickery to getting the server to determine what resources to push, that it knows the client needs, but basics like &quot;let&#x27;s look at the main pages etag to figure it out&quot; got very little experimentation &amp; tries, certainly very few documented.<p>&gt; Chrome currently supports handling push streams over HTTP&#x2F;2 and gQUIC, and this intent is about removing support over both protocols.  Chrome does not support push over HTTP&#x2F;3 and adding support is not on the roadmap.<p>I am shocked &amp; terrified that google would consider not supporting a sizable chunk of HTTP in their user-agent. I understand that uptake has been slow. That this is not popular. But I do not see support as optional. This practice, of picking &amp; choosing what to implement of our core standards, of deciding to drop core features that were by concensus agreed upon- because 5 years have passed &amp; we&#x27;re not sure yet how to use it well yet- is something I bow my head to &amp; just hope, hope we can keep on through.')
