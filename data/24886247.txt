Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[24890948], score=None, time=1603633863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867643, text='I&#x27;m surprised that the author equated embedded programming with IDEs! In my experience that&#x27;s where the IDE programming fares poorly because every environment is different (so everybody has their &quot;official&quot; IDE that you need to relearn) whereas the low level tools tend to be fairly standard (you usually have a vendor-provided GCC toolchain and a few command line tools for generating images and flashing).<p>I know that IDEs are incredibly popular nowadays, but I do 100% of my development in Vim without any issues. It does require proficiency with the command line, Makefile and shell scripting though.<p>For instance the Makefile shown in TFA is not great, in particular because it doesn&#x27;t track changes on header files. My personal template looks like:<p><pre><code>    NAME = my_prog\n\n    CFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -MMD -MP\n\n    SRC = main.c foo.c bar.c\n\n    OBJ = $(SRC:%.c=%.o)\n    DEP = $(SRC:%.c=%.d)\n\n    $(NAME) : $(OBJ)\n     $(info LD $@)\n     $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^\n\n    -include $(DEP)\n\n    %.o: %.c\n     $(info CC $@)\n     $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;\n\n    .PHONY : clean\n    clean:\n     $(info CLEAN $(NAME))\n     rm -f $(OBJ) $(DEP)\n\n    # Be verbose if V is set\n    $V.SILENT:\n</code></pre>\nNote that it hides the actual commands being executed unless you set &quot;V&quot; on the command line, which I know some people actively dislike.<p>The &quot;magic&quot; here is the &quot;-MMD -MP&quot; flags to gcc to generate header dependencies and the &quot;-include $(DEP)&quot; to integrate them in the Makefile.')
