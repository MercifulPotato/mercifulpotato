The difference, in my mind, is that values are sort of ingrained into us as humans, and we can&#x27;t change them. They include good beliefs but also a lot of personal baggage.<p>Principles, on the other hand, are things we _choose_ to act on. Ideally they are the same as our values, but when building&#x2F;designing something, it&#x27;s best to choose principles.')
