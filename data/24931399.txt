The use of the logo for commercial purposes could be a concern; I could see an argument perhaps saying that the businesses should have more control over their trademarked property in the sense that there could be confusion of whether they&#x27;re working with Grubhub (they&#x27;re certainly not endorsing Grubhub).<p>But apart from that, use of the business&#x27;s information (including name) to describe what restaurants Grubhub will pick up from is nominative fair use. If I make a list of &quot;businesses in my home town,&quot; McDonald&#x27;s can&#x27;t use trademark law to keep their name off my list. Same deal here.')
