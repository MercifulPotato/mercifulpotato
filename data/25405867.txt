The problem is that that isn&#x27;t enough for them and it would still be an capitalistic greed anti-consumer shit show.<p>If I pay I want: No ads, no tracking, full access to my own data in sane export formats, schemas, no data mining, no data selling, no &quot;sharing data with our partners&quot;, encryption options, no dumb hoops, no dark patterns, the ability to point a product at an API endpoint of my choosing, backup options that default to my infrastructure first and so on.<p>Actually let&#x27;s add more: The data generated by my use of my data in the product. Non-canned support responses that don&#x27;t ask for information I literally put in the ticket three weeks ago. Prominent indication of where (geographically and legally) data is stored and used. If&#x2F;how often you do backups. If&#x2F;how often you practice disaster recovery.<p>So really what I want to pay for is sanity and no bullshit.<p>Yet if I do pay, many services and companies will still do all of this shit in the background until midnight the day it&#x27;s finally made illegal, all the while gaslighting me about &quot;how much they value me as a customer&quot; and how they &quot;respect&quot; our &quot;relationship&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s literally obscene.')
