All it takes is a <i>user</i> to include your header and some header that #defines <i>any name in your header</i> to be something else.<p>So that means you really need to name your preprocessor symbols (and any other all-caps names, because that&#x27;s the convention) in ways that <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t collide. Like MYLIB_OK.<p>So it starts off dumb, but then you have to start layering on convention and defensive programming immediately. And it complicates entire other features of the language, naming constants and enumerated values especially.')
