Not acknowledging things for what they are can hold you back.<p>Just because HN doesn&#x27;t have formal attributes of addictive social media like tailored feeds, shiny pictures, endless scrolling, etc., it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s very different. I&#x27;m saying that, because I managed to get rid of almost all addictive sites, but HN sticks, and I still spend far more time here than I&#x27;d like to admit. If you look at it closer: this is an <i>_endless_</i> list of <i>_news_</i> with <i>_a lot_</i> of <i>_comments_</i> from your <i>_peers_</i> that you <i>_engage_</i> with. If you take words in italic it&#x27;s obvious that this is exactly what makes other social media addictive. &quot;News&quot; and &quot;peers&quot; are the most important words here of course.<p>In a way, I believe sites like HN are even worse than others because they are somewhat disguised. I shrug FB, twitter and instagram easily (never actually even got into them), Reddit was harder but their stupid redesign made it much easier, HN sill stands for me.')
