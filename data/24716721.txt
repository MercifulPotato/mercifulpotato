There&#x27;s always a tradeoff between the usefulness of having static guarantees, and the complexity of the type system features that enable those guarantees. In some cases it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to enforce certain static properties - you have to weigh the costs and benefits on a case by case basis. But it&#x27;s nice to have the option, and Haskellers make use of it frequently.')
