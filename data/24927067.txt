Not sure how well it has been enforced ... it excludes certain other states (e.g. most of New England) and states where their rates are low enough.<p>MA actually just got put on the CT &amp; NY &quot;must quarantine&quot; lists because of our now-higher rates (not not vice-versa, in fact Baker just today called NY&#x2F;CT out on it but they didn&#x27;t give in  any on it).<p>I&#x27;m sure though that probably travelers through the airports might be problematic ... then again, air traffic is down very very significantly (source: live under a Logan approach and it&#x27;s been absolutely quiet since late March).<p>I don&#x27;t really know how else MA would enforce cross border quarantine short of police checkpoints at every crossing which would be both expensive and likely unconstitutional.<p>As for Plymouth ... it&#x27;s kinda cold now, I&#x27;d have expected that back in the summer, but not so much now (although the Plimoth Plantation is in fact open which I&#x27;m a bit surprised at!).')
