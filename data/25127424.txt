He never said that, and you can&#x27;t quote him saying that. He did call the media&#x27;s reaction to the virus a hoax, which the media of course then took out of context and reinterpreted in the worst way possible.<p>But in our post-truth world we now have mainstream media taking quotes out of context and reinterpreting them to create their propaganda, citizens will then constantly parrot the propaganda on Reddit&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc., and if enough people have been convinced that Trump called covid a hoax, it apparently becomes &quot;true&quot; and never goes away. If someone sees 1,000 people on Reddit saying he called it a hoax, well now you have 1,001 people that go around parroting it, and it just spreads and never dies, even though it&#x27;s completely detached from reality.<p>Even more ironically, the story itself is just further propaganda that is detached from reality. Of course there&#x27;s people that DO think the virus itself isn&#x27;t real. Just like there&#x27;s people that believe the earth is flat. But the vast majority of people that don&#x27;t give a flip about the virus are doing it not because they think it isn&#x27;t real, they&#x27;re doing it because the data shows it&#x27;s a coronavirus that&#x27;s 2-3 times deadlier than the flu. That&#x27;s it. Just like you mentioned. Shutting down and destroying the country over a virus that&#x27;s 2-3 times deadlier than the flu is absolutely absurd. They stopped buying into the fear porn and they&#x27;re going on with their lives.')
