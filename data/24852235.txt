I haven’t seen anyone in the community describe it this way but it has the feel of undefined behavior to it.<p>There’s apparently some heightened interest in Rust for these purposes because its guarantees offer some additional robustness here.<p>But having JIT for the BEAM changes the calculus of whether it’s worth maintaining your code in two languages for a speed improvement that comes with additional liabilities. It will be interesting to see what libraries and tools become pure as the JIT covers more territory.')
