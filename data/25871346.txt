What are they supposed to do with the license change? Just accept whatever Elastic said? I don&#x27;t think you can blame them for taking the last version where they agreed with the license and continue to use and develop it. Sure, maybe making it open is a bit of a jab back, but even in isolation it makes sense for them.')
