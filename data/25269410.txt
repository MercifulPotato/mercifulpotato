I had cemented my &quot;status&quot; back in elementary school when I was a &quot;computer genius&quot; because I knew how to mount the network drive then open and save files to it (which led to me being tasked with helping everyone else of course lol). I used to take every single chance to put my hands on a computer and it paid off in present day when I get paid to do it.')
