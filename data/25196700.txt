Item(by='beaner', descendants=None, kids=[25196777], score=None, time=1606209347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196631, text='&gt;  Putting more energy is not going to make more money into the system, is just makes it more likely that you get to be in the front of a firehose that drips money into the system in a constant rate.<p>This doesn&#x27;t negate what I&#x27;m trying to say. That the energy amount is variable but the currency units output on the other side are static doesn&#x27;t change the fact that energy is being turned into money. By contributing a higher fraction of the input, you get a higher fraction of the output.<p>If anything, higher energy input can only be justified when the money being made as a result has an equivalent value or purchasing power. You&#x27;re confusing units of currency for the actual purchasing power they represent, which actually is variable.<p>&gt; no one wants money, what people want is the what money can buy<p>This is wrong. People want the option to have things in the future, which is exactly what money is.')
