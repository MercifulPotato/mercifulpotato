Or some other mechanism more focused on better design?<p>Or put it some other way, if I have many problems, and one of them is I&#x27;m not currently writing the clearest simplest easiest to read and test code, and I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time on design or don&#x27;t know much about it. And then I encounter an Haskell evangelist, I will very likely assume that Haskell will make me a better coder and designer, and that the language will force me into good design and safer code.')
