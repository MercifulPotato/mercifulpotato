Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604249216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960596, text='Ah, I think I see it.<p>The set of infinite, non-deterministic execution traces is uncountable (same reason real numbers composed of infinite sequences of digits from a finite set are uncountable).<p>On the other hand, the set of infinite execution traces which can result from any deterministic, finite-size program is countable (because the set of programs is).<p>But programs take inputs.  And the set of possible inputs to an infinite execution trace is uncountable (same reason as reals, above).<p>The prover needs to show that a program behaves correctly when given <i>any</i> sequence of inputs, even if the program never terminates and keeps taking new inputs forever.  That requires proofs over an uncountable set of infinite execution traces.')
