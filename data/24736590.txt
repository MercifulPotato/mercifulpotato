He was a next door neighbor of a friend of mine who lived in subsidized housing for the elderly. The robber had a strict schedule in and out in two, maybe three minutes once the robbery started. However, he got caught on the last one - because he stayed too long.<p>As a side note, I met him as he was dying of cancer, and my friend would help take care of him. Id pitch in, but it was mostly my friend doing the day-to-day helping. Absolutely f*ing heartbreaking. There was no one else in his life - no friends, no family, nothing. He was bitter and alone. It was brutal watching him die over a few months.')
