I&#x27;m unsure what they mean to be honest... and I&#x27;m sure that would be hard to explain as well. I guess I can see these &quot;movies&quot; mentally in the same way as how I vaguely remember the sequence of events in a recent dream. Unsure if I&#x27;d call that a movie though. Sounds like a pretty crappy one at that!')
