It&#x27;s also how fast they can read&#x2F;understand the program code.<p>&gt; All mathematicians are expected to write paragraphs in &quot;English&quot; or some other relevant language outside of equations.<p>Sure, we do that for software also - we document things outside of the code. For example in a wiki, a README.md or sometimes even just above the code as comment&#x2F;docs. But that&#x27;s not what I was talking about, right?<p>&gt; Whenever a mathematician uses the letter &quot;x&quot; or &quot;f&quot; they define the meaning with an english phrase or paragraph.<p>So you are fine if a developer does e.g. `c := (some super complex expression) &#x2F;&#x2F; find relevant customer` and then goes on to use just `c` everywhere in their code instead of `relevantCustomerBlaBlaBla`?<p>Also, mathematicians don&#x27;t always do that. Sometimes they just say &quot;let x be [insert complex equation]&quot;.
