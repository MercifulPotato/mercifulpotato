Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602011784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701041, text='I think everything you&#x27;re saying is a reasonable interpretation of the behavior you observe, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the only possible nor the only plausible explanation, so it might be worth diving into what assumptions you might be making, especially considering that you&#x27;re aware of what I think is one of the core issues - we don&#x27;t know each other.<p>Text is hard to see through sometimes, and language is often vague. It&#x27;s not always obvious when something is a joke, and it&#x27;s not always guaranteed that something said in jest will be received the same way, nor that it&#x27;s actually funny. Also downvotes are given for a wide variety of reasons (same as upvotes) so downvotes don&#x27;t even necessarily indicate that a joke was interpreted as unfunny- it might simply be detracting or not relevant. It&#x27;s best to not take downvotes personally, because they&#x27;re often not given for the reasons you assume. (BTW I see good jokes on HN getting upvotes all the time, so make sure to avoid jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.)<p>&gt; Even your comment is offensive, with the passive aggressive &quot;Let&#x27;s not do X,&quot; as if we&#x27;re part of some kind of collective, or I&#x27;m some kind of child that needs to be gently chided for my remark.<p>Sorry to say so, but this is off the mark. Your comment is explicitly offensive toward people who are actually autistic. This is a sort of collective, it is a community of hackers, and gentle encouragement to keep things civil and in line with the guidelines is allowed and encouraged. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
