They failed to not have the bug then, and most likely will fail to not have bugs in the future; that&#x27;s life. The solution in this case may not be to detect an error condition, but to just indicate what the software is doing. Ex a persistent notification for &#x27;updating database schema&#x27;, maybe appearing after a 5 minute timeout; if that sits around for an hour or five days or something, you can google around for it.')
