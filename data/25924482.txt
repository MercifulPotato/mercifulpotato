Newspapers have curated their content and various newspapers are known for having left or right bias.<p>This isn&#x27;t just the stations own content. If you paid to put content on television, radio, or in the paper, the publisher has always had the right to publish or not publish content (with some limits, but nothing this article speaks about would be protected by law). You couldn&#x27;t have a cable community access channel with whatever content you wanted.<p>YouTube&#x2F; Twitter&#x2F; Facebook have been and remain far more permissive in publishing outside content than any other media in history.<p>You are implying that there is some kind of &quot;new&quot; restrictions on speech, but this is literally hundreds of years old.')
