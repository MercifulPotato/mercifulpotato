Repeat for several different metrics for a better understanding of how well the model performs. This can be put in a set of unit tests.<p>Check residuals, inspect the logical implications of the regression coefficients (or whatever), plot a few curves etc to be more sure again. This can&#x27;t really be put in unit tests, nor should it be. But again, this is more statistics than software development.<p>Same goes for model deterioration - every so often you check that the metric(s) still beat the minimum threshold on more recent data.')
