But with big platforms like Facebook, it&#x27;s not easy to opt out from them. Facebook and other platforms aren&#x27;t just social media for teenagers. Many companies nowadays only have a Facebook&#x2F;Whatsapp profile as their only contact point. If you get banned from these services you miss out on accessing a wide share of services, not related to social media.<p>Also, if you have people coming to your coffee shop and acting badly, people can judge it for themselves and form their own opinion. On the internet, bans are quiet and you can easily silence a large chunk of the userbase without making a noise.<p>You may cheer these big platforms now because it&#x27;s only &quot;racists, white supremacists and crooks&quot; being banned, but as soon as the first group of people you agree with gets blocked from these platforms you&#x27;ll be the first one to fight for freedom of speech.')
