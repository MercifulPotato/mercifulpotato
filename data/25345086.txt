On PC by far most games are rendering through D3D11 and D3D12, with the bulk still using D3D11 because Windows7 is still a thing. In general you use the API that&#x27;s &quot;most native&quot; on a platform because that usually gets you the best performance and driver quality.<p>I&#x27;m happy to be proven wrong though.')
