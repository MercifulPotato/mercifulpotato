Portacle is a great way to get started. In the CLPC repository though, we are documenting the steps to set up Emacs, SLIME, etc. from scratch, so that a beginner to the CL ecosystem can try out and understand the traditional way of installing and setting up these tools.<p>If anyone here comes across this comment and is already reading or about to start reading the book Practical Common Lisp, or is eager to learn Common Lisp, you are welcome to visit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spxy&#x2F;clpc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spxy&#x2F;clpc</a> and join the Common Lisp Programming Challenge.')
