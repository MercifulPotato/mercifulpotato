The figures for the icestorm (E-cluster) were taken by running 8 threads and subtracting the results from the 4-thread test.<p>Power consumption is from the built-in powermetrics (peak value during run): sudo powermetrics -s cpu_power<p>This is on a machine that has other things running - showing around 90% idle in activity monitor.<p>n.b. Its worth noting that these icestorm cores are running at 2066Mhz when benchmarking.They can go as low as 600Mhz, and consume a LOT less power. As im currently looking at power metrics, the E-cluster (the 4 icestorm cores) active frequency is &quot;idling&quot; around 977Mhz at 5mW. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way for me to lock the frequency and perform the benchmark.')
