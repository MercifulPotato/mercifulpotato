Yet the opposite almost never happens.</i><p>Just because it is easier to found and grow a business doesn&#x27;t mean the environment is friendly to founding and funding a <i>high-growth</i> business.<p>In fact, an environment that is friendlier to SMEs, lifestyle, and bootstrapped companies probably reduces the pressure to jump into a VC-funded high-growth swing-for-the-fences model. Combine that with a less generous funding climate, and those who do want to go that route will go somewhere else for their funding.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the reverse applies in terms of attracting entrepreneurs that <i>don&#x27;t</i> wish to go the high-growth route from elsewhere.')
