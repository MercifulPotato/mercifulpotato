Looking at my purchase history over the last six years, that number is closer to 0.25% (presumably because many purchases weren&#x27;t considered eligible).<p>I still keep my purchases going to my charity of choice, but make no mistake: opting for AmazonSmile contributions won&#x27;t move the needle on your charity. You have to make contributions directly out of your own wallet. Bonus points if your employer will match them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;chpf&#x2F;about&#x2F;ref=smi_se_dshb_aas_saas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;chpf&#x2F;about&#x2F;ref=smi_se_dshb_aas_s...</a>')
