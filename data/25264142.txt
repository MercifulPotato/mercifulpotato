Item(by='dzaima', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606819898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257914, text='Keyboard space is another somewhat important factor. My layout for dzaima&#x2F;APL already uses all altgr keys, so I could definitely not afford multiplying the number of needed characters by 2. Not having ambivalently callable operators would also mean needing 2 versions of most of them.<p>dzaima&#x2F;APL being written in Java means getting it to run in a browser would be a bit hard, and ngn has given up on ngn&#x2F;apl, but BQN[0] could definitely get a web canvas based graphics interface.<p>Somewhat interesting to add to the conversation about Under is that, in my impl, calling a function, calling its inverse, or doing something under it (i.e. structural under) are all equally valid ways to &quot;use&quot; a function, it&#x27;s just a &quot;coincidence&quot; that there&#x27;s direct syntax for invoking only one. (Dyalog does not yet have under, but it definitely is planned.)<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlochbaum.github.io&#x2F;BQN&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlochbaum.github.io&#x2F;BQN&#x2F;</a>')
