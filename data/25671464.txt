It used to be called Riot, but was recently renamed.<p>Honestly, I think they should have just called it &quot;Matrix&quot;. I&#x27;m guessing they didn&#x27;t do that because they want to promote the concept of multiple clients without any single &quot;official&quot; client, but it would really simplify things.<p>As of now, I have to tell people &quot;Use Matrix, but you need this app called Element to get on to it&quot;. It&#x27;s confusing for a lot of people.')
