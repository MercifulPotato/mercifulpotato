Conference groups, where one tries to enter a group, but doesn&#x27;t know anyone in it, are one the biggest challenges of a conference. \nIf you could simulate open shoulders, closed shoulders, that would be a way to make this, better than reality.\nIf everyone in a group has closed shoulders, it appears obvious they are not interested in anyone new joining. And also as in real life, a more welcoming group will stand slightly differently, but a newcomer can feel the difference. A slight opening of the shoulders in the group circle, allows one to enter, without feeling rude.\nSimulating that feeling, by making a switch, sign, or setting, may be a breakthrough? Very exciting program. Going to try soon.')
