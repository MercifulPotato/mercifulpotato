Which will be probably very soon - I have to admit I&#x27;ve been using JPA for almost a decade and I still find it \nso confusing that I&#x27;d rather use native SQL for any non-trivial scenario(i.e. everything above plain CRUD). N+1 select problem is far from the hardest issue with JPA, for me it&#x27;s either mixing managed and detached objects or following weird cascading rules especially during updates.')
