Death, in play at least, doesn&#x27;t seem to frighten them. I guess its the same among adults, but it&#x27;s interesting that make-believe and reality are seperable even at a young age. I don&#x27;t think we adults give kids enough credit for how sophisticated they can be. (Probably because there are a lot of areas where they aren&#x27;t and it&#x27;s easier to just bucket them in whole.)')
