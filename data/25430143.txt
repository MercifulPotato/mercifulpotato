When you get a question like this as an interviewee, they want to see how you arrive at your answer regardless of what the answer is. The answer by itself is less important than what made you pick it in the first place.<p>For example, possible takeaways from your answers:<p>* Lacks critical thinking, takes things for granted, doesn&#x27;t show initiative or not comfortable with it.<p>* Elevated smartassness, possibly as a defense mechanism or due to inability to read between the lines. Maybe just nervous at the moment.<p>* Better. At least this solves some specific problem based on one&#x27;s personal experience. It&#x27;s possible to discuss that and see what else surfaces.<p>* Also good. Miraculous even if you&#x27;d managed to produce all that in the early 90s. Again, this also opens things up for further discussion.<p>See the point? It&#x27;s a meta question.')
