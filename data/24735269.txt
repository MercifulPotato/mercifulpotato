I have spent most of my professional career in Python and have watched the trajectory of type hinting in the Python ecosystem somewhat closely.<p>Python is not a statically typed language and yet type hinting sentiment seems to have gone from: &quot;Why do you want it?  Python isn&#x27;t statically typed?&quot; to &quot;Well, mypy is a useful optional package&quot; to &quot;Let&#x27;s just support type hinting in the language itself&quot;.  Which is to say I think there is value to type checking by development tools even in dynamically typed languages.<p>--<p>On a slightly unrelated note, Julia seems to be similar to Python when it comes to types; that is to say both appear to be dynamically and strongly typed.  But take that with a grain of salt as I don&#x27;t have any first-hand knowledge of Julia.')
