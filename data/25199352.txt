If mining becomes entirely unprofitable, then miners will drop out, and mining will become easier.  This process will continue until equilibrium is achieved where participating miners are making only a very small amount of money based on their energy costs.<p>Of course, what you say about transaction fees is true too - if miners are receiving less in &#x27;mined&#x27; bitcoins, then they are likely to demand more in fees.  You can already see this happening - when I first used bitcoin, nobody charged any fees at all, relying only on the mining rewards for covering their mining costs.')
