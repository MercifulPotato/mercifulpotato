The only way that free speech works is that people feel free to vociferously disagree. Given the volume of, say, Domingos&#x27; tweets, he certainly feels free to disagree. At this point the same can be said of Gebru and Anandkumar. Great! What&#x27;s the problem here? Can&#x27;t we just all just argue and get along?<p>Where is the mob attack? Oh, someone said someone mean to you. For heaven&#x27;s sake, if Anita Sarkeesian can take it then the rest of you sure can. If no one here is upset about public health directors in Kansas having their children threatened, then why the dustup about some feelings on Twitter?<p>Great, someone puts you on a block list on Twitter. Congrats. Until you&#x27;ve gotten your first rape threat you haven&#x27;t really made it anyways. What a bunch of whiners.')
