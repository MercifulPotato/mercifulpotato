Item(by='DoofusOfDeath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603212053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834628, text='Just to clarify, here&#x27;s a little more detail about what he&#x27;s like during a friendly debate (usually with family members):<p>- He doesn&#x27;t lose track of the underlying logic, despite any emotionalism that the other party might be exhibiting.<p>- He doesn&#x27;t get flustered nearly as quickly as most of his opponents.<p>- He has more endurance for the debate than most of his opponents do. Usually he&#x27;s willing to keep on banging away at the argument long after his opponent has lost the will to debate. (No idea if this is a common trait for people with Asperger syndrome, or just something unique to him as an individual.)<p>Also, I think there are two versions of &quot;flat&quot; speech in this context:<p>(1) Simply not getting worked up to the same extent as the other person in the debate, like I describe above.  I imagine this is what the ancestor comment was referring to.<p>(2) Speaking with abnormally small variations in tone, volume, and cadence. I.e., what some people refer to &quot;robotic&quot; speech. I think some people associate this with Asperger syndrome.<p>Interestingly, although my son is shows more telltale Asperger signs than I do, I&#x27;m more prone to &quot;flat&quot; speech. Especially when I&#x27;m tired, and doubly so if I&#x27;m on Adderall.')
