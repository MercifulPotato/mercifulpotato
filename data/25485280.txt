I thought about this for a longer time and decided to remove the &quot;in Node.js&quot; part from the title. Instead, I made it clear in the book description. In my opinion, the book can be valuable for anyone who is interested in the concepts, regardless of technology choices.<p>I think that it is fair to say that my book is partially also about Node.js, but not primarily. I wouldn&#x27;t say though it is about JS. In fact, many of the code examples would look similar in other languages. Furthermore, the use of Node.js helps to provide concise code examples and executable code without much ceremony.<p>When reading &quot;Implementing Domain-Driven Design&quot; by Vaughn Vernon, all the code examples are in Java. The book &quot;Enterprise Integration Patterns&quot; has a lot of code examples and all of them are also in Java. The most recent edition of &quot;Refactoring&quot; by Martin Fowler uses JavaScript. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t say that these books are about a particular programming language.')
