For the longest time, people were expected to be men, despite how glaringly obvious that is false.<p>Still, people are often expected to be rich (median wealth in US is below 100k), well-educated (more than half have no degree).<p>Our society is still filled with things we expect to be normal, but it is often unclear which becomes first.
