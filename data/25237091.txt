(I use them to benchmark WordPress Hosting company performance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviewsignal.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviewsignal.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;wordpress-hosting-p...</a>) I have to say overall the experience was pretty good. I was able to write near identical scripts easily. The documentation was good. Overall pretty happy with K6 as a successor and stand alone. I&#x27;ve used a lot of load testing tools and it&#x27;s definitely one of the best out there.')
