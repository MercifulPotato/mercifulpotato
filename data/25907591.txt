I won&#x27;t remember now what Youtubes I mean, but if I remember correctly the narrator really seem to meant that there were a lot of intentional references(possibly it was Ghost in the Shell).<p>Is it just something like &quot;rule of cool&quot; in that they just pick whatever seems &#x27;fucked-up-cool&#x27; or is it a culture of going for intellectual hard topics? Are japanese writers just hardcore about philosophy and &#x27;deep reality&#x27; topics in general?(again I could be talking crap because I don&#x27;t haven&#x27;t even played all the games, but geopolical perspectives in Metal Gear Solid also pretty original and based in actual dry research instead of the charicatures we mostly get from western industry).<p>If anyone is familiar plz help :P')
