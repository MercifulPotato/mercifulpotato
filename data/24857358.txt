Should media related to pornography, terrorism, or pedophilia be allowed or forbidden? How about gore, violence, or any other form of crime &#x2F; morally wrong concept?<p>I&#x27;ve personally seen (without intending to) the video of the New Zealand Christchurch shooting. On seeing that video I have never been more disgusted in my entire life. I felt like I wanted to puke, hell I want to puke as I type this. Should that be allowed or forbidden?<p>In my view everything should be allowed, that is, there should be no form of censorship whatsoever. It is up to the individual, based on the value system that he&#x2F;she has accumulated throughout his&#x2F;her life, to decide whether what he&#x2F;she is seeing&#x2F;reading is acceptable or deplorable. But no one should be able to decide that for another individual.')
