I have a bunch of baofengs that I bought to pass out as emergency radios at burning man.  They have saved at least one person&#x27;s life, because it meant we were able to call the emergency services when somebody had a heart attack and collapsed.  I&#x27;m sure that guy is glad that that crappy $20 radio was there and a ham operator had configured it for the 911 service it was used for.<p>That alone cemented baofengs into my &quot;good to have&quot; category for life.  They&#x27;re cheap, and that&#x27;s why I have been able to use them in the places I have.')
