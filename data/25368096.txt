This article does talk about managing cash flows in a way that involves never making a profit.<p>Isn&#x27;t the exact opposite true?<p>I work with businesses which import goods and sell them.\nThe vast majority of these make a steady profit without any thought to cash flow management.\nAccounts receivable are a mess, payment terms are long and they have a lot of cash tied up in working capital - but they are making enough of a profit to make up for this.<p>In contrast, you can stay in business making a loss with clever cash-flow management, but not forever. Equity will decrease year over year, and new sources of cash (lending, selling shares) need to be found to finance the continued operation of the business.')
