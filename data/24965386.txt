With GitLab, if you for example want to run jobs on ephemeral KVM virtual machines, you would have an agent on host machine (or multiple of them), which would then receive a job, spawn VM, execute commands in it, and at the end terminate it.<p>With GitHub, you would have to spawn VMs in advance, and launch their agent in each of them. When agent dies, you will have to manually kill the VMs, and spawn a new one.<p>This means that there is no easy way to have VMs spawn on demand, or to spawn different VMs with different configurations depending on job label.')
