Eventually this was removed from upstream but there was a patch floating around which I used for some time.<p>Whatever one _wants_ to do it or not is another story. Even on 32-bit kernels I don&#x27;t think vm86plus is enabled by default (nor is LDT changing from user-space) because of the crazy ways you can use it to break things.')
