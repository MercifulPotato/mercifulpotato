There are other niggles but those are the ones that have affected me in the last 30 minutes.<p>On the other hand the biggest hassle from my desktop is ssh connections time out if I suspend the machine overnight.<p>(I&#x27;ve used ubuntu LTS on the desktop since 2006, before then it was debian testing since 1999)')
