You can also evaluate &quot;sizeof(variable_name)&quot; to get its exact size.<p>You&#x27;ll see a bunch of bytes reflecting how exactly your variable is seen by the CPU. That&#x27;s exactly how many RAM bytes it occupies. It can quickly copied to a new location, limited only by your RAM bandwidth. It can be dumped to a disk and loaded later, limited only by your disk bandwidth.')
