It is harmful to society, and unfair - it takes less time to invent a new hoax than to fact-check it.<p>Just like loitering on the ground is considered an offence, so should be publishing fake news. It doesn&#x27;t hurt one person, but it hurts society.<p>There also are objective criteria for determining if something is fake or not - so it is possible to create laws that forbid it and don&#x27;t limit a freedom of opinion.')
