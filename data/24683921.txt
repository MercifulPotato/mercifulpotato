This took us a lot of time and effort, but we finally have basic experimental support for running simple graphical applications. It requires some special setup for now though, so do not expect it to work out of the box just yet.<p>GUI support seems not to be ready yet, but when it is, it looks like they&#x27;re using cocotron, so it&#x27;ll look something like any of the examples you see on this page: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cocotron.org&#x2F;Examples&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cocotron.org&#x2F;Examples&#x2F;</a>')
