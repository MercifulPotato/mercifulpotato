I was curious on what constitutes racism in the east vs. the west and I don&#x27;t have experience in the east. I&#x27;m also not disregarding anywhere in between the countries of the east and west.<p>I know of the historical factors but that&#x27;s like saying Germans are still racist because they have a history of being Nazis - I was more interested in what kind of experiences of racism between Asia are happening in modern times which I&#x27;ve seen you&#x27;ve written so thanks for that. I was also curious whether there were any parallels in one of the bigger issues like police brutality of minorities in Asia.<p>There is a whole other discussion when talking about true hate vs. stereotyping.')
