Item(by='Hello71', descendants=None, kids=[24930351], score=None, time=1603976777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929836, text='Even ignoring the fact that your plan as described falls within the specified range ($60&#x2F;month&#x2F;11 GB = $5.45&#x2F;month&#x2F;GB), I have never heard of plans or overage charges this cheap from any of the three major Canadian wireless providers. Last year, the three major providers simultaneously increased the price of the well-publicized $60&#x2F;10 GB offer by at least $5&#x2F;month. I&#x27;m not aware of any standard plans offering more for less, although you may be able to bargain for less. You may also be able to find slightly cheaper rates with a smaller provider, but despite offering nominally nation-wide coverage, the practical coverage usually ends up being substantially poorer.<p>Regarding overage charges, I would be genuinely shocked if anybody, including a minor provider, has overage under $10&#x2F;GB, seeing as by your own admission, even your standard rate exceeds $5&#x2F;GB. Rogers overages are $70&#x2F;GB, Bell is $110-120&#x2F;GB, Telus is a whopping $130&#x2F;GB. If overage charges are under the normal rate, then that&#x27;s not an overage, that&#x27;s pay-as-you-go.')
