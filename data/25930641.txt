Half the stuff on a modern webpage—even those you&#x27;d still call documents rather than apps—can only really convey meaning via visual layout, and so break down when divorced from CSS&#x2F;JS.<p>For example: I&#x27;m a big fan of reader mode in browsers, but so often they&#x27;re tripped up by basic UI affordances like menus and image galleries. The renderer has to guess at what&#x27;s content and what isn&#x27;t, so half the time any sort of &quot;widget&quot; is rendered as a crappy-looking vertical list. Sure, that&#x27;s technically what a menu or gallery is at its most basic level, but surely we can do better?<p>There probably are sensible defaults you can already follow—representing a menu as a &lt;nav&gt; containing &lt;li&gt;s, say. But it would be much easier if there was a &lt;nav-item&gt; tag. A &lt;nav-item&gt; inside a &lt;nav&gt; would semantically be a menu in the same way that &lt;li&gt; inside &lt;ol&gt; is semantically an ordered list—you don&#x27;t need any CSS to render that in a sensible way.<p>Same goes for galleries; if we had a &lt;gallery&gt; tag that could contain &lt;main-image&gt; and &lt;thumbnail&gt;s, you&#x27;d still be able to do custom layout with CSS if you needed to, but at the base level you could sensibly render it with just the markup itself.<p>I dunno, I just find it weird that we added all these new tags for HTML5 years ago then just stopped bothering. I mean when was the last time a HTML element with <i>behaviour</i> was added?<p>In an ideal world a reader mode could be expanded to a &quot;reader-friendly page mode&quot; wherein the page still looked approximately like the normal webpage, just without all the user-hostile shit. Of course, that&#x27;s usually diametrically opposed to the financial incentives of running a website, but it&#x27;s nice to think about.')
