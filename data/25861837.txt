I&#x27;ve always wondered if they were worked.<p>They work, though I don&#x27;t like the inflatable ones much and prefer those filled with microbeads like a bean-bag even though they&#x27;re less portable. I haven&#x27;t yet tried one with memory foam and an inflatable core or the even fancier types since I tend to lose them while I&#x27;m stumbling bleary-eyed off the plane (I&#x27;ve also lost books, hats, scarfs, &amp; sweaters this way, basically anything that might not be stowed in the carry-on bag).<p>BTW, don&#x27;t buy a neck pillow at the airport, the options are very limited, the prices high, and you probably won&#x27;t be able to return it if necessary (poss. even if you kept the receipt).')
