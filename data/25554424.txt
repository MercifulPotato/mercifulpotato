Zerg tends to be the defensive, macro-heavy race and Terran tends to be the offensive, scrappy race.<p>Though some Zerg players like Reynor are starting to buck this trend a bit and are known for more aggressive, agile approaches.<p>(Or at least this was all the case as of about a year ago; haven&#x27;t followed the game much this year.)')
