It seems like Rust is mentioned solely for attention in this case.  Would &quot;A better way to search through academic literature&quot; have been popular?  Probably.  How about &quot;A better way to search through academic literature written in Java&quot;?  I assume not.<p>Regarding moderation, its a thankless task which I don&#x27;t envy and its hard to draw a line over nitpicky article titles when one has been voted in already.')
