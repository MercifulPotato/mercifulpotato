This only happened after laws like SESTA &#x2F; FOSTA got passed and I don&#x27;t think they really wanted to do it. The porn purge reduced revenues and made services like tumblr even worse off.  Before that they didn&#x27;t really give a shit about it beyond CSAM.<p>As far as payment companies go, the anti porn stance comes from Visa, Mastercard and Amex and their backing banks, and maybe US govt policy.<p>If you want porn to have a safe space in the USA, get rid of laws like SESTA &#x2F; FOSTA and prevent discrimination of payment processing on the basis of sex work.  It&#x27;s the political and finance industry that is ultimately responsible for this.<p>Also I think if SV was hypothetically female dominated, the anti-sex work attitudes would actually be increased.  AFAIK the groups that pushed laws like SESTA or FOSTA were definitely more female led. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;11&#x2F;11203740&#x2F;prostitution-legal-men-women-poll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;11&#x2F;11203740&#x2F;prostitution-legal-me...</a>')
