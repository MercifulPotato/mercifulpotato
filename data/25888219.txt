Enough protein and fibre to fill you up.<p>Eating low calorie is not expensive, it&#x27;s just not very exciting.<p>Until recently you could also get something like this at mcdonalds (grilled chicken burger or wrap).<p>Added sugar is not good, but fat free products are a great choice for dieters who want more variety.
