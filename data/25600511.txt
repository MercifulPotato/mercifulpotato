I love him. I still need to get around to finishing Wheel of Time just so I can get to his parts.<p>I really wasn’t crazy about Dune Messiah. It was just okay. The whole prescient man that can’t accept the future is changeable is so frustrating. The thought it got much better toward the end though. Children of Dune is great so far. His kids are the manifestation of the answer to all my grievances with Paul in DM. I think DM will be one of those books that’s good in retrospect when contextualized within the entire story. On it’s own, it’s pretty meh. It’s short though.<p>And Foundation is great!')
