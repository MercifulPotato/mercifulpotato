A friend of my brother works for a company that makes unrelated clothing, furniture, and other comfort type items.    They make all of their products here in the USA. They started up mask production in march.  They&#x27;re high quality washable cloth masks.  I bought a few and have been using them when I need to go out.  They&#x27;re about twice the price of similar ones on amazon but much higher quality.<p>As for mass produced surgical masks?  Yeah we don&#x27;t have the manufacturing base for that sort of thing anymore unfortunately.')
