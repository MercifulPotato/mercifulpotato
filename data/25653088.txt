I can read hard books.<p>Back in the 80&#x27;s I started seeing so many raves for TBotNS that I went out and bought them all at once.<p>About 80 pages into the first one, I was turned off, bored really. They sat on my shelf for a decade at least, before I just gave them away.<p>My question is this: how long did it take you to &quot;get into&quot; this series. Should I have plowed on further? Or tried a restart? (I read the first 100 pages of Dune about 3 times before it clicked, and I loved it all after that)<p>Or is it a taste&#x2F;style thing, and if someone doesn&#x27;t like it within 80 pages, they&#x27;re not likely to enjoy the rest?')
