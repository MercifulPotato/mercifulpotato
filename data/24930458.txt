I know anything returned `err` is safe to display back to the user<p>2. Using the array (as opposed to an object) can allow me to name the values when I destructure so it can be used multiple times in the same block with useful naming.<p>3. I can destructure just the first half `[isValid]` if that’s all I care about.<p>4. More generally it helps keep the code readable. Other control flows might rely on some casting, assumptions, or exceptions but this way presents a nice customizable api for users writing the code, and a readable api for those reviewing the code.')
