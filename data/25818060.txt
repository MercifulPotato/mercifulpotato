Dennis Prager&#x27;s video on the Ten Commandments was demonetized and the reason given?  &quot;It contains the word &#x27;kill&#x27;. Dangerous for children.&quot;<p>They have extremely rigid standards for conservatives and very loose standards for everybody else.  That&#x27;s a real thing and it&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t see until you are one of those whose views are being targeted.<p>Ultimately, I predict that conservative discourse will take a similar path to MP3s: first, it will be targeted by the big powers-that-be.  Next, technologies will appear that make it impossible to police or shut down.  Finally, corporate America will realize that it&#x27;s better to work with people than fight them and the discourse will be brought back into the fold and corporations will once again make money off of it.')
