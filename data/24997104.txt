We empower writing tasks naturally.<p>Defining a fully descriptive task in traditional tools is not a simple process. You’ve to start writing the task title, description, and additional form fields for task status, priority, assignee, etc. It means there are some ceremonies to be followed.<p>Working for many years with different remote and office teams, I saw that every team develops its own ubiquitous language. This is more emphasized especially when it comes to daily tasks description language. This level of understanding helps the project team to communicate quickly while eliminating inaccuracies and contradictions; and that’s an attribute of a – smart team.<p>Describing a task in a natural way using one single box, without the need for multiple form fields, makes the task data entry process trivial and helps the team focus on delivering – what’s most important for an agile team – values.<p>A flat team is responsible enough to focus on productivity and move the tasks to #done.  However, they should have a proper tool to achieve that – that’s where Ambra comes.<p>An example: Hey @ troy we need #todo a #presentation of the website to the customer #urgent. You immediately know the status of the task, who&#x27;s in charge for and when it&#x27;s needed.<p>Ambra is offered as freemium, you can go now and create your first project, invite your teammates, or just start assigning tasks to yourself and feel the simplicity.<p>We love to hear your feedback.')
