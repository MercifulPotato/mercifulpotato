At this point many will say &quot;well why are you working in this industry then&quot;? Well I tried the alternatives, and they were way worse. I need money to survive in this world, and programming gives me the best bang for my buck. Most other industries require working longer hours doing less interesting work making less money with less freedom.<p>If it&#x27;s really so bad that you&#x27;re miserable, just take some time off. Either you&#x27;ll find something else you enjoy doing more and leave programming for good, or you&#x27;ll eventually be so bored (and broke) that programming might sound appealing again.')
