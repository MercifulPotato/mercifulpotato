If they haven&#x27;t seen the writing on the wall, they&#x27;re ignorant.<p>SF has itself to blame. They squandered revenue, didn&#x27;t fix real issues, and pandered to land owners.<p>Businesses will move to more business friendly cities, and they will become more distributed - it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to negotiate that way.<p>SF is done.')
