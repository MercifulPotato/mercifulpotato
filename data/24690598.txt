Thus patient-centered care has replaced a one-sided, doctor-dominated relationship in which the exercise of power distorts the decision-making process for both parties.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.ijsu.2006.01.005" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.ijsu.2006.01.005</a><p>(Although if it was written by surgeons, might take it with a grain of salt.)<p>Definitely an arrogant physician is something that will hopefully fade into obscurity as patients become more educated, and medicine becomes more corporate &#x27;customer-centered&#x27; and less solo practice.<p>With regards to patient intuition, that&#x27;s actually a field of active research. When do you trust patient intuition, and when do you not?<p><i>&quot;Intuition, like analytical reasoning, is fallible. However, we suggest conditions under which clinicians and patients should take patient intuition seriously. We invite empirical investigation of these conditions, which relate to the credibility (or accuracy) of the intuition and its meaning and significance to the patient. More generally, research is needed on non-conscious and automatic processes of decision-making and on how patient intuition can complement rather than oppose reasoned thinking in jointly shaping patient and clinician judgments, decision-making and action. Such research may help to integrate the processes of intuition and reasoning used by patients and clinicians in decision-making, with a goal of improving the patient-clinician relationship and health outcomes.&quot;</i><p>Buetow SA, Mintoft B.
