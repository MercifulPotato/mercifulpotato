There are many data centers that will give you BGP access to then announce that IP range and route it to your servers. The result will be that whois tools will not actually report which data center you&#x27;re in, but will report &quot;Uncensorable Inc&quot; or whatever you choose to call yourself. No one will know which company to tweet at to try to have you deplatformed.<p>I&#x27;ll be trying to do this to see if it works, if I succeed I&#x27;ll post a story or two here with a demo and how-to instructions.')
