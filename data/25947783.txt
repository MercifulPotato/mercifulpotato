The downside is the drift between internal structs and the IDL structs, but the upside is you can use the same &quot;memory dump&quot; on interpreted runtimes or entirely different platforms (even those with different endians). Plus impls like protobuf help guard against breaking backward-compatibility by numbering fields and not &quot;allowing&quot; you to remove fields in ways that would change the structs&#x27; ABIs.')
