If you don&#x27;t trust the people you&#x27;re messaging, then don&#x27;t message them. Trying to build a platform that guarantees security regardless of who you message is a fallacy, that system doesn&#x27;t exist and people shouldn&#x27;t think about security in those terms. If you send someone information, you can not guarantee with any messaging system that they won&#x27;t copy that information and send it to someone else. Recipient trust is part of the equation.<p>Any one of your friends can just copy and paste text out of iMessage, you have no technical guarantee that your messages are going to stay in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem. If you send a message to someone with an Android phone, it gets sent in plaintext over SMS. If they&#x27;re in a group chat, boom, no more encryption. Apple themselves can&#x27;t keep your data in the iMessage environment, they exfiltrate it for you whenever you text someone who&#x27;s not on iOS.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t have any friends on Android, all of the data that you&#x27;re worried about leaking gets stored non-E2E encrypted to Apple&#x27;s servers whenever anyone in your messaging pool turns on backups -- and I <i>guarantee</i> most of your contacts on iOS have backups turned on.<p>But you&#x27;re worried about security flaws in the Matrix protocol? Based on what?<p>If you actually need E2E encryption, you shouldn&#x27;t be using iMessage in the first place, you should be using something like Signal, a program where the default settings for you and your contacts aren&#x27;t going to leak your messages and break their encryption. And at least Signal warns you in advance if a contact isn&#x27;t on the same platform. At least it works on multiple operating systems so you aren&#x27;t virtually guaranteed that it&#x27;ll be impossible to do E2E chat with some of your friends.')
