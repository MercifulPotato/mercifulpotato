In either, try to open an SFTP folder as if it is local, or integrate Git status icons into finder (all easy to do on KDE and Gnome). Good Luck.<p>The number of copy+paste bugs and QuickLook hanging issues on Mac is not even funny.<p>Just look at all the enhancers like Norton Commander and Path Finder, and you can see that even calling the OS Windows didn&#x27;t make MS put too much effort into their windows.')
