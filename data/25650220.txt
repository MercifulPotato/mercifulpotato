Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609876726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649062, text='&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not talking about security in general.<p>&gt; You can say that now, but that&#x27;s not what you said previously. &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;trade-off&quot; when it comes to cyber security&quot;<p>I literally followed that up by &quot;either commit to it fully or don&#x27;t use 2FA at all&quot;. You omitted crucial context there. Now I could have expressed that more clearly, sure, but the context is right there nonetheless.<p>&gt;&gt; the CEO running the show is in an entirely different category<p>&gt; Not sure what you mean by this.<p>What I mean is that the guy is not just &quot;a CEO&quot; - it&#x27;s <i>the</i> CEO of the very company in question here. So what I&#x27;m saying is that someone <i>within</i> an organisation - let alone the head of said organisation - has very different tools at their disposal than can or should be provided to their users.<p>&gt; It is full of amateurs. Just because you don&#x27;t find someone&#x27;s work valuable, doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t. Saying &quot;Well it&#x27;s not professional, so if you lost it then it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; is not correct.<p>Amateurs don&#x27;t lose 10s of thousands of dollars from losing their GH account. Again - omitting context. If your data isn&#x27;t valuable to you (be that in terms of money of for sentimental reasons) then it doesn&#x27;t matter indeed. Just like you&#x27;d protect physical assets, non-physical assets require protection as well and if you don&#x27;t do that, said assets cannot be of much value to you, no?<p>&gt; But people are human beings. Even if 99% of people have perfect back ups, that&#x27;s still 560k (according to Github home page numbers) that will have failed backups or some other issue.<p>So what you&#x27;re suggesting is putting 100% of users at risk because there&#x27;s the odd chance that someone might lose data? That&#x27;s just not reasonable at all.<p>&gt; you keep widely including the term &quot;decentralized&quot;, as if just because git is decentralized, that nothing on Github should matter.<p>Because it <i>does</i> matter in that all you need to do is to keep a local copy of your repo. With a centralised system you&#x27;d lose the most important part of the repo: the complete commit history and all branches.<p>This is not the case with git and &quot;all&quot; you&#x27;d lose would be external configuration, issues and Wiki pages, but even those can easily be exported and saved externally.<p>You can even re-import all of that to a new account if need be. Heck, you can setup triggers that synchronise the entire repo - including issues, projects and wiki to other providers or a local copy if you really want&#x2F;need to.<p>The fact that millions rely on services like GH, GL, and BB doesn&#x27;t change the nature of git.<p>Again - if your data is important to you - be that for monetary or private reasons - don&#x27;t keep it in one place. Especially if that place can be locked away from you at any time for any odd reason. I don&#x27;t understand why people these days have such a hard time understanding this, but using GH implies that you put your data on someone else&#x27;s machine with little to no guarantees whatsoever.<p>None of these multi-million and billion dollar corporation deserve <i>any</i> of our trust and using their services comes with strings attached. Whining doesn&#x27;t help - being aware of this and becoming a responsible and critical user who knows their options is what helps avoiding disasters like this.<p>PS: you should really start by looking into how git itself works (especially compared to centralised repos like SVN) to actually understand the importance of decentraised version control.')
