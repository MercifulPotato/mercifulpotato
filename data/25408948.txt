I know its survivor bias, but I dont want to waste my time on something both terribly written and outside my echo chamber.<p>One usability tweak based on how I interacted with it would be to add a &#x27;I already like this&#x27; button to suggested books to save me from re-adding them. It also suggested another H.P. Lovecraft novel despite me already marking At the Mountains of Madness as a liked book, I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you like one Lovecraft book, you&#x27;d like the rest.<p>The one recommendation I had a strong negative reaction to was by Jeffrey Archer which I guess means that its the book I should read next.')
