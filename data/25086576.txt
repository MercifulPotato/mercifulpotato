I&#x27;ve seen people do it.<p>You can have no emergency savings (at all) and be making $100k+.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy - spend everything you have (often on &quot;dumb&quot; things like expensive takeout for every meal, a lease on a car you don&#x27;t need, more house than you can afford, refreshing electronics constantly for no reason, etc.).<p>The reasons usually boil down to lack of emotional regulation and&#x2F;or bad spending habits, not lack of income - though it is easier to do with low income, as the margins are smaller.')
