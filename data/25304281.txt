Generally the issue is that it&#x27;s hard to enforce that against bad users.<p>The few times I&#x27;ve written scrapers, one of the things I&#x27;ve done is put contact information in the user-agent so that if there is an issue, the site admins can reach out. So far that&#x27;s worked out ok for me.')
