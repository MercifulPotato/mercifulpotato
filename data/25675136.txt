I have no answer to that, it&#x27;s entirely up to you to work out which section has the information you need or want.<p>I guess the best heuristic is probably to let the HTML section take precedence, as a lot of modern clients will display it as the default and it is therefore likely to be the tested&#x2F;correct one. Text is usually only used as a fallback.')
