According to those you consider to be under delusions, you yourself are under one, and they are in fact seeing the truth for what it really is. It would be nice if it were as simple as some sort of Ministry of Truth, but that idea has been explored well enough in theory that it doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to try as a real experiment. But maybe it&#x27;s inevitable that society reaches a point where that seems attractive, and we try it and live out something more  closely approximating 1984 than life already does (we already are there tech wise, smart TVs are telescreens, they just aren&#x27;t quite as obviously sinister yet). And then we learn our lesson and some improved iteration of society emerges thereafter.')
