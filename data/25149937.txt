A website consisting of 100% static content seems to be fully okay according to their metrics - but funnily enough, some months ago they claimed that 50% of the pages were served too slowly on computers, while 100% of pages were OK on mobile. Same static server. Now it&#x27;s the other way around, they randomly say that a random selection of pages is too slow on mobile, and it changes every day. Maybe it&#x27;s just <i>their own</i> connection that sucks? It also doesn&#x27;t help that they keep using acronyms for the broken stuff that aren&#x27;t explained everywhere on the page itself.')
