Lots of systems parse URLs out of emails and follow them, you probably want to look for a a pre-existing session cookie, or insist the user log in from the verification page and confirm this is what they wanted.<p>Otherwise you&#x27;ve merely got two unrelated facts:<p>1. Some user of your system (maybe happy_pancake) says bob@example.com is their email address<p>2. Mail to bob@example.com is received by a machine or person which reads web pages.<p>It would be foolish to conclude from these facts that happy_pancake is actually bob@example.com or that bob@example.com wants to use your service.')
