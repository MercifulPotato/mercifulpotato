If tagging a site about dogs as &quot;cats&quot; gets 5% more visitors, even if they&#x27;re pissed off it will still translate into more sales.<p>Further, getting everyone to agree on semantics is impossible.<p>You can already see this in action on soundcloud. Search for any music category and you won&#x27;t be 5 songs in until you find a song that doesn&#x27;t fit the category. Whether that&#x27;s because the creator legitimately thought the tag belonged or if they just thought it would get them more listens it doesn&#x27;t really matter. What matters is the tags become useless<p>I see this on many sites.<p>Stack Overflow uses tags to add semantics. It only kind of works because of a vast army of volunteers fixing the tags.')
