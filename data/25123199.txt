When one clicks &quot;Book&quot; and then suddenly get an Internal Server Error in network logs (while UI shows in-progress icon) or gets logged out - where is Fair Access? If Railways gave 10 Rs for each such failure, they will go bankrupt within 2 hours. First-come-first-serve does not mean fair access when they can&#x27;t fix their technical problems.<p>I am not sure if you know the history of IRCTC and why it is slow (at times. Things have vastly improved in the last decade). People have asked this many a times and their explanation does make some sense, that if IRCTC is super fast and efficient, then people with cash to spare&#x2F;with computers and good internet access will hog all the tickets, denying people in rural areas a fair opportunity to purchase tickets. That is still probably true in 2020, because a good chunk of Indians in rural areas either do not have good internet connectivity, lack digital means of payment or are simply flummoxed by the online process.<p>From your perspective, IRCTC is not fair access because the servers slow down but from the govt perspective, fair access is not limited to only IRCTC users. There might be an argument that railways has a low capacity overall and that there is a long way to go for efficiency improvements etc but given my experience over last 12 years, the experience has improved drastically. Wait times have gone down considerably on a lot of trains, you no longer have to plan your travel 6 months in advance, you can buy tatkal tickets without paying scalpers etc. In 2018 I could even book tickets (from home) on a train which had already departed from its source station (my departure point was halfway between the origin and destination) and people around me did not believe that this was possible.')
