At that point (having a need for a Controller role), the customer should be doing between $40MM-$50MM in ARR&#x2F;annual turnover. With that said, Finmark should expect to have to provide more value to a customer than a single Controller role would. This also might help with encouraging CFOs not to attempt to build finance fiefdoms (tools &gt; headcount).')
