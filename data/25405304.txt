Protests have never attracted more than a fringe of conspiracy theorists etc. As for the press, the media in Poland is nearly wholly controlled by the government, and so will not necessarily challenge the minister of health. Then there are countries like Finland where politics is consensus-based, and so is the press, so once all parties have broadly agreed on restrictions, it is unseemly to raise objections.<p>Apparently politicians in many EU countries have decided that they are politically vulnerable if they open up, not if they simply keep the status quo of restrictions going.<p>As for &quot;struggling to get people to comply&quot;, actually EU countries have been quite effective in ensuring that restaurants and theatres ordered to close stay closed. There are some countries elsewhere on earth where business owners have been able to bribe the authorities to look the other way, but that doesn&#x27;t happen in EU countries.')
