Why wouldn&#x27;t this just be an opt in thing? It could even be tied to the account being used.  It&#x27;s not like AWS accounts are expensive or hard to setup.<p>If a user opts in to the &quot;kill if bill goes too high&quot; and they kill a critical portion of their business, then that&#x27;s on them.  Similar to how a user choosing spot instances if their spot ends up being destroyed.  You&#x27;ve already got that &quot;I can kill your stuff if you opt into it&quot; capability.<p>&gt; On the other hand retroactively forgiving the cost of unexpected&#x2F;unintentional usage doesnt impact the customers users.<p>Yeah, and what happens if someone isn&#x27;t big enough to justify AWS&#x27;s forgiveness?  What if they get a rep that blows off their request or is having a bad day?  You are at the mercy of your cloud provider to forgive a debt, which is a real shitty place to be for anyone.<p>&gt; And with billing alerts the customer is able to make the choice of whether the cost is worth it as it happens.<p>And what do they do if they miss the alert?  You can rack up  a huge bill in very little time the right AWS services.<p>The point of the kill switch cap is to guard against risk. The fact is that that while 72k isn&#x27;t too big for some companies, it means bankruptcy for others.  Its because you might want to give your devs a training account to play with AWS services to gain expertise, but you don&#x27;t want them to blow $1 million dollars screwing around with Amazon satellite services.')
