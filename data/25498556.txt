As a linux&#x2F;Unix shell i like bash - it&#x27;s posix enough that you can write posix-ish scripts (might have to run on ksh&#x2F;bsds) - and these days it has good completion and other niceties. And unless you make an effort, it doesn&#x27;t colorize everything to the point that it looks like your user land threw up on your terminal.<p>Other worth looking at IMNHO ibnclude rc from plan9, fish and oilsh. And maybe dash for a small runtime for scripts.')
