There are no details at all, so it seems fake and superficial.<p>I do agree with the general sentiment of the parent post though. Having managed IT (operations not development) when good work is done, often the intention is that no one notices. Therefore the broader organisation may not have sufficient awareness that anything of value has been achieved.<p>In such circumstances I believe it is up to the manager to both manage up in terms of making the team&#x27;s achievement known and recognised, as well as represent the organisation and  acknowledge the team&#x27;s work.<p>A few of the posts above are essentially prescribing using STAR to offer feedback, which I think is more thoughtful than just generic words of affirmation. This can be made even more authentic if you take the time to talk to affected stakeholders and gather real testimonials to pass back to the team.')
