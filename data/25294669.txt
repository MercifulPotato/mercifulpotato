I still get the occasional inquiry about memory fencing or memory boundaries on Console X for the 5-15Î¼s event generation API (improperly aligned memory could cause interlocked increment corruption!).<p>Annnyways:<p>I had an opportunity to chat with one of the founders at Snowflake in 2017? 2018? for a few hours. I tried to convey how imperative I felt true-realtime time series engines would be critical moving forward, an the reception was rather lukewarm. If they had been as excited as I, it&#x27;d have been one of the few opportunities to pull me away from my dream job.<p>I <i>still</i> feel the world will need this architecture, as we start moving towards more ML&#x2F;AI driven decision making, and that the company which can get traction will be in a pivotal position moving forward.<p>Sometimes I wonder about feeling pressured to shift into Data &amp; Applied Science to stay at that org (there just didn&#x27;t seem to be vertical opportunities in the dev track). I excel in this job too, and I love what I work on... but dang sometimes I feel that the architect career path had even bigger impact potential. It was a fun couple decades. :P')
