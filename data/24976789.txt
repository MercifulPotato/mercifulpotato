Say you setup a licensing company on an island nation that use to then charge yourself $10,000 a month to license the software you wrote... that you transferred there.  Now lets say you want to buy a house and you bring back a certain amount of money.  That money is taxable and that is where people mess up they don&#x27;t report it.<p>Big companies like Apple instead of bringing the money back they borrow billions of dollars at low interest rates.  This lets them keep their money offshore where they invest it to make a bigger return then their interest rate on borrowing in the US.<p>Apple also has a routine for money in the US.  You will find in Nevada Apple has an investment corporation.  They will do the same thing, send the ownership of software to Nevada, charge their company in some xyz state (CA) and then they use that money in Nevada to invest it for more money then it costs them to borrow.  So apple is covered both ways.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Braeburn_Capital#:~:text=Braeburn%20Capital%20Inc.%20is%20an,McCarran%20Boulevard%20in%20Reno" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Braeburn_Capital#:~:text=Braeb...</a>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;how-apple-dodges-billions-in-taxes-2012-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;how-apple-dodges-billions-in...</a>')
