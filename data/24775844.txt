I read <i>incomprehensible</i> instead of <i>incompressible</i>.<p>Perhaps the far universe we perceive and will perceive is not there anymore. It doesn&#x27;t have to. What we perceive is its light (or electromagnetic&#x2F;gravitational waves). Objects far away could have been <i>garbage-collected</i> millions of years ago. You don&#x27;t need to compute them anymore.<p>If the simulation has a limited time to run, then you can create and delete objects while playing with the speed of light to carry whatever information to us.<p>Edit: <i>millions of years ago</i> is not needed. They could have garbage-collected the objects as soon as they complete the time for duration of the simulation. Whatever it is, I would save this information as a template for future simulations.')
