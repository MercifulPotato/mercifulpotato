But if you&#x27;re a wage earner, house prices will appreciate faster than your wages depending how low interest rates are driven and how long they are kept there.  This results in a greater portion of one&#x27;s income over their lifetime going towards paying for their property.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing with student loans.')
