This would make it a real pain. I am explaining this to people since the birth of gmail, but no one listens.<p>&gt; Let me think for a moment, what would happen if google does this to me...<p>&gt; {lots of stuff that is impossible for the average person}<p>If you&#x27;re making the same comments to those who &quot;don&#x27;t listen&quot; then I can see why. Honestly this comes off more as a gloat post than pragmatic suggestions. And this is coming from someone who used to run all of the above.<p>The problem is, hosting your own email is actually really hard. Not only much harder to set up than it should be Particularly so considering how old the technology is -- you&#x27;d think there would be a GitLab-like solution that is a single package for all the components but no, the end user is left working out what MTA to select, then there is choices between the DB backend, user authentication, POP3 vs IMAP, and possible a web server and web site code itself (if you want web mail as well as POP &#x2F; IMAP). And that&#x27;s before you get as far as SSL, login attacks (eg fail2ban), spam protection, setting up your DNS records in the exact combination to protect yourself from being identified as spam and then finally creating your user accounts. And even after all of that, you&#x27;re still likely to find that Google and Microsoft just assume you to be spam because you&#x27;re not running on a known trusted service. It&#x27;s ridiculously hard to get right and that&#x27;s before you&#x27;ve concerned yourself with the weekly upkeep (security updates, application updates, back ups, etc). There&#x27;s a reason a great many skilled sysadmins -- including myself -- have given up bothering to run their own mail server. It&#x27;s easier to trust $COMPANY and make regular backups in case of emergency than it is to run the process in reverse.<p>...and that&#x27;s just email. Running your own cloud is also problematic -- not as difficult as email but it is still a considerable hassle and still out of the question for the average Joe.')
