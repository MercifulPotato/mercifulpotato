Does vision guide eye growth only during a narrow period in development? In tree shrews, there is clear evidence of a period of maximum sensitivity to form deprivation (Siegwart and Norton, 1998). In chicks, however, it appears that susceptibility declines steadily from the earliest period, perhaps being related to the growth rate, with older animals showing consistent but smaller responses to form deprivation (Wallman et al., 1987), even up to 1 year of age (Papastergiou et al., 1998). Adolescent marmosets and rhesus macaques also show decreased, but still significant, form-deprivation myopia Smith et al. 1999, Troilo et al. 2000b. In humans as well, there is evidence of changes in ocular dimensions in young adults associated with the progression of myopia, perhaps related to visual tasks (McBrien and Adams, 1997). Thus, the young adult eye is still subject to visually guided growth.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0896627304004933" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S089662730...</a>')
