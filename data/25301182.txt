I was a Vim zealot that converted over with Spacemacs, but I ditched Spacemacs once I knew the names of the packages I used the most. The package `evil` is enough to satisfy your modal editing needs (perhaps you already knew about it). Anything that doesn&#x27;t fit your workflow can be changed to fit into that same modal editing paradigm. It just takes time but it&#x27;s worth it in my humble opinion.<p>Just remember: Emacs&#x27; main strength comes from how malleable and extensible it can be. Give it time; don&#x27;t jump ship after a few bumps. Patch it up with some Elisp and keep sailing.')
