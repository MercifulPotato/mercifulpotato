If you want to be extra paranoid, make it an optical link. Or wireless transmit-only if that fits your application. Downside is you need more bandwidth since you can&#x27;t have the receiver ask for a specific subset of data.<p>The trouble always starts when someone wants remote inputs for some reason. Then you really need to start to think about a) how to protect the gateway systems and b) how to make sure that even if the gateway is cracked the damage is limited.')
