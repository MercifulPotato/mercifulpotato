When a photographer takes a picture, the camera manufacturer contributed to the result (some smartphones even add a &quot;shot with X camera&quot; watermark by default) but that doesn&#x27;t mean they own copyright. When an author uses a spell checker that suggests a correction, that doesn&#x27;t grant the spell checker copyright of the resulting novel.<p>The copyright owner of a mechanically produced creative work is the person who provided the input, not the person who built the mechanism.')
