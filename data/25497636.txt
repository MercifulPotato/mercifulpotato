The image quality is fantastic and extremely competitive. The image-stabilisation works superbly, and the autofocus is very good - much better than their older lenses.<p>I mostly photograph birds and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the quality. All the recent bird photos I&#x27;ve uploaded are taken with it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;robotmay&#x2F;50528664881&#x2F;in&#x2F;dateposted-public&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;robotmay&#x2F;50528664881&#x2F;in&#x2F;datepo...</a>')
