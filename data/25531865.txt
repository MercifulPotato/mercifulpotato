I grew up surrounded by nature but it was mostly flat and not very varied. I went to my first park (Mt. Rainier) at over 30 years old and it honestly completely changed my outlook on nature. Try to get a chance to get away from the crowds however you can and just stop and be surrounded by one of the most majestic natural places in the world. It can very much be a spiritual or at least very meditative experience. I canâ€™t wait to camp out once the kids are older.')
