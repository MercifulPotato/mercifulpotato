I thought that my new touch typing skill would transfer, but it didn&#x27;t. I still try now and again to properly touch type, but it&#x27;s slow and with a lot of mistakes. So this practice site looks very interesting to me as well!<p>Some people say that they can easily switch back and forth between qwerty and dvorak, but it turns out that I couldn&#x27;t. I still miss the speed and ease of dvorak, but I also enjoy being able to quickly use any keyboard now.')
