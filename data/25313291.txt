Dirt, grime and dust collects between the fibers and abrade them.<p>Obviously don&#x27;t wash your jeans every time you wear them, but once a month if you wear them all the time is fine. Low temperature, gentle cycle, <i>never</i> tumble dry because that really wears out fabrics fast. Consider using liquid wool detergent, since it&#x27;s more gentle and doesn&#x27;t have abrasive particles.<p>Another good tip is to wear clothes on alternate days, and let them hang to air out between wears. Give them a good shake before putting them on, that takes care of a lot of dry dirt and dust, reducing abrasion.<p>Steaming works really well for wool and wool blends, for freshening up items that are nominally dry clean only. A clothes brush and a steamer can put off the need for dry cleaning for a long time. Spot cleaning takes care of actual stains and steaming loosens the fibers so they release a lot of the dirt stuck to them. Plus it should kill off most of any bacteria, too.<p>And don&#x27;t buy Levi&#x27;s, their quality is mediocre now.')
