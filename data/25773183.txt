Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610608641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761196, text='&gt; <i>I&#x27;m using software for fee but, I&#x27;m also beta-testing for free.</i><p>Assuming you&#x27;re talking about a beta release for some open source software package, versus a full release, I don&#x27;t think the distinction matters.  You&#x27;re using software that you got for free.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s beta- or release-quality.  You aren&#x27;t entitled to different&#x2F;better support for it just because the developer chose to put out a version they admit isn&#x27;t quite release-quality[0].  You&#x27;re entitled to exactly the same amount of support as for a release version: none whatsoever.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;I derive value from a free product so I should never complain.&quot;</i><p>I think that&#x27;s framed the wrong way.  I do agree that you should probably never <i>complain</i> about something you got for free; that smacks of undeserved entitlement.  But constructive criticism and useful bug reports are (usually, depending on the maintainer) welcome.<p>[0] A developer might put out a beta version for a variety of reasons.  One reason, yes, might be because they intend to jump on support requests faster in order to shape things up for a proper release.  But another reason might be because they simply wanted to share with people as soon as possible.')
