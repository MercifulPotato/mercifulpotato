I have 8 years of experience in software, working on data management and business intelligence platforms. I’ve spent the past 3 years in an enterprise SaaS company and the problem space has gotten old for me.<p>I&#x27;m especially interested in building data products, AI&#x2F;ML, enterprise software, financial services and&#x2F;or health &amp; fitness services. I recently completed YC’s Future Founders course with an idea for a data discovery platform. I’m in the customer research stage and have not started building yet. I&#x27;m open to other ideas and missions as well.<p>I&#x27;m an intermediate coder (Python) and have built simple applications. I would prefer working with a technical co-founder, but open to non-technical co-founders if our interests and skills match. I&#x27;m willing to code as needed to develop the product. I would do well working on the business and PM side.<p>I&#x27;m very collaborative, analytical and pragmatic. Reach out and we can chat? lgenung at gmail')
