Most people I know living this lifestyle have a very lax viewpoint on the concept that remote working around the world incurs special tax liabilities&#x2F;visa requirements. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s actually true or if living in countries for 2 months at a time for the purpose of remote working does create tax &amp; visa nightmares.<p>Do you have any advice for US citizens who might be interested in taking up that sort of lifestyle? In particular, are there countries that are trivially amenable to such arrangements or certain types of employment contracts &#x2F; job arrangements that help provide legal cover for perpetually travelling employees?')
