A neighbour (African American) told me how in the early 90s he was in Sydney and decided to see how he could support the &quot;people of colour&quot;.  He went to Redfern and found that all the dark people were giving him the hate stare.  He found this confusing.<p>I pointed out to him that to our Indigenous people, being coloured didn&#x27;t make him a brother (usually &quot;cousin&quot; amongst Aboriginal Australians), in fact he was just another invader.<p>Assumptions about colour don&#x27;t always apply in different countries.')
