I don&#x27;t know what it was (blimp, foreign aircraft, whatever), though I doubt it was extraterrestrial. (Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence)<p>I couldn&#x27;t spot anything obviously wrong with Mr. Fravor&#x27;s story by itself.<p>On the other hand, if the DoD wanted to nudge their pilots to report things they see, and had a story like David Fravor&#x27;s to put out there in order to encourage current pilots to report what they see, that would be a propaganda event to encourage, so to speak, at least by declassifying harmless footage and not squashing the story.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Eco2s3-0zsQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Eco2s3-0zsQ</a>')
