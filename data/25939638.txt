Besides, I&#x27;ll have 350km range and will charge mostly at home.<p>The dealerships of Nissan, however, are terrible and don&#x27;t care about EVs. I&#x27;ve come close to impulsively buying a Tesla from their website a few times, but the ridiculous fee for a paint job gives me a really bad impression that it&#x27;s junk luxury (and I think that&#x27;s unfortunately how most ordinary people view EVs).')
