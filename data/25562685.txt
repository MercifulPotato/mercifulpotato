Nobody doing this is also writing a large RPG or even a Mario style platformer.<p>So, you can do it, but you spend a massive amount of &quot;scope points&quot; doing it.<p>The language tooling is much the same way. To do games - big or small - you need lots of I&#x2F;O handling, and this immediately leads you towards talking to the OS directly, which leads you towards either C or C++ because that&#x27;s where the tools and resources are. You can get a binding of SDL or whatever for your language, but that&#x27;s effectively limiting the scope of your engagement with I&#x2F;O - if the framework doesn&#x27;t work, you have to debug it across a binding layer which is always iffy. And it can really hurt when talking about console dev.')
