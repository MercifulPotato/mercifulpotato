We didn&#x27;t get into the current situation because Google deliberately chose to make their algorithm friendly to marketers; we got here because marketers competed with each other to rank up in search results, effectively reverse-engineering Google&#x27;s algorithm in an effort to exploit it. This would happen to <i>any</i> search algorithm that was widely adopted enough that marketers started trying to optimise for it.<p>(Google <i>has</i> deliberately slanted their news results towards mainstream sources in an attempt to suppress political messaging that they consider unacceptable, but it&#x27;s not clear whether this is having an impact on the specific problem of commercial results drowning out other sources.)')
