Screening for certain mental and psychological maladies would probably reveal how mentally ill some of these people are as a result of their combat and trauma.<p>Personally speaking, I had high hopes for the BLM movement and the situation that unfolded (Blue leaks) in regards to Police brutality this summer but everyone just went back to the divisive identity politics leading up to the election instead of having a commonly held stance that transcends all party politics.<p>Most people do not realize that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have long history of further expanding the Police State. Biden passed the Crime Bill in the 90s that saw the expansion of the for profit jail system that led to lengthy sentences for petty things like drug possession crimes--all while his son turned out to be a drug addict that used his father&#x27;s position to collude with other cronys for personal gain. And Harris was an immensely corrupt Attorney General that overturned many cases in regards to police corruption using unscrupulous methods and supposedly made evidence disappear to absolve police from wrong doing.<p>I don&#x27;t know if and when people will have had enough to actually do anything and get involved anymore, but the issues discussed so far are simply symptoms of a much deeper systemic governance problem and begins with who and how elected officials are put into those positions of power and how limited options there are for any recourse for non-incumbents or established career politicians to be elected in the first place.<p>The US showed itself to be a Police state over the Summer, that cannot be denied.<p>The question is what are YOU willing to do about it and how many people in your community can you get involved and start from there. I&#x27;d make an argument for private policing, but that would require a resolve for direct activism to serve as a counter weight to these atrocities that the US populace doesn&#x27;t possess anymore. And honestly given what we&#x27;ve seen with Blackwater&#x2F;XE in private military contracting I&#x27;m sure the US would find a way to normalize this same system in the Police all over aain')
