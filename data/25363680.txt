Who&#x27;s want to sign away their copyrights so that some company can make a buck? It&#x27;s essentially proprietary software that also happens to be available open source under some as-tedious-as-possible licensing terms.<p>- Open core: Essentially proprietary software with an open source loss leader. Or for the supermarket chain variant of this business model: &quot;We&#x27;re opening a new supermarket! Free plastic buckets to the first 1000 customers&quot;, causing hours-long queues of people that really want a $2 plastic bucket for free. And as we&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s not much of a protection against big cloud providers with armies of programmers that can easily recreate whatever proprietary juice you have added on top, adapted to their particular environment.<p>- Public goods: Like Linux Foundation projects like the Linux kernel or Kubernetes. Can work, but is not the direct core value of any of the companies participating. Similarly, a company in some other industry may share some code as open source in order to reduce the maintenance burden.<p>- Free software product: The flag bearer being Redhat. Code itself may all be open source, but a company call sell a particular version of it with support, training etc. Might not get the growth numbers and scale that gets VC&#x27;s excited (as can be seen in the blog post the parent linked to), but can be sustainable.')
