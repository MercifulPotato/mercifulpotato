There&#x27;s been a move away from tests that require cultural or language specific knowledge and which instead rely on &quot;which shape in the sequence comes next&quot; type questions but they have their own set of problems in that they don&#x27;t capture linguistic ability which is a part of intelligence, and are also useless for blind people. Earlier IQ tests required a lot of culturally specific knowledge, and were often quite up front about it because they considered the possession of such knowledge to be a marker of intelligence. Generally that viewpoint is out of fashion now so test makers try to come up with tests that measure &quot;pure&quot; Intelligence, whatever that means.')
