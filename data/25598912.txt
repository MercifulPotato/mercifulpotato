Which is what brought me in. I wasn’t trying to change the world, but I’ll take free server space if they’re giving it away.<p>Then they sealed the deal when a little Echo skill I wrote for myself gave me (and continues to give me) got me $100&#x2F;month in AWS credits.<p>Combine that with every place of work using AWS, and I’m pretty much married to it. I at least know the UI, and for a programming who hates configuration, that means a lot (as far as getting in and getting out quickly).')
