This photo shows roughly one-third of their chile section: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;o3B4nZBikZCTmHFXA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;o3B4nZBikZCTmHFXA</a>  There&#x27;s no way they could possibly stock that much fresh chiles because of shelf longevity issues.<p>Also, anecdotally, I tend to cook a variety of cuisines from around the world, and the good majority of recipes use powdered, flaked, or dried chile peppers.  When raw peppers are called for it&#x27;s generally commonly available stuff like jalapenos, cayenne, and habanero.<p>All of that is to say that for the serious chile head, the kind of person who is the target market for this device, the vast majority of the chile peppers they&#x27;re gonna have access to, especially the mail-ordered ones, are gonna come in dried form, so it makes sense to optimize the device for analyzing dried chiles.  I&#x27;m a bit of a chile head myself and I wouldn&#x27;t need to bother measuring the common fresh chiles that are available in grocery stores; I already have a good understanding of them (and frankly none of them are really that spicy in the grand scheme of things; this bag of dried ghost chilis that I have, on the other hand, I&#x27;d like to see a measurement on).')
