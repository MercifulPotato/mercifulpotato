A lot of this seems to be borne out of the misunderstanding of what self esteem actually is. I remember this whole craze, I grew up in the thick of it. One thing the &quot;preachers&quot; utterly failed at is understanding and thus communicating what it even means to have self esteem.<p>Then one day I came across this most profoundly enlightening article about a commentary on self esteem by the one and only Bruce Lee <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainpickings.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;bruce-lee-artist-of-life-self-esteem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainpickings.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;bruce-lee-artist-of...</a><p>What does it mean to hold someone <i>else</i> in high esteem? One could argue it means you respect their opinion or their actions, and then they can serve as a role model, a source of validation.<p>So therefore self esteem is the critical ability to derive validation in your actions from your self.<p>Self esteem is <i>NOT</i> just believing you can do something or be great or whatever. That&#x27;s confidence. That&#x27;s got nothing to do with self esteem at all.<p>What self esteem comes down to is deriving direction, right from wrong, validation, etc. from one&#x27;s self. This is so important, because, if you derive validation through pride in reflection of others then you become a slave to those others.<p>This is what self esteem is about and why it&#x27;s so critical. The craze lost the view. But the core message is still true today.<p>Lee also recognizes the challenge in cultivating self esteem, that it requires constant effort. It&#x27;s not simply about &quot;believing it so therefore it&#x27;s true&quot; like so many self esteem preachers would have had you believe during the craze. It&#x27;s a challenge and it&#x27;s an ongoing effort, like any other kind of hygiene.<p>It&#x27;s common to suggest people think for themselves. This is impossible without cultivated self-esteem. I would argue that a huge number of people today suffer due to a lack of self esteem. The personality cults that we see destroying society today can arguably be enabled by looking to others for validation instead ourselves. It&#x27;s a drug. It&#x27;s far too easy to find outside validation now. Self esteem is enabling, yes, but it&#x27;s also grounding. It&#x27;s too easy to believe lies if you fail to ground your validation of action and thought in something more constant than the fleeting voices of strangers on the internet.<p>TL; DR: Self esteem is not about confidence in your abilities (or the idea you can do something because you believe you can), it&#x27;s about recognizing yourself as a legitimate (perhaps the most legitimate) source of validation of your actions and choices instead of deriving validation only from others and thus self-esteem is how you avoid becoming a slave to the judgement of others. It requires constant maintenance.<p>The &quot;craze&quot; definitely failed to understand and communicate this.')
