However, reading the 24-hour news cycle and being aware of the real political landscape is not perfectly correlated; I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s 50% overlap at the upper bound and sub-ten % at the lower. Furthermore, reading the news cycle and being politically active in a way that affects your, your family&#x27;s, and your &quot;heirs&#x27;&quot; wellbeing is probably almost negatively correlated.<p>Any political wins made by groups exploiting and dominating mainstream media (Trump) are explained by the fact that the barrier to entry in political action is so lowâ€”just getting a few people to vote is politically effective because almost everyone is just watching the news instead of doing anything real. Meanwhile Trump&#x27;s team meets with money and accrues powerful stakeholders by annexing their agenda, building support in institutions and markets.<p>So ignoring political news and pursuing interfaces with actual nexuses of power is far more politically effective than the hundreds of people with twenty tabs of The Atlantic open and the WSJ draped across their lap like a religious shawl every morning. Go out, meet politically active people in your city, email representative staff, make friends with people with money and vested interests that are vulnerable to political changes.')
