I didn&#x27;t see it was related to crime, I thought you were asking generally speaking. I can&#x27;t talk about decreasing crime as Gary has a pretty bad reputation for it, but I&#x27;d be surprised if there wasn&#x27;t a correlation between greenery (nature, trees, plants, flowers, etc) and crime, even if there wasn&#x27;t any, I know being surrounded by nature is good for us&#x2F;mental wellbeing.')
