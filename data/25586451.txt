Fact is, the US is the better option the vast, vast majority of the time even including additional cost of living and healthcare costs.<p>Spending $1.5k on healthcare a month in exchange for double or triple the salary is worth it, by a long shot.<p>This isn&#x27;t a religious debate, it would be great to be a developer in a friendly and beautiful EU country for me personally, but not if my salary is slashed to the bone to do so.<p>The EU is not competitive in the tech market at all, and especially not for senior level contributors.<p>According to Payscale, Senior Developers in Sweden earn roughly the equivalent of $70k USD. That&#x27;s the biggest shafting I&#x27;ve ever seen.')
