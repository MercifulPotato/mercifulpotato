There&#x27;s this sentiment on HN that &quot;all you have to do&quot; is get a job at a big tech company and you&#x27;ll make a million dollars a year. It&#x27;s idiotic, and not true. Yes, there are people who make $500k+ writing code in a cubicle for 40 hours a week. They are the vast, vast, vast minority compared to the people a) making $100-200k doing the same thing; b) making that $500k+ doing everything <i>but</i> writing code.<p>Unless you&#x27;re doing infrastructure stuff at Netflix, ad work at FB or Google, or some high level stuff at Microsoft you&#x27;re not making half a million a year, and you&#x27;re not doing it at a mid-level anything, anywhere.')
