But when I submitted, maybe I misunderstood the list. From what I read here, it seems like the list maintainers are looking to promote self published books. Or those published by someone other than an non big tech publisher (O&#x27;Reilly, APress, Manning)? It&#x27;s a bit unclear to me.<p>My book was published by APress. I&#x27;m proud of it, but maybe it doesn&#x27;t belong on this list?')
