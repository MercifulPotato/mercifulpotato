But, really, how is this so different to any other objective approach?<p>Here in the UK there is a significant body of legislation around the process of making people redundant, so it would have worked differently, and particularly it will work differently for larger numbers of redundancies.<p>There is always some sort of objective scoring criteria. For larger redundancies these are agreed with employee reps as part of the consultation period. You might be able to get away with less rigour if you&#x27;re only making a handful of people redundant. Regardless, those scoring criteria and the scores associated with them are going to end up in some sort of model, which might be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet, but there&#x27;s nothing to stop you implementing it in code. The model is generally published as part of a consultation pack so that staff can understand how they are being evaluated, and provide feedback via their employee rep.<p>The end result is that the people sorted at the bottom, however many you need, are made redundant. It isn&#x27;t nice. But it is objective, and it&#x27;s important that it be so, because that&#x27;s as close as you can get to any sense of &quot;fairness&quot; - not that it&#x27;s going to feel fair to the people losing their jobs. You <i>have</i> to be able to justify these decisions, to demonstrate that you&#x27;ve gone through a fair and objective process to arrive at them, because you might land in court if somebody challenges your decisions.<p>It&#x27;s not nice, and it&#x27;s always going to seem heartless to some people. But that&#x27;s part of leadership: sooner or later you are going to have to make decisions that some (or even many) people don&#x27;t like, and that you don&#x27;t like either. In many of these cases there will be no perfect choice and no perfect outcome. There is no avoiding it. If you aren&#x27;t willing to deal with this, don&#x27;t become a leader.')
