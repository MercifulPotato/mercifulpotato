One of the issues with using a z-score for count data is it assumes the data are normally distributed. This implies values &lt; 0 are possible. However, since counts are lower-bounded at zero, theyâ€™re asymmetric unlike the normal. This means that practically this method would produce too many false positives for most applications. Whatever threshold is chosen, is likely to have too narrow an envelope between false negative and false positive to be reliable for count data. However, for normally distributed data, this would work perfectly.')
