Depending on how you define it, that would require proportional allocation of the senate, or its abolition, as well.<p>Our not-so-pure democracy, based on the constitution Madison signed, has lately been quite the spectacle and proved incompatible with basic rights and security. It hasn&#x27;t lasted very long, and arguably fell apart in 1860. Our president elect has been alive for a third of its lifespan, counting the long way from 1788. Which is another way of saying our president elect is pretty old, and our government pretty young.<p>There are founders aplenty to quote on the necessity of amendment, as well. But without further research, I&#x27;d guess trouble in the Senate, too.')
