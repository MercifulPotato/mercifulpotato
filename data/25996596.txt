Is the lack of security policing over its multiple independent nodes inevitable?<p>-<p>I hope you&#x27;ll indulge me with your thoughts, because I&#x27;ve had little luck figuring out which solution is wisest - and I want to do what is best for our children&#x27;s children.<p>To be honest, there&#x27;s a part of me that just wants to ditch digital messaging altogether, and get back to the basics - old school fundamentals - as in, we&#x27;re using the phone only to make plans to meet with people face to face so that we can chat in private, and we type out old-fashioned printed letters, whose hard-copy output is encrypted with our unique public keys - one for each different pen pal.<p>That would be pretty romantic, but things would take forever.<p>But could we emulate something similar if we each set up our own matrix servers at home?<p>As in, if we were to all run our own private messaging servers, and exchanged encrypted messages with each other using unique private and public key pairs, whose streamlined access allows us to easily maintain and continuously update these key pairs with all of our contacts - wouldn&#x27;t that be the superior option?<p>I conclude that it&#x27;s a trade-off between simplicity and independence. I am also ready to stand corrected on my interpretation of the nuances of this deeply impactful topic, and would value your thoughts and speculations of the future.')
