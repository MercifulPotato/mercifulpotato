I&#x27;ve done a &quot;base setup&quot; of W10 sniffing traffic from a clean&#x2F;fully patched install and it talks to <i>everyone</i>. The only way I&#x27;ve been able to mitigate this is running LTSB&#x2F;LTSC versions along side of reputable &quot;disable telemetry&quot; software pulled from GH. It&#x27;s gross.<p>Although I admit to fighting with my Debian installations from time to time, at least they respect my privacy.')
