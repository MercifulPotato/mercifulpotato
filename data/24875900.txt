To make macro use feel natural because they&#x27;re not much different than using the core language, the language needs to be homoiconic, which to my knowledge Nim is not.<p>In any case, macros are not what draw me to Lisp, but its unparalleled combination of ease of use, readability, and power... along with 70 years of development and tooling.<p>So I could just use a Lisp or Scheme, which I do.  They can be plenty fast too (see Chicken, for instance, which -- like Nim -- compiles down to C).')
