If I look at it today after 4 years of professional coding, I cringe. I know how horrible my code is. I know how poorly I understood oop and how none of the things were tested. Zilch. Nada.<p>If I were to go back to academia ever again, the one course I am going to take is coding standards and practices for researchers. They should know basics about git, testing, ideally even a review and CI system. Given my experience in how code is handled in academia, I&#x27;m very skeptical about the quality of it and I expect to find critical bugs in them if it&#x27;s written in a non-cs department. It&#x27;s actually sad that we depend on the code so much for our publications, but how little attention we pay on how to do it properly. My trust went down in academia more and more when I saw how well defined practices were in industry and how it actually helped maintain a reasonable quality of code.')
