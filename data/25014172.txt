Never had a problem with it. It&#x27;s performance is great, the http.Handler interface is a great pattern too.<p>I rarely find myself straying far from the standard library. If there&#x27;s something that takes a bit more code but doesn&#x27;t bring a dependency then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.<p>I definitely agree that there comes a day where you just see the light and realise that simple is good, the standard library is good, and that you don&#x27;t need most of the stuff a framework gives you. But it gets really hard convincing others that Go is a great language because it&#x27;s not Rust. Don&#x27;t know what there&#x27;s so much hate for it in this community. I&#x27;ve never fell in love with a language like this before. It&#x27;s just incredibly productive for me and fits my thinking perfectly.')
