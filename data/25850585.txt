I think many are used - at least in a transaction sense - mainly for illicit financing.<p>&gt;&quot;And I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn&#x27;t occur through those channels.&quot;<p>Yuck, as much as I hate this argument, which is basically just the &quot;think of the children&quot; argument restated, I&#x27;m rather convinced that Yellen&#x27;s point is true.<p>There are no legitimate uses for bitcoin that I can think of, other than:<p>- An instrument for speculative investing<p>- Sending money to dissidents in other countries<p>Neither of these seem like high-priority use cases that will suffer unduly from more regulation.  By contrast the primary use case for bitcoin seems to be riding the speculation bubble, followed by buying stolen accounts&#x2F;credit cards&#x2F;identities and illegal drugs.')
