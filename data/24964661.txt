But that was after few month long and expensive exploration phase that along qualified for decent contract.<p>After I went on my own I handle smaller contracts that are easier to eyeball. Well small is relative as in one case licensing fees alone over a period of time went well into 7 figure territory. But yeah I no longer had to direct 30 people and did not have 20 persons on a client side bugging me every day and being under constant stress ;)')
