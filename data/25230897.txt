Item(by='kome', descendants=None, kids=[25231399], score=None, time=1606499510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230800, text='&gt; This seems like a pretty good deal on balance, at least for those who can accept that the world is not perfect and very often the loss of a single life is the best one can hope for to prevent the losses of tens or hundreds of thousands of lives.<p>There are plenty of assumptions here tho. Because I am not sure such an act &quot;can save lifes&quot;, or in fact, it keeps reinforcing the hegemony of US, IL and SA in killing systematically and waging wars in the region... My point is: is murdering a top scientist&#x2F;politician useful to save &quot;tens or hundreds of thousands of lives&quot; or is this facilitating the killing &quot;tens or hundreds of thousands of lives&quot; in Palestine, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and destabilizing the region?')
