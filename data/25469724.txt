And you also tend to be surrounded by an environment---whether it&#x27;s audience, or a park, or a chess club---that doesn&#x27;t try to grab your attention away.<p>It&#x27;s really easy for me to concentrate on playing music, or just listening to music, for two hour straight. The same for reading books.<p>But I can&#x27;t maintain that long a focus when I&#x27;m programming. At some point, I&#x27;ll be waiting the computer to give me feedback, for compilation, tests, or results. There&#x27;s nothing for me to think about on that code, and my mind goes to something else. I have a list of other stuff that I could fix, so I don&#x27;t stray too far from programming, and can always go back into it swiftly.')
