Item(by='pjc50', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608029943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25428614, text='&quot;Without ads&quot; and &quot;without <i>targeted</i> ads&quot; are different things. There&#x27;s an &quot;ad-centrist&quot; view whereby adverts should be OK so long as they&#x27;re chosen to go with the content on the page and the community that the site aims at - you know, like all newspapers and magazines used to do.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how imgurl survives given the abuse workload; there is an inevitable death spiral of image hosting sites as they get cluttered by more and more adverts of worse and worse quality.<p>Stackexchange handles this very differently, too.')
