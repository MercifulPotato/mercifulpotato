I&#x27;m plenty happy using Docker Compose in production and foresee myself continuing to use it as long as Docker maintains it. There&#x27;s even a WIP issue on their roadmap[0] to rewrite Docker Compose with Go to make it more consistent with their main CLI. Looks like full steam ahead to me rather than death.<p>It&#x27;s really nice having the same Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml get used in dev + ci and prod. There&#x27;s no surprises and no massive amount of complexity.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docker&#x2F;roadmap&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docker&#x2F;roadmap&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15</a>')
