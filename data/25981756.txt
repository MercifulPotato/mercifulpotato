They&#x27;re just measuring physical activity per quadrant. They can use it to study which products and product areas seem to be attracting the most interest. They specifically don&#x27;t use photography or wifi that follows people around.<p>Although the vibration&#x2F;light sensors are a somewhat novel idea, in the end a retailer already knows exactly what products are sold, in what quantities, which ones are returned, and (anecdotally at least) which ones spark the most questions from shoppers. It&#x27;s not long in coming before UHF RFID chips will show the products being carried around the store (or out the back door, etc.).<p>Probably this system would be most useful for determining which products are &quot;hot&quot; and should be moved to an end cap or special display near the entrance.  Or they might choose to &quot;bury&quot; the products to force shoppers to walk past tempting tangential items.<p>Retailing is a science, perfected over many decades. The lights, the music, even the aromas, all conspire to influence shoppers in ways that online can&#x27;t compete with.
