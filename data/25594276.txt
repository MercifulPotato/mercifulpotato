The Boy Scout oath says &quot;On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country&quot;. You could replace God with any moral belief system.<p>I think our sense of Duty started to dissolve sometime in the 80s with the idea that &quot;Greed is good&quot; and then continued in the 90s with a rise in apathy. Both of which are selfish ideas, selfishness is the opposite of Duty.')
