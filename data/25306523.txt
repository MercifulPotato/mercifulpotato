Like accessing the current page&#x27;s DOM, being able to hook the event loop.<p>I didn&#x27;t care at the time. I hated all things HTML, CSS, JS. Such a downgrade from state of the art. I regarded the browser as terrible means to deliver, bootstrap applets. Just like Flash.<p>One thing I didn&#x27;t appreciate at the time was the genius of HTTP and URLs.<p>I&#x27;m still completely baffled by the &quot;worse is better&quot; thesis. I just can&#x27;t understand why JavaScript was created, much less why it succeeded.<p>One can understand how mistakes like \\0 terminated strings and SQL&#x27;s NULL happen, become hard to undo. But JavaScript is the original sin that just keeps poisoning. Other platforms, ecosystems learn and grow and mature. JavaScript stubbornly refuses to acknowledge truth and goodness, and is all the more successful for it&#x27;s belligerence.<p>Amazing.')
