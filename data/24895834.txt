In this case, the virus can revert to wild type or develop into an entirely new strain.<p>Now, the Oxford vaccine is <i>not</i> an attenuated virus as is usually meant by that term.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not the same as an &quot;inactivated virus&quot; vaccine type either, where a virus is broken apart.<p>It&#x27;s a different sort which doesn&#x27;t fall into either of those categories.  It&#x27;s described as a &quot;weaken adenovirus&quot; and &quot;replication-deficient&quot; because of replication genes being deleted, and spike protein coding added.  (There&#x27;s no coronavirus at all, just the spike protein.  This is completely different from other vaccines.)<p>The replication-deficient adenovirus has been studied thoroughly, not just for Covid but earlier as well.  There are good reasons they selected it.<p><i>I will certainly take that vaccine when it&#x27;s available, if that counts as any sort of endorsement</i>.<p>I have high confidence in the people engineering and studying it.  (I&#x27;m in Oxford, btw ;-)  But can you really generalise the observations of inactivated virus vaccines to this relatively new kind?  I think no, it has to be studied and monitored with care.  Thankfully, I think they are doing exactly that.')
