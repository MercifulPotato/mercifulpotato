But I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade, and spent time in the early days to understand how it works under the hood.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say git has a good user interface.  I don&#x27;t think it does.  I&#x27;m comfortable with it because I&#x27;ve spent many years using it, and because I expended extra effort (effort I don&#x27;t think an average user should have to expend) to learn it well, and to be unafraid of making mistakes while poking around.')
