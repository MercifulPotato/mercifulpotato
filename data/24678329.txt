I absolutely agree on the Ubuntu front (though I don&#x27;t believe for a second that things are better elsewhere. E.g.: Python on Windows is way worse in my experience). But I dislike Ubuntu (and Debian, for that matter) for many related experiences I had in the past.<p>2.) I&#x27;d say, though, that you&#x27;re missing out on good containerization solutions if you&#x27;re wrestling with Python installations on a server distribution.<p>3.) Most importantly: Where things like Docker or LXC don&#x27;t apply (or don&#x27;t apply as much; like development&#x2F;desktop usage), the single best concept I&#x27;ve encountered so far would be the way NixOS and Guix handle installations. I sincerely hope that model will take off in the next couple of years. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that <i>if</i> it takes off, it will be on either Linux (most likely) or BSD.')
