Peer review is sufficient for scientific articles. The idea of licensing scientists puts us back into the middle ages.  The opportunities to politicize and raise barriers of entry to scientific practice have an understandable appeal. Think of unions, hair dressers having to spend $5k on cosmetology degrees, M.Ed.&#x27;s. \n Hopefully this licensed profession would be given a name other than scientist -  maybe data engineer, analyst, doctor, or technician to avoid confusion.  \nWhat&#x27;s needed is more peer review of data related practices, not credentialing and fake authority.')
