The existence of pump and dumps, I would say, is obvious, in and out of crypto. But this paper fails by lacking a method to confidently detect pump and dump schemes. They successfully detect 2 of 4 schemes, no better than a coin toss. You might say this is better than nothing, but 50% is not really enough to either protect or extend your portfolio in the face of an impending pump and dump.<p>Assuredly there are many crypto hedge funds able to predict pump and dumps with much higher accuracy, but they are keeping the methods to themselves to protect their intellectual property.')
