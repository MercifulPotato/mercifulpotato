You, yourself, just explained that there is <i>some</i> line in sand that must be drawn? After all again, by your own argument, I have no right to distribute child pornography. Clearly, you, yourself, don&#x27;t fully believe that <i>there is no argument for censorship, suspension or banning, based on our 1st amendment</i> - you are not willing to defend me of my right to distribute child porn.<p>You must then agree, by the framing of your answer, that this is no longer a conversation about free speech and about whether or not Trump incited violence. It&#x27;s clear that you understand that if it were Trump promoting violence, that my comparison wouldn&#x27;t be such a stretch. So can we agree to not waste our time discussing the merits free speech?<p>Google and Apple are deplatforming Parler for inciting violence - and enforcing no moderation towards users that do so. If you want to argue that &quot;inciting violence&quot; is not &quot;clearly illegal&quot; then I&#x27;m willing to watch videos that support that case, but you should make it clear that is your position, and not a general one about &quot;free speech&quot;.')
