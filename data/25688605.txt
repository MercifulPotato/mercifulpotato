There are plenty of independent car shops that will do all kinds of stuff to your ride, from visual trim replacement, repainting, mechanical tuning, engine swaps, aftermarket parts etc etc. Toyota doesn&#x27;t bother, because <i>there isn&#x27;t much money in it</i>. An independent tuning shop can make $1M&#x2F;year in revenue, and a thousand of such shops can make a total of a $1B. But $1B&#x2F;year of extra revenue is paltry change for Toyota.<p>Anyone can offer 10k aftermarket upgrade, but the real question is <i>how many will buy it</i>.<p>&gt; But I do think the previous bear cases of &quot;they cant run a factory&quot;, &quot;they cant scale production&quot;, etc are all mostly disproven.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m very bullish on Tesla, mostly because I have great trust in Musk&#x27;s ability to run business. However, my bullishness doesn&#x27;t extend to valuing Tesla <i>today</i> more than next five of biggest auto makers combined.')
