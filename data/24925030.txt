For example, should anyone be making the best flatware and why do we care about buying the best flatware when there’s plenty of good enough.<p>There’s so many points in his article that it’s hard to start in one place but I got the sense that his overarching thesis is this:<p>There’s a bunch of real human problems today (hunger, climate change, disease etc) and people can either be working on 1) solving these problems or 2) distracting people from thinking about their own mortality and these crises. In the bucket of the distraction-economy is probably anything entertainment related, social networking, consumerism, etc which is not innovative. There are people who are trying to change the system because it’s broken not just simply extract more value from it.<p>At least that was my takeaway.')
