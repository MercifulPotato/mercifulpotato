AWS also offers free credits to prominent Open Source projects.<p>It&#x27;s not available yet but it should be a good option once they become available, you can immediately start the process of applying for the credits.<p>This way you would get access to the required hardware without any costs and without having to maintain it. They are designed from the ground up towards such CI&#x2F;development use cases.<p>You can also use the same credits for getting access to Intel and ARM Linux, as well as Windows EC2 instances. This may improve your project&#x27;s CI and build times.<p>Disclaimer: I work at AWS.')
