And it&#x27;s like, he probably has no grasp on why he&#x27;s upset--he doesn&#x27;t really have &quot;thoughts&quot; like we do and he&#x27;s oblivious as to why he&#x27;s having the emotional response he is... he just knows he&#x27;s antsy and he wants to stop being antsy. Anyway, only mentioning it because I realized that&#x27;s how I likely am a lot of the time: oblivious to myself but obvious on the outside.')
