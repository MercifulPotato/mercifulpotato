You get D-K exactly when you run the simulation of the data collection with ceiling&#x2F;floors, and you <i>have</i> to for basic statistical reasons. There&#x27;s nothing to explain. D-K does not exist, and OP is misleading in trying to &#x27;correctly&#x27; explain research that was wrong to begin with (he gets only halfway there when he admits that regression to the mean forces much of D-K, but then handwaves furiously that it can&#x27;t explain all of it, when the other measurement problems account for the asymmetry in how much the top&#x2F;bottom groups regressed).')
