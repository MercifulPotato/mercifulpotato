It might get awkward running two parallel package managers, but I&#x27;ve heard good things.<p>The idea of Nix is that you can specify a package&#x27;s dependencies very explicitly, and have it build in a hermetic, and reproducible, environment. It can handle all sorts of dependencies, be they same-language libraries, binaries, or native system libraries. You can think of it sort of like firing up a docker container in which to run your build--if it works once, it&#x27;ll always work, and if it works here it should work everywhere.<p>NixOS adds to that by essentially making the running system one of the packages managed by Nix. You specify what packages should be installed, how those packages should be configured, what services should be run, users that should exist, etc. When you build, the operating system you&#x27;re running on is replaced with the new one. If anything breaks, you can trivially roll back. If you build the same config on a different host, you&#x27;ll end up with the same system (albeit with slightly different package versions).<p>Guix is basically a fork of Nix (or started that way); it&#x27;s got a very similar approach to Nix (and GuixSD to NixOS). It uses Gnu Shepherd instead of systemd, and uses Scheme for system config instead of a custom language.')
