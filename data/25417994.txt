Despite being starry-eyed and optimistic when starting out, cracks quickly began to show in the facade. Curriculum changes would be announced hours before that day&#x27;s lessons would begin leaving both students and instructors baffled. There were students who simply hadn&#x27;t mastered the material yet and were generally not ready to move on, yet were forced to go into the next unit lest the &#x27;pass-rate&#x27; between cohorts would be less than 100%.<p>Frankly, having seen the average quality of their work, I wouldn&#x27;t hire 70% of all Lambda students. I&#x27;ve seen a handful of really talented and hard-working students who&#x27;ve made the most of their LS experience, but for the majority that simply followed the curriculum and did the bare-minimum I wouldn&#x27;t want them anywhere near my codebase.<p>Thus far, it seems that almost all students who got a job either spent numerous hours studying outside of normal classes, had previous experience going into it (such as myself), or generally got a lucky break. There are numerous students who are still without a job more than a year after graduation.')
