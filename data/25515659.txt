For instance startup A sells 10% of the equity for $100K. And then it uses that money to continue scaling and operation. So, that money has not left the company, (not sure is it taxed) but only way to get it personally would be through salary and dividends (for which investor would complain as badly invested money). And, this part is ok.<p>After few months same VC decides to buy out the rest 90% for $500K, startup founder agrees and sells the company.\nNow at this point, does those $500K go to the founder pocket or the company? Does founder pays personal or corporate tax on that money? \nWhat is the difference between that one and the first case?<p>What if founder sells 5 more times 10%, until company is not his anymore? \nAs founder is not majority owner can he ever sell the rest to personally gain anything, as majority owners can decide to infinitely dilute and sell shares?<p>I would really appreciate if someone can explain this.<p>Somewhat I am confused with edge cases, for instance if investor asked to buy out 80% more for $450K, so founder is left with 10%, and then founder can be left with $50K of personal money with last sale. \nWhere is an error in my thinking?')
