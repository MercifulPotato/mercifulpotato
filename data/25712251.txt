I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an easy way for Apple to get around it. IP protocol is too easy to block. I think that it&#x27;s possible to develop better protocols where every peer will proxy packets if necessary, so it&#x27;ll be impossible to block it, but that&#x27;s probably not something that&#x27;ll replace Internet.')
