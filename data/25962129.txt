They&#x27;re comparatively rare (being illegal just means you get fined if you get caught, it&#x27;s really &quot;not that serious&quot; for a big player), and small timers aren&#x27;t allowed to participate, but they&#x27;re not impossible. An even bigger point than that is that the short doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be naked in the <i>legal</i> sense for you to fail to deliver, especially when a security has gone completely Texas like GME has.<p>This situation is rare. Halting all trades is very scary for all parties involved. It&#x27;s way worse for just about everybody than asking brokerages to have 100% collateral is.')
