I want to shout here very loudly!<p>(I guess we&#x27;re off topic now, but please please please don&#x27;t do what I did and ignore it.)<p>Me, age 29, I&#x27;ve mentioned before that I&#x27;m a lifelong medium endurance cyclist (4-8hrs, 75-120miles): started to get foot pain.  Went to the doc (Stanford Hospital GP), doc says you have gout, here&#x27;s the pills you will take for the rest of your life.  Me: nah, I&#x27;m healthy, I&#x27;ll eat better.  I was already eating better.  Long story short, moved to a rural area, and had probably 30 attacks over 20 years, and none of the 5 (or was it 8?) docs diagnosed it correctly, or prescribed the pills, which are allopurinol.  Take the pills.  As you might imagine from my preferred exercise I have a very high tolerance for pain.  Or did.  I am not suicidal, but there have been several two week stretches where I became quite understanding about how people could be made suicidal from chronic pain.<p>Gout is not necessarily a virtue test.  Take the pills.  And you don&#x27;t want advil&#x2F;tylenol, you want indomethecin for the pain.  For the last 5 years I take a half dose everyday and I&#x27;ve not had a single disabling attack, hallelujah.  My joints still hate low pressure weather systems though.')
