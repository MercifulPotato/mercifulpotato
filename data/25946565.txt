I was a full-time remote worker before the pandemic, but I think one of the reasons it worked so well for me is because I had been able to build up a lot of the working relationships I have now in person. I made the decision to go remote because it was just going to work better for me, and I was fully aware that I would have to work at not being forgotten by the people in the office. There are ways to deal with it: you need to overcommunicate, make conscious efforts to get in on &quot;office gossip&quot; (the non-toxic kind), etc. An occcasional office visit or retreat makes a big difference.<p>Some of the people I&#x27;ve enjoyed working with the most have really struggled with the 100% remote dynamic during the pandemic. They have different personalities which have made it hard for them to be stuck at home, but those personalities make them great team members too. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to just never work with people like that again.')
