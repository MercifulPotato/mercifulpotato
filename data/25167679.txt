The Jenkins solution is to simply execute containers using the host&#x27;s Docker daemon, or via a container orchestration system which you call out to.<p>The latter is the best option as it&#x27;s much more scalable and doesn&#x27;t require ugly proprietary hacks. Docker in Docker requires vertical scaling and more complex management for intermediate states&#x2F;maintenance.<p>Podman probably isn&#x27;t ready to replace Docker yet, but rootless containers are the easy-mode for federation of clusters. If you can supply the other features you need (and I think most can) it&#x27;s probably worth it in the long run.')
