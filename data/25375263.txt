There was nothing to formalize the concept of a &quot;package&quot; back then.<p>That&#x27;s not true any more, ES Modules have made it into the spec, so that&#x27;s what Deno is using.<p>As for package-lists, the current convention in the community at the moment if you have a decently sized library is to have a `deps.ts` file where you re-export all of your dependency, making it an equivalent to package.json and helps with upgrading dependencies across a codebase.<p>TypeScript is already optional in Deno! it will run any .js file just fine, and you even skip the compilation part.')
