More and more we see vague &#x27;problems&#x27; and &#x27;harm&#x27; but it&#x27;s never clearly stated.  These companies provide damn good service and at a great cost.  If we want to look at harm - why don&#x27;t we look at the medical industry, drug industry, cable&#x2F;internet -- these companies are outright abusive to their customers and extract massive amounts of money from them and are often granted monopolies by the government.')
