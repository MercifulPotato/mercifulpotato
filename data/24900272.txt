Item(by='Spivak', descendants=None, kids=[24902006, 24902683], score=None, time=1603740749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899967, text='&gt; The common person primarily votes based solely on a historical allegiance to a political party (be it individually formed or inherited) with about 75% of America essentially being unmovable D or R safe votes.<p>This is one of those statements that sounds bad on the surface but is actually totally reasonable and has nothing to do with some trope about the &quot;uninformed masses&quot; or whatever. Locally the individual matters a lot more but at the national level voting histories show that the party dominates.<p>People have &quot;disqualifying issues.&quot; And this is totally rational. Being black and voting R is nuts -- same if you&#x27;re gay. And if you&#x27;re pro-life then voting D is unpalatable. These kinds of polarizing issues very nearly define the party line. So yeah, if you go the polls in Nov and don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re voting D or R (nationally) then you&#x27;re probably crazy uninformed.<p>The actual decision making happens during the primaries where people suddenly have an entire group of people who aren&#x27;t immediately disqualified and the internal discussion gets a lot more nuanced.')
