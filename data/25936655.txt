It doesn&#x27;t really matter which company it is, it just matters that the company is shorted at &gt;100% of total issued shares.<p>if the gamestop is still shorted at 130-150% of total issued shares (finra report coming soon) that means the shorters are going to be paying interest and getting margin called as GME prices goes up. the fees for borrowing GME to short have been 30-60%. That is absolutely insane, if you can even find shares to short, which I haven&#x27;t seen any for the past day.')
