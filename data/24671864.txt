Knowing this, Thibado’s group built their circuit with two diodes for converting AC into a direct current (DC).<p>So, they built a full-wave rectifier (albeit with only 2 instead of, say, 4 diodes)? Pretty neat to see electrical engineering fundamentals at work.<p>(also, for any who wanted specifics: article is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;pre&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevE.102.042101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;pre&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevE.102.0...</a> ; abstract contains a couple of circuit diagrams)<p>edit: updated link, thanks for pointing that out')
