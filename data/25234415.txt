The goal is for it to be a embeddable, DOM-friendly &amp; transparently asynchronous scripting language so you don&#x27;t need to deal w&#x2F; callbacks:<p><pre><code>  on click \n    add .throb to me\n    wait 3s\n    remove .throb from me\n  end\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d like to make ajax and web workers trivial to use from it.  I hope to have a lot more time for it in the next year, now that htmx is stable.  We&#x27;ll see.  Suggestions welcome!<p>edit: one thing I&#x27;m pretty sure about is that I&#x27;m going to go back to an interpreted runtime over the transpilation I&#x27;m doing now')
