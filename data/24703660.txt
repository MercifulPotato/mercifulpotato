I ran VM Fusion on a MBP, and I really liked that setup. The Mac was for play, the Linux VM for work, and I had everything in one box. Linux networking just worked.<p>But my 2015 MBP was on its last legs, the new MBPs had really bad keyboards (butterfly switches, touchbar), and they are really expensive.<p>I got a System76 Darter running Pop OS, and I&#x27;m very happy with the combination. The hardware is decent, much cheaper, and Pop OS is extremely stable and pretty. (At the time, the MBP didn&#x27;t even go to 32GB, but that&#x27;s been fixed.)<p>Maybe get a Linux ThinkPad and run photoshop and Microsoft Suite in a VM?')
