You&#x27;d still rather ride in a Mercedes E430 taxi (long time European standard)... unless you had never experienced both, in which case you probably think the Caprice is just fine.<p>And if you knew Ruby, Python, Java, C#, Kotlin, or better yet F#, Clojure, or Elixir, you&#x27;d most likely enjoy using one of them rather than PHP.<p>There are three reasons to use PHP.<p>1. it works<p>2. it is well integrated with web servers<p>3. you can find some of the cheapest contract labor who know how to program in it (compared to other, less common&#x2F;popular languages)<p>Bonus 4.  you need to extend Wordpress by writing a plugin or theme (and Wordpress is the Caprice of CMSs...)')
