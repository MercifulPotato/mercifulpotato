In open landscapes and in meetings with business side, there&#x27;s endless pointless chatter about everything else but doing their job. I&#x27;m not a devotee to overwork and squeezing blood out of stone type of worker. However, the directionless chatter, general incompetence, lack of inquisitiveness and awareness become energy-draining over time.<p>Status report is when a team say the same things every day and every week, nothing changes and there&#x27;s nothing new to be learned. This is Waste.<p>Daily scrum is meant to encourage collaboration, inspiration and brief sharing of information. However, when driven by business needs alone, it becomes another pointless status report. On the flip side, if daily scrum takes off, it should be allowed to continue as a new meeting afterwards, but is also a sign that there&#x27;s not enough coherency in the group with the current practice.')
