Though it&#x27;s done pragmatically and as an \\<i>ethically appropriate measure.<p>A bit longer: most brain tissue studies require extraction, fixing, staining,... of brain. so are usually done _ex vivo_ .<p>Even longer: But even where animal could be kept alive, it raises questions of what exactly one should do:<p>- Do you keep paying for, up to, years to house an animal that can&#x27;t be used for anything else? (consider, if you&#x27;ve applied treatments to it, you likely discredit it from inclusion in other studies).<p>- Did your study cause long-term effects that would lead the animal to suffering were you to keep it alive?<p>- You probably can&#x27;t release the animal: most are raised from birth in facilities, they&#x27;d not likely survive long (not that mice live very long in the wild as it is).<p>- Or, if you _did_ release them would they spread anything into the wild?<p>\\</i> ethically appropriate is decided by ethics boards. Please don&#x27;t argue with me about what is or isn&#x27;t ethical animal treatment.')
