But that&#x27;s not really a &#x27;crisis&#x27;.<p>If the residents of an area do not want to turn their city into Hong Kong or Vancouver with 100&#x27;s of high rises stacked back to back, it&#x27;s absolutely reasonable for them to do that.<p>Unlike Hong Kong, California is massive and there&#x27;s plenty of space.<p>There&#x27;s vast land available for fairly dense development around Morgan Hill, Santa Rosa, Sacramento - and that&#x27;s where people can go if they want to live nearby.<p>If the jobs in SF don&#x27;t pay enough for people to live there, then definitely demand more pay, don&#x27;t take the jobs or leave. The area is nice, but not that nice.<p>Companies should use the opportunity to spread out a little bit.')
