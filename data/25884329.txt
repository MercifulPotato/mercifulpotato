The adaptive input only looks for cars, and so a pedestrian can easily wait two or three minutes for them to get a green cycle. In addition, the logic that triggers a walk signal requires a button to be pushed first, so if you arrive at the crosswalk during a green light for cars in your direction you still need to wait for an entire red cycle because they wonâ€™t give you a walk during the current signal.<p>The worst part is, that according to the data the time saved is about 30 seconds, on a few block drive that has easily taken me an hour and a half in the worst case. For a project that cost half a billion dollars this was a piss poor return on investment, and particularly inappropriate for a busy dense area.')
