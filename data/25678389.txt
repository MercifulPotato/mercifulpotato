E.e. we can&#x27;t program a mail exchanger machine to accept the mails on behalf of hundreds of users, by delivering them into a giant mailbox, and then continuing the delivery path by sucking them out with a fetchmail-like tool, and forwarding to more forwarding hosts.<p>The whole complaint of this irate BSD person is that you can&#x27;t do this kind of nonsensical thing.<p>There is a sort of valid criticism in that fetchmail (or at least did originally, I don&#x27;t know about now) worked by re-sending the messages to the user over a mail transport mechanism, rather than delivering it into a mail directory structure. E-mail clients that download and cache messages certainly do not do anything of that sort. However, that shields fetchmail from having to know how the user&#x27;s mail software likes to have the messages stored. Arguably, sending the mail is the right interface.<p>Though the envelope info isn&#x27;t available, it&#x27;s assumed that it was already processed by the remote mail server.  The remote server did all he spam checks on the SMTP info, and whatnot, decided that the message is deliverable to the user, so there it is.<p>Fetchmail assumes that if the mail is in the remote box, then it&#x27;s yours, and can be effectively forwarded. The envelope sender is Fetchmail itself.<p>If that is broken, so are mailing lists. When you receive a message from someone via a mailing list, you also don&#x27;t have the envelope which the mailing list robot&#x27;s server received. The envelope is that of the mailing list&#x27;s own delivery; the mailing list robot is the MAIL FROM: sender.<p>For that matter, you are not even the original intended recipient! The mail was originally to the list, and now it is to you.<p>Not having an envelope isn&#x27;t a show-stopping impediment to further forwarding and delivery. You just have to understand and accept that it&#x27;s more of a forwarding style of delivery, like a mailing list robot.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s almost like complaining that a dog which fetches the mail from your door and brings it to the kitchen is not a trained postal worker, does not understand and handle addresses right, and could not be reliably used to service an apartment building with six tenants, all by itself, such that the mailman could just put everything in one bin and leave it to the dog.')
