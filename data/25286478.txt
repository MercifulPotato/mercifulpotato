Item(by='caconym_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606980442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284959, text='Consider two models of car. One was sold in large numbers in the early 90s and has proven exceptionally reliable, but obviously it&#x27;s built to early 90s safety standards, and has been involved in a huge number of fatal accidents with various causes ranging from operator error to scattered manufacturing defects. However, no serious design issues ever surfaced.<p>The second is a 2020 model, equipped with state of the art safety features. However, its fatal accident rate is the same as the other model (though the absolute number is much smaller), and nearly every single such accident happened in the exact same way: the driver assist system, which cannot be turned off, has a nasty habit of overpowering the driver and steering into oncoming traffic. The NHTSA investigation reveals that this system was implemented hastily, using outsourced labor and cheap non-redundant components, so that the manufacturer could qualify for a tax credit. Specific concerns regarding the implementation were raised by engineers but overruled by management.<p>I&#x27;ll take option A, thanks.')
