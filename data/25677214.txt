My wife bought the Peloton bike for us 4 years ago. What were they, $2k? I think the first year&#x27;s subscription was free, and now she pays whatever the monthly fee is. $40, I think, right?<p>Why&#x27;s that unreasonable? When I was trying to get back into shape and add some strength training, I started seeing a personal trainer, which I honestly, probably stuck with for too long. Given per-session costs, it was costing me upwards of $500&#x2F;mo. Of course that includes use of gym facilities and 1:1 training and advice. Probably one of the best things I ever did.<p>Basic gym memberships have gotta be at least $100&#x2F;mo. I&#x27;m sure there are countless people paying $200&#x2F;mo and up. Obviously you get access to a lot more equipment, but you have to go there, too.<p>I just don&#x27;t see $40&#x2F;month as a lot. Maybe I&#x27;m strange.<p>Since then, my wife also added a Peloton treadmill to the mix, which is over 4k. It uses the same subscription. As do the Yoga and stretching and bodyweight strength classes.. and meditation if you&#x27;re into that. Both of us, 2 pieces of equipment, unlimited classes, on your phone, appletv, whatever. $40&#x2F;mo.<p>On the average evening we&#x27;ve got the treadmill and bike going at the same time and when she finishes with her run she&#x27;s doing stretching and core stuff in the living room while I do more on the bike. The subscription starts to sound like a pretty good deal. But don&#x27;t tell them that, because we&#x27;re locked in thanks to the hardware :)')
