Sure it’s not as big as the US but we’re a fraction of the market so it’s to be expected. If anything I’m constantly dumbfounded by just how much random shit I find on Amazon here (and I exclusively shop with “From Australia Only” ticked).<p>I’ll always buy local if I can get it at a similar price, and I’ll even pay slightly more for local, but I’m not going to spend 25%+ more for an identical product and Amazon’s prices usually really are that much cheaper.')
