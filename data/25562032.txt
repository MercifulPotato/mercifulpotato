As long as they’re driving uphill it’s OK, but as soon as you drive down the mountain you’ll see cars spinning out of control. At the slightest turning circle, The inertia of the car will push the back out, and 99% of drivers don’t know how to deal with that situation- so they brake and try to turn harder, which makes things even worse.<p>Obviously if everyone was used to driving RWD and countering oversteer , you wouldn’t need to put the best tires at the back. But the reflexes for the vast majority of drivers are to brake of things get tricky (which is perfectly fine for normal FWd driving)')
