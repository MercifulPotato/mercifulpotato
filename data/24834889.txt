Item(by='StavrosK', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603180664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834260, text='&gt; usually a roundabout way of complaining you canâ€™t say racist things anymore<p>As an external observer, this seems to me exactly the problem. Discourse is so polarized, that nobody can say &quot;this thing that started as a reaction to overt racism has gone too far&quot; without people replying &quot;that just means you&#x27;re racist&quot;.<p>The situation has come to where there are ridiculous abuses going on, and criticizing them is anathema because the initial purpose of the system being abused was to counter a bias.<p>Hell, even writing this comment, meta-analyzing the situation, I&#x27;m semi-afraid will have personal impact to me, which is pretty indicative of the problem.')
