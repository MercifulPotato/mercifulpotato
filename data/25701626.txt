The real use case here is for heavy note taking and also tracking the todos within all the notes. I found that with WorkFlowy I had so many buried todos that I could never see them in one place and manage them throughout the day. It’s great for notes, but wasn’t working for tracking tasks.<p>It allows you to prioritize the tasks at every level. You can zoom in on certain nodes to see only the tasks relevant for that node and descendants. It actually works for me but would love to get some task rabbit testers.')
