I&#x27;m just proud of what we&#x27;re achieving.<p>We&#x27;re planning on turning the internet of shit into a secure platform with myriad uses, whether that&#x27;s monitors at the bottom of the sea, or in your GHD hair straighteners, or anything you can thing of that needs secure mobile connectivity.<p>And we&#x27;re onboarding iSIM customers too.
