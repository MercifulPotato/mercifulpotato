Back in the early 90s I spent $1200 out of my own pocket to buy a 20&quot; CRT. At the time I was designing 3D rasterization algorithms and circuits and would spend hundreds of hours tweaking constants (how much difference loss does a 5b interpolation fraction introduce vs 6b, etc) and A&#x2F;B testing to get the most cost effective &amp; high quality results.<p>I bought and returned two and just lived with the defects of the 3rd one when I realized it was impossible to get good convergence across the display. I would confine my A&#x2F;B tests to a specific area of the screen where convergence was best.<p>BTW, I forget the exact details, but color convergence at the factory was set with the monitor facing some particular direction, lets say north. If you set up the monitor facing east, the convergence would be off a little bit.<p>When quality LCDs became available, convergence was a non-issue, but they used dithering to attempt to increase the color gradations, so it didn&#x27;t really help my kind of work anyway.')
