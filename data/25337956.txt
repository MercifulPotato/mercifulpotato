To be fair when I was living &quot;rural&quot;, I loved being only 45min from a 24hr Walmart, and I&#x27;ve lived as a minority, which doesn&#x27;t feel great so I get going back from whence you came.<p>But I&#x27;m still going to say, what you didn&#x27;t... good riddance. If you came just for the money and the ambiance a generation of intellectuals and artists created before you came, and you aren&#x27;t willing to contribute to it? Leave, I&#x27;ll be as happy to see you go as I was in 2001. If the pandemic (and lack of cool bars for a year) is all it takes, maybe people who give a damn will be able to move back in. Maybe that&#x27;s not what created the wealth, but it sure did make it a nice place to hang anyway.<p>My personal guess is that a lot of those &quot;creatives&quot; that are moving to Hawaii&#x2F;Sacramento&#x2F;etc for 6 months (or a year) will be back, and if not, I hope they enjoy the place they choose to make home.')
