You could equally say &quot;Louisiana spends about 20% of its local municipal revenue supporting local businesses.&quot;<p>I have no idea if that is a big number or how it compares to other states. I also have no idea if it&#x27;s a good investment - perhaps it results in lots of jobs and ultimately more than 20% increase in tax take (you should also factor in if it&#x27;s just pulling jobs and therefore taxes from elsewhere, rather than creating new value).<p>But the money is no more &quot;lost&quot; than it would be if they spent it on schools or roads or whatever else.')
