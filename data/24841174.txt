Matlab is expensive and not really a language. Python is not designed for numerical computation and can be verbose.<p>The issue for Julia is, if you stay in Numpy and Scipy in Python, and can use JIT when applicable, you are basically using  C. You can make it fast using C libraries and there is not whole lot of room for Julia to shine. Even with C, I had to be lately a bit careful to beat Numpy.')
