Quasirandom intentionally makes the output very different from random (avoiding clustering).<p>Every other thing in the PCG website and in this thread attempts to be similar to random (with varying degrees of success). No one here is trying to intentionally be different from random.<p>&gt; Sibling comments are completely correct.<p>No sibling comment says anything about quasirandom. The sibiling comment mentioning graphics (by Karliss) actually sort of disagrees with you, and says that we want stuff to be as close to random as possible for graphics so that players don&#x27;t see patterns. Of course there can be multiple types of graphics situations, some where quasirandom would be useful (the blog you linked), some where a real random approximation would be useful (Karliss&#x27;s situation).')
