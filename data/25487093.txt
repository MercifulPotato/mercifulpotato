They were awesome for their time: They had awesome, engaging features, maybe on a &quot;nerd&quot; level O:-), back then not accessible for everyone. Today we have much better ways to interact online, kind of with the whole world and somehow everyone is online, today. Locality has lost on importance, since ways to interact remotely&#x2F;online became more powerful and also accessible for all. It&#x27;s really interesting where this leads to in the future. E.g. WFH (work from home, especially emphasized by &quot;Covid&quot;): Companies might outsource development to the lowest COL (cost of living) area in that vein. Also: Everyone is globally connected, better and better, yet somehow more and more &quot;home alone&quot;. So interesting, somehow unavoidable and it&#x27;s open to see where this develops and if we manage to make these developments positive and get the negatives under control for all&#x2F;most involved.')
