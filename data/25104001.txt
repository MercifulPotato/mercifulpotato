They are the <i>victim</i> of a group hysteria which claims whatever opinions the group espouses - which can vary over time and more often than not contradict earlier held opinions - are the absolute truth which shall not be strayed from. Those who dare to dissent are excommunicated. In short, they are part of a cult, a secular religion with its own martyrs, its own saints and its own devils. It is as if the church of Scientology suddenly had gained mass adherence and started espousing its value system on society.')
