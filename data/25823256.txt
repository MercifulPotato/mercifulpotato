That&#x27;s good. However, to be a great designer you must recognize the difference between a design that is trendy (dark mode, lots of blank space, low contrast text colors) and a design that is great (actual measured usability).<p>Keep in mind the phrase &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. This was written down by a product designer early in the 20th century (whose name I have sadly forgotten). This was the pithy phrase he used to summarize his primary point, which was that a product designer cannot allow himself to be angry at consumers for purchasing his competitor&#x27;s products. If you think that your competitor&#x27;s products are ugly or badly designed but consumers are purchasing them any way, you cannot simply write off the consumers as uneducated or lacking in taste. Instead, you have to recognize that you are the one who is wrong. Perhaps your elegant design has hampered the actual usability of the product, or increased the cost of the product beyond what the market can bear. Or perhaps your taste is simply different from the tastes of most people.

Ruder).<p>This must be the funniest thing I&#x27;ve read all month. The &quot;mind is energized when jumping to the next line&quot;? What tripe. If that&#x27;s an accurate quote from something this E. Ruder wrote, then I know that E. Ruder is purely a BS artist. If it&#x27;s a bad summary of what E. Ruder wrote, then the author of this &quot;article&quot; is a hack. It is quite  probable that both are true. You&#x27;re not going to become a great designer by reading this pre-digested pablum. You must perform your own research, or at least read the primary sources from people who have.')
