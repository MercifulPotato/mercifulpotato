If you think 10 minutes of Duolingo every day is going to make you fluent in Chinese you&#x27;re deluding yourself, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that it can&#x27;t be a good entry point and a good way to build discipline and gauge your progress.<p>I&#x27;ve been learning the saxophone for a few months (ask my neighbours) and have used a bunch of different methods. I find that even bad practice is good practice, so to speak. It&#x27;s just important to keep a feedback loop: listen to yourself, compare yourself to good players and look for the differences. And don&#x27;t <i>just</i> use an app, vary your training using multiple sources and methods to find what works best for you, as well and filling the gaps.<p>For the saxophone I found that a good way to spot bad habits force yourself to &quot;do things right&quot; is to force yourself to play in a different key every day. This forces you to deconstruct what you&#x27;re playing, as well as making sure that you can play on the entire range of your instrument.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s better to start with good personalized private courses with a good teacher and excellent hardware but many people wouldn&#x27;t even start if that was the barrier of entry. I know that I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>Having to unlearn bad habits a few years down the line is annoying, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world.')
