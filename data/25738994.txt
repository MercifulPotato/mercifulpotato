We whitelist scripts to load, so as to enable Facebook and Twitter posts to be embedded into other sites. But, we don&#x27;t whitelist&#x2F;enable the tracking aspect of these scripts. We block them from accessing cookies and other local storage. You can modify this behavior in brave:&#x2F;&#x2F;settings&#x2F;socialBlocking<p>2. Brave has never replaced ads on pages. We block harmful, third-party ads and trackers. And, separately, we offer a privacy-respecting digital advertising model. As you point out, our model of showing ad notifications is opt-in.<p>3.

Tips made to unverified creators remain in the user&#x27;s wallet. There&#x27;s no threshold requirement here; if you tip 1 BAT to a verified creator, that tip will go out immediately. If you tip 1 BAT to an unverified creator, it will remain in your wallet for up to 90 days.<p>2.')
