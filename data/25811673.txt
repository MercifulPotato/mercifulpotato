So it&#x27;s not surprising nothing gets done.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my strategy has always been to grapple with these situations. Sometimes you get to have impact and learn in the process: eg how do I communicate about this problem in a way that gets traction? If you can do it, you will &quot;level up&quot; in your career.<p>Alternatively you may learn why things being as they are is a reasonable trade-off for the situation you are in. This may also level you up by helping you think on &quot;what makes sense for the business&quot; rathe than simply &quot;I don&#x27;t like it&quot; level.<p>At worst, you&#x27;ll have a story for your next interview about how you tried and failed to make a big improvement like this. I have a similar story and it resonates really well for senior roles.')
