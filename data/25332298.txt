The history how you reached the solution in your branch is not important, I am not interested in a wip commit which could indeed have a valid commit message, but still not final. Only the committed is interested into that.<p>So I think just before merging squashing the commits makes completely sense. Before that the committer is free to do whatever he&#x2F;she likes.<p>Of course in the case the diff of files is so big that make multiple commits sensible, means that the PR is not broken correctly. Then, it&#x27;s fine to have multiple commits, but the problem is elsewhere not in squashing them.')
