Nothing to be impressed about it; even lazy ones like me eventually get there.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised about the vi keybindings, but not at all distressed. If there are a lot of people out there who are accustomed to vi keybindings but found reasons to want to use emacs, that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I don&#x27;t use org-mode daily, but I do edit my todo list daily. If it ever gets deeply nested I&#x27;ll switch it over to org mode. And I suspect that&#x27;s what all the people using org-mode daily are doing -- todo&#x2F;idea lists.<p>I should start reading &#x2F;r&#x2F;emacs every few years to catch up on new things.')
