My work-provided laptop stays in my work area at all times, and I don&#x27;t put anything work-related on my personal laptop. I also took at least an hour or two customizing each one (name, background, dock) so that it feels different than the other. That way when I hop off my work laptop at the end of the day, if I decide to pick up my personal laptop, it immediately feels like I&#x27;m doing something different.')
