Item(by='hntrader', descendants=None, kids=[25746628], score=None, time=1610453505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745397, text='Thanks, very informative stuff.<p>(1) and (3): If we&#x27;re to use open interest (along with the gamma of such open interest), it seems that we have to make specific assumptions about whether options&#x27; market makers are going to be net short&#x2F;long, and by how much, in each specific contract, in order to perform the calculations. What such assumptions do you think that we should use for that, and I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to make it more accurate than simply assuming &quot;100% of this open interest in this specific put is held short by options market makers&quot;? That seems to be the assumption made in [1], which is definitely very incorrect but maybe it&#x27;s the best we can do?<p>(4) So I guess flow that results from vanna hedging (and the other greeks aside from delta&#x2F;gamma) is pretty small then. A number of people on Twitter make a big deal out of vanna hedging - they seem to think it can predict moves in the underlying, but they must be mistaken if not much flow comes from it as a result.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squeezemetrics.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;white_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squeezemetrics.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;white_paper.pdf</a>')
