On one hand, it feels like gouging. There’s no way the phone costs that much more to manufacture. On the other hand, I’ve been using an iPhone 6s+ since it came out (5 years now) and it still works really well and still gets software updates. I’m thinking of getting an iPhone 12 but I <i>still</i> don’t actually need to - a battery replacement every few years keeps it working as it did when it was brand new.<p>How long will my next phone last? At least 5 more years. Probably longer. Spread over 5 years the price is fine, and I’d rather buy something that’s designed to last (and remains supported) than buy a series of cheap phones that get ruined or ignored every couple years by software updates. (Looking at you, Samsung). If my phone lasts 50% longer, a 30% bump in price is reasonable. Even if I don’t use it that long, I can make that money back on the second hand market when I upgrade.')
