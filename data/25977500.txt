Restricting interstate travel is going to be very difficult to both achieve and to survive federal court challenges.<p>Some toolkits are not available to some countries. The United States is unlikely to be able to effectively use the authoritarian measures other countries have used.<p>Pointing this out gets mass downvotes on HN which is a typical libertarian paradise, but when it comes to COVID, is all about authoritarian measures to get it done. I&#x27;d be fine with them too if they were at all practical in this country, but they aren&#x27;t.')
