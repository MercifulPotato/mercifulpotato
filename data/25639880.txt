The only way unions could exist while being pro-market is if they competed with each other, which they don&#x27;t. There is only one teamsters. There is only one auto workers union. There is only one longshoreman&#x27;s union.<p>Following your logic, if your ISP has a total monopoly, and you sign a contract with them, that is pro-market transaction. Of course, we both know it isn&#x27;t. Contracts aren&#x27;t what makes a market. Competition is. And unions have no competition with each other.')
