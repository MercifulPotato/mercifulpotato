Did hedgefunds run out of credit? The problem with this reasoning is that it takes rules which apply to small investors trading through an intermediate platform and applies them to Melvin. It&#x27;s just false that anything would be a legal or rules-based trigger for Melvin to buy. They don&#x27;t HAVE to buy like people have been claiming. Melvin isn&#x27;t trading on Robinhood.')
