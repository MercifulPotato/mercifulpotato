This is crucial information, because these &quot;hit-and-run&quot; tourists are usually charged with causing the most damage to the struggling city. They tend to come in from other parts of Italy -- often from beach resorts on a bad weather day -- and rarely spend money, bringing their own food and eating illicit picnics on bridges and on waterfronts. But since they don&#x27;t stay overnight, they cannot be counted by the authorities -- until now.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand exactly why not staying overnight means they can&#x27;t be counted, and another quote does mention too many visitors in specific areas, but the problem is apparently bored domestic travelers who can&#x27;t go to the beach, not over-tourism in general. Maybe a messaging based approach would work better than this rather intrusive tracking system but who knows, I&#x27;m not Italian. I&#x27;ve been to Venice though, it&#x27;s really nice, if you get the opportunity you should take it (respectfully), even if you have to agree to be tracked.<p>Also - not sure if commenters are aware of this, but I&#x27;m pretty sure every hotel in Venice already keeps passports and IDs on file and reports who is there every day to the local authorities.')
