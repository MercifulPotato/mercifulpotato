(Although macros and monomorphization still happen in debug mode).<p>In general I don&#x27;t buy the complexity argument. Rust is more complex than Go, D or Delphi. But its not 50x more complex, or whatever we would guess from the compilation speed difference.<p>I suspect a lot of the compilation time bloat is a result of all the intermediate representations the code goes through, in order to play nice with LLVM&#x27;s optimizers and codegen. (Or to put it another way, I suspect a compiler optimized for development mode iteration has the potential to be way faster than rustc.) If you mostly don&#x27;t care about runtime performance, a debugging compiler could probably also skip monomorphization and just compile everything once and use dynamic dispatch for generics.')
