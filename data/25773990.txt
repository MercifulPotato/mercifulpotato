Polish government anti-censorship, or wider corporate governance issues vis-a-vis its shareholders and US regulators? I know where I&#x27;d put my money.<p>Plus, who is to decide what content is violating the country&#x27;s laws? Surely not courts - they would be inundated with every little petty hate comment or reference to Nazis. So it will have to be the platform anyway. And incitement to violence, hate, racial discrimination etc. are already illegal in Poland, so Twitter could go on banning whatever they like.<p>The government would like the enforcement of these laws to be very selective, but as said, in practice, it won&#x27;t be the up to the government to say what is and what isn&#x27;t legal content.')
