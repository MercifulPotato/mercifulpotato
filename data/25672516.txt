He fired the first shot.<p>She was in the middle of climbing through the top of the barricade, which is what got her shot.<p>DC is also a stand your ground territory, there is no duty to retreat even in civil matters. I think it would be very easy to convince at least a single juror that &quot;a riot attempting to break into your place of work&quot; would instill a reasonable fear of bodily harm. Doubly so when your place of work is the center of the nation&#x27;s legislative branch. Quadruply so when the rioters are known to be armed.<p>Even if the officer didn&#x27;t have reason to fear for his own life, shooting someone because you have a reasonable fear that they will cause bodily harm to someone else is legal. These people were armed and attempting to break into a session of congress. Fear that they might attempt to shoot a legislator would not be an unreasonable concern.')
