If you spent a large amount of resources in creating the library of Java code, why should only the implementation be protected? They&#x27;ve spent a lot of resources to come up with which methods to create, what to call them, how to describe them, how to organize them, how to connect them with one another, etc. That is a creative effort. They then invested in making the platform popular. If this wasn&#x27;t protected, you would have zero incentive to build high quality libraries or to invest in making the platform popular if someone else can just come along and copy it.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this type of creative expression is any more or less worthy of protection than any other code.<p>There are some other silly things mentioned in the proceedings. One is about monopolies, clearly that&#x27;s wrong because there are multiple platforms and Apple and Microsoft clearly didn&#x27;t need to copy these Java libraries. The QWERTY keyboard analogy is also not a good one since there&#x27;s a clear difference between something that is written and consists of tens of thousands of pieces vs. a relatively simple organization of characters that&#x27;s also not written (it&#x27;s physical). So that would probably go under a design patent. Another is about transformative use. There were cell phones using these Java libraries before Google decided to use them as well -- the Jasper S20 using the SavaJe OS for instance. Also the doom and gloom that the industry will break is absurdly doomsday. Simple libraries or SSO wouldn&#x27;t constitute the level complexity and creativity of Oracle&#x27;s Java libraries.<p>Google could have invested in creating its own libraries and only using the 57 or so classes that make up the Java language, made its own methods, classes, and packages. But that would have been a large effort to design them, get them battle tested, and to attract a developer community around it. It was easier to cheat to get ahead and ride the coattails of Oracle&#x27;s community that were familiar with the Java libraries they had created. Google knew what they were doing was wrong at the time, but the cost to get to market meant it was worth it. Google didn&#x27;t stop there, they continued to copy the changes that Oracle did to its libraries and copied new packages that Oracle created.<p>Finally, Google had the option to take the community license, but they didn&#x27;t want to contribute back. I say, hard cheese Google, pay up.')
