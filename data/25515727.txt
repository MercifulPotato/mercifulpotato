These aren&#x27;t MBA students, they&#x27;re engineering students, right?  Everything in a technical math curriculum builds on what came before.  If you have to start cheating <i>that</i> early, the only rational thing to do is to admit you&#x27;re not in the right program and drop out gracefully.<p>Academic ethics aside, cheating at this level is just plain bad judgment.   No one who has to cheat in Calc I is going to get through Calc II without having to do the same thing, over and over.')
