And if there are long-winded sections where you don’t get what the premise of the idea is, you’ll most probably ditch the book and find something else to read instead.\n&gt;But these elaborate creations full of complicated phrases are what you need to level up your thinking.<p>Simple writing is clear thinking. Yes, limiting yourself to well-written materials will limit your exposure to many ideas. That&#x27;s how constraints of any kind work.<p>But don&#x27;t mistake long, meandering sentences with 10 dollar words as signs of genius.<p>They&#x27;re signs of lazy writing, lazy thinking, and a desire to impress the reader with how smart the author is. Writing simply takes hard work. It&#x27;s easy to write complicated sentences. It&#x27;s easy to be hard to understand.<p>Clarity and conciseness are hard.<p>Hemingway, Vonnegut, Thompson... they wrote powerful, thoughtful works. So do Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.
