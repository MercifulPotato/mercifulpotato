Item(by='elliekelly', descendants=None, kids=[25971930], score=None, time=1612032365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971639, text='&gt; If the story about Robinhood running out of money is true, why wouldn&#x27;t they just ban buying on margin and not all buying? I don&#x27;t understand that.<p>Because DTCC requires cash collateral while the transaction is settled whether the transaction happens in a margin account or a cash account. There&#x27;s no distinction from DTCC&#x27;s perspective. DTCC (reportedly) increased the collateral on $GME transactions to 100% of the transaction price compared to the typical 1-3% of the price.')
