GTK2 + QT with GTK2-style would get you an almost seamless experience.<p>The &quot;dark or light&quot; theme we have today is an absolute joke by comparison.<p>Many Gtk-engines were also much faster in terms of pure rendering speed.<p>Another issue as mentioned is that per-control CSS skinning breaks easily with custom themes. Instead of using system colors devs often hard-code a custom look.<p>Finally, some programs go for a fully custom theme that doesn&#x27;t even work properly without. Darktable is one example. Darktable looks cool, but a long time I had a hard time reading it&#x27;s controls since it didn&#x27;t respect system&#x27;s font sizes nor it allowed to change it. The contrast was poor. It now comes with several themes, but nothing matches my system theme, which is more accessible.<p>As much as I love darktable, I&#x27;d skip the custom UI any day.')
