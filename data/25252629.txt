Item(by='franciscop', descendants=None, kids=[25253886], score=None, time=1606734680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252169, text='As a European [1], I have no idea what you refer when you say &quot;especially most software built by individual hobbyists is [...] not great&quot;. Have you seen the websites built professionally by consulting agencies? Public administrations? Sure a hobbyist <i>just starting out</i> doesn&#x27;t write great code, but hobbyists care a lot more about quality and will improve a lot faster than those just slinging sausages or those making the bucks.<p>When I peek into your average open source project (made, mostly, by hobbyists) I see good to great quality. Whenever any private code gets leaked, or on your average company, or just inspecting websites, you see the horrors. Just my experience here :)<p>[1] Spaniard, I do believe our websites might be on the bottom of quality of Europe though, so my experience might be different from other &quot;European&quot;s :)')
