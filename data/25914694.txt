Most of the losses were in the writer&#x27;s team. We only lost one engineer.<p>As a result, our writing output was considerably smaller. To mitigate this, we did two things:<p>1. Mozilla hired some contractors to help keep the continuous web platform documentation updates happening, so MDN does not become out of date.<p>2. Mozilla plus Google, Microsoft, Samsung, W3C, Coil, and other supporters worked together to create Open Web Docs, which provides funding to hire more full-time writing staff to help MDN content keep getting better.<p>Step 1 was really just getting MDN out of trouble, and back to stability. Step 2 is about letting us go further and start evolving MDN&#x27;s content.<p>MDN is staying inside Mozilla; we still contribute a lot to MDN in terms of engineering, infrastructure, and writing costs. It is just that we now have OWD contributing to writing costs as well, to help safeguard the content.<p>This is a good thing â€” it allows all the interested orgs to get together and agree on future content directions for MDN together, rather than just working away on it in our own little pockets. And we&#x27;ll be developing a shared process to follow to make sure that all work is going in the right direction.')
