Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609810061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640656, text='That’s a real concern in terms of meritocracy, but I don’t see how it makes your goals orthogonal to everyone else’s, unless you are always a young out-performer. Almost by default, if you’re not job  hopping (presumably to get a raise) you won’t always be one of the younger employees. The out-performance piece is by definition an edge case.<p>The original comment seemed to lay claim that each individual will sacrifice for the collective to become a net negative. I think there’s a good case to be against seniority rules, but it’s almost impossible to claim they are against <i>every individual</i> self interest.')
