The reason there is so much contradiction is that we can&#x27;t deal with the complex relationships between variables or the unknown unknowns. The only reason medicine is able to do decent studies is because they can tightly control things in RCTs. Correlational&#x2F;observational studies are almost never good enough to make strong statements about anything.')
