When you add a new map, the app needs to know where it&#x27;s located. So, you&#x27;ll have to take 2 keypoints of your map (e.g. cities) and search for them in the app. To do so an internet connection is needed.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done this, the position of the map is stored so you can reuse it whenever you want and be located on your map without internet connection')
