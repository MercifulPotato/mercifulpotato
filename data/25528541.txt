Nobody wants to know what you had for breakfast, but given the nature of the bug, clearly staring and restating the state of LANG, TERM, any intercepting terminal emulators, and how you were running this (on a serial try), would&#x27;ve helped narrow down the bug.<p>Your initial report started with an incorrect premise - fish does not work on a vt220. The real bug ended up being that fish does not work on Linux serial ttys. That&#x27;s <i>fine</i> - we all make these kinds of mistaken assumptions about bugs - but it&#x27;s here where mentioning all the details helps.<p>For example, without info about how it&#x27;s hooked up via serial to a getty, it&#x27;s unlikely someone unfamiliar with these setups would think about the possible consequences of that. And without mentioning the state of TERM, the bug is ambiguous: does fish not work on a physical vt220 with <i>some</i> settings, or does fish not work with TERM=vt220? Those are two different problems.<p>Excessive verbosity is fluff, but excess brevity leads to information loss. Some redundancy is required to ensure the meaning gets across. This is human error correction.<p>You weren&#x27;t rude or entitled, but everyone on that thread, yourself included, displayed less than ideal bug reporting and handling skills. Things could&#x27;ve gone much more smoothly.')
