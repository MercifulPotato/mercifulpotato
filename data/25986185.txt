Item(by='ineptech', descendants=None, kids=[25991249], score=None, time=1612161121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25985311, text='&gt; I understand that it feels like the odds are stacked against you.  But Iâ€™m asking you to please reconsider... [ followed by table of great S&amp;P outcomes ]<p>I think the author misunderstands the threat here, and it&#x27;s much graver than they think.  Remember the U2 album Apple pushed to everybody&#x27;s iphones?<p>Same thing here.  What happened last week is the cracks showing, people being forcibly reminded that they are not in control.  In Apple&#x27;s case it was iphone owners being jolted out of the pleasant fantasy that their phone is a little piece of territory they alone control.  In GME&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s people thinking of the stock market as something that exists <i>for</i> them to use, like a supermarket.  And the jolting reality is that the stock market has become a vast and incomprehensible playground for billionaires to gamble with derivatives, in which the retail investor is <i>incidentally</i> allowed to participate only insofar as their money is helping to push up prices.<p>So the threat to the market is not what the author seems to be speaking to (a hypothetical investor who will buy in late, lose money, and get sore about it).  The threat is people getting the general feeling that the stock market is shady, and deciding to buy a rental property, start a small business, etc.')
