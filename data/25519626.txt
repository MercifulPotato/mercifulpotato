Although just as a GTK-theme, not the entire desktop. Window manager is FVWM and taskbar&#x2F;panel&#x2F;session-manager is LXQt, so it&#x27;s a bit of a Franken-desktop :)<p>For Qt-apps I use the &quot;Windows&quot; style so they fit together nicely.<p>Comparing Memphis and Chicago, there are some layout-bugs in Memphis, but I feel like it&#x27;s overall a bit better balanced than Chicago.<p>I think all new themes are too bright and flat, Windows 9X was perfect (at least in that regard).')
