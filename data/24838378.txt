I feel like these things are a speed bump when I run into them though. I recently canceled a my service with a utility. Instead of a simple form to select a date to shut off service, provide a new mailing address, and a submit button, I had to go through this artificial “dialog” with a robot. What if I made a typo in the date? How do I go back and fix it? Restart the whole thing? Try magical NLP strings like “change cancelation date” and see what happens? It just feels like a step backward to funnel interactions that used to be carried out using a rich UI through a chat dialog. I wonder how this affects usability for blind or mobility impaired people too. It might be better for them, idk.<p>Chat dialog interfaces can be cool as a way to piggyback a service through existing chat services. I used to love goog411 back in the SMS era. But I don’t want everything I do with a computer reduced down to a fake chat with a robot.')
