However, the theory of operation for SSA <i>itself</i> isn&#x27;t tied to any particular control flow representation: it only stipulates the two rules mentioned in the post.<p>My goal with this post was to introduce SSA at a high level and show <i>why</i> it makes a few optimizations simpler, without requiring readers to understand the other parts of an optimizing compiler (like why we reduce the CFG&#x27;s representation to a graph of basic blocks). It&#x27;s why I chose to use pseudo-C for some of the SSA reduction examples, rather than LLVM IR. But I certainly understand that this approach doesn&#x27;t work for everybody :-)')
