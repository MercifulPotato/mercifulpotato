Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610468823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748698, text='&gt; cannot be reasonably described as moderate.<p>I would agree with this. I knew Aaron, at least in terms of our mutual involvement in the intellectual freedom movement, and worked with him on various things (though not well, I was a pretty shitty python coder back then).<p>His positions, like mine, were definitely in the &quot;extreme&quot;, in the sense that 99% of people either 1) don&#x27;t agree that we should abolish copyright and patents OR don&#x27;t have an opinion on it.<p>But there can be a negative connotation to the word &quot;extreme&quot; that I don&#x27;t think applies here. Our stance is extreme in the sense that the Internet was extreme in the 1970&#x27;s, or the Web extreme in the 1990&#x27;s, or civil rights extreme in the 1950&#x27;s, or women&#x27;s right to vote extreme in the 1920&#x27;s.<p>Another way to put it: he was far ahead of our time on issues of justice.')
