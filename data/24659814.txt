I picture a misconfigured Kubernetes setup irreversibly taking out an entire fleet of satellites.<p>The mission sounds cool, and I understand its application:<p>&gt; <i>KubeSat is an open-source project for building a cognitive, autonomous framework for satellite constellations and swarms.</i><p>But couldn&#x27;t the cognition layer run at a ground station? The ground station would then control the satellites using a limited control layer that&#x27;s as robust and bug-free as possible. Debugging a bad Kubernetes setup in space sounds like a nightmare.')
