Top notch analysis.<p>Governments &quot;forcibly forbid&quot; their citizens from developing nuclear weapons. Similarly so for things far less dangerous than nukes because, you know, &quot;less dangerous than a nuke&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly synonymous with &quot;safe&quot;. I can&#x27;t top your &quot;top-notch analysis&quot; though, so this will be my last reply.')
