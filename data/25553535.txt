And they won&#x27;t use secure passwords on their site, and they&#x27;ll use fake 2-factor, because those incidents don&#x27;t bother them enough to want to prevent.<p>So when capitalism says a type of security isn&#x27;t necessary, well, other than a nihilist &quot;nothing is necessary&quot; attitude, I don&#x27;t believe them.  And it doesn&#x27;t prove that what a company does is &quot;just as secure&quot; as best practices.<p>&gt; When you start with a premise that all sites MUST have HTTPS and MUST NOT support TLSv1.0 in each argument, then your arguments are simply unsound, because they&#x27;re based on an incorrect premise<p>Whew, good thing I wasn&#x27;t doing that.<p>&gt;  If you intentionally disable your blog from working on such older devices, shifting the blame to device manufacturer is simply ludicrous!<p>Let me try to be clear again, since you definitely misread me.<p>Disabling HTTP is on the site owner.<p>HTTPS breaking is the manufacturer&#x27;s fault.  The site can influence how it breaks, but no matter what a very old implementation will be broken.  At a certain point you can&#x27;t even get certificates any more because all the roots are expired.<p>&gt;  All my sites are HTTP-only<p>So you don&#x27;t want your users to even be able to opt in to privacy or protection from hostile networks?')
