Just because we pay taxes in dollars doesn&#x27;t give it any intrinsic value. It has been decreed by the US government that we do so but that doesn&#x27;t change the underlying fact that the dollar is based onâ€¦ nothing other than a promise of the government that it&#x27;s useful.<p>Because more gold can be mined and more dollars can be printed, each block of gold and dollar loses value, because they&#x27;re not scarce.<p>A dollar in 1913 had the same buying power as $26 in 2020 [1]. Bitcoin is hard money; it can&#x27;t be deflated and it can&#x27;t lose buying power like all fiat currencies do.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebalance.com&#x2F;what-is-the-value-of-a-dollar-today-3306105" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebalance.com&#x2F;what-is-the-value-of-a-dollar-tod...</a>')
