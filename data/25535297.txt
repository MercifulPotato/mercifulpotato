Please optimize for casual users and due to Covid-19 social distancing more people are forced to making and editing their own video.<p>These are my two suggestions:<p>1)Try to enable targeted video size feature for the generated&#x2F;exported video. Also design a simple UI menu to automatically transcode and resize the generated video according to the chosen video format.<p>2) Make it easy for the authoring of the sub-title by including dead simple and easy to use vector graphic editor built-in and integrated inside the video editor (not third party full blown vector editor).')
