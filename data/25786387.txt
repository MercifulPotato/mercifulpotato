If you had relatives being deported or being shot by the police, it’s likely that you wouldn’t just tell your friends&#x2F;family « sorry, i have no control over this »<p>My grandparents paid attention to politics, as did many in the United States at the time. TV news was watched, no Internet, lot of newspaper reading.<p>They were sent to Tule Lake and interned for being Japanese-American all the same; their possessions stolen by a government who doesn&#x27;t care if its citizens &quot;care&quot; about politics.<p>The average person has no control over &quot;politics.&quot; Caring about it didn&#x27;t save my grandparents, nor the protests of all of their friends.<p>No one took care of that dirty work. That&#x27;s the great delusion.')
