Lots of redundancies.<p>For example, each dependency may have its own messaging or thread management system, or its own memory management system.<p>Or it may include other dependencies that have their own &quot;special sauce.&quot;<p>For myself, I use lots of <i>little</i> packages; mostly written by Yours Troolie, and only occasionally use third-party dependencies.<p>Each of my packages is usually crafted towards a certain discrete function, and has its own project lifecycle. I think that&#x27;s a good thing about using dependencies. I believe that modules with encapsulated lifecycles are a good way to ensure quality (or not, if I &quot;choose poorly,&quot; as the Knight Templar said in the <i>Indiana Jones</i> movie).')
