Even if you work inside Microsoft you wouldn&#x27;t know that unless you&#x27;re in one of very special positions there, in which case by saying what you&#x27;re saying here you&#x27;re violating your Microsoft and government NDA.<p>e.g. I know the special Windows and Office builds that go to the DOD are prepared by a very small core of engineers to remove all telemetry code and such. The majority of the actual engineers who work on the product have no idea about and don&#x27;t have access to the source code of those builds to  know how different they are from the regular builds.<p>Even the executives who work in those special projects can not have exact knowledge, and definitely not if they&#x27;re not US citizens even if they are the actual managers of the engineers doing the work. The engineers can&#x27;t tell their own bosses any details in those cases.<p>What &quot;evidence&quot; on Earth do you think can anyone here provide that any company is cooperating with the US government? Closest we got were the Snowden documents, and those did actually indeed provide information that Microsoft in particular was sharing customer data with the US.<p>I am okay if you want to say there is no evidence of data sharing, but I take issue when you say that lack of public evidence is itself evidence of not sharing.')
