What they did is chop up the lecture.  When students asked a question, that was omitted from the online presentation.  The result is that an hour of class winds up being, say, four 12-minute videos.<p>That sounds weird, and it can be a bit choppy, but it has advantages.  You get to stop and think at the points where others needed to ask questions.  You have natural breaking points if you prefer smaller-sized bites.<p>So, I don&#x27;t know if the students are in <i>all</i> of your video, or just when they ask questions.  But if it&#x27;s only when they ask questions, you might consider this approach.')
