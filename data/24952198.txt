If you make someone an offer and it doesn’t Include health insurance, and they accept, and the individual mandate isn’t enforced anymore, then theres no additional burden on the company.<p>I’ve been offered jobs without health insurance and didn’t accept them. I’ve contracted for those companies as I’m my own company and have had a group health plan for myself and others&#x2F;partners. Figure the premium can be $1000-1200&#x2F;per.<p>Getting it is easy.
