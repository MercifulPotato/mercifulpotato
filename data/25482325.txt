The entire main stream media has lost all credibility. And if you are on the opposite side of the political spectrum of the 95% of media, then you are aware of a lot more fake journalism done by the media and yet get called names by people.<p>Even now, reading through the comments, it seems like a lot of people are congratulating NYTimes for finally admitting their entire podcast was bust. After all the damage has already been done, majority of the retractions don&#x27;t even get to most people who read&#x2F;listened to the original fake journalism and NYTimes is only retracting now because they got caught and they ignored all the multiple challenges which were raised originally.')
