With the weird patches for greylisting, etc., I never wanted to update it.  In the last week, I jumped to docker-mailserver[0].  O.M.G.  That is too easy!  Yes, there is picking one&#x27;s way through the options at first, but those go in a tiny config file and survive updates.  The heavy lifting is all in one container.  I just use it as a mail gateway, into a local machine that has port 25 filtered, but I played a bit with the imap functions, too.  You do have to have a box somewhere that can run containers, which for me is a KVM VPS.<p>Gmail instantly was happy with my inbound emails.  I got on a backscatter blacklist because I didn&#x27;t immediately drop invalid email addresses at the gateway, but that will time out shortly.  And just as I had settled in with the new server, I got to test the update function.  This week the entire docker-mailserver project moved to a new repo name on Github, with a new release.  A couple of the config files changed names, but nothing much in contents.  A docker pull for the new image name, and my mail server was running the fresh release.  Happy, happy, happy.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docker-mailserver&#x2F;docker-mailserver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docker-mailserver&#x2F;docker-mailserver</a>')
