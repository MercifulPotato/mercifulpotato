In the full title report I got documents dating back to 1880 - all hand written. I got to read about various families that owned the land, and transferred ownership to various companies, including &quot;Northern California Power Company Consolidated&quot; in 1917 and eventually &quot;Pacific Gas and Electric Company&quot; as of December 10th 1948.<p>It is a total mind-fuck how tied up we are with that company.<p>But, I do have some hope that at some point in the future mini-grid technology will replace these large juggernauts.')
