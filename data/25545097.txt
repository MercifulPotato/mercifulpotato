While a lot of &quot;old growth&quot; is indeed gone, the idea that the US has been deforested is not really correct.  Moreover, vast areas of the east coast has been returned to forest from what was farmland in the late 1800&#x27;s and early 1900&#x27;s.<p>Overall, generally speaking, the ecological condition of the continental US is probably better today than at any time in the past century.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mff.forest.mtu.edu&#x2F;TreeBasics&#x2F;PICs&#x2F;Trends03.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mff.forest.mtu.edu&#x2F;TreeBasics&#x2F;PICs&#x2F;Trends03.jpg</a>')
