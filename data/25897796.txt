Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=[25898076], score=None, time=1611535691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25897143, text='Sorry, I meant 3-in-4 are female, not 1-in-4.<p>&gt; A very confused sexism.<p>To an uncritical thinker, it might definitely seem that way.<p>To address the &quot;liberal arts college&quot; aspect, I mean specifically they&#x27;re insulated from a lot of the reality of the rest of the world. I specifically mean the Dartmouths, Browns, etc. of the educational world.<p>I mean people for whom a $200,000 education to have a $35,000 - $115,000 a year job is perfectly reasonable, because after all, they&#x27;re not the ones paying for it in any capacity. Their family can easily foot the bill, and if they can&#x27;t, then they end up married to a junior IB &#x2F; exec type who can easily afford to pay back that pesky student loan.<p>Obviously this skews more female because of evolutionary dynamics, but you still probably get the occasional male for whom this might be an option of some kind.<p>So what are the implications of a majority female, thoroughly middle class-to-upper middle class group who attended the same or similar small liberals arts colleges?<p>Homogeneity. Women are statistically more willing to conform to the group, or rather, they&#x27;re higher in trait agreeableness if you want to hash it out scientifically. This means a reluctance to champion a book that could cause controversy, much less intense controversy. We&#x27;re seeing this already with Penguin having to deal with employees demanding that Jordan Peterson&#x27;s new book not be published.<p>The second layer of homogeneity is that in order to do well at those colleges - to even be accepted beyond being the &#x27;token&#x27; of your specific sub-divided little group - is that you need to speak a certain way, act a certain way, and think a certain way. That gets reinforced and becomes self-selecting. The location of the major publishing houses are all large cosmopolitan cities, cities where the concerns are, &quot;Do I seem culturally accepting enough?&quot;, &quot;Am I projecting the &#x27;correct&#x27; values?&quot;, etc.<p>You need not take my word for it though. You can find plenty of authors who complain about these sorts of things.<p>EDIT: I should add... I know these people. I occasionally work with and consult for these people. The certainty of their positions relative to their utter lack of worldly experience is not just staggering, but offensive.<p>I&#x27;ve travelled all over the world, for over 19 years. I&#x27;ve been to 72 countries, I&#x27;ve lived in 12 different nations for over a year at a time. Women and men with the kind of credentials I&#x27;ve mentioned above are almost always the same. They&#x27;re utterly convinced of their own moral superiority, whilst also being utterly ignorant of anything outside of their little bubbles.')
