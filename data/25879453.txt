Here&#x27;s the money quote: &quot;American culture&quot;. How is American culture relevant here? I thought we were talking about a religious holiday (Christmas), and that if the religion is sincere then you&#x27;re trying to lead people by your witness to find Christ, beyond nationality and even culture. Christmas as such is simply a symbol, rather than an aim in itself.<p>It seems as if you&#x27;re operating from an axiom that many other discussants do not agree on. No wonder the conversation seems like it&#x27;s folks talking past each other.')
