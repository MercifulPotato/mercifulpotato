QUIC is just basically TCP over UDP in that it shares the same semantics (guaranteed, in order delivery of a bidirectional data stream with congestion control). Sure, game engines donâ€™t always want all those attributes - guaranteed delivery, for example - and will implement their own thing over UDP that makes more sense for them. QUIC is just as bad as TCP for those use cases though!')
