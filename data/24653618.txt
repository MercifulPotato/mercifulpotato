Now I have a Macbook Pro at home and another Macbook Pro at work, four Thunderbolt ports on each.<p>I think the big problem is the fact that it&#x27;s still very implementation dependent and, as the author said, it&#x27;s easy to get peripherals (particularly power-related) that don&#x27;t do what you expected them to do. Then again, I have the same problem with USB1&amp;2. How many times have you bought a cable and found that it only carries power, not data, because it only has two wires inside? That has happened to me dozens of times over the past decade. Still happens today. But when you get peripherals that work, USB-C and Thunderbolt3 are terrific. I don&#x27;t use and peripherals at home. I have a dock on my desk at work that gives me gigabit ethernet, external keyboard and mouse, external hard drive, two displays, power, and headphones all through one Thunderbolt cable that takes one second to plug or unplug. It&#x27;s terrific.<p>I remember old men ranting when the iMac didn&#x27;t have a floppy drive, how it needed more serial ports, parallel ports, and fewer USB ports because no one uses USB, it&#x27;s too expensive and it&#x27;s never going to be practical. Those arguments didn&#x27;t age well. USB-C is rolling out more slowly than previous options, but it is rolling out and it&#x27;s terrific.')
