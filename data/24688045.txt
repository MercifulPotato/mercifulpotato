Lots of people for example understand the principle of leasing an apartment or car, and in those cases it&#x27;s much harder for the true owner to arbitrarily take the property away from you.<p>&gt; Actually I have a radical opinion: copyright should be abolished and it should be illegal to implement DRM in any form.<p>Radical opinions further tell people that you are not being pragmatic about what you are saying and therefore it can&#x27;t be very practical advice. That is another reason why I expect people weren&#x27;t receptive to your warnings.')
