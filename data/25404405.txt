In fact, a &quot;gradual shading&quot; on refresh might even make for a neat transition effect[1].<p>IMHO it&#x27;s just the &quot;cartel&quot; (they like to keep the details of driving their displays confidential) of EPD controller companies who haven&#x27;t produced controllers with more than 16 levels of grayscale, but the material is fundamentally analog and here is proof that if you drive the display directly, you can get at least 32 levels of grayscale if not more:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16140284" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16140284</a><p>With a bit of careful calibration, I believe far finer grayscale is possible.<p>[1] Although EPDs have been around for a long time now, I have yet to see the demoscene do anything with them --- a directly driven display naturally allows for a lot of effects due to it effectively being an &quot;analog write-only memory&quot;.')
