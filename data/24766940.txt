A way to get the data out, inventory the integration points, enumerate the site-specific user procedures oriented towards business teams that need to be re-oriented towards a new system, a central location of customizations (containers are slightly helping here, with their notion of a centralized location of persistent configuration data across builds), how to test, and so on, is nearly always left to the team tasked years and sometimes decades down the road to figure out, instead of the team that originally stood up the system and has the information fresher in their minds.<p>This generally isn&#x27;t done because no one wants to budget for those activities; they don&#x27;t show up as revenue-positive.
