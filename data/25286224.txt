Is google doing something for that? It is so annoying to spend time on web nowadays. I find myself skipping search results when website looks bloated to me. So it is like ‘search something, quickly look at results, try to click on most accurate and lightweight looking link, if website is actually bloated click back without waiting it to be fully loaded and try again on another link.’')
