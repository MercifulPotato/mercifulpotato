One thing we do is start every all hands meeting with a personal update.  Everyone gets a chance, if they want, to talk about something personal.  A movie they saw, a kid&#x27;s accomplishment, etc.<p>But these updates are limited to the weekly all hands meeting.  Other meetings just get right into it.<p>It seems to be a good balance of getting to know your coworkers and not wasting too much time.  In the grand scheme of things, it probably takes up less time than all the random water cooler chitchat that takes place in an office.')
