Successfully and profitably, or not, is another question altogether.<p>Even in the past when i&#x27;ve procrastinated, i still 1. had the ideas to work on, and 2. spent some time after work many days to work on the projects.<p>If the question had been &#x27;how do you build profitable projects and earn $100k+ per year doing so?&#x27;, i would not have commented.<p>But given the 2 questions asked, i definitely have an opinion i could share, regardless if it is agreed upn by anyone else.')
