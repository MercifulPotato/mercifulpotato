If my hard work is going to be looked at as an <i>insult</i> or entitled request, go to hell.  That sort of rudeness is shocking to me.<p>In projects I maintain, I get my share of spammy low effort requests and I ignore them or reply with a polite &quot;Need more info&quot; or &quot;no time for now&quot;.  It&#x27;s not really that big of a deal.<p>For other projects that I use and appreciate, I have also spent hours before gathering useful debug information, only for it to be completely ignored.  If I spend hours building a nice report for you and you won&#x27;t spend 5 minutes reading it and two minutes responding with &quot;sorry but I&#x27;m too busy&quot; then who is the entitled one here?  Further for you to look at it as an insult?<p>I rarely even send PRs these days because those often rot for months or years.<p>This is not a user problem, this is a people problem.  Please people, lets make these types of people into the minority in open source.  Please, let&#x27;s give each other the benefit of the doubt.  Let&#x27;s appreciate effort on both sides.  Don&#x27;t be a doormat, but don&#x27;t lose your humanity either.<p>In short, let&#x27;s be great to one another.')
