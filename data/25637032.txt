There are difficult to map regions of the genome, some of which are interesting. Only recent advances in long read sequencers have helped to solve some of these issues [1].<p>For the future to truly be amazing with one sequencing the lab prep, chemistry, and equipment required needs to advance. Oxford Nanopore has some advancements here [2] but it&#x27;s still a ways to go before you could have a sample prepared as easily as an ultrasound or x-ray.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;human-genome-not-fully-sequenced&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;human-genome-not-fully-s...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecseq.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;ngs&#x2F;are-there-regions-in-the-genome-that-are-not-coverered-by-dna-sequencing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecseq.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;ngs&#x2F;are-there-regions-in-the-g...</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoporetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;voltrax" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoporetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;voltrax</a>')
