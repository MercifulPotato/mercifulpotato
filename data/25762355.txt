But at a first glance it looks to me that this could be very difficult. Because AFAIK the SF search is relatively complicated. Even for Leela implementing an  efficient batched search on multiple GPUs seems to be difficult (some improvements coming with Ceres).  And Leela is using a much simple MCTS search. That doesn&#x27;t that Leela&#x27;s search could not be improved. It does not give higher priority necessarily for forced sequence of moves (at least not explicitly) or high risk moves. Which is IMHO why sometimes she does not see relatively simple tactics.')
