Yes it is &quot;early&quot; and I expect it to evolve but I like where they are going.<p>A number of boards I&#x27;ve done recently were essentially PCB wiring harnesses for a bunch of breakout boards. Why? Because it was easy and quick and I could get from idea to something that could be shown to work quickly. Also for a lot of things most of the circuits are already out there and its just a matter of putting things together.<p>Things I would like to see in the future:<p>1) A &quot;box&quot; form factor so that things could easily be put into a chassis. Ideally the box would be an STL file so you could print it to the height as needed.<p>2) A &quot;ui&quot; mode which is basically the board design tools but with all indicators and controls, and a constraint that once you have everything laid out the way you want it has a single wiring harness between it and that &quot;main&quot; board.<p>This is also something that Crowd Supply could knock out I suspect if they were inclined to do so.')
