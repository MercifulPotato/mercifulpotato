A lady was convicted of felony theft. She walked into a store grabbed a mink coat and tried to run out with it. Not realizing it was chained to a pole.<p>Appeals court ruled that just because it wasn&#x27;t possible doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a crime to attempt.<p>These guys tried to prevent congress from transferring the presidency from Trump to Biden. That&#x27;s a coup attempt. Being an idiot isn&#x27;t an excuse.')
