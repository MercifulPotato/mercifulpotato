Do people need real computers? Are their lives not improving because they don&#x27;t have a real computer? I don&#x27;t think either is true. Real computers are available everywhere for very low prices, if they need it, they have every possible opportunity to get it. Additionally, isn&#x27;t it possible that a person wants to use an iPhone <i>alongside</i> their real computer? I know many people like that - my programmer friends included.')
