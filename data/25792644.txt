I actually wrote a blog post about this recently: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevincox.ca&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;tabs-were-a-mistake&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevincox.ca&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;tabs-were-a-mistake&#x2F;</a><p>The Chrome is an interesting example because it seems that some people liked it but it was arguably a bit of a botched implementation. (It seems like when Chome was killed and opened again it would put all of the tabs at the front, instead of sorting them by the time each tab was last used). Also people were complaining about no longer being able to swipe between tabs, but with Android gesture navigation this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue anymore.<p>I&#x27;ll take a look at dtach too. I think one of the benefits of using tmux just for reattaching is that tmux is widely used and tested against all sort of shell escape codes. I have a slight worry that the less popular tools will not handle all of the cases as gracefully. I&#x27;m hoping that I am wrong though and it works well.')
