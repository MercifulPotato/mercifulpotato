I bet you get similar correlation with wealth.<p>Why aren&#x27;t those two sides of the same coin?  I mean, smart people can generally figure out how to accrue and maintain wealth.<p>Someone will say by way of counter-example that, let&#x27;s say the Kardashians are not smart.  But they seem awfully clever at manipulating their publicity in ways that bring them wealth.<p>So it really seems to have more to do with whether one has a narrow conception of intelligence as being able to, say, find new theories in QCD or derive relativity, rather than being able to figure out how to accomplish things beneficial to themselves.  Which might be D-K in effect, but who knows?')
