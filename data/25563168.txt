I only have: a router on the floor, some tatamis with a futon on them, and a desk with my computer.<p>The problem is that my flat is getting cold these days. I have not enough stuff to &quot;keep&quot; heat with inertia so I need to keep the radiator turned on during day and night. And that&#x27;s pretty expensive (~â‚¬0.18&#x2F;kWh).<p>That&#x27;s my minimalist home!')
