We’re building a music-focused social network fighting back against algorithmically generated playlists and soulless corporate radio. We’re creating a democratized platform people connect with their music, their favorite artists, and each other.  We&#x27;re looking to add an Android developer with an eye for detail and a passion for performance to help build out our new app from scratch.<p>We are a small team developers working collaboratively in a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our dev team has a wide range of backgrounds—including self-taught hackers and bootcamp grads.<p>While the position is remote, we’re based in NYC and generally availability for collaboration between 10am and 4pm Eastern time. Interest in relocating to NYC in the post-pandemic future is desirable, but not required.<p>Email me at andrew@stationhead.com if you&#x27;re interested. Be sure to include the name of your favorite band in the email!')
