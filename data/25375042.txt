The two were not aligned, and TK culture was still very prominent back then (work hard, dont go home early, we are going to be a 1 trillion dollar company etc etc) and Thuan definitely helped him spread that culture. So definitely not great days but I think the engineers took away a lot from their time there. Lots of lessons learned')
