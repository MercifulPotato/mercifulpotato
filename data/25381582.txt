Not only external users but also some internal apps n such. One guy from a GIS section talked up and was like, hey is this going to affect the maps on water.weather.gov and other sites? The head dude was like, yup it is. So even internal agencies are getting affected by it.<p>Overall tho yes. Some large players take the data here , process it, and resell at larger value. Some might call it a value add. Accuweather is shit tho so dont ever go to them for anything')
