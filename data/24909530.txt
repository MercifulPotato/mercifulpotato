Or do many people simply not actually care?  Can you just park by the side of the road and go walking in the woods?<p>Because ultimately, that&#x27;s what I have here. I can just park off of the side of the road so long as it isn&#x27;t blocking anyone and go off into the woods. I can do that and camp. Or sleep in the car, even. Without being worried about any trouble whatsoever. I can do this hours away from home without needing to know who owns the land.<p>Indiana doesn&#x27;t need signs: If a local cop sees your out-of-town plates parked by the road or sees you in someone else&#x27;s woods, they are going to ask about it. Lots of folks don&#x27;t care all that much, however, especially if you aren&#x27;t camping or hunting, so if they see you, they might say hi but that&#x27;s about it. (Parents had some acres of woods, and didn&#x27;t care with the exception of hunters - they wanted to know when hunters were about so they didn&#x27;t let kids or dogs in the woods without proper safety colors).')
