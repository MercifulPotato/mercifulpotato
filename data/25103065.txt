Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605462337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102940, text='These headlines are always so disappointingly misleading.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Varies annually, but I&#x27;m invoicing anywhere between $175-275K per year on average. YTD, I&#x27;ve invoiced $258,170.57. I&#x27;m a freelance writer and subject matter expert with a small team 3-4 of subcontractors who help with production and research.<p>Invoicing $275K&#x2F;year (gross revenue) and paying a team of 3-4 subcontractors is hardly equivalent to someone earning $275K&#x2F;year.<p>These articles would be vastly more interesting and helpful if the people involved could simply break down their actual earnings. People always want to see how a business works. It&#x27;s not helpful to read about stories where the actual interesting numbers are deliberately omitted to produce a better clickbait title.<p>Also, this interview is full of weird softball questions like &quot;What is your gender and ethnicity?&quot; and &quot;Where do you live?&quot; . Would have been far more interesting if they had covered how the person gets leads, how they network, and so on. It&#x27;s not really helpful to know that &quot;Organization&quot; is a skill that helps this person thrive at work.')
