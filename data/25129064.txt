App developers <i>should</i> opt in to ignoring transport security. I’m sure a bunch of Android shitware attempts to install CAs either via user interaction or exploitation.<p>&gt; Once we go down this path there&#x27;s no turning back to the user-centric Web of the 1990s &#x2F; 2000s<p>The landscape we live in now is very different to then. I’m all for a free web, but not at the cost of security. The web is now a multi billion trillion dollar industry. Weakening security just so Bob can see Alices’ holiday pics in situation where Alice can’t figure out letsencrypt, is frankly unhinged.<p>If you want a ‘free web’ you’re welcome to disable any HTTPS enforcement and disable TLS cert checking entirely. Hell, fork a browser, be very clear about the security weaknesses and publish on github if you feel that strongly, I’ll even star it for you.')
