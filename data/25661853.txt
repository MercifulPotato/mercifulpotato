Especially that that response towards BLM was completely unjustified and plain wrong.<p>However, after watching the streams for a while now, I feel, the current response <i>might</i> have been the best to avoid shootings&#x2F;deaths.<p>Evacuation seems to have worked (so far, fingers are crossed). And I can definitely see right-wing terrorists shooting armed guards to get into the building and the chambers.<p>The events are an absolute disgrace, but any stronger response might have triggered the terrorists even more.<p>EDIT: Sorry, is this really such a stupid argument? Does the symbolism of entering the building trump that of a bloodbath?<p>For context, right-wing groups &#x27;stormed&#x27; German parliament a couple of months ago and nobody is talking about it anymore since nothing really happened.')
