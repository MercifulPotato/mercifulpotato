The food on board was nice (Polish catering wagon).<p>The Train to Lisbon though was really old and the food well eh. But arriving at sunrise in Lisbon was well worth it.<p>I am happy that the sleeper trains come back to existence, more eco friendly, more relaxed traveling, more cargo and less restrictions than with air travel (e.g. &gt; 100ml liquids)')
