The federal government needed to work with the states that were being hit hardest by Coronavirus, when they were being hit. Instead some got a random $1200 check and some PPP loans, when many didn&#x27;t even need it yet.<p>States had a choice, leave everything open and deal with the loss of life, and still suffer as people would be going out less. OR shut down to help prevent deaths and hope the federal government would help (which it should have).<p>Instead it became a political battle to give corporate immunity, and nobody got anything after March.')
