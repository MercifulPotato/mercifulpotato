I thought all of the browsers years ago identified homoglyph attacks and deployed defenses. For example, in Safari, this domain does render as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com</a> because Safari decided this was a homoglyph attack. My impression was all the browsers did this for any domain that used a homoglyph of a latin character, so why is Firefox failing?')
