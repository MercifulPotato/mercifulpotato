It was pretty shocking to witness the lack of knowledge in regards to how the human brain works, and more specifically lacking in how to heal&#x2F;treat an injured brain.<p>Immediately following the accident, we saw other patients in the same condition as her and tracked their progress for comparison sake. The common theme was that patients either made significant progress (with motor skills, talking, etc) within the first 0-3 weeks, or not really at all. It seemed like once scar-tissue started forming in the brain, critical brain connectivity began to get <i>blocked</i> (not necessarily <i>broken</i>). If we can better understand the underlying mechanism behind the &quot;signal blocking&quot; vs &quot;signal un-blocking&quot; aspect seen using this drug in TBI patients, it would be a huge win for all brain related conditions.')
