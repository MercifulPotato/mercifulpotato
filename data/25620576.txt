Petrol car leave the european market with about 200-250k km on the odometer (source: discussion with a car journalist).<p>If you buy a Tesla model 3 SR+ right now in Europe it&#x27;s made in China with LFP chemistry which is much more durable 3000-6000 cycles to about 2 millions km.<p>That gives plenty of room to play with car batteries without too much detriment.<p>And I assume you&#x27;ll be able to limit discharging to some value to avoid getting stuck on your parking :).')
