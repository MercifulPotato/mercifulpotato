At a high level, none of those magic values should be in the code. The whole thing should probably be in a database.<p>In terms of your algorithm, you would want to decouple your ingredient prep from your cooking algorithm. Otherwise, if prepping ingredients takes longer because you buy a new prep tool, your food winds up over or under-cooked. Secondly, you want to decouple your cooking algorithm from your equipment model. Otherwise, every time you upgrade your oven you need to rewrite every recipe. But this is all a digression.<p>In future if you want to make a point about software, I would recommend using either English or real code and not a stressed analogy to a novel domain. But in general, it seems you are still learning the craft. It&#x27;s really great that you are thinking about the evolution of a codebase over time as this is a key area that people earlier on in their career miss, and IMHO one of the greatest learning experiences for a programmer is maintaining non-trivial system over an extended period as the environment and requirements change.<p>Oh, and check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20021105191447&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthus.com&#x2F;Recipes&#x2F;CompCook.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20021105191447&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthus.com...</a> (1985).')
