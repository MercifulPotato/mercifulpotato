There are already ways to log into Google accounts using a trusted platform like a browser when the environment can&#x27;t be confirmed.  Google Cloud Shell has a mechanism like this, where it will generate a URL that you paste into a browser, and it will prompt for login if you aren&#x27;t, then provide a token you can paste back into the shell utility, and then it&#x27;s authenticated to perform actions on Google Compute Engine as you through shell commands.<p>This is essentially what the embedded browser context is doing in an automated way.  My guess is there&#x27;s a way to manually do this already, or there will be soon.<p>The main thing they are trying to do here is make sure the login process is secure as they can make it.  I think there&#x27;s a non-negligible increase in security by requiring somewhat trusted applications to make the request.')
