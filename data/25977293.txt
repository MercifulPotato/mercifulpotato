The government allowed the agitators to assemble until violence started. We see this again and again, a vocal minority taking it to the extreme and then when law is enforced people always blame the government.<p>No one talks about how normal people were affected both during the CCA (when regular throughfares were blocked by the agitators) and now when state roads were blocked. Can you hold the capital to hostage? I mean what does this talk about law and order people are allowed to go berserk in the capital. This is India&#x27;s Capitol insurgency moment, nothing else.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; India is staying mum on contemporary persecution of religious minorities in neighboring countries such as Rohingyas in Myanmar and Uyghurs in China.<p>India has taken in Rohingya refugees just like Tibetan refugees before, but India also cant take more since we have our own problems and the demographic change problem is real, just read up on what is happening in the Indian state of Assam. India also does not interfere with other countries&#x27; policies.')
