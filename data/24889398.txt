That would rightfully just produce a response of &quot;that&#x27;s nice for you, it&#x27;s still slow on x86-64 and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using, so from my perspective <i>the feature is slow in an environment many people use</i>&quot;.<p>If you want this to stop, make GNOME&#x27;s performance better in the ways you envision, because it <i>is</i> the experience most Linux users get. (Quite a lot of work has been going into GNOME Wayland performance lately.) Arguments about Wayland protocol feature politics don&#x27;t necessarily make the out-of-the-box experience worse; for many people it&#x27;s a good &quot;Just Works&quot; experience. Stop telling people they need to switch desktop environments to get a better experience; some fraction of people will go &quot;if I have to switch, I&#x27;ll switch back to Windows&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;etc&quot;. A vanishingly small fraction of people will go &quot;oh, sure, I should switch to a different window manager and environment that isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to and doesn&#x27;t necessarily have the integration I&#x27;m used to, and switch my apps to match too; this makes me happy&quot;, and those people know who they are already.')
