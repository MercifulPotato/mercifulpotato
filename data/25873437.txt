A lot of comparisons are slightly off because they use the energy numbers from the car itself which leave out charger inefficiency --- which can be rather bad on Tesla --- but it doesn&#x27;t change the big picture.<p>On the other hand, you need to consider the amortized cost of the vehicle itself; both a higher vehicle cost and the likelihood of a somewhat lower vehicle lifetime.  Maybe increased performance counteracts some of this for you?<p>Further complicating things is maintenance.  Oil changes are avoided.  Brake pad changes are reduced.  But tire wear is usually increased...<p>And after all this, there&#x27;s the convenience differences (both ways).  You never need to go to a gas station for a normal drive.  But road trips suck a lot more.')
