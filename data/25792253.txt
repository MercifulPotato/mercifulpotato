I waited to a similar processor to come out that was better. took a long while and I upgraded to an 8750h because it had more cores and was being sold in 500-600$ machines. There is now an 8 core chip of the same quality that i the next to most recent intel generation, this will be my next upgrade. My 4700mq machine runs win10 and ubuntu linux just fine. I dont do heavy compute work on it anymore, but I did back when it was current.')
