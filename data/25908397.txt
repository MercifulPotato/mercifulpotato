The most popular spinoff of this series, Law &amp; Order:SVU has focused on this topic for the entirety of <i>twenty-two</i> (!!!!!!) season run.   That&#x27;s nearly 500 episodes of detectives investigating and describing some pretty brutal rapes and sexual assaults of people of all ages, genders, and walks of life.<p>Pretty much any crime drama is going to hit on this subject pretty regularly.  Based on the stuff I&#x27;ve seen on shows that run on broadcast TV during primetime, there is not really much taboo around the subject.  Comedian John Mulaney has a very popular skit that focuses entirely on the ridiculous things that are said on this subject during day-time TV.')
