Already, there is a very heavy use of &quot;tactics&quot; (metaprograms, and ones with decent computational complexity (think &quot;search&quot; not just &quot;expansion&quot;)). Mathematicians write lemmas so we can try to run the tactics on &quot;mini problems&quot; that do not grow even as the total body of work grows, but there&#x27;s always a risk the that there&#x27;s some sticking point one cannot break down enough.')
