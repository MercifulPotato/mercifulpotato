If they no longer need to move there for the good jobs, they won&#x27;t.<p>This statement supports my point. A large proportion of devs currently live in a tech hub. They moved there because there was opportunity. Telling all the developers that the opportunity will come to them does not magically change the number of developers. So if demand for developers hasn&#x27;t changed, and the supply hasn&#x27;t changed, why would salaries change?<p>The only way the number of available devs changes is if some new untapped supply exists outside of the tech hubs. My argument is that it does not, the majority of devs that could already moved to a tech hub or figured something out.')
