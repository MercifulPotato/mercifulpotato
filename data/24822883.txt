Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[24826924], score=None, time=1603074796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822704, text='&gt; I make a distinction between web apps and web sites.<p>This is an important distinction to make. But far too many web sites try to place themselves in the &quot;web app&quot; category when they really don&#x27;t belong. Using a heavyweight JS framework does not automatically make your blog or news site into an app; it just makes your blog or news site slow.<p>I&#x27;ve long thought that browsers should move to formalize the distinction between traditional web sites, and web apps. Apps should get access to the richer, more invasive APIs but only when the user instructs the browser to grant app-level permissions to the site, and at the expense of having stricter security and privacy policies enforced (ie. no third-party cookies, and probably no third-party scripts).<p>&gt; Native phone apps donâ€™t render their initial screen server-side. Why should web apps?<p>An extra RTT to local storage is pretty much always quicker than an extra RTT to a server. And it&#x27;s not exactly unheard of for a mobile OS to cache a raster image of an app&#x27;s screen to use the next time the user launches that app or browses through their collection of running apps.')
