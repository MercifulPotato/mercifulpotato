I have separate pots for rent&#x2F;bills&#x2F;car. It also has a &quot;Salary sorter&quot; that will split your salary into the pots when you get paid (you just have to approve it).<p>None of that is available in the USA yet, but something to look out for if there isn&#x27;t currently a US alternative.')
