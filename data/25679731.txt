Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610066329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679636, text='&gt; The cosplayers are the people who pretended to be the Republican electors in the states of Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, despite failing to meet the statutory requirements of meeting in the appointed place, having the vote signed by the respective Secretary of State, and having the vote receipt submitted to the National Archives.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen that failure to meet statutory requirements is not sufficient to disqualify an election, elector, or ballot. Otherwise PA would have gone to trump because of the backdated postmarks.<p>&gt; In other words, these are people whose actions as purported electors are not legitimate.<p>According to you. Other people feel that these are the legitimate electors. Since legitimacy is a social construct and not a physical phenomenon, there is no objective answer.<p>&gt; It is as if I were to put on a shirt with the word &quot;POLICE&quot; on it and print out a badge that had the same word of it--it doesn&#x27;t actually make me a police officer, merely someone cosplaying a police officer.<p>Likewise, if the result of an election is altered due to ballot stuffing and other forms of compromise, the apparent victor is not legitimate, but a cosplayer.<p>&gt; What happened yesterday was a mob taking it upon themselves to overturn the lawful results of the election in response to an alleged crime in an extralegal attempt to achieve justice, completely in violation of all due process.<p>Yes that&#x27;s your opinion. If you refrain from assuming your own opinion about unknown facts to be automatically correct, then you can see how they may have felt themselves to be <i>members of the public</i> who were <i>petitioning their government</i> or <i>performatively airing grievances</i> just like their antifa&#x2F;blm counterparts have been doing for years.')
