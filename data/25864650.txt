I really like the car, but I just can&#x27;t see it as a daily driver. (For a taste comparison, my &#x27;99 Nissan Maxima was probably my most comfortable car, both for passenger comfort, and for the driving experience.)<p>The DMC-12 is a hotbox in the summer and the stock AC just can&#x27;t keep up. That&#x27;s my biggest memory. Rolling the window down would be fine, except that the portion that can roll down is tiny. You get no airflow to speak of. If the doors were redesigned so a larger portion of the window rolls down it would help tremendously.<p>It may just be my body shape, but I can&#x27;t get comfortable in the seats. I wouldn&#x27;t want to ride in it for a long time. re: driving - It&#x27;s probably also the lack of performance, too. If I&#x27;m in that more reclined &quot;sporty&quot; driving position I expect some response when I mash the accelerator. As an EV the performance could be radically enhanced. That would definitely be neat.<p>I felt that visibility was bad. The high window sills, gigantic A pillars, and sloped windowshield always made me feel like I had to second-guess what was going on around the car. The hood is deceptively long, too.<p>It would be a neat conversation piece to have one, for sure. As an EV it could be made wickedly performant. I think it would still feel like riding in a low-slung box that you are just peeking out over the top of, though.')
