And that is a typical issue with Tesla, they have too many software guys and too little real world automotive experience. So they&#x27;ll create these kinds of problems by implementing their own things instead of going with proven existing tech.<p>The most rampant example was the rain sensor on the early model S. They decided not to buy the same perfectly working sensor that any German car had for 10+ years at the time, no they decided to implement the rain sensor by training some image recognition on the camera that&#x27;s behind the windscreen. Worst idea ever, because it meant the 100k+ euro Model S had no automatic wipers for a long time and when they got there it was worse at detecting rain than the standard sensor on a 20k euro VW Golf...')
