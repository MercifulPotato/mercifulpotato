Mix of code stuff + general tech + gaming + design.  Goal is to be a fun, light read on a Sunday morning over coffee.<p>The idea, which is by no means original, is that I already spend several hours a day browsing HN, reddit, reading others&#x27; newsletters, twitter, etc., and I figured I ought to channel that into something productive.  I&#x27;m doing it anyway, so wy not, right?  Might as well curate the stuff that I&#x27;d normally forward a few friends when I chuckle.<p>It&#x27;s been hard to remember that not everyone reads the same stuff that I do.  So I&#x27;ll curate a bunch of things and worry that &quot;everyone&#x27;s already seen this stuff&quot;, but no, actually, that&#x27;s not true at all.<p>So far everyone I&#x27;ve sent it to loves it and has asked for more (and sent in suggestions), so I guess I&#x27;ve got that going for me.<p>(If anyone is interested, feel free to sign up at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlh.me" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlh.me</a>.  This is early and I haven&#x27;t put the archive &#x2F; sample issues up yet, but I will in due time.  No offense taken if you sign up and change your mind ;)')
