Item(by='midasz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610698615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='A couple of things honestly.<p>The project I&#x27;m closest to &#x27;finishing&#x27; is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;list.futbol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;list.futbol</a>, which aggregates silly titles found on &#x2F;r&#x2F;soccer. It originated from a post called something like &#x27;It was the saddest backflip of my career...&#x27;. After that post users started keeping track of &#x27;the list&#x27; with comparable posts. The list started living in comments, and eventually a subreddit was born (&#x2F;r&#x2F;saddestbackflip). What I&#x27;m doing is twofold:<p>- A static site built on hugo that has markdown posts per submission, it&#x27;s on github here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;midasvo&#x2F;the-list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;midasvo&#x2F;the-list</a> so that if I get hit by bus a bus someone else can easily fork it or take it over (or if I add things that people don&#x27;t like they can start their own). It also offers a really simple JSON endpoint so others can do what they want with the data. It&#x27;s the communities data after all, not mine.<p>- A reddit bot (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;midasvo&#x2F;the-list-bot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;midasvo&#x2F;the-list-bot</a>) that checks top-level comments on &#x2F;r&#x2F;soccer for callouts (e.g. !addittothelist), creates a markdown post from the submission, commits and pushes it to a separate branch on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;midasvo&#x2F;the-list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;midasvo&#x2F;the-list</a>, and creates a pull request. Once the pull request gets accepted, github actions go to work and the site will be updated. It already does this.<p>What I still want to do is to add a threshold to the parent comment, e.g. if the !addittothelist comment gets 100+ upvotes the pull request will be merged automatically.<p>----<p>Furthermore I&#x27;m working on self-hosted recipe application using Spring Boot and React. Honestly just want to use it for me and my wife, but the philosophy is that people should be able to self-host it using a container - the data is yours. If I have the time&#x2F;motivation I want to add the ability to &#x27;connect&#x27; to others instances so you can retrieve their recipes and add them to your own repository. But firstly I&#x27;ll work on exports&#x2F;imports.<p>I&#x27;m not doing this on github, but on my own gitea instance + build street using drone-ci and other stuffs.')
