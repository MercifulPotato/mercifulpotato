If the exchange decides to close trading then its halted. But they don&#x27;t halt just because a market maker fails to make market, and if they did, they&#x27;d halt it for everyone not just discount brokers. No market maker would just mean you just have to cross with whoever is on the other side. That would be a bigger issue in low volume markets, but GME etc is pretty busy right now :)<p>* RobinHood wouldn&#x27;t care or know anyway. Why would they care that a market maker is having a bad day? Why inconvenience their clients while other brokers keep serving theirs? For all they know, the market maker is too far long and would really appreciate offloading some inventory.<p>* Market makers don&#x27;t get to pick and choose who they trade with. They can&#x27;t make market for the big boys but not for the discount brokers.<p>Sorry if I&#x27;ve missed some crucial point here. Can you enlighten me?')
