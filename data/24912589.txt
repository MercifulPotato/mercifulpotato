I have been doing research on language models in medical diagnostics even before GPT-2, and found that when trained and applied in certain ways, language models (even much smaller than GPT-3!) are very good at diagnosis predictions, they can compete with much more complex symptom checkers at that.<p>Proof: Link to my paper (written back in 2019) and a bit less technical article. \n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dialog-21.ru&#x2F;media&#x2F;4632&#x2F;tarasovdplusetal-069.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dialog-21.ru&#x2F;media&#x2F;4632&#x2F;tarasovdplusetal-069.pdf</a>  \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;language-models-multi-purpose-medical-ai-systems-denis-tarasov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;language-models-multi-purpose...</a><p>I applied for GPT-3 access on the next day since the application form was available, described my research and experience in detail, but there was no reply.<p>Now, they gave access to these people at nabla, and they just asked a bunch of stupid questions using top-k random sampling to generate answers and claimed that this debunks something. This study debunks nothing and proves nothing, it is stupid and only done to get some hype from GPT-3 popularity.<p>Ok, I am sorry for being rude, but I am really upset because I spent years working on this problem using whatever computational resources I could get and obtained some interesting results, and based on these I think that GPT-3 should be capable to do amazing things for diagnostics when used properly. Why won&#x27;t OpenAI give access to a researcher who wants to do some serious but a bit mundane work, but gives it to people who use it to create hype?')
