Since overflows should happen very rarely I guess the branch on overflow should almost always predict as non taken.\nSo wouldn&#x27;t it be possible to have a &quot;branch if add would overflow&quot; instruction or even canonical sequence that a higher end CPU can completely speculate around and just use speculation rollback if it overflows?<p>I think an important design point here is that the languages that need a lot of dynamic overflow checks are primarily used on beefier CPUs so if you can get around the code size issue, making it performant only on more capable designs is fine since the overflow check will be rare on simpler CPUs.')
