But for some jobs I&#x27;ve had the trouble of not having a network in some places was so annoying that I thought: not in my place. For me it totally paid off, it&#x27;s just convenient to have a proper connection everywhere. Also because we were living in the house during renovations so moved desk multiple times. Granted there are sockets which I haven&#x27;t actually used yet, but there&#x27;s equal amounts for which at one point I thought &#x27;damn, so convenient that this socket is here&#x27; :). E.g. FM reception here sucks for some stations, now I just carry a little RaspberryPi+speakers mounted on a piece of wood around as &#x27;radio&#x27; and can just plug it in in any room. Also if I see the mess some people go through in a brand new house, dealing with wifi repeaters on all floors and sometimes long cables to feed them just to get a signal which is still worse than a fixed line, I think this way is more convenient.')
