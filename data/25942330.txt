Saw elsewhere that they&#x27;re trying to push it to $1 (it&#x27;s at $0.01 and the push has raised it 72%). Half tempted to drop $1k in it, in a Just-In-Case thing.  Supposedly the total volume of Dogecoin is only 128k coins, though that sounds low. If it is that low it explains why the coin is so volatile.  My main cryptocurrency positions are Bitcoin and Cardano.')
