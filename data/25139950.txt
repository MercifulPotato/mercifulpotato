I drank in college and I certainly had started to develop anxiety by then. By the time I was in the service that drinking scaled to a handle or a thirty rack a day.<p>Post-service I eventually quit drinking completely. It took a while, but I did it. The anxiety has never gone away but it&#x27;s not as crippling as it was when I was drinking.<p>CBT really helps at least manage the symptoms and when I feel like I&#x27;m breaking down I can at least manage to slowly walk myself back. Having friends who aren&#x27;t annoyed by the symptoms and are bold enough to walk you through those days is life-saving as well.')
