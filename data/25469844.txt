Item(by='vlovich123', descendants=None, kids=[25470518], score=None, time=1608314127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468843, text='Your argument seems to be scalpers don’t have power because OEMs could just raise the price themselves and get all that scalp profit.<p>That’s good in theory but in practice you have complex sales channel configurations and contractual agreements. If Best Buy is selling your GPU at $400 because that’s the agreed upon MSRP, they’re going to be pretty unhappy if they’re out of stock and suddenly you decide to increase MSRP to $800 after they’ve sold out because then they’ve made even less money.<p>So your job now is to figure out what the scalp price will be in the future before there’s any demand.<p>Additionally, please factor in your pissed off customers who paid you $800 for launch day delivery for the price to potentially drop to $400 a few months after. What’s the cost of that brand damage?<p>Scalpers have numbers (if demand and supply are close, they have an artificial power to restrict it) and power (the OEMs have to tread a delicate line with many constituencies that scalpers don’t since you “blame” scalpers but that doesn’t hurt anyone’s actual reputation).<p>For all we know scalpers are part of the business plan. NVidia gets record sales numbers and press articles about how the GPU is sold out. All the OEMs offer preferential access to buy the GPUs giving them better margins, getting rid of inventory, and no reputation risk beyond at worst some marginal grumbling that they’re not doing enough to stop scalpers. The only ones getting screwed are early adopters who are eager to pay higher prices.<p>It’s the perfect way to segment the market by price sensitivity without paying for it or running afoul of any laws if it’s being done intentionally.')
