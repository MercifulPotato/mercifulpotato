Neither does any of the other ongoing legal action? Even if you think those cases have no merit, to deny that these facts are disputed is simply to deny reality.<p>Also, criticizing somebody for something that you think other people are also guilty of isn&#x27;t Irony. Even if both parties in this matter were equally despicable, that doesn&#x27;t make either of them right. Your comments highlight a lot of issues we currently have with political tribalism. You&#x27;re just proving that facts and misdeeds don&#x27;t matter as long as they have the correct political context.')
