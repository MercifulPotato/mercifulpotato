Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25868818], score=None, time=1611294765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868692, text='&gt; Facebook and Twitter spend a cubic fuckton of money on moderation, at a scale significant enough that there are, annually, news cycles about the psychic toll Facebook moderation takes on the army of people Facebook pays to do it.<p>Which appears to be <i>less</i> effective -- paid moderators aren&#x27;t members of individual communities -- with the result that most of the planning of the riot happened on Facebook.<p>&gt; Parler hoped to do moderation on a volunteer basis.<p>So does Reddit, doesn&#x27;t it? Moderator of a sub is the creator, a user? And it seems to be less bad than Twitter and Facebook.<p>The reason people compare to Facebook and Twitter instead of Reddit is because they&#x27;re worse.<p>&gt; You can run a service like Parler on all-volunteer (or, like Gab, no-volunteer) moderation. You just can&#x27;t do it on Amazon&#x27;s infrastructure.<p>What happens if you can&#x27;t do it on anybody&#x27;s infrastructure who has the capacity to host a site that size?<p>But you&#x27;re changing the subject.')
