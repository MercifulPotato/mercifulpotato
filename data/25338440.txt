Sonic tech came out and said that the uplink was good and that it might be a problem with my UniFi system, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with my LAN services.<p>It&#x27;s great that the community was able to diagnose this, but a shame that AT&amp;T didn&#x27;t pick it up first and isn&#x27;t acknowledging an issue on their network.')
