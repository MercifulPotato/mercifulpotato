It already allows for speculation, and in addition to that, it&#x27;s heavily biased towards people speculating in one direction: up. People can be leveraged up to 20x (aka. 5% down payment), whereas for stocks it&#x27;s limited to 2x[1]. There&#x27;s also no meaningful way to short housing prices. You can&#x27;t short-sell a house, and there aren&#x27;t derivatives for housing (futures&#x2F;options). The latter would also help increase supply because speculators can speculate on housing without tying up the underlying asset (ie. stories of speculators buying houses and leaving them vacant because they don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle&#x2F;risk of tenants).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;reportspubs&#x2F;investor-publications&#x2F;investorpubsmarginhtm.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;reportspubs&#x2F;investor-publications&#x2F;invest...</a>')
