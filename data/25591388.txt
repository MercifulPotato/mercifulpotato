One of my tools back than was Oracle SQL Developer[0] a java application that worked a little slower than I would like to on my new MacBook Pro at that time, so I tried to make my own client for oracle database[1]. I had some sales right after publishing to Apple app store, but the application needed bug fixing and that was reflected in app reviews. Very quickly I&#x27;ve lost an interest working on my app and shut it down. It felt nice to be able to jump start my sales for App store so quickly but the whole experience with Apple ecosystem wasn&#x27;t pleasant. Close and locked down. I didn&#x27;t want to invest my time developing apps for it.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;database&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;appdev&#x2F;sqldeveloper-landing.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;database&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;appdev&#x2F;sqldevel...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;letitcrash&#x2F;nora" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;letitcrash&#x2F;nora</a>')
