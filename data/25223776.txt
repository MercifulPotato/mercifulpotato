Although given the incumbents and their aggressive pricing, it&#x27;s hard to eventually productize something and build a business, if that&#x27;s your goal.<p>The space is also complicated with regulations that are not easy to translate from one country &#x2F; state to another. So an open source approach may not work perfectly.<p>However, I&#x27;d love to see some Open Source options that can piggyback on existing services, e.g. QBO api, so we can avoid paying the advanced features that are expensive, a lock-in and leaves something to be desired for customizability.')
