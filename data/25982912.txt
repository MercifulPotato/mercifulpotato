I feel like there is a massive vacuum in the software ecosystem for a product like this.<p>I&#x27;d really like to support LaTeX in multiple ways throughout the app, and have plans to build a feature to automate the animation of equations.  There is also another planned feature to try and create an integration with sympy[1], and it&#x27;s likely there will be some overlap between the sympy and latex stuff.  I don&#x27;t think there is a good way to automate exporting functions to LaTeX, even using sympy, because its not 1-1 (not sure though).<p>I think having the kind of visual environment math inspector offers has a lot of potential when it comes to computational PDE&#x27;s.  At some point I want to draw the Lorenz attractor, which is something that probably won&#x27;t work very nicely with the current plotting system in the app.  It would also be amazing to do fluid dynamics simulations, but that is a really huge job for sure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sympy.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sympy.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.html</a>')
