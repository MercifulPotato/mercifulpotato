A couple nights playing a game that either sucked or just wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea was enough to show me that playing games was a <i>lot</i> better than working on games.<p>Anytime I hear a young person say they want to be a game developer I want to grab them by the shoulders and try to shakes some sense into them. If you&#x27;re smart enough to do game development, you&#x27;re probably smart enough to go make twice as much to work half as hard somewhere else. You can go work your 8 hour day, and play whatever game you want the rest of the night. Or do something completely different.')
