Think of NomadList, Thrillist, food review websites, blogs, etc.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that this will be very successful, obviously, but I don&#x27;t see an individual person making much use of this. Seems like a fine thing for a startup to do, Google will probably not get enough out of this to keep it alive.')
