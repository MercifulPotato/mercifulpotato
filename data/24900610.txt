The glue is one of the harder parts of the problem.<p>- wasm bytecode is sandboxable with a simple MMU mapping.  That&#x27;s one reason it has structured control flow rather than goto.  (And this is why you need a special algorithm to compile C gotos to wasm.)  RISC V certainly doesn&#x27;t limit itself like that.<p>So I think this idea is glossing over a lot of details... not all ISAs are equal, especially ones meant to be transmitted over the network!')
