The new Raspberry Pi 400 is a modern take on home computers like the C64, but 15 times cheaper. Pi 400 full kit: $100, C64: $595 (1982) &#x2F; $1576 (inflation adjusted for 2019).<p>The computers are not just getting cheaper, educative material is easier than ever to find.<p>Because modern computers are much more complex and do much more than before, you don&#x27;t do much bare metal programming anymore, but then again, nothing is stopping a kid from buying a microcontroller and playing with it. It cheap and information is plentiful. I would even say that it is easier for Gen Z to play with electronics than it was for millennials.<p>But that unprecedented availability of computers didn&#x27;t turn everyone into a nerd. Just because someone has a smartphone doesn&#x27;t mean he has any interest in computing. When computers were limited and expensive, only those who had some affinity with them had them, now everyone have them, so mechanically, you can&#x27;t expect the same average level of interest.')
