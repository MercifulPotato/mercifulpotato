I rarely write on HN, but I think this is important for others who may read it.<p>As someone who grew up lower-middle class, who read HN for ~10 years and became slightly-upper-middle class, I think working hard is an unattractive proposition, and becomes ever less so as the timer ticks. I have seen people burn out like candles, to no avail.<p>My advice continues to be: &quot;Do not ever work hard, unless you find yourself in a good strategic position where working hard benefits you&quot;. I cannot say that such positions of strategic advantage are non-existent for a normal software developer, but these became rare. Other HNers note, and I agree with them, that for someone to be raised in hierarchy for hard work is a rare occasion, especially if we talk about a real raise (say, above senior developer or a team lead). It takes a rare company and a departing higher-up to make working hard ROI &gt; 0.<p>To expand on it:<p>* Realistically, the era of PG essays&#x27; applicability and easy startups is over, and has been over for several years. We are entering a new socio-economic regime which could be called &quot;new guilded age&#x2F;neo-feudalism&quot;. I may sound leftist saying this, but bear with me, I&#x27;m actually not leftist at all, it&#x27;s just the truth of our situation. Lords became lords, the rest remain the rest.<p>* In this regime the low-hanging fruit is all but taken, the value has been captured, and the tech economy enters maturity, which is a polite euphemism for &quot;MBA phase&quot; of value extraction. It&#x27;s not just me decrying this, Elon Musk has recently said the same: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;elon-musk-decries-m-b-a-ization-of-america-11607548589" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;elon-musk-decries-m-b-a-ization...</a> . Expect disappearance of small businesses (so, don&#x27;t invest in tech skills used by small businesses). Expect more rat racing at work, more subscriptions and dark patterns in digital products. Also maybe expect slow merge of BigTech and US government in the next couple of decades, effectively giving us a BigTechGov with all that entails.<p>How does a generic middle class software developer rationally cope with the reality of this brave new world ? Here is my version of it, if someone knows how to enhance this advice, please do so in the comments:<p>1) Work as little as possible, to earn as much money as possible (basically minmax the professional game, choose high-paying moderate barrier to entry programming niches). Take breaks, fly to pretty islands with sunny beaches as much as you can. Never bear with bad workplaces if you have opportunity to switch, you have no obligations to this system, the age of corporate IBM pensions is over. For top management we are but replaceable parts, and our loyalty is neither required nor expected.<p>2) If you have what it takes (intelligence and neuroplasticity, basically), leetcode for FAANG while doing 1. This allows you to reach endgame - early retirement - more quickly.<p>3) If you do not have what it takes, do not leetcode or study algorithms (it&#x27;s a waste of time without applicability to faang), go for tier-2&#x2F;3 silicon valley unicorns. If you can, get a raise, become a manager as quickly as you can, because programmers have a short shelf life, while managers have much simpler day to day responsibilities, and long shelf life. I know what I&#x27;m talking about, because I have been a manager. Basically, working your life away in a position of individual contributor is a sad fate I wish everyone avoided.<p>4) Live frugally, do not overspend. Invest as much money as possible in a mix of index funds, bitcoin, gold, property. Again, do not &quot;invest&quot; money buying tech products and various products sold to you by MBAs - these money will be wasted.<p>5) Slow down your ageing as much as you can - take metformin if you tolerate it, use whatever interventions necessary to avoid metabolic syndrome, monitor your biomarkers, do aerobic exercise once in two days (I prefer biking for example). Monitor your spine health, avoid deterioration with any means necessary. With serious approach it is possible to feel&#x2F;look 10 years younger than you are.<p>6) Find a loving partner, make at least three children. Children are good for everyone, and for you in your 50s-60s. Don&#x27;t bother with college education for your children, you either won&#x27;t be able to afford it, or it will be free by that time. The best gifts you can give your children are high IQ and good health, both of these are highly heritable (though could be ruined by environment), so look for these in your partner as well. If you have questions regarding IQ and how not to ruin it, mail me.<p>7) Retire as early as possible, focus on low-capital-expense high-satisfaction activities, e.g. spending time with your kids, studying abstract subjects, sports.<p>8) THE END.')
