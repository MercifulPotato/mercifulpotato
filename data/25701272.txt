Trump supports <i>coal</i>. Ajit Pai. He&#x27;s a pathological liar. Trump sucks.<p>But a lot of the things he gets wrong actually help him in swing states. There is a lot of coal in Pennsylvania. So lazy opponents can&#x27;t easily use those things to attack him because it would only get him more votes in places that matter.<p>And then we end up in a situation where the majority of people hate Trump for reasons that are actually lies, because the truth translates inconveniently to the electoral map and too many people care more about winning no matter the cost.')
