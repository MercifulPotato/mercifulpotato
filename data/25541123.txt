Why not?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m a serial failed entrepreneur. Gave up a few years ago for money reasons, then did well in crypto and decided to give it another shot with some financial resources at my back.<p>It&#x27;s not going well. Again.<p>This time around, I haven&#x27;t yet figured out the &quot;why&quot; apart from things I knew were potential issues ahead of time. I guess that&#x27;s progress? (i.e. At least I anticipated and accepted them before diving in vs being surprised.)<p>More generally, I think my weaknesses are introversion - a hardcore resistance to networking, fundraising, relationship-building, team-assembly, self-promotion - and intelligence (I guess?). I&#x27;m in the &quot;Salieri zone&quot; at the top 1%; smart enough to recognize genius, but not actually genius myself.<p>I also <i>hate</i> anything relating to finance. I&#x27;m a builder at heart and want to scream when it comes to valuation, options pools, market analysis, etc. You know, the MBA stuff. (Good thing all the schools rejected me.)<p>Everything else: work ethic, technical aptitude, resources, upbringing, physical health... nothing abnormal.<p>How about you? What&#x27;s your story?')
