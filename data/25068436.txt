It’s just a non-harmful form of hydrogen.<p>&gt; from the time of Big Bang?<p>Because that’s where the majority of the deuterium in existence was made. Crazy, but true. Unlike most of the heavier elements, it isn’t a by-product of stellar evolution.<p>Extraordinary to think that the Universe is almost fourteen thousand million years old, and most of our deuterium was made in the first twenty seconds. After that, it cooled down and just wasn’t hot enough for fusion to do its work.<p>Physics is mental.')
