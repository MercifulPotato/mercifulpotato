Rewriting code is not a business objective. Improving application performance is, delivering features more efficiently and reliably is. These are some examples of objectives that might involve rewriting code (or not, not every codebase is a swamp in need of draining).<p>In the context of this article though, the code to be &quot;improved&quot; should be anything you touch. Did you use a function in building some new widget and you noticed it had no tests and no docs so it took you ages to integrate? Then add a test and the minimal doc string.<p>In terms of who is watching the consultant, I&#x27;m unclear why you&#x27;re asking me, a person who has just said they would never hire a consultant to do anything with code. But if I had to, I would get someone of at least equivalent technical knowledge. However I&#x27;m pretty sure thats not how it usually works, which is probably why inept consulting companies rinse big companies for so much money for such lacklustre results.<p>But overall I really have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about with regard to consultants and rewriting code. None of which seems to have much relevance to this article about making tiny improvements regularly. Unless your comment was in the wrong thread?')
