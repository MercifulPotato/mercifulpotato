Item(by='TrackerFF', descendants=None, kids=[24845768], score=None, time=1603264342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24842745, text='I think my industry (civil engineers) is a bit easier to hire for because credentialing weeds out people who are completely out of their depth, and lying about qualifications can get you in real trouble. Managers can assume youâ€™re basically competent and can focus on hiring people with decent personality and a good reputation. Some of my software friends use brain-teasers to screen candidates, and it comes off as a bit silly to me.<p>Pretty much the case for <i>every</i> non-Software Engineering discipline.<p>But then again, people in the tech field will vehemently defend the system - because it&#x27;s one of the very, very few fields where you don&#x27;t need a college degree, can go on and &quot;grind leetcode&quot; for months, and land a six-figure job.<p>And it is because of that, that tech companies are making their recruitment process bordering the absurd. They&#x27;re simply deadly afraid to vet frauds, that have &quot;gamed&quot; the system.<p>So in short - tech companies would rather let 10 decent candidates slip by, if it means they can block 1 fraud.<p>I&#x27;ve been to many engineering interviews, outside tech, and it is not even remotely the same process.')
