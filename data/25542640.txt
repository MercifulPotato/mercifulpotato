I currently have a Lenovo ThinkPad running Ubuntu with no problems, and it is not the first laptop I&#x27;ve run Linux on. Honestly, if you are not using bleeding edge or obscure hardware, you are probably ok. The only time I&#x27;ve had hardware problems with Linux in the last 10 years was a video card (on desktop) that could not initially output audio over HDMI. After a few months, the driver was updated, and all was fine.')
