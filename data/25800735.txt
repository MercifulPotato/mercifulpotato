If the average pay of someone touching this case was $400 an hour, you&#x27;re talking about man centuries of billable hours (mind you that 6 hours of billable hours out of an 8 hour day of work is not bad for a lawyer)<p>In reality the average pay is much lower since even if the lawyers were billing a thousand an hour, the people under them aren&#x27;t anywhere near 400 an hour.<p>There is absolutely no reason why the court shouldn&#x27;t attempt to find a market rate for their efforts and pay that... as I linked to start, it&#x27;s been approached before<p>-<p>And on a meta note... all too often I see people go &quot;well if you don&#x27;t have every fact you must discard any attempt at reasoning about it, it&#x27;s arbitrary&quot;<p>Lateral thinking, extrapolation, just building an intuition, all valuable skills to work on.')
