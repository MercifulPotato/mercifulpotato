You have to do the early phases of drug development in model systems like cell cultures for practical reasons: It makes evidence obtained more reproducible and has less ethical concerns than experimenting on humans immediately. It&#x27;s like how software components usually get implemented and tested in simplified environments (e.g. unit tests use doubles), and just like with drugs, sometimes we find that software components interact with each other in unexpected ways when combined into a whole.')
