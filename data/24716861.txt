Just bought a Mazda 6 and one of the reasons was a sensible, buttons-first infotainment system. There&#x27;s a knob in the center console that I can use to control everything. Besides that, the seat warmer&#x2F;cooler, the AC, all the basic stuff is controlled by buttons.<p>But the kicker is that the infotainment system has a touchscreen, but the touch functionality is _disabled_ if the car is moving, because they think it&#x27;s a hazard to have a person operate it while driving.')
