Most important quote from the post:<p>&gt;  Itâ€™s a standard Wittgenstein game problem: human constructs do not neatly fall into precise definitions.<p>The actual debate seems to be around social status.. are software engineers as high up the social status ladder as &quot;real&quot; engineers? I don&#x27;t know&#x2F;care. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes :D If software engineering stays a sufficiently selective, high-paying, important field for long enough, it will gain the prestige to be considered &quot;real&quot; engineering. Otherwise it will not.<p>I think it will become both - more bifurcation. The top salaries &amp; status will be reserved for 1&#x2F;10th of the engineers. A lot of the bottom will become lower paid and more automated, closer to technical support.')
