Item(by='juststeve', descendants=None, kids=[25476232], score=None, time=1608368387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475903, text='Agree with all of that except the last paragraph - streaming album&#x2F;LP&#x27;s suck, and I&#x27;ve had spotify and apple accounts for <i>years</i>. As an alternative, I&#x27;d kindly recommend (to anyone) finding a few independent radio stations in genres you like or are new to. I feel that a good DJ and&#x2F;or announcer is a godsend in an environment where the music alternatives feel endless and the social environment is complex. I just don&#x27;t think that &#x27;AI&#x27; or any SQL implemented &#x27;playlist generator&#x27; will match a good DJ set with commentary.')
