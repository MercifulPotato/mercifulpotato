Item(by='antibuddy', descendants=None, kids=[25847966], score=None, time=1611157619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846959, text='&gt; Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny&#x27;s team has released a report about a sprawling, opulent Black Sea palace allegedly owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The video was posted less than two days after Navalny&#x27;s arrest.<p>The emphasis is on &quot;alleged&quot;. Navalny is just another so-called Kremlin critic who is actually just a crook, but if you blackmail&#x2F;character assassinate Putin you&#x27;re a hero in the western media.<p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.<p>&gt; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations were old but that the property, near the resort town of Gelendzhik, did not belong to Putin. The allegations were first made in 2010 by Sergei Kolesnikov, a businessman with connections to Putin before his time in politics. On paper, the property appears to be owned by businessman and billionaire Alexander Ponomarenko.<p>At least DW did post the response.<p>PS.: Sorry I wanted to say, that Putin is an evil person. I don&#x27;t have any evidence, but the accusations are true and he is a monster. &#x2F;s')
