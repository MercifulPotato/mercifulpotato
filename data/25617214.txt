This sounds like carrier peering at first read, and that the external network operator may have passed some charges back through GCP to you?<p>If you didn&#x27;t change any network defaults and you had two vms in same region, different zones being rather chatty, that could do it as well. Using external IPs always incurs a charge.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;vpc&#x2F;network-pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;vpc&#x2F;network-pricing</a>')
