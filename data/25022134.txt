He hurts them.  He is their kryptonite.  A shiv in their side.  Blocking the other side from enacting their agenda is one thing, and any republican can do that.  he causes liberal tears, and they love it.  It&#x27;s like voting for poison ivy instead of sidewalks made of ice.  They dont like him, they like the pain he causes others.  And by extension that makes him admirable, despite not actually giving two anythings about him as a person.')
