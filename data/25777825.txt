We now have:<p>* A CLI with no official support for static bundling or SSR (the solution is basically &quot;use Nuxt&quot;).\n* There is a separate static site bundler... but it&#x27;s opinionated: markdown-centered, theming system, etc.\n* An alternative build tool (Vite) which is amazing for development but worse than the CLI for building production apps. It essentially does less, faster.\n* A Vite based markdown-centered static site bundler (VitePress).<p>I read a comment the other day that someone had made about React that really hit home. Basically along the way the project lost sight of the people that actually just want to build actual applications. Vue is amazing, and I&#x27;m eternally grateful to the Vue team who have basically enabled me to earn a good living for a few years, but I kind of feel like Vue is heading in the wrong direction.<p>Rich Harris talked about &quot;a single, officially supported way to build apps&quot; in a talk he did recently, which is what I&#x27;ve been wanting someone to say for a long time. Svelte kit sounds very appealing at this point. Officially supported SSR + static bundling (or both!) without having to either choose between a third-party framework-on-a-framework, a &quot;markdown-centered&quot; bundler, or having to write another custom SSR implementation.')
