I bought a Wallstreet Powerbook G3 back in &#x27;99 or so because it was a cool RISC laptop AND it was promised to run this amazing upcoming UNIX-based Mac OS X.  When OS X came out, of course it ran...but it was an absolute dog on these machines.  IIRC Apple never bothered to write optimized OS X video card drivers for these &quot;old&quot; machines, they just charged forward with the new stuff.  The experience was definitely enough for me to swear off buying new Apple products for at least a decade (although OS X did eventually win me back).')
