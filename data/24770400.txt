Both of those are pretty unpleasant for someone (either borrowers or savers). So yes, fiscal policy is where the eventual pain is locked in.<p>But, and I feel there is being something lost to semantics in this thread, we have an article reporting &quot;the U.S. money supply has grown 20%&quot;. Given that the US economy has been partially shut down for most of that time it is hard to see what that can be described as except money printing. The alternatives are polite euphemisms for money printing or appeals to it all somehow being so complicated a measured &gt;20% change doesn&#x27;t count.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand why people are so keen to let the government go unchecked (we don&#x27;t send our best &amp; brightest to be politicians) and to keep kicking salary earners to the benefit of asset earners (pretty sure we all earn a salary).')
