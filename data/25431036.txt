Sure, it demonstrates zero creativity, but it&#x27;s totally unfair to say that person lacks critical thinking skills as their answer is the most rational.<p>To pass that question, you need to know the interviewer is looking for creativity and be able to make something up on the spot. That&#x27;s obvious to many of us, but depending on the role I wouldn&#x27;t fault someone for not being in tune to that question or ready for it.')
