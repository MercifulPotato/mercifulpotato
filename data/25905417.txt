More generally I&#x27;d describe both of these situations as &#x27;unsound&#x27; and actually they manifest themselves in the same way in both disciplines (an oversight, incorrect model, complexity, etc).<p>You might think that if you do maths on the computer, maybe it can help you keep things valid as you execute your derivations, and something similar can be done for coding. This is true, in maths&#x2F;logic they have theorem provers and in coding we have <i>static typing</i>. Again they literally manifest themselves in the same way in both disciplines due to the Curry-Howard Correspondence[1].<p>You can also argue that in conjunction with static typing there are also linters, etc, but I anchor specifically to static typing in this example because of how directly it relates to your math comparison.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspon...</a><p>EDIT: spelling')
