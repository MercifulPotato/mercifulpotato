Item(by='gonzus', descendants=None, kids=[24929351], score=None, time=1603968550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928101, text='Does something like Google Plus Code (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.google.com&#x2F;pluscodes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.google.com&#x2F;pluscodes&#x2F;</a>) help in this case?
