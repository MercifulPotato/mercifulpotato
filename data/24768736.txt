You&#x27;re meant to suspend your disbelief when perusing fictional works.<p>Otherwise, you can just scroll through TvTropes instead of ever reading or watching anything. Or you could just read this:<p><pre><code>  template&lt;typename Hero, typename Sage, typename Villain, typename MacGuffin&gt;\n  void Story(Hero hero, Sage sage, Villain villain, MacGuffin macGuffin) {\n    while(true) {\n      auto what = hero.advance();\n      if(what == sage) { sage.teach(hero); }\n      else if(what == villain) { hero.fight(villain); }\n      else if(what == macGuffin) { roll_credits(); return; }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s literally it. The whole of fiction, if everything is just narrative tropes.')
