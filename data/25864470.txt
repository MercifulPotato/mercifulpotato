Their argument is based around running &quot;full nodes&quot;, which is made-up term for a non-mining node that stores a full copy of the blockchain. (There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having the whole chain, but the fallacy here is that &quot;full nodes&quot; don&#x27;t protect the network, it is miners that secure the network and it is miners who decide what transactions to uptake)<p>It&#x27;s all moot though, because introducing sidechains and the lightning network destroys the value of Bitcoin in a perverted attempt to save it from a non-existent problem.<p>&gt; Keeping it spread out across millions of individual home computers, laptops, and mobile devices is the strongest, and perhaps only defense of that.<p>No, because Bitcoin was built to be resilient to Sybil attacks, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s proof-of-work and not proof-of-stake. So it doesn&#x27;t matter if a million people in Africa have the whole blockchain on their raspberry pis or laptop or whatever, because all I need is one ASIC mega-farm in Antarctica and I can double spend attack the network into oblivion.<p>It&#x27;s hashpower that protects and secures the network, nothing else. This is one point that the fraud CSW actually got right.')
