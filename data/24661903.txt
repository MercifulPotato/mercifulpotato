They&#x27;ve put a Citrix ADC load balancer in front of our web servers, which is also terminating TLS. I&#x27;m not sure if it was always like this (before I joined the company) but downloading a 1000 bytes file via HTTP takes ~15ms while the same file via HTTPS takes at least 110ms. The external company ignores this and claims that SSL termination is expensive. I can understand a few ms, but clearly 100ms is rubbish.<p>What do you think folks?')
