Often there are no clear explanations of why fundamental principles make sense or actually work in a way normal people can understand. In this case it seems to have gone beyond that, in that there wasn&#x27;t even an unclear explanation apparently.<p>&quot;Surprisingly, a simple, valid explanation of the\nexothermicity of combustion reactions has apparently not been\nprovided, [1−5] not even in textbooks on combustion [6−9] or in the\nbe provided in conceptual general-chemistry terms and results in a simple, predictive formula for heats of combustion.\nThe heats of reaction of a few specific combustion reactions have been explained in terms of bond energies, [5,7] but this has not revealed why all combustions of organic molecules are exothermic. Most bond-energy analyses have remained opaque since double bonds were treated on par with single bonds. We count double bonds as two bonds since the total number of electron-pair bonds is the same in reactants and products; only when the number of bonds remains unchanged is a general analysis per bond meaningful. On this basis, it becomes apparent that combustions are exothermic because of the unusually small bond-dissociation energy of O2 (per pair of\ntechnical literature on heats of combustion&quot;')
