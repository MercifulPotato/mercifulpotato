I&#x27;ve been frustrated when people describe a modulation real when they could have deacrbed it more elegantly complex. With modern floating point registers being so large the phase loss is less important, but sometimes the representation just makes more sense symmetrical around zero (DC). Could you explain what you mean by harmonic relationships in sound?  Does that imply AM will destroy some quality of the music even if you used a 22khz wide band?')
