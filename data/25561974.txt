Just like with anything, a &quot;stable&quot; person can live in a world with this kind of make believe and enjoy the story telling devices being used. However, someone less &quot;stable&quot; that can be less able to make these distinctions. Does that mean we all can&#x27;t have it because of a small number of people? If that&#x27;s the case, then I would apply this same rule to any and all social media. Clearly, some people can&#x27;t handle it, so nobody can use it.')
