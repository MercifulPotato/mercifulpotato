But there are certainly downsides too.<p>Especially with the advent of internet shopping, improved delivery speeds, and reduction in cultural inertia, going direct has become more convenient. That said, while DTC shopping may be _more_ convenient than before, it&#x27;s still noticeably _less_ convenient than retail shopping. This is displayed by the overwhelming preference of consumers for such resellers as Amazon (the likes of which take an extortionate fee, and provide very little for the consumer beyond a single storefront, fast postage and financial trustworthiness).<p>&gt; I know Walmart gets lower quality products than other places and whatnot, and manufacturers make subtle adjustments to products to meet resellers&#x27; desired price points.<p>This, and more generally the market data held by retailers, is also a benefit of retailers. By aggregating information about purchases of many different consumers over many different brands, retailers are able to drive product development towards products they know will sell even if these preferences will not be expressed directly by consumers or manufacturers.<p>To summarise, going back to your original point:<p>&gt; What&#x27;s the problem with [manufacturers selling direct to consumers]<p>Manufacturers know how to make things, they don&#x27;t know _what_ things to make, or how to sell them to consumers. An market where only DTC sales were allowed would have products that consumers generally want less than they do now, with worse service.')
