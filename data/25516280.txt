The original goal was to try an do some data analytics to try and identify some trends on the basis of genres and whatnot over the years (especially comparing how films done in some of the earlier lists compared to the 2010s decade lists) but it moreso just became a tool for me to find some recent films to watch when I&#x27;ve seemingly exhausted every remotely obvious recommendation from recent years.<p>The UI is a bit of a mess in part because I was playing around with some stuff and in part because it was my first Svelte project so I decided to chuck all the CSS into one file so I could focus on Svelte itself. Doing either one of these would&#x27;ve fine but doing both together was extremely dumb. There&#x27;s probably some easy fixes I could add in via prompt messages to help guide a new user but I figured it&#x27;d be more useful to share it now when people are more interested in these kinds of lists and looking for stuff to check out over Christmas than waiting until after.<p>Svelte seems really really cool. I don&#x27;t think this project is anything like a good example of a Svelte project but I will say for a scrappy thrown together thing that got bloated fast, the speed of Svelte has helped cover up an awful lot of cracks.\nOn the more negative side, for the first while I had a lot of trouble with the life cycle and how updates are triggered. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at all if there&#x27;s still some nested stuff that just doesn&#x27;t update.<p>Please read the home page for my attempts to explain in greater detail if you&#x27;re interested. And if you have any ideas of things I could do with the data I&#x27;d love an excuse to try digging into it.')
