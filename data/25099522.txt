This is always a difficult time of year for me: my father died around this time when I was 12-years-old; I live in the northern latitudes so it&#x27;s dark all the time; and since it&#x27;s around the time I got clean I start getting bad cravings again.<p>I want to buy a smart trainer for my bike but they&#x27;re all sold out at the moment. I&#x27;m too scared to ride on the roads at this time of year: it&#x27;s permanent twilight, the roads are always wet which disguises potholes, and there are dead leaves everywhere.<p>I know that exercise really helps, so I hope I can get that smart trainer soon. I&#x27;ve been going for short walks but I really need that kind of exercise that leaves you struggling to think afterwards.')
