From what I understand, its creator, Jose Valim, took a &#x2F;ton&#x2F; of inspiration from Clojure.<p>I still watch Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks and when I have more time, I really want to take a deeper dive into Clojure, so I by no means want to reflect negatively on my experience with it so far. Just an anecdote.')
