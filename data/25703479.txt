We are not abandoning our communities to violence. We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.<p>Later in the article:<p>&gt;What would the country look like if it had billions of extra dollars to spend on housing, food and education for all?<p>Even Kaba, who has been advocating for the abolishment of police and prison for a long time, doesn&#x27;t just want these establishments gone. She wants all of the funding and resources currently budgeted for these establishments to go towards resolving the root cause of most violent crimes.<p>The spin that my conservative relatives were told by Tucker Carlson and friends was that &quot;these people want anarchy and free reign to commit crimes&quot; (paraphrasing). While anecdotal, it does seem that conservative media conveniently forgot to mention the rest of the argument to my relatives.')
