I have to admit I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before, but SeeLink&#x27;s main use case is to share links with small groups of people, such as teams, friends, or family. SeeLink might come in handy for a student project where you need to share a ton of resources across the web, or even starting a new side project where you need to do lots of research and collaboration. Thanks for taking the time to comment, though!')
