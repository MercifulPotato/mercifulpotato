AIM and ICQ were never open source, but had several 3rd party clients.<p>Nit-picking: AIM had an open-source protocol (TOC), that AOL had created for their TiK open-source AIM client. Some 3rd party clients used the protocol too. It was missing lots of features, but the basics generally worked. After ICQ moved to OSCAR protocol, I believe TOC would work off and on for ICQ as well as AIM.')
