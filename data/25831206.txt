I&#x27;ve been slowly building one over the last couple months and had to learn all of it from various sites.  It&#x27;s nice to have this all in one place.<p>It&#x27;s a 1000mmx600mm gantry design I made in fusion 360.  I&#x27;ve been mostly copying a commercial design (omio cnc).  It uses 20mm aluminum plates, ground rails, and ball screws.<p>For electronics I&#x27;m  using a teensy 4.1 based grbl board (grbl-teensy-4) with external stepper drivers, 34mm steppers, and a 500w brushless spindle.  I&#x27;d go bigger on the spindle but I&#x27;m limited by wattage.<p>The hardest part for me is the hardware.  My design is simple based around plates with holes in them, but a couple plates require threaded holes in the end.<p>If you are a software guy, drilling a 12mm horizontal hole 30mm deep into the edge of a 20mm x 400mm plate is surprisingly difficult. It won&#x27;t fit in my drill press that&#x27;s for sure.')
