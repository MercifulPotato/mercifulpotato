Item(by='pembrook', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602212143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725611, text='Fully agree, I don&#x27;t have a problem paying Stripe if it means they are properly incentivized to help me run my business.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to throw them a few more percent if they could handle more of the complexity you&#x27;ve mentioned above. Right now, Stripe is both too complex to set up and too simple from a feature perspective.<p>I&#x27;m optimistic though since it seems companies like Paddle, Chargebee and others are blazing that path. As much as I love Stripe and what they originally did for online commerce, they&#x27;re already starting to look like the lazy incumbent compared to the challengers right now. Market dominance is not a great incentive to create better products.')
