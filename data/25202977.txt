Their &quot;price&#x2F;performance&quot; graph naturally makes them look quite good but it has some issues. The biggest one is that the methodology is entirely missing but there are some smaller clear issues like comparing to Amazon&#x27;s C6g instance (which costs 13x as much) instead of the price-comparable Lightsail instances.')
