When we were kids, this sounded like the end of the world: a virus that attacks the immune system itself. It was so terrifying to hear about such a horrible disease that had no cure, and was so insidious that we couldn&#x27;t even create a vaccine to stop it.<p>In a few decades we as a species have found a way not only to completely eradicate it to undetectable levels (it still hides in cells to protect itself) but now we are at a monthly injection.<p>The way we have created a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is also absolutely incredible. It&#x27;s great to be alive these days, now if only we can get a firm solution over cancer and other diseases like dementia, etc!')
