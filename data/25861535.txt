Item(by='randcraw', descendants=None, kids=[25861750], score=None, time=1611250486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25860757, text='Your BF&#x27;s doctor is uninformed and offering bad advice.<p>Fact is, most men over age 70 do have elevated PSA due to small amounts of low grade prostate cancer cells (Gleason score of 3+3).  Usually it advances slowly, never growing beyond the bounds of the prostate gland before the patient dies from some other cause.<p>But an elevated PSA (over 1 and below 10) in someone younger than 70 should not be ignored.  Often a second PSA test is done perhaps a month later to confirm the first score and to see if the number is rising quickly.  If repeated tests do not show PSA elevation AND the score is low, often the urologist will recommend a &quot;monitor it, and wait and see&quot; strategy.<p>If the PSA number is high or is rising, the next step is to get a biopsy where 12 to 18 samples of tissue are taken from the prostate to see how much of the gland has cancerous cells (Gleason 3, 4, or 5).<p>I know something about this topic because a routine PSA test at age 55 showed that I had asymptomatic cancer in 80% of my prostate. Luckily it was removed surgically.  But if my doctor was as casually unconcerned as your BF&#x27;s doctor, my cancer would have metastasized and by now it would be incurable.')
