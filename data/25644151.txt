On a side note, by colorspace I mainly meant that we can just stick with one with ultra-wide gamut. There are indeed other reasons to have different color spaces.<p>(Below is my original comment for transparency.)<p>-------------<p>Gamma isn&#x27;t really about CRT; or I should say, they&#x27;re two different things. The fact CRT has a somewhat physical &quot;gamma&quot; (light intensity varies nonlinearly with the voltage) is likely just a coincidence with the gamma we&#x27;re talking here.<p>The reason gamma is used in sRGB is because human eyes are more sensitive to changes in darker area, i.e. if the light intensity changes linearly, it feels more &quot;jumpy&quot; in darker end (which causes perceptible bandings). This is especially an issue with lower color depth. To solve this, we invented gamma space to give darker end more bits&#x2F;intensity intervals to smooth the perceptive brightness.<p>&gt;it&#x27;s not needed to understand the difference between linear and non-linear colorspaces<p>It absolutely should, since any gamma space would have problem with &quot;averaging&quot;, as explained by the GP. Actually, it&#x27;s so bad that almost all the image editing&#x2F;representing tasks we have today are doing it wrong (resizing, blurring, mixing..).<p>This topic has been discussed extensively on Internet, so I&#x27;m not going to go into detail too much.
