That said, the proposed Australian law is nothing short of laughable.<p>Not only are they requiring Google to pay the news orgs they link to, it also seems that Google couldn&#x27;t decide to just not link to these orgs. If the orgs are not a fan of Google showing links to their website they can just forbid Google via robots.txt. This option has been available for decades.<p>When I first read about this I was convinced I had to be completely misunderstanding the proposed law, but no it turns out it is in fact <i>that</i> stupid.<p>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surpised, Australia doesn&#x27;t have a particularly good track record on regulating the internet after all<p>Of course Bloomberg, a news org, would publish an opinion piece titled &quot;Googleâ€™s Going to Regret Its Australia Search Threat&quot;')
