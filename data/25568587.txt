When my team started up we used latex&#x2F;mercurial for all documents. It worked great for a year except for one person that used dropbox instead of mercurial. Eventually we reached a critical mass where convincing the whole team to not use word was impossible.<p>Google docs works pretty well, but I wish it had more friction to download documents in office formats. People are quick to start working on local copies as soon as they miss some minor feature in word and you end up with the same problem you described. I think my perfect tool would not even export to word.<p>I agree sharepoint is awful and it&#x27;s even worse now that it&#x27;s baked into teams and people are using it without even realizing it.')
