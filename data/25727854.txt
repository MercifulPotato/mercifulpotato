Ever. I have MORE time for life, I&#x27;m not in a car an hour a day driving to and from work, I don&#x27;t have to get to work 15 minutes early to make sure my system boots so I can actually clock in, I don&#x27;t have to fight for 1 of 3 microwaves in the break room on the 30 minutes I get for lunch, I clock out and bam my wife and I can get on with our evening instantly, I can eat much better because I don&#x27;t have to worry about what food I can keep in a small lunchbox without it spoiling&#x2F;without losing too much space to ice packs, I don&#x27;t have to use an often soiled public restroom and dodge puddles&#x2F;piles of human waste, I don&#x27;t have the distraction of 100ish people in a cramped open office talking&#x2F;walking around, I have an entire bedroom as an office to myself instead of a few square feet of space, I can listen to music&#x2F;books&#x2F;YT videos without having to have earbuds jammed into <i>one</i> ear because we&#x27;re supposed to always be able to hear people at work, I don&#x27;t have to smell a 3-7 burnt bags of popcorn a day or someone&#x27;s frozen artificial crab&#x2F;cheep microwaved garlic monstrosity&#x2F;boiled greens they microwaved about 3 minutes too long. It&#x27;s great. I never, ever, ever, want to go back to an office.<p>Sadly we&#x27;ll be back to work, sharing desks&#x2F;keyboards&#x2F;mice with another shift, as soon as they feel covid is under control :( it&#x27;s going to suck and absolutely destory my desire to work.')
