Outdoor equipment retailer REI is my favorite example.<p>They have switched from unlimited returns forever for any reason to 1 year.<p>My theory is it’s a combo of two things. 1. People abusing return policies. 2. More and more items that used to be durable becoming consumable. In a lot of industries the drive for lightweight and high tech has led to things that simply can’t last. I have a backpack that weighs less than a pair of jeans, but it certainly won’t last the way my dads old backpack lasted. Same thing with my battery powered drill, I really doubt that I’ll be able to find a battery for it in 30 years.<p>The backpack and the battery powered drill are two things that have shifted from buy it for life, to consumable good.')
