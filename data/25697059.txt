Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610166971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687099, text='&gt; Point to a single court case in the US regarding this election year where evidence was presented in court and judged.<p>Bowyer v. Ducey (while it was <i>also</i> dismissed for a variety of reasons including standing, abstention in the face of overlapping parallel state court claims, mootness, and laches, the analysis in the ruling leading to dismissal for failure to state a claim included a finding that the offered evidence was a combination of unreliable and irrelevant to the claims.)<p>Plus there are at least four cases that proceeded to trial.<p>&gt; Every single case was dismissed on procedural grounds.<p>That&#x27;s both false (not every single election-related case has been dismissed), and beside the point (as, to the extent that “failure to state a claim” is procedural—arguably that and standing are not, really—it often still involves reviewing the proffered evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as to whether it could sustain a <i>prima facie</i> case.)')
