You could argue that a programmer in 2020 is not 10 times faster at writing 1990 style gui software, and maybe you are right.<p>However, if you would try to write a modern web application like Basecamp only with methods and technologies from 1990, this is not going to work out at all. There would be no web frameworks, no web server, no browser, no Ruby, no Java, no stackoverflow, no Google, no automated testing, no git, no stripe, no script, no css - no anything.<p>You would probably give up and go for something like a client-server application with Delphi and Oracle. \nAnd you&#x27;d probably work with a waterfall development style, create tons of features that nobody wants, and then ship the whole thing as a bunch of floppy disks.\nWho would pay for something like that? Even if you sold it at 1&#x2F;10th of what people pay for Basecamp or Jira, no one would want it. It would be trash. There have simply been fundamental improvements in the capabilities of software, and in our abilities and methods of writing such software, so that it is not even possible to compare them, and yes, I would say this is at least an order of magnitude of improvement.')
