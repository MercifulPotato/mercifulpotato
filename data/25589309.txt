They inherently have different life cycles. In an ideal scenario you deploy some dummy code with terraform (just a hello world). And as a separate pipeline you deploy the actual code. Ideally, if your ci&#x2F;cd supports it, you have two separate pipelines, each one only does it&#x27;s thing if the relevant files have been edited, with the code depending on the terraform.')
