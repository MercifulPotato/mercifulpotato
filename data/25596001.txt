You have duty if you belong to and care about something larger than yourself.  I think what&#x27;s weakened people&#x27;s sense of duty is the wave after wave of increasing individualism that probably accelerated some time after WWII, and has been going on for as long as I&#x27;ve been alive.  A big part of duty is sacrificing your individual interests for another, which has always been hard but is even harder if social attitudes don&#x27;t give it much support.')
