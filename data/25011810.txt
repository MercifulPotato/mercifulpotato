Each developer should just by default get 25% of the year to improve the code they&#x27;re responsible for. If a developer wants to spend 6 or 9 months one year doing some big refactor then that&#x27;s one thing, but it&#x27;s not a good work environment if there needs to be weeks of meetings every time someone wants to fix deprecations so that they can upgrade some library or whatever.')
