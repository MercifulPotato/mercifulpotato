It&#x27;s a &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision that prevents any company from having to take on the legal liabilities that come from hosting user-generated content they have no real control over.<p>In short, if you post something on Facebook that someone else doesn&#x27;t like, that person can&#x27;t sue Facebook. But, crucially, there&#x27;s nothing special about Facebook, Twitter, or the other big names here. If I make my own social media startup, I would also enjoy the same protections. It&#x27;s the same reason you can&#x27;t sue Wikipedia for libel if you don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s written about you. Indeed, wikipedia can only really exist because of Section 230 protections.<p>Now why would the negative effects be disproportionate towards small entities and startups? Because the big guys can afford their own content moderation systems. They certainly don&#x27;t want to take on the role of censor, but they&#x27;re perfectly able to. Little nimble startups can&#x27;t, which makes repealing section 230 a form of regulatory capture by existing social media companies.')
