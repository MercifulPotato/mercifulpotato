As mentioned elsewhere, I use it for phase correct cross overs via FIR (at 250 Hz, which means it requires lots of taps), and also for DRC and cabinet correction (same FIR filters). I &quot;simply&quot; adjusted their DSP program (using SigmaStudio) to my needs.<p>The OS looks nice, and it allows to relatively easy manage DSP programs&#x2F;adjustments and, what&#x27;s also kind of important, playback music. BUT I have one HUGE problem with it: The whole software is only really available as an OS image. That plain sucks. This seems all the rage these days, but if I would run every piece of software on an RPi of it&#x27;s own, I&#x27;d end up with a small RPi cluster in a year or two, while one RPi would be enough for all of that.<p>I tried to build AUR packages, but this was utter frustrating to figure out which software depends on what else (the buildroot dependencies they have are good-enough, but not exact; and some software seems to be randomly split across packages) and how they&#x27;re properly configured and so on. So I gave up after a few weekends and am now only running the sigmatcp server.')
