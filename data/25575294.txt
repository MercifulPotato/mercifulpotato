It is more passable in winter because the rivers can be driven across and there is more ice and less swampyness.<p>Several people have done the road and other remote dis-used highways on motorcycle (in summer&#x2F;autumn when it&#x27;s more difficult but the weather is less brutal).  The AVrider forum has several threads with lots of pictures.<p>Traveling these kinds of roads is common in this part of Russia.  I would bet money that they had driven the &quot;correct&quot; route before and then when Google said the old road was faster they knew exactly what they were getting into and figured they&#x27;d give it a try because it might save time.  Their mistake was not being prepared.')
