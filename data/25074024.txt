Are we improving or are we getting worse?<p>From what I see most metrics on an individual or team level can&#x2F;will be gamed leading to worse outcomes.<p>Metrics on higher levels like on the level of the product or even revenue of the company&#x2F;product depends on many other players outside of the control of the engineering team (product management, operations, QA, regulatory, marketing, sales, etc). This of course it&#x27;s due to the fact that delivering value to customers is a team effort.<p>But how can you know&#x2F;show your department is on the right track?')
