My argument is that a few simple, low impact measures would be enough to drop the effective infectivity of the virus low enough that it would fizzle out.  There&#x27;s reason to believe that a simple combination of limiting high-risk social engagements coupled with _strict_, enforced universal face mask requirements would be enough.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t 100% eliminate the virus, as it would continue to spread and pool in countries without those guidelines.  But for countries that do maintain them it would never gain a foothold.<p>Keep that up until a vaccine is deployed.<p>Easy.  Low impact on quality of life.  That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m arguing.')
