If so, do tell-- really, no detail is too small.<p>You got big balls too. The Terrorism he talks about involves actual human harm and the mass slaughter of hundreds of people in China.<p>And here you are trivializing what he&#x27;s talking about into an insensitive block chain insult. Might as well just call him a &quot;nerd.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d say your balls are 100x bigger than his.')
