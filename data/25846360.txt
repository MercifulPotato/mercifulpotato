Suppose you have one interval A represented as offsets within a larger interval B, and you&#x27;d like to know what A&#x27;s coordinates are in the global coordinate system that B uses.\nThis is much easier to compute when everything uses 0-based coordinates.<p>Here is a slightly longer discussion of that in a genomics context: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ga4gh&#x2F;ga4gh-schemas&#x2F;issues&#x2F;121#issuecomment-52739173" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ga4gh&#x2F;ga4gh-schemas&#x2F;issues&#x2F;121#issuecomme...</a> and a draft of a document I wrote up (again, in a genomics context) so as never to have to have this discussion ever again: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmarshall&#x2F;ga4gh-schemablocks.github.io&#x2F;blob&#x2F;jm-intervals&#x2F;pages&#x2F;_formats&#x2F;genome-coordinates.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmarshall&#x2F;ga4gh-schemablocks.github.io&#x2F;bl...</a>')
