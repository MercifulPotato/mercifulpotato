Copyleft licenses still exist, so does the Free Software Foundation.<p>There are now more people who care about these things and more quality Free software available than ever before in human history!\nIt&#x27;s just that the complacent open-source idea, as well as proprietary software (biggest offenders are locked smartphones, etc), have spread even faster :(<p>I don&#x27;t think the movement has weak foundations nor that it is politically naive. In my eyes it goes directly to the problem it cares about, which is human freedom in the context of using a computer. It doesn&#x27;t oppose commerce, but it is aware of the current socio-political order&#x27;s (i.e. capitalism&#x27;s) tendency to turn anything into a sellable commodity.')
