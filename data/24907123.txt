As a person who has to stare at them all day, i find it stupid all banks in india have different formats, some use total, some dr cr, some running net and other nonsense. Thats fine on paper but digital versions are even worse. None are machine readable. I want a statement which can be fed into excel or python or whatever.<p>I am saying thks because you say you interact with banks in building infrastructure. If your one suggestion can help, thousands of people would thank you. Plus it wont cost any money to banks to switch to a standard export format')
