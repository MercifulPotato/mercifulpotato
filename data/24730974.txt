I made it to the on-site twice, hiring committee once but ultimately was rejected; one time I was setting up for a phone screen when the whole COVID thing thinged and I think I got dropped when they froze hiring.<p>My current job was acquired by essentially my current employer buying me out of a contract with my former employer. I was doing contract work and they wanted me full-time. My former employer, the consultancy my current employer contracted with, acquired me when they knew I was unhappy with the place I was at, another place they contracted with, prior to them. The place I was with prior, I was hired via a standard &quot;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot; type of interview. No assessment of my skills was made. I made claims, they took them at face value.<p>So I&#x27;ve been through several processes for getting jobs.<p>&gt; Google screwed the recruitment irrevocably and what&#x27;s worse every minor shop attempts to copy their processes.<p>And this one is eh. Yes, their process is certainly rigorous and probably overkill. But the old style interview wasn&#x27;t much better. The place where I work has gone through a couple of developers. Both were hired through more conventional means as we&#x27;re not a software shop, we&#x27;re a company that happens to need bespoke software.<p>Both were able to produce <i>something</i> in terms of software. None of it was excellent and the internals were just bad. I don&#x27;t know another way to cut it. Neither were fired. Both quit for other jobs. We obviously need some sort of standard here.<p>We do need to assess whether or not someone can solve problems. We do need to assess whether or not someone can code sufficiently. Variable naming, indentation proclivities, clarity, etc. However, we cannot get caught up in testing whether they know the OTBS or the difference between systems and apps Hungarian or if they can solve trick questions.<p>I&#x27;m going to be responsible for essentially building a team for my department of the building. And I&#x27;ll tell you now, I&#x27;m going to be making a process closer to Google&#x27;s rather than the one I went through to get where I am. Not to lock the door behind me, but to make sure we don&#x27;t repeat the same mistakes. It&#x27;s essentially 1 for 3 (maybe, I could be garbage as well to be honest).<p>What&#x27;s wrong with a skills assessment with regards to hiring? Or what&#x27;s wrong with the way Google performs skills assessment with regards to hiring?')
