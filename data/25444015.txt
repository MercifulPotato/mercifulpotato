Do you know a statically typed functional language and want to learn a dynamically typed? Are you looking for something practical you can interop easily with other languages with? Are you looking for a good language to follow SICP with? Do you already know scheme but want to learn a true lisp?<p>Depending on the reason why there are lots of different recommendations. For example If you know Java, and want a more practical language with modern library support from the lisp family someone may actually say Clojure is the best choice for you. But if you know scheme and are wanting to learn an actual lisp, then that wouldn&#x27;t match your needs.<p>Always be wary of people telling you what you should do without them knowing why you want to do it. Not because they don&#x27;t mean well, but because the only way they can answer is by projecting their own reason &quot;why&quot; onto you - which in most cases isn&#x27;t applicable.')
