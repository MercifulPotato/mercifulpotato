Like the costco return policy, or the craftsman tool replacement.<p>I found that home depot had an interesting replacement policy - bring in a broken tool and you get the free Husky brand (now HD&#x27;s store brand) tool as a replacement.  Now I&#x27;ve personally had quality issues with Husky tools, but I have to admit, that&#x27;s a good way of doing it!<p>I&#x27;m mostly afraid of cheap + long &#x2F; forever warranty.')
