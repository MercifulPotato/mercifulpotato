If the context is <i>elsewhere</i>, though, it is bad.<p>Similar for anything implicit (operator overloading, conversions, fancy type classes): If you need to switch context or even know about a completely different language feature or library to understand <i>this</i> code, that additional effort better saves a <i>lot</i> of code <i>here</i>.')
