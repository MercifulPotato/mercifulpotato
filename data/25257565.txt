With the exception of my main workstation at home, all of them are either iMacs or MacBook Pros from 2015 or before.  For the simple reason that the newer Macbooks my colleagues at work are using have all had hardware quality issues.<p>So I had a look at the current Apple product range.  And I have to say that I&#x27;m a bit conflicted.  After the last 5 years of Apple (in my opinion) struggling to produce a laptop relevant for professionals, with the new M1 machines coming, and with every release of OSX having some new element of unpleasant surprise to it, I&#x27;m not sure I want to continue buying Macs.  Not for software development at least.  I&#x27;m considering going back to Linux for my main software development workstation - and possibly for a powerful laptop.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts on this.  Both on whether Macs are a viable option for software development in the future and from people who have made the transition back to Linux for software development.  What was your experience like?')
