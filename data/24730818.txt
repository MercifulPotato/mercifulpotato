How many of the original authors&#x2F;maintainers are left in OpenSSL or the Linux kernel?<p>My main worry about Rust dependencies is not so much the number, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s still a fairly young ecosystem that hasn&#x27;t stabilized yet, packages come and go fairly quickly even for relatively basic features. For instance for a long time lazy_static (which is one of the dependencies listed here) was the de-facto standard way of dealing with global data that needed an initializer. Apparently things are changing though, I&#x27;ve seen many people recommend once_cell over it (I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try it yet).<p>Things like tokio are also moving pretty fast, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if something else took over in the not-so-far future.<p>It&#x27;s like that even for basic things: a couple of years ago for command line parsing in an app I used &quot;argparse&quot;. It did the job. Last week I had to implement argument parsing for a new app, at first I thought about copy&#x2F;pasting my previous code, but I went on crates.io and noticed that argparse hadn&#x27;t been updated in 2years and apparently the &quot;go to&quot; argument parsing lib was now &quot;clap&quot;. So I used clap instead. Will it still be used and maintained two years from now? Who knows.')
