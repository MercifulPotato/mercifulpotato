It&#x27;s a tax treaty form and there is no visa application required if you are only working from Canada. Many companies don&#x27;t know about it and think that paying people out of the US will be a big headache, but they literally only have to fill out the one form and then not take off tax. It basically says &quot;we both are confirming that the Canadian works in a place with a tax treaty with the US and will be paying income tax there so no tax needs to be with-held&quot;. I worked somewhere that knew this first, and then worked at 2 more places where I had to educate the payroll department about it! (They tried to send me forms that clearly said &quot;I am a US citizen&quot; and I was like &quot;hellooo I can&#x27;t sign this, that would be fraud&quot;.')
