When working as a web&#x2F;app frontend developer I&#x27;ve barely ever needed any real maths knowledge beyond basic algebra. As a backend developer, I&#x27;ve had to read up on certain select algorithms. As a game developer I&#x27;ve had to study a bunch of trig, pathfinding and search algorithms.<p>It also depends on the stacks you work with of course. If you are doing doing a lot of Haskell for example you probably want to understand category theory and lambda calculus and whatever.')
