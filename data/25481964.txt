They obviously did not want inventory so they sold an equal number of contracts. (Sell high, buy low). That much is a routine short scenario.<p>The unusual part of this scenario is that contracts were expiring (it required someone to take actual inventory) so prices at settlement went negative. So when they &quot;bought&quot; to cover their shorts at settlement they were paid to do so.')
