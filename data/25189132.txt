You&#x27;re worried the care will get screwed up? Or you worry that someone will steal that data and charge more for insurance?<p>I&#x27;m just wondering about why exactly the paradigm doesn&#x27;t totally work here. I get that we don&#x27;t want medical devices failing, but that&#x27;s different than charting. And I get it that we don&#x27;t want everyone to have your data. But risking that someone does a data copy vs. reducing healthcare costs seems perhaps a risk worth taking (and it&#x27;s not like the insurance companies who actually charge us money don&#x27;t already have it).')
