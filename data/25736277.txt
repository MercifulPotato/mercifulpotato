Regardless of what actions may be taken by the incoming administration in regulating big tech in America, I have to think that every other nation is looking at the richest&#x2F;most powerful&#x2F;most influential tech companies (Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit etc.) and thinking about whether the employees and leaders of these corporations can disrupt their own country or political parties. After all, if they can take down POTUS, isn&#x27;t everyone else a vulnerable target? And if so, isn&#x27;t it a massive risk to have their countries&#x27; culture, politics, and elections subject to the whims of the progressive left in America? I have to think these nations will all plan to either heavily regulate international tech companies, or demand local&#x2F;public ownership of their subsidiaries, or invest in their own native competitors (whether public or private). Anything less than a heavy response would effectively mean they are insecure and open to being controlled by an unaccountable shadow government ensconced in modern tech companies.')
