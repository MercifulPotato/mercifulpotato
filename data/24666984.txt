Not primarily because I&#x27;m smarter and more experienced, but because the tools available to me are <i>just awesome</i>.<p>I can write a functional app that allows a hand full of the billions of people around the world to interact, and I can do that in less than an hour, and on the cheap, perhaps even free.<p>40 years ago, that would have required a lot of time, up front money and ongoing maintenance costs.<p>There are countless examples.<p>I&#x27;m not dismissing the hazards of abstractions and the freakish amount of complexity that we face today.  And I agree that a lot of it is done wrong.')
