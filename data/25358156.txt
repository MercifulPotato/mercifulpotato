Item(by='willis936', descendants=None, kids=[25358274], score=None, time=1607520060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357960, text='&gt;”Break-even&quot; is nowhere near enough to get practical power out, because the energy extraction process must be so inefficient, with two stages of heat exchange before you get a working fluid you can run through your turbine.<p>Correction: break-even is most of the way to a working plant.  A “burning fusion plasma” is one that self heats.  The plant requires very little power when the plasma is supplying most of its own heating.  Keep the confining coils cool, keep the control systems (correction coils and heaters) running, and watch as the heat comes in.  Q = 1 is the balance point.  The distance (in terms of lawson criterion) between Q = 0.5 and 1 is much larger than Q = 1 and infinity,<p>Also, two stages of heat exchange are not needed and not a killer for power generation regardless.  A liquid lithium wall blanket operates as tritium breeder and coolant.  Run the lithium through a heat exchanger to boil water.  Watch as the turbine spins.  Very similar to PWRs.')
