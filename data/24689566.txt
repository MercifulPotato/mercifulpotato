(Green threads were in Java 1.1 then were quickly removed in favor of Native Threads)  As a lot of the work described in the article are handled once in the JVM instead of each application dealing with it separately.  Debugging tools that already work with it (except UI displays not used to displaying 1000&#x27;s of threads at once).
