Firstly, if stuff had been written in Rust it would have been written 30 years after it was relevant. Secondly, if you&#x27;re expecting companies to re-write code after 30 years to make it safer and do a good job? Good luck. There&#x27;s a handful of people on the planet capable of doing it, there&#x27;s a handful of people on the planet willing to do it, and there&#x27;s 0 overlap between the two.<p>If these companies were seriously held accountable for bug free code, there wouldn&#x27;t be better code, there would be a lot <i>less</i> code. Entire applications just wouldn&#x27;t exist. Dozens of products would&#x27;ve died due to dev costs.')
