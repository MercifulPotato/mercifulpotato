I know people who get &gt; $500K as a software engineer on H1b. Getting worker on H1b requires 1-2 month legal process, lot of paperwork and extra money. I think it is more expensive for companies to hire foreign workers. Some startups straight out reject visa holders since they don&#x27;t have resources to hire them.')
