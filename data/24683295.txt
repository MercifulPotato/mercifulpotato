The insulation is typically poor or non-existent<p>You&#x27;re assuming a certain type of climate. Hundred year old buildings with huge levels of thermal mass <i>in year-round warm climates</i> are exactly what you want, not insulation. The high ceilings are also extremely practical in such environments.<p>&gt;There is little reason to suspect that progress in building design has been discontinued<p>Building design: no question that we&#x27;ve got new stuff that in the right conditions is better than what we had 100 years ago. We have some new stuff (e.g. insulated glazing) that is just better <i>always</i>. But there are many aspects of actual building construction that could be argued to have gone backwards in the last 100 years, mostly because of the rise of developer-led construction and the economics that this implies.<p>&gt; the replacement building doesn&#x27;t have to be on the same lot.<p>Fair point.<p>&gt; An expense today is much more costly than the same dollar value expense in 50 years, because if you don&#x27;t spend the money today, you get 50 years worth of interest on it<p>That assumes that you don&#x27;t gain anything of value from the expense today. If what you are saying was so simplistically true, there would no point in investing in anything at all. If I put money into blue chip stocks with the expectation of  earning profits, I do so with the idea in mind that these profits will exceed any interest I might have earned by saving it. If we collectively put money into a beautiful city hall or park lodge, we do with the idea in mind that what we will gain over the life of the building is worth more to us that the interest we might have earned by saving the cost instead.<p>&gt; In which case you&#x27;re essentially asking for the state to fund architecture as art with tax money<p>If you can&#x27;t differentiate or acknowledge the concept or utility of public investment in public places, then I&#x27;m certainly not going to persuade you that this is not what I&#x27;m asking for.')
