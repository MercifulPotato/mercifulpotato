When you say things like &quot;they will still believe [email is non-repudiable] if Google discloses its DKIM keys&quot;, you&#x27;re essentially saying that this campaign will not be successful in its ultimate goal - that even if the campaign manages to get Google to periodically rotate and publish their DKIM keys, it will not achieve the desired effect of increasing the deniability of email. So, you&#x27;re saying that this campaign is a fool&#x27;s errand?<p>I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion on the chances of success that this campaign has. What I am saying is that <i>if the campaign was successful in increasing the repudiability of email</i>, that would make it easier for people to repudiate emails that they&#x27;ve sent, and that would be a bad thing in the context of resolving disputes. Do you agree?')
