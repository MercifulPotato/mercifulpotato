I can&#x27;t really see any professionals stuck with 8 GB ram nowadays. As I said, even Chrome will kill a computer with that amount.<p>So I can see it being an issue, I just think an IDE isn&#x27;t optimized for that kind of usage, I guess? I acknowledge I&#x27;m speaking from privilege here, though, and that probably non-professional users would like to use this software as well.')
