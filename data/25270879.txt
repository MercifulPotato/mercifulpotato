However “past me” is really bad at caring about “future   me”, and “current me” doesn’t care at all about optimising for “past me”.<p>Most people seem happy to argue that the amount that society should spend on them (or their loved ones) for health services is infinite (you can’t put a price on life), and the amount they should spend on the health services for others should be zero (those scabs should have made better life choices!)<p>Good luck trying to make sense out of spending $20 to save $2000!')
