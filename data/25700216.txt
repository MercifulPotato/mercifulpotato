It has always been authoritarian. Every aspect of the government, not just one political party here or there. That includes the police and the judiciary. Every aspect of the Indian govt. abuses power.<p>Rajkot&#x27;s police chief said the kids were not studying for the upcoming exam, and they were playing PUBG. (Edit) So he banned the game for the entire city and arrested people for playing it. Another ex-politician was dragged through a court case for making fun of a judge in a photo. Every now and then, the entire internet is cut off in many parts of India for some silly excuse or another.')
