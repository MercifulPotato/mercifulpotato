Oil and food are examples: the price moves,  but goods must be moved, and people need food to survive. So price could double and demand would go down like 2%<p>Seond issue with your post: there is no shortage of supply, all drugs i can thing of are readilly avaliable. The police &#x2F; etc. Have failed to restrict supply. The only thing they can do is drive up the price as cartels &#x2F; criminals have to employ more elavorate methods.<p>You know what else drives us the price? Taxes. You could set insane rate of tax on any substance so that it&#x27;s legal version costs as much as the black market one, or even more. Legal one still nakes more senxe to buy, because you&#x27;d know its pure and does not come with baking powder, horse shit or rat poison mixed in. Its a well known fact that drugs on the street are of very low purity.<p>In fact it is very common for a drug user to die because they suddenly get a dose of &#x27;clean&#x27; drug and what used to be a normal dose of 10% drug just became a 10x dose of 100% drug.')
