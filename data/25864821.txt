I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s _morally_ wrong to deplatform.<p>Not necessarily because I enjoy having this speech hosted, but because isolating and pushing out so called &quot;deplorables&quot; is escalating the current American political conflicts to serious violence.<p>As I said in my other comment, when the disenfranchised can&#x27;t speak, they get violent. If you disagree with these people, say that to them. Cutting them off from the mainstream public squares like Twitter and Facebook just creates a new generation of radicals.<p>Silicon Valley used to stand for freedom of speech for a reason.')
