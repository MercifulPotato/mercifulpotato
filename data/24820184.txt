At least in my country, which is not small, it kinda felt like everybody knew everybody. With time it just turned into... well, what Twitter is now, so I left years ago. I&#x27;ve wanted to find an alternative to it (and IRC), but I don&#x27;t think a clone with even more draconian moderation rules is the way to go. Also, as I get older I just don&#x27;t feel like dealing with this kind of stuff.')
