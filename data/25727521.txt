There&#x27;s at least a dozen languages you could have chosen, and that others have chosen for any given use case. within some bounds, it makes very little difference.[0]<p>The reason you&#x27;ve chosen Haskell and, by the way, also the TLD &quot;.system&quot;, is that you&#x27;ve constructed your identity in such a way that &quot;advanced language with a steep learning curve&quot; is something that fits.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.
