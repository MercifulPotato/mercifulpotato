Let me lay out the scenario in more detail.<p>The program is still exactly the same.  It asks to be pointed at a fluid sim program, and then uses that for some of the math it needs.<p>When it was coded, the only dependency it could use was GPL.<p>Now there&#x27;s a new non-GPL dependency it <i>could</i> be pointed at, with the same API.<p>Now it&#x27;s possible to run the program without using any GPL code.  Does that make the program no longer GPL, even though it didn&#x27;t change?')
