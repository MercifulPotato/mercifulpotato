Hate speech is terrible and I hate it myself, but it could be even worse that someone could legally define or interpret someone’s speech as hate speech. How would judges decide these cases? What burden of proof would prosecutors need? We would need extremely narrow guidelines and even then it likely wouldn’t even cone close to being sufficient.
