That&#x27;s what makes them bad actors :)<p>But are the bad actors in the two scenarios (with&#x2F;without Coc) the same kind of bad actors?  Do they have the same set of motivations for being in the community, and the same ability to rally supporters?  My perception is that the bad actors in the two scenarios are wildly different, and that they&#x27;re different because Codes of Conduct tend to distort the core incentives for participation in the community.')
