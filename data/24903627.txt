A lot of people might have friends, family, or other ties to the region, and this is just what they need to convince them to make the switch. 15k isn&#x27;t much, but it will cover a smaller move and closing costs pretty well for a lot of people. This is especially true if you&#x27;re already in the Indiana&#x2F;Wisconsin&#x2F;Ohio area.')
