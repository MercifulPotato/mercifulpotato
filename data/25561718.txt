Let&#x27;s do the math your way in both directions:<p>1) Assuming system-level model<p>10,000 microphones * 8 kilosamples per second = 800 megasamples per second.<p>NVidia Tesla does 100 teraflops. I get about 125,000 FLOPS per sample. That feels adequate to me!<p>2) One filter per microphone per passenger. We need to divide by 250.<p>500 FLOPS per sample per passenger. That&#x27;s more than enough for a very fancy IIR.<p>Of the two, I think #1 is more likely to work than #2, precisely because you want a coherent model. If you want to adjust your model for someone walking down the aisle (or any kind of system ID), that&#x27;s a lot easier with 125,000 FLOPS per sample than 500 FLOPS per sample.')
