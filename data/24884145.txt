The evidence for that isn&#x27;t as strong as people assume.<p>Section 3.4 talks about the weighing issue, and shows some where reweighing worked:<p><i>Following the election, two different state-level pollsters acknowledged that they had not adjusted for education and conducted their own post-hoc analysis to examine what difference that would have made in their estimates. Both pollsters found that adjusting for education would have meaningfully improved their pollâ€™s accuracy by reducing over-statement of Clinton support.</i><p>but also:<p><i>Despite this, it is not clear that adjusting to a more detailed education variable would have universally improved polls in 2016. Analysis of the effect from weighting by five education categories rather than three categories in four national polls (Appendix A.H) yielded an average change of less than 0.4 percentage points in the vote estimates and no systematic improvement.</i><p>It&#x27;s worth noting that in previous elections this had never been the case before (which was why it wasn&#x27;t done).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aapor.org&#x2F;Education-Resources&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;An-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aapor.org&#x2F;Education-Resources&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;An-Evaluat...</a>')
