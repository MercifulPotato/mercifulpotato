You are aware of why anti-semitism was so widespread in Europe at that time and why Hitler found it such fertile ground? It&#x27;s because Jews were perceived (with some justification) as being at the top of the totem pole, they tended to dominate top financial jobs in particular, but also were successful in many other ways e.g. many were business owners, lots of academics were Jews and so on. The anti-Jewish trope at the time was that this was because Jews were involved in a global conspiracy to promote Jews above others.<p><i>The Protocols</i> is an example of this kind of conspiracy theory. It was said they controlled the world&#x27;s financial systems, the press, and so on. The conspiracy theory was vague, and the Protocols doesn&#x27;t really name any specific people or give specific evidence. Nonetheless it became widely believed in the first part of the 20th century in Russia and Europe.<p>This was why the first part of the anti-semitic policies of the Nazis was to start banning Jews from holding high ranking positions, and boycotting their businesses.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;encyclopedia.ushmm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;boycott-of-jewish-businesses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;encyclopedia.ushmm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;boycott-of...</a><p>Now in 2020 it is <i>de rigour</i> for people to state that white men hold positions of power due to a vague sort of conspiracy (&quot;patriarchy&quot; and &quot;institutional racism&quot;), that they should be removed from these positions and replaced by people of acceptable race and gender, and that this is OK because they sit at the top of the totem pole. Patriarchy&#x2F;institutional racism are vague theories, with no specific names or evidence ever being presented to support their existence. But nonetheless they are very popular theories and are routinely used to justify discrimination against white men.')
