Just like everything will sooner or later connected to the internet, which is why it matters that it is secure, with &#x27;software is eating the world&#x27; as pretty much the mantra of HN you should realize that <i>any</i> piece of software, no matter how trivial has the potential to affect lives and sometimes in the most direct way with the ultimate price - of someone else&#x27;s life - as the consequence of our collective failure.<p>And that&#x27;s because of the very nature of software: it gets re-used all the time. One persons application is another persons library, one persons application is another persons service and so on.<p>Leaky abstractions are bad enough, leaky <i>broken</i> abstractions can sooner or later turn out to be dangerous.<p>Of course whoever deploys the software has the responsibility to check it for suitability. But in principle any language, OS or library has the potential to be applied in ways the original author did not foresee and if that potential can extend to life critical or life affecting purposes then that should come with a similar standard of care.<p>How many machine learning systems are written in Python? How many of those make decisions every day regarding people&#x27;s lives, some of those life critical? Are you <i>seriously</i> suggesting that all those people made the wrong decision in picking the language the application is written in?<p>If so then you are most likely at odds about this with just about every developer out there who - rather than arguing with their manager about whether language &#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27; or &#x27;z&#x27; is suitable for the job will simply be told what language is on the menu and to do the job in that one based on availability of programmers and whatever is &#x27;hip&#x27; at the moment. These decisions are not necessarily made in the most rational manner and whether you agree or disagree with that in principle it is the reality that we live in.<p>And so &#x27;toy&#x27; languages such as Python, PHP, Perl, Visual Basic, FileMaker and so on are all going to be used for mission critical stuff, whether you add a disclaimer or not.<p>Better be aware of that  before you throw your brainchild out into the world: you own it.')
