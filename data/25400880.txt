You have to plan your command, try to run it and understand how all the piping steps work. If you get it wrong, it’s an annoying experience.<p>As an alternative, try Sublime with multiple selection (or other editors). With multiple selection skills you can transform your lines in a WYSIWYG interactive format which is much easier to work with for me.<p>(To use it well you need to know the following shortcuts: split selection to lines, select next, and the alt+arrows jumps to next&#x2F;previous word)<p>This won’t mean you don’t need to learn how to use shells, but is still pretty fun to use.')
