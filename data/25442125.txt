Although he&#x27;s moderately controversial for Intellectual Ventures and famous for Microsoft and Modernist Cuisine, I know him best from the massive dinosaur skeleton in his Lake Washington mansion.<p>While living in Seattle I had a (super, super dumpy) boat and a favorite activity was boating friends by his house to surprise them.
