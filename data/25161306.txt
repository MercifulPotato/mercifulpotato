IIUC they also excluded people with prior exposure to COVID-19.<p>I&#x27;d take it if I were 60, certainly 70 - an 80 year old with pre-existing conditions has a shockingly high 20% infection fatality rate(1).

For them it&#x27;s about a 1 in 1 million fatality rate per infection(1). And we&#x27;ve screwed up before: one of the H1N1 vaccines turned out to occasionally cause narcolepsy, and that wasn&#x27;t even novel vaccine technology.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gh.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;5&#x2F;9&#x2F;e003094" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gh.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;5&#x2F;9&#x2F;e003094</a>')
