The Arbitron system works through the HD Radio codec, which is a wavelet codec.  It is basically hybrid mp3 type coupled with high frequency reconstruction on the receiver side.<p>Interestingly, that literally means fake signals on the receiving end above 8 to 10Khz!  Was as low, and may still be as low as 5khz when used for AM.  I have not kept up.<p>I could tell early on.  It has improved a lot since then.<p>The Arbitron system appears robust.  Noise, low signal quality, etc...  do not generally impact it much.  The effective bitrate needed is very low.<p>Given a larger sample of audio, it is likely to work.')
