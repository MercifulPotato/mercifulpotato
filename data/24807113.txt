There may be some tweaks that could be made that I would support, but the general concept behind 230 is correct.<p>&gt; Are private entities responsible for the content they host?<p>Generally no. Private entities are responsible for the content that they publish, not for the content that they host. An example being the comment section on a news site versus the news article on a news site. The latter is content that they published, the former is content that they host.<p>&gt; If we repeal 230 and someone posts something falsely defaming me, who do I sue?<p>IANAL but I would imagine if 230 is repealed and some one libels you, you sue the platform and the content creator.<p>If 230 isn&#x27;t repealed you sue the content creator and ask for an injunction against the platform to remove the content.')
