Since then I&#x27;ve just gotten so used to it that I forgot about my desire for it.<p>My hacky solution at the time was just to always do anything programming related in a folder watched by Dropbox. Then every single file modification and delta is indeed automatically stored (and away from my machine, for redundancy and safety). It&#x27;s not the greatest UX when I occasionally dig through the Dropbox file modification history, but it works okay enough.<p>As an amateur musician, I always wondered why there wasn&#x27;t any DAW that supported something like this, too. You get an endless undo button that automatically tracks all atomic actions (twist X knob to N%, change Y volume to N dB) to allow for reversions, but no system to actually view, restore, tag, or switch between anything in this edit tree beyond resorting to annoying kluges like &quot;stashing&quot; an older state by spam-clicking &quot;undo&quot;, saving a copy of the project under a new file name with a short description of the state at that time, and then pressing &quot;redo&quot; over and over until you&#x27;re back at the &quot;present&quot;.<p>And when you close the program, all that undo history is gone, in which case if I feel like I did something that really messed up the whole project and which I want to revert, I have to dig through the Dropbox file edit history and download like 10 different copies of the project file around the time I think the undesirable change may have occurred, and load each project one by one to try to find the one that&#x27;s immediately before that change.<p>Sorry for the long tangent. I just also don&#x27;t see why this isn&#x27;t already a thing for both source code and music project version control.')
