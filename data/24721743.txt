In multiple repos, the history for one repo is limited to that repo, which is usually more topical for people working on it.<p>If I&#x27;ve got changes on an old version of the repo, and try to merge against a new one, I find conflicts in the changes others have made to the same repo -- I have the &#x27;before&#x27; version, they have the &#x27;after&#x27;.  I frankly don&#x27;t investigate too much when it hits.<p>As for history, I love rebase for two reasons: (1) I can squash mistakes in my history so they&#x27;re gone forever.  (2) In reconciliation I&#x27;m watching my changes filter through the history of the repo.  When I understand what&#x27;s up, this is great.  When I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a catastrophe of me re-applying changes that haven&#x27;t actually been applied yet, then conflicting with their application later. Ugh.')
