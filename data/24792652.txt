To begin with it’s a complete maze just to subscribe to it. Second, a serious bug was released that replaced all my bookmarks with some random spam video. Third, the ultimate deal breaker which happened a few days ago, was that the iPad app is so buggy that it deleted all my bookmarks when I tried to simply move a folder to a different folder since the navigation is so broken I was left with no choice. A years worth of bookmarks went “poof!” in a second; words can’t express my rage.<p>My advice, drop raindrop before it drops your bookmarks.')
