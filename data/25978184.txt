Further, sharing power is a cost saving measure and happens as soon as importing power costs less than using a peaking power plant.  It still requires someone to have built the generating capacity, but it’s much easier to add 1GW of base load capacity at a time when your selling some of that to a different state.<p>As to minor differences 50GW is 67% larger than 30 GW that’s a huge swing over the course of a day.  At 0.5 KW per person  in CA x 4 miles per kWh x 12 hours x 365 days, that’s 8,760 miles per year which is almost enough on it’s own.  Suggesting  at most a minimal capacity increase.')
