Chinese and Japanese are far more monocultural, and developed somewhat linearly.<p>It would be very interesting to see research on the inverse: native English speakers who experience dyslexia in other languages. Also research on <i>non</i>-symbolic language dual learning (e.g., German speakers who learn English).')
