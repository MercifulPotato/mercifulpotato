At some point, after getting abused again and again, users are to blame. All this shouldn&#x27;t suprise any of them, it&#x27;s in the ToS after all. Some users read the ToS and made an educated choice, some didn&#x27;t read them and decided to not participate in any business with a company that obfuscates its goals in a 50-page wall of legal damage control, and some just ignore it and use the service.
