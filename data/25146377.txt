Or try to help cloth them by donating free clothing.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;bad&quot; to receive these donations, but the un-intended side effect is that they destroy the local industry, and prevent competition from forming. Thus, the country has a hard time building up their own industry.<p>Of course, these charities aren&#x27;t doing so with any ill intensions (which is where the simile deviates).<p>Apple hides the true issue of device open-ness by lowering their %-cut they take, and indies celebrate. But they are blind to the future possibility of being locked out by apple by decree (see epic), or some other arbitrary rule they create.')
