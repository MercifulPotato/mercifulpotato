Likely works seamlessly with apple products similar to other airpods and, unlike those other cans, doesn’t require a proper sound system or external amp to drive them.<p>That being said, the fact that they stipulate they <i>only</i> work with apple products is a bit insane to me. I’ll stick with my wireless Sennheisers that I have to charge once a month thanks.<p>EDIT: Here’s the bit about them being Apple only. Hopefully it changes.<p><pre><code>  AirPods Max require Apple devices running iOS 14.3 or later, iPadOS 14.3 or later, macOS Big Sur 11.1 or later, watchOS 7.2 or later, or tvOS 14.3 or later.</code></pre>')
