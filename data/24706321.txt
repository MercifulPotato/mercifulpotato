There&#x27;s a really good book by Marshal Rosenberg, titled non-violent communication, which gives a better explanation than I can right now. I would recommend it to pretty much anyone, if only for the very healthy way of treating oneself that it provides. Mileage may vary, but it fits my mental model pretty well<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m very glad to read through the replies to your post and see all the constructive  you&#x27;ve engaged in. I&#x27;ve gotten mare than a few new thoughts and ideas because I chose to get involved in this post - thank you :)')
