Why would companies want to be ethical? The only worry is what affects their bottom line, and for that you only need to appear ethical.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people are so naive to think they can get millions of dollars from their employer and do whatever they want.<p>All great ethics leaders (i mean Ghandi, Mandela, etc) had their life severely impacted b  y their choices and they were not sitting on the fattest payroll on the planet.\nAnd that was the easy part: the reason why they are great is that they still managed to deliver their message to the world, despite their limited resources and harsh conditions   .<p>I hope Dr. Gebru can rise to that level. We definitely need more ethical leadership.')
