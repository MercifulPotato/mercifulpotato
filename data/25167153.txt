Item(by='piaste', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605922190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163920, text='&gt; The Slack app is essentially a Chromium browser running the usual web-based Slack. It uses the same amount of resources running in a tab in your browser.<p>I would expect that a pinned Slack tab in Chrome&#x2F;Edge would be able to share <i>some</i> resources with the browser that a separate Slack app can&#x27;t.<p>Has anybody tested the performance difference between running 100 browser tabs vs. running the same webapps as 100 electron processes?')
