Is that what you meant? Though we&#x27;d obviously still need vaccinations</i><p>Yeah, exactly. Depending on other model factors (like ongoing vaccinations, relative mortalities, economic costs etc) the best time (and degree) to open up may be earlier or later than the technical herd immunity point.<p>To make an unfair argument: is 65% vaccination the end of WFH, or just when we should open up outdoor dining? If we vaccinate the youngest 65%, clearly we&#x27;d have different restrictions than if we&#x27;d vaccinated the eldest 65%. Etc.')
