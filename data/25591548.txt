There is no format today that lets you package up an interactive web experience and let someone else embed it for you. That was a huge deal because while Flash was easy to get your hands on (illegally, but still) most of the Flash creators did not have the ability to run their own web server.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that sharing links to Flash content was a walk in the park though. I remember spending a <i>lot</i> of time updating Flash player and restarting my computer and then something going wrong and doing it again. Plus Flash was always trash on Mac and Linux, HTML5 works great on those platforms.<p>So I don&#x27;t really miss Flash the technology but I miss the wacky internet that existed around Flash content.')
