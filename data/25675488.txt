This enraged some hindu groups and the ad got pulled because there was a vocal online outcry, calls for boycotts, doxxing, etc. The corporation protected itself from the negative externality.<p>I&#x27;m all for it, but I recognise what is also happening as a result.<p>While in the above case it&#x27;s the corporation pulling its own ad, and in the Facebook case they&#x27;re a platform, the end result is the same. Some activist group tells the advertiser not to advertise because their ad equates them to X and X is bad, here are a bajillion deeply offended people.<p>At Facebook you have employees colluding with activist groups giving them tips on how best they can &quot;effect change&quot; on Facebook policy. Which advertisers to target, which controversies to use in their activism. It&#x27;s all to bring about the desired political outcome of some radicals - limit the reach of my political enemy or their strongest arguments.<p>In the USA the religious group doing the activism is not Christianity anymore - back in the 70s and 80s the Christian lobby had the same degree of influence over TV show content. Today there is a secular belief system occupying that same position, with the opposing political party at the helm, much like the religious right of a few decades ago.')
