His opinion says the &quot;Open Source&quot; philosophy is based off watering down &quot;free software&quot; principles.<p>&quot;The terms “free software” and “open source” stand for almost the same range of programs. However, they say deeply different things about those programs, based on different values. The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. This is why we do not agree with open source, and do not use that term.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point....</a><p>I guess you and Stallman agree there, and that permissive open source licenses are totally up-to-date with modern cloud computing businesses and business practices and that Elastic and their choice of Apache2 are getting exactly what they signed up for. And that &quot;free software&quot; licences especially the viral ones exemplified by GPL&#x2F;AGPL are also still relevant in 2021, and having chosen one of those would have given Elastic.co what they claim to be demanding... (I think I agree there too.)')
