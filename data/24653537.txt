So far the largest charger I&#x27;ve been able to find only has 2 USB-C plugs. So, switch + pixel + pocket wifi + macbook air<p>Then I have lots different computers. My Macbook Air has USB-C, my MacBook Pro has USB-A, My brand new desktop PC has USB-A, my Razer laptop has both USB-A and USB-C, my Playstation has USB-A. I have USB-A SD-Card readers and USB-A hubs.<p>Then, when If first got the Macbook Air I ended up going through 3 different USB-C hubs until I finally figured out how to buy one that actually supported 4k-60hz (the first 2 only supported 4k-30hz). Then later, I tried to use the Razer on a USB-C monitor. It worked but at some point the keyboard and mouse were flaky. Turned out apparently I needed a Thunderbolt HUB, not a USB-C hub (plugs are the same) so now I&#x27;ve gone through 4 hubs.<p>you can read about the 4 or 5 kinds of possible USB-C hubs you might end up with if you&#x27;re not careful. I have no idea how a non-techie figures this out.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigmessowires.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigmessowires.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;explaining-4k-60hz-...</a><p>And then, I still have 3 iPhones that all use lighting (USB-A to lighting) and a few other devices at are USB-Micro (Kindle for example)<p>And several external hard-drives that are all that USB-3 wide plug to USB-A<p>I&#x27;m sure by the time USB-D arrives USB-C will be great and all my cables will be USB-C on both ends and all my devices will only have USB-C sockets but right now it&#x27;s a mess')
