I was left on my own. So I muddled through. And documented everything in Makefiles. Not readme, but working code. Now `make clean` `make install` etc, all run, deploy, install, clean etc the project.<p>A great way to learn. But unfortunately worthless to others in the team, as they all were entrenched in their own ways and setups. I just added a sixth&#x27; way of &#x27;working with the codebase&#x27;. I&#x27;m no to sure if it is the team, me, or Make, but I certainly won&#x27;t spend such time a next new codebase arrives.<p>(I do add makefiles on each of my private and opensource projects though, and will keep doing that)')
