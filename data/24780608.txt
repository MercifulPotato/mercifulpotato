Zoom&#x27;s characterization of end to end was referring to the transport layer between the clients and Zoom service endpoint. The more serious issue there was that until a point in the recent past, they weren&#x27;t using an appropriate cipher mode.<p>E2E in the sense that security nerds bang their chests about isn&#x27;t what customers want. Boards of directors of public companies, some attorneys, and some others need it. Almost nobody else does. It means that you don&#x27;t have cloud recording, can&#x27;t use POTS phones to connect to the meetings, etc. People with those needs have security controls beyond the software, so they probably need something like Webex, or should be using directly connected room systems. Someone who needs E2E for real reasons aren&#x27;t doing it from home, for example, as you need to take other measures to protect that meeting content.')
