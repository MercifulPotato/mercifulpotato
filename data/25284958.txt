There are 45 sequential possibilities of winning numbers: 1-2-3-4-5-6, 2-3-4-5-6-7, ... 45-46-47-48-49-50.  So &quot;45 &#x2F; (50 choose 6)&quot;, about 647 times more likely than that calculation for p.<p>Of course, if you start adding in other striking patterns  like 2-4-6-8-10-12, the chance of a &quot;fishy&quot; draw becomes more and more likely.')
