Nowadays, everyone takes for granted that music is bandwidth cheap, and content owners realized that removing the packaging issue did remove a large part of the piracy, because those who pirated for lack of good delivery didn&#x27;t have to anymore, and with this market share acquired, the revenues increased, which meant that prices could go down, and thus another chunk of the piracy crowd became customers as well.<p>I guess that my point is that price isn&#x27;t a completely solvable problem, but it&#x27;s not entirely orthogonal to the other issues.<p>Clearly, price cannot be reduced down to zero, there will always be people finding this or that to be too expensive for what it is. Note that ads do not reduce cost to zero for the consumer in the case of digital streaming: they still have to pay in ad view <i>time</i>, which leads to ad blockers, yet another form of piracy.<p>&gt; If Netflix was working so well, all those other services wouldn&#x27;t exist, because they&#x27;d have no customers.<p>Even if Netflix is working perfectly well, they can&#x27;t have the monopoly of creativity. They might produce good content (something you seem to disagree with, I personally don&#x27;t have an opinion on that), but they cannot prevent other distributors to do the same. The main reasons for this are that:<p>- again people cannot be put all in the same bag: what one will be interested in might bore the next,<p>- &quot;topics&quot; can be exclusive (GP alluded to that): For instance, Disney owns &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and if you want to watch some of that stuff, you&#x27;ll have to go to them.')
