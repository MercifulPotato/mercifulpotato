There&#x27;s a lot of exiting companies&#x2F;teams (like mine) looking to hire people but we&#x27;re on the &quot;old stack&quot; using Kafka, Scala, Spark, etc. We don&#x27;t do any ML stuff but I&#x27;m on the pipeline side of it. The data scientists down the line tend to use Hive&#x2F;SparkSQL&#x2F;Athena for a lot of work but I&#x27;m much less involved with that.<p>Not all jobs are new pasture and I think that&#x27;s forgotten very frequently.')
