For example, I would prefer to avoid animal-based rennet if at all possible, but there is no real diversity in cheeses with a Parmesan-like flavor profile made with microbial rennet (I know of one such cheese and while it’s ok it’s also no amazing) and as far as I know Parmesan (actual Parmesan named Parmesan) with microbial rennet doesn’t exist.<p>There are probably hard-cheeses out there that have a Parmesan-like flavor profile and are made with microbial rennet but they are fiendishly difficult to find. The one I found I only did find because it markets itself explicitly as a Parmesan alternative with microbial rennet. But beyond that? And I can totally understand why cheese makers are reluctant to jump into that market if they can’t market themselves as that thing, even if they were perfectly capable of making that thing.<p>Overall it’s a difficult Problem to solve with no easy outs I can see.')
