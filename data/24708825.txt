Congrats on shipping, that&#x27;s the hardest part! Site looks great. \nJust something I noticed, images from the blog took a bit to load, and they could be optimized (will also save you bandwidth). I recommend doing this for all images though. Search for tinyjpg or similar free sites, it will compress the images without losing much on quality.<p>Keep it up! :)<p>Edit: there are some great libraries to compress images too. e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;semiromid&#x2F;compress-images" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;semiromid&#x2F;compress-images</a>')
