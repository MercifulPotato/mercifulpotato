I teach CS as well and just taking a problem and dividing it into small tasks to be solved is something many students struggle with even near the end of our programme. This &quot;mental leap&quot; (the bridge between the problem and the steps to solve it using code) is the real barrier in my opinion. Most students won&#x27;t have a problem understanding a solution when presented with it and wrongly thinks that just understanding a solution is the end goal, when arriving at it is the real challenge.')
