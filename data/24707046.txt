In fact I might have enjoyed it more if there were more structure.<p>I hated art class as a kid, and turning computer lab into art class was not something I was ready for back then.  At the time I was laser focused on wanting to learn to program, and I saw logo as something different than programming.<p>You&#x27;re using this as a weird segway to rant about authoritarians, but you&#x27;re also telling me that there&#x27;s a single way to teach kids programming that everyone needs to adhere to, and anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it was taught wrong.  Seems a bit tone deaf.')
