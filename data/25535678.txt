Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25535852], score=None, time=1608893174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535372, text='I have to distrust this survey because it was commissioned by the World Economic Forum, even if it was executed by Ipsos. And Ipsos themselves aren’t exactly the best pollsters - they’re rated a B- by 538 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;pollster-ratings&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;pollster-ratings&#x2F;</a>) and I find online polling methodologies to be generally dubious.<p>The World Economic Forum is famously pushy about establishing a “new normal” and the idea of a “Great Reset” (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Reset" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Reset</a>). They have a vested interest in painting a picture of broad support for their political agenda. So of course they’re fishing for data like this. But from the little information available about this survey, I am already skeptical because the questions seem poorly designed. For example someone may answer “yes” to wanting a more “sustainable and equitable” world even if they are only interested in the “sustainable” part. Or they may understand “equitable” to mean equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. They may also answer “no” to this question if it was more specific about policies. Similarly on the other question, someone may say they don’t want to return to a pre COVID life only because they like remote working and not commuting (rather than desiring a new economic order). So I’m not sure what to take away from these results.')
