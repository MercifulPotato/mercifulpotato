Stop showing me the ad for the tool from the same store I already bought it from.&quot;<p>Yes. I hate this too, but think of it as a bug, not the actual intention. We would love to know when you wouldn&#x27;t buy a product as much as we would love to know when you actually would. But we don&#x27;t, always, and end up having to make approximations. We don&#x27;t always know what you actually bought, we just know you bought something. Advertisers don&#x27;t even always tell the value of stuff you bought, something tht&#x27;d have benefited them to share from ROI pov etc.')
