If you talk with a pedantic person he might be 100% accurate but prevent it from moving forward. This is called obstruction. What Lem was saying is obviously true, definitions of different level remain in use. Because they&#x27;re useful.<p>I like Lem but sometimes his complex grammar and vocabulary doesn&#x27;t add any value. I think it&#x27;s better to describe (relatively) simple things in simple language. Lem tended to phrase everything that way.')
