Police in the US are armed to the teeth, so it’s no wonder they overcompensate with aggression.<p>Of course, if they received a tip or confirmed that someone in the building is armed and dangerous, then that’s a different story. But simply going in with guns drawn in every single situation is simply unacceptable.')
