Then what?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I received an e-mail from Cognism about a notice of my *data* processing in their service. I am not sure how they get my e-mail address (which is not related to my name or job) and relate it with my name. Anyhow, I did ctrl+f to see the `opt-out` section, and here is the section:<p><pre><code>    &gt; ## Marketing Opt-Out Options\n    &gt;\n    &gt; If you do not wish for your personal data to be used in the\n    &gt; Cognism Database for the purposes set out above, please fill in\n    &gt; your details here[0] or contact us using the above contact\n    &gt; details.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; Where you receive a marketing email from us, and you would like to\n    &gt; be removed from that mailing list please let us know by clicking\n    &gt; unsubscribe at the bottom of any marketing email that you receive\n    &gt; from us.\n    &gt;\n    &gt; [0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cognism.com&#x2F;data-opt-out\n</code></pre>\nNormally, I looked at the page, and funnily enough to ask me to fill in the company name, first and last name, where I live, and my work e-mail to opt-out. Is this just normal form for this kind of opt-outs, even though I really didn&#x27;t want to be part of their collected data? Do you have any suggestions on keeping me away from these services?')
