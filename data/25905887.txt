Microsoft had, I imagine, powerful clients that were still on Windows XP.<p>The consumer space is a much more dynamic space. As it would happen, it has been about 15 years since the first iPhone. I would be surprised if there were someone still wanting to use that device. (I mean, un-ironically.)<p>Also too, the smart phone was a new market and the &quot;Cold War&quot; between Android and Apple meant change was harried (is that the proper use of that word?). &quot;Move fast and break things&quot; was certainly evident on both sides.<p>Now though, as the market has matured, I would hope all players slow down a bit and look to extend the lifetime of their hardware&#x2F;software.')
