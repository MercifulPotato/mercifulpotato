Item(by='pqb', descendants=None, kids=[25446211], score=None, time=1608139304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444632, text='&gt; What I don&#x27;t miss from Ubuntu are the PPA&#x27;s,<p>I have just looked into the extra sources to see if I have any PPA there but I was surprised to see the only one, which come with a Pop_OS! to bring some custom tiling manager and other tweaks.<p>Frankly, era of PPAs has ended. I don&#x27;t find many software packages shared on Launchpad nor I won&#x27;t trust PPA owners to install anything from most of PPAs. There are better ways to share software and easier to set own APT server. Today, almost all software distributors I know (Microsoft, Slack, Sublime, Spotify, Hashicorp...) have their APT repository on also their server or on a packagecloud[0] &#x2F; JFrog Artifcatory[1]<p>&gt; If you plan to do any gaming in Linux.<p>To be honest, I find KVM with GPU pass-though a better idea overall (I can use software like Affinity Designer thanks to that). KVM is a really top-notch software if you know to configure it properly :) However, proton and wine can be installed without any problem on Ubuntu.<p>&gt; And, I&#x27;m biased a bit because my installation is always quite minimal. I only have i3 and my tools for programming, and whatever is needed to run proton games.<p>I have a complete range of various programming tools and SDKs that hardly can be packed in 240GB disk. My current setup is rather small: Jetbrains IDEs, Unity3D, Qt Creator&#x2F;Designer, emacs with orgmode, vim, various chat apps, Spotify, Syncthing, Sublime Text &amp; Merge, rofi, pass, fossil, nginx, flutter, nimrod, nodejs, deno, zsh, golang, chicken-scheme, milena+ivona, orca, backup tools, terraform with terragrunt, multipass and some dotfiles and private scripts. It takes about 3h to complete format disk and install OS and provision all software I need (thanks to terraform). My DE is GNOME with a taskbar (Dash To Panel extension) instead of a dock. Is it minimal? Likely no, but it does its job.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packagecloud.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packagecloud.io&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jfrog.com&#x2F;artifactory&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jfrog.com&#x2F;artifactory&#x2F;</a>')
