Item(by='AtlasBarfed', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611337021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864078, text='Skateboard EV design combined with high-density batteries and plunging motor&#x2F;component costs should enable lots of flexible near DIY designs.<p>I speculate the widespread ability to do small scale manufacture of the base skateboard (wheels, motors, battery, &quot;frame&quot; part of body on frame) dropping to $5000 in about 10 years.<p>Sure it might not get the range &#x2F; weight advantage of Big Auto EVs (that is, once the rest of Big Auto starts to close the gap with Tesla), but it will probably still do 200 miles for daily driving or fun driving. It probably won&#x27;t have slick software, won&#x27;t self-drive, etc.<p>Then there is the drop-in engine replacements. Again, once batteries get cheap and good enough, you can probably get a 100-150 mile range on a all-in-one battery+motor drop in for a, for example, chevy big block. Stick shifts could do regen with the old &quot;engine braking&quot;, or single pedal driving could probably be done too.<p>But it might save a vast array of old cars. If the cheap skateboard can be tailored for the old car wheelbase&#x2F;dimensions, you could see old cadillacs rolling around with these inside of them.')
