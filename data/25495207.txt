Item(by='oblio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608560903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494141, text='I can&#x27;t find it now, but I remember reading about something with what seems a lot more boring than the articles I find about &quot;metamaterial lenses&quot;. Maybe someone has a pointer for what it&#x27;s actually called.<p>It was something reproducing a sort of &quot;solar furnace&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_furnace" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_furnace</a>) at a micro scale, coordinated with electronics. Think creating a dynamic lens by redirecting light from many micro lenses (mirrors?).<p>The upside being dynamic focal lengths using extremely short lens (the whole thing being microscopic).<p>Am I day dreaming? I can swear I read something or saw a documentary somewhere.<p>Or is what I&#x27;m describing just another name for metamaterial lenses? Based on what I&#x27;ve read about metamaterials, right now, I don&#x27;t think it is, but I can very easily be wrong.')
