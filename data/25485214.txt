It would help if you gave some examples of what is missing in each case (in your eyes) disqualifying them.<p>With the SQL example:<p>I don&#x27;t think a set of rules is disqualified from being called an algorithm if it&#x27;s implemented using some other tool or process, because we do this all the time: when programming, we split up implementations into functions, or we could have used the standard library&#x27;s sort function too -- I would still consider it an algorithm no matter how the &quot;sort the results&quot; step ended up being implemented.<p>If the result is wrong, it is not necessarily because the implementation of SQL&#x27;s ORDER BY is incorrect (it could be but it&#x27;s unlikely for a popular SQL implementation), and if you know that the the rules are incorrect then I agree, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t blame the sorting algorithm (at least initially, although it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s also be wrong).')
