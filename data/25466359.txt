I think he says more or less:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m usually advocating for undestanding deeply the problem and being an expert in the matter, not in the tools that solve it that come and go quickly. But in reality it&#x27;s ok to be learn the tool, as it also brings you knowledge on the same matter, eventually. It may not be as comprehensive, but it&#x27;s still desired. And people who understand tools that solve the problem are also needed and it may fill some real world needs.&quot;<p>I find it very relatable, as I&#x27;m kinda doing that at my work. I&#x27;m no expert in anything but solve problems very skillfull coders embarrass themselves at. Not that they are dumb. They are smarter than me, more expierienced as well. But they often lack a wider view of the issue, don&#x27;t take account so many things. The OS in their code, neglect the existance of network, delays, assume weird things about how other software work and so on. The almost always neglect that people just lie sometimes or will fight to death to prove they tested corectly while I know they made trivial mistakes while testing. All people do. I just verify that once more. Sometimes coders ask me (after I help them with an issue) what apps do I code at our company, while I don&#x27;t code at all. It would take me a year to Hello World using company internal standards. I just troubleshoot a lot. I know options. I read what you guys write here and try to understand what problems you have or don&#x27;t have when using different aproaches. So I can suggest new ways of debugging, solving issues, simplifying things.<p>I like my job. Except for the part when developers lie to me, but in general it&#x27;s a cool job ;)')
