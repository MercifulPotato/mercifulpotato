To put such a controversial feature, and present it as &quot;this is the truth, just how it is&quot;, without even mentioning that it&#x27;s just an opinion and a lot of people have a completely opposite one, and both for good reasons. That just makes me distrust this guide because it is so opinionated and subjective.')
