(Second time was &quot;shame on me&quot;).<p>One problem was that he worked with a lot of H1-B coworkers.  So management would push, and they feared for their ability to stay in the country, and when he got there, people would just just suck it up.  His first day, calls at 1am 2am 3am.  He left.<p>So a year later they cajoled and talked him into another job.  He was given assurances and when he got there, basically the same culture slapped him in the face again.  sigh.')
