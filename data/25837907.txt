I see hypocrisy all around. I think the capitol protests should not have happened, and the people who participated in them should be held accountable.<p>I agree with you that the capitol riots and the summer riots are incomparable. The summer riots were much worse, lasted longer, targeted innocents rather than political institutions, were widely excused and often promulgated by the newsmedia and politicians, are still talked about as if they were just, continually avoid criticism by cowardly saying that such points are a &quot;distraction&quot; in the face of things like the capitol riots, and use dishonest sleights of hand like the changing of language from &quot;riot&quot; to &quot;attack&quot; to gaslight.')
