If the error is at least detectable at the time of a read, your protection worked. What&#x27;s scary is a triple-flip event. Most of those will still look like corrupted data, but if it happens to flip into looking like a fixable, single-bit error, you&#x27;re out of luck and won&#x27;t even know it.')
