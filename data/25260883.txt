The FÃ¼hrerprinzip is rejected in Metropolis&#x27; critique of Joh Fredersen, the Volksgemeinschaft is contradicted in its promotion of general equality and its lack of a &#x27;racial enemy&#x27;, and the Judenkampf is contradicted in the absence of an all-evil Jewish caricature, as well in Metropolis&#x27; portrayal of the beauty of technology not lying in its use for exterminating the enemy, the Jew, but instead as being the very goal when building Utopia. The Nazi ideals, the Nazi vision of Utopia, not only does not exist in New Babylon, but Maria and Freder&#x27;s mission ends up casting such ideals and visions into the gutter.&quot;</i><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;science-technoculture-in-film&#x2F;fritz-langs-monster-was-metropolis-a-pro-nazi-film-f9cbe0ff5fd5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;science-technoculture-in-film&#x2F;fritz-langs...</a>')
