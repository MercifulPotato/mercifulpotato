Plus the random little transient wifi hiccups that just happen from time to time.<p>I can see about a dozen other wifi networks in range of my house, so some radio noise out there but nothing crazy.<p>And now that I also have symmetric gigabit fiber, only my wired connections can come anywhere close to saturating my WAN bandwidth.<p>If you have the option&#x2F;ability, wired is going to crush wireless every time. Wifi is great for casual use and I&#x27;m glad it has gotten as good as it has, but for real work&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;whatever there&#x27;s no contest.')
