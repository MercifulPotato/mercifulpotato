Somebody in the 1980s thought that being able to read your order with just your surname as a password was a good idea. Or that passwords have to be 8 character maximum, no profanities or common words, and they can&#x27;t have Y or some other characters since you could not have dialed it on a specific model of 1980s phone. I haven&#x27;t touched a GDS for the past 10 years or so, but they are out there, probably still on mainframes as well.')
