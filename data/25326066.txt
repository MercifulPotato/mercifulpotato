Is this a fact, because I am not aware.<p>&quot;Doctors see these symptoms many times every day&quot;\nThats why it&#x27;s called a syndrome - no one positive indicator.<p>The possibilities of it being crickets or mass hysteria have been put forward before. The authors obviously decided these explanations didn&#x27;t fit the clinical observations, and I suspect they&#x27;re thorough enough to consider that they&#x27;re looking at nothing.<p>It&#x27;s fair to invoke Occam&#x27;s razor if you need an immediate hard conclusion but there&#x27;s no reason for experts to not explore this and state what they&#x27;re finding. The problem is when there are so many non-experts with limited information jumping to the conclusion that this must be nothing but a drum beat-up to war because of the conspiracy amongst warmongers for which there is also no proof.<p>If it is due to some weapon, the operation would be designed to be unattributable. And if it could be attributed no one is going to tip their hand as to their capability of finding out. So we&#x27;re unlikely to get solid proof for any of this and need to follow up on plausible explanations. I said that microwaves are a one, not saying other explanations aren&#x27;t also. And I&#x27;m not rushing to conclusions.')
