Some people go to mandatory reeducation for being extremists. Some people are wrongly convicted, with the prosecutor not having done its job well, and that&#x27;s wrong. But you can&#x27;t compare mandatory forced reeducation (like a super-boarding school for adults), and instances of lazy prosecutors, to concentration camps; that&#x27;s a totally different level of crime that&#x27;s not even in the same ballpark.<p>You just conjured up the word &quot;holocaust denial&quot;. Not sure whether you are implying I am like a holocaust denier. But don&#x27;t you think that such a serious accusation, requires serious evidence? So far I haven&#x27;t seen you addressing any of the actual content that my sources discuss.<p>Again, if you argue whether people should be treated as humanely as possible, then I agree. But you can&#x27;t brush terrorism and the US involvement in Afghanistan, under a carpet and pretend like they&#x27;re not relevant and like they&#x27;re wholly-independent issues. Again: what else is China supposed to do? It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;choice x is bad&quot; without considering whether there are better choices. Has <i>anybody</i> found a better solution to terrorism? Even France is now talking about things very similar to Chinese reeducation camps.<p>Do you also denounce the US war on terror as an equally, if not bigger human rights violation? Do you believe the US deserves the same treatment as the one you think China should receive? If you do then I&#x27;ll believe you are arguing in good faith, because selectively enforcing human rights is how it is weaponized nowadays.')
