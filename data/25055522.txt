Ironically, that’s intended to be a security precaution, the goal of which is to protect the daemon from a malicious user who does something like symlinking their .pam_environment to &#x2F;etc&#x2F;shadow, which is a highly sensitive file that standard users aren’t allowed to read. Unfortunately, when done incorrectly, it also grants the user permission to send the daemon signals, which is why we’re able to send accounts-daemon a SIGSEGV.<p>What’s the recommended way to drop permissions while blocking the ability to kill the process (sure you can mask off SIGSEGV but SIGKILL isn’t maskable)?<p>Also, the wording makes it sound like you can re-acquire the original permissions which I thought is impossible. Isn’t dropping permissions a one-way operation? I would have thought there was some usage of fork here but the usage of `pidof` and 1 result in the write up would imply no forking. Maybe a link to the source here would be sufficient for me (I don’t see one in the article or in the thread here).')
