The hope being that a free and open source self-directed system could be suitable (and thus) compassionate&#x2F;kind to beginners of all kinds and at different skill levels. That it allows many entry and exit points, sort of like a branching of interconnected plateaus and islands. Stepping stones from everywhere to everywhere. Rhizomatic. Cross-connected topics with illustrated and detailed guides.<p>It would be beautiful if it, as well as recording your progress, if the system would also enable you to <i>contribute back</i> to the curriculum, allowing you to create a better suited lesson (an alternative) for the next learner, who now has a choice of two lessons, one new lesson complementing the original lesson. Or it could add a step that was missing. I think some distributed application framework like holochain or DAT would be perfect to build this on.<p>The closest I&#x27;ve seen a modular education system is Ryan Carson&#x27;s TreeHouse, where there are &#x27;tracks&#x27;, topics and courses - which are all made up of modular components that are available and reorganized based on the learner&#x27;s interests&#x2F;wants&#x2F;goals.')
