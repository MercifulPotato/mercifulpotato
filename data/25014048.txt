Why do I have to click 4 times in Firefox Linux Desktop, just to see info on the cert?<p>So this is perhaps why there is no EV or OV differentiation.  Who cares?  Of what use is an EV cert, if no one even checks the name.  Or further, knows if the bank (for example) uses that CA?<p>I think in such a context, &#x27;green&#x27; and &#x27;no-green&#x27; is just non-helpful to validate anything.  Sadly, 1 person out of 1000? actually care about encryption, or even know what SSL is.  Maybe only 1 out of 10000 know about EV.<p>Sometimes I just become sad, when I think of the lack of general knowledge about fairly important things.')
