Generating one is inexpensive, maybe 1 ms to get it cranking.  It&#x27;s entirely possible that looping through untampered RNG combinations until a hole opens is more efficient than scrolling the field around.<p>The algorithm to locate the biggest hole on a 1,200 tile board takes around 45ms and I&#x27;m stubbornly itching to use it one way or another.  But I&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s a more sane solution over shifting fields.')
