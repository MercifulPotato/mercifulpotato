Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603469336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870410, text='<i>Exactly!</i><p>I&#x27;ve been using Firefox for a looooong time -- since before it <i>was</i> &quot;Firefox&quot;, actually! My name&#x27;s in that full-page ad that was placed in the New York Times to commemorate the 1.0 release and, of course, I used Netscape before that.<p>Over this time, Mozilla has certainly made some &quot;goofs&quot; (to put it nicely). They&#x27;ve done several things I wasn&#x27;t real thrilled about -- especially in the last couple of years. The default settings should <i>absolutely</i> be tightened up.<p>There are some valid criticisms in this article and I can&#x27;t -- won&#x27;t -- try to defend them. My own &quot;preferences file&quot; is <i>several hundred lines long</i> and gets installed on my machines before I launch Firefox for the first time because, yes, it makes an absurd number of outbound connections on startup.<p>Firefox is the &quot;mutt&quot; of web browsers. They all suck, Firefox just sucks less. Even with all of the legitimate criticisms and screw-ups on Mozilla&#x27;s part, Firefox is still a <i>tremendous</i> improvement over Google Chrome, which isn&#x27;t allowed on my machines. The closest I come is having Chromium installed (from the Debian package repositories!) and that&#x27;s reserved for the rare case when I need to use a different browser for a few minutes.<p>Mozilla Firefox certainly isn&#x27;t perfect, but it could be <i>sooooo</i> much worse!')
