I don’t think that anyone in the field is concerned that this small-scale experiment will lead to global catastrophe, but it’s a stepping stone to something which <i>could</i> lead to those bad outcomes—and it’s not clear that a small test like this would be able to answer the most important questions that we’d need answered before actually embarking on a global albedo modification programme.<p>Of the various issues already covered by the Daily Mail story, one thing it doesn’t really talk about is that albedo modification requires a functioning human civilisation capable of injecting aerosols to the atmosphere to exist, without ever stopping, for <i>thousands of years</i>. A single disruption could cause up to 0.7°C of warming in <i>one year</i>[0].<p>About the only case in which something like this makes sense is if we’ve solved the emissions problem, but a bit too late, so only need a bridge for a few decades while we are actively pulling CO2 from the atmosphere.<p>If you want to learn more, away from the sensationalism of the Daily Mail, the podcast Brave New Planet had an episode about this last October[1], which is where most of my current knowledge comes from.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1748-9326&#x2F;4&#x2F;4&#x2F;045103" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1748-9326&#x2F;4&#x2F;4&#x2F;045...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bravenewplanet.org&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;a-radical-approach-climate-change" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bravenewplanet.org&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;a-radical-approach-c...</a>')
