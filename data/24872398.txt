They are &quot;in the crow&#x27;s nest&quot; in this scenario.<p>Imagine a hospital scenario where the doctor announces your symptoms over the public address system and then all of the other patients in the hospital vote on your course of treatment. And the patients are voting while treatment company representatives walk around and tell misleading stories about how effective their particular drug or therapy is in treating what ever ailment has just been announced over the PA.<p>Of course in theory you choose your doctor based on the fact that they spent 12 years studying for their certification in medicine and perhaps their experience in treating cases like yours. You don&#x27;t go to the hospital to hear what the other patients think you should do.<p>But even in this ridiculous scenario, the other patients can be sincere in their desire that you get better, and so will passionately advocate for vendor X&#x27;s treatment if they believe that vendor X has the best treatment.<p>And as a result, your care stops being about finding the right treatment to a disease or condition, and becomes convincing the largest number of patients that an answer could be the right answer.<p>From my perspective, living as I do in California for many years, my perspective is that I don&#x27;t think the people of California are well served by this state of affairs.')
