I&#x27;d say somewhere after Assassins Creed 2 they tried to portray the 2 factions mostly as political factions favoring a type of rule. The insurgent&#x2F;partisan&#x2F;kinda communist vs the aristocratic&#x2F;oligarchic. I think only in AC1 they actually portrayed the Assassins as good guys because they took the most simplistic look and even then the problem was rotting in the core of their order. Later on they increased the alien&#x2F;old race bullshit which doesn&#x27;t really make sense for the series as a whole and now it really just seems like they want to create an action adventure game in various settings and sprinkle some backstory on top')
