I got Covid relatively early in the US, late March &#x2F; April. I was quite sick for most of a month. The weird part is that a low grade fever and other symptoms persisted for months and would come and go for weeks at a time, almost always tied to visits to a grocery store (happened three times, about ~5-7 days after visiting a grocery store, which was my primary exposure to such spreader environments). It felt like the virus being topped up, rebooted. To put it into perspective, I haven&#x27;t had the flu in 20 years and never get sick for more than 2-3 days in a given year. My immune system seemed unable to kick Covid.<p>It took six months to feel back to mostly normal after the worst initial month of symptoms went away.')
