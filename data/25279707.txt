To do it properly we need to know how many &quot;young&quot;(active ppl) there are, how many old with lung problems, the rates of propagation in and between those, and probably other stuff. But the goal is to keep the deaths down, and my opinion is that by far the smartest way is to first vaccinate the vulnerable people and those who deal with them directly (nurses, etc.). There&#x27;s also a lot of points about practicality. For example; If i get infected not much happens (i&#x27;d just have to isolate myself, even with heavier symptoms). But if my mother gets those severe symptoms she would need to go to the hospital, if she would live at all.<p>Even if the math says it&#x27;s better to vaccinate the young ones first, i&#x27;d still argue that it&#x27;s overall safer to vaccinate the vulnerable ones first.')
