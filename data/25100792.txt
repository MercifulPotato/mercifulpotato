What worked for me was no trick, just deciding to lean into social interaction more and more. When I needed to I would remind myself that more good than bad has come out of me putting myself I&#x27;m vulnerable positions, and that &quot;no one really know what they&#x27;re doing&quot;, and we&#x27;re all socially awkward and trying not to be.<p>It gets easier - think of the hockey stick curve. Nothing happens for a while, then it seems like it&#x27;s all happening at once. At this point I have what I&#x27;d describe as short-cut mechanisms in my head - where at one point I&#x27;d have to talk to myself and convince myself that taking that meeting or saying hi was a good thing with tons of reasons, these days it shortcuts to &quot;just do it&quot; because I&#x27;ve had that conversation with myself so many times. What it&#x27;s resulted in is me actually responding right away to things, being more open to social interaction, and I&#x27;ll wholeheartedly say I was right - it&#x27;s led to more good things than bad, every time.<p>Hope this helps!')
