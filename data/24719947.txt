High speed trains are a thing already, as are MagLev trains, as are trains that go through tunnels, called the subway. The lack of their success in the US market has little to do with the technology itself and more to do with politics.<p>The addition of vacuum tunnels does little to alleviate the administrative &#x2F; financial challenges of our struggling train systems. Vacuum has few practical upsides and a lot of downsides such as safety, reliability, and cost. It boggles the mind as to how investors are falling for this idea.<p>But perhaps marketing and branding are where Musk&#x2F;Bronson&#x27;s talents lie when it comes to high-speed rail? Please tell me otherwise, as I would love to see better rail infrastructure in the US.')
