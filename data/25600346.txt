Maybe misleading title; the interview doesn&#x27;t focus that much on any one thing. Personally I found the questions relating to being a good leader to be excellent (acknowledging the vulnerability inherent in creative work; using the leadership role to provide a positive grand vision to enable the team to work under, while still being able to be critical of important detail work; an awareness of the vulnerability anyone is facing when bringing an idea to the forefront and taking care to greet the idea with openness.)')
