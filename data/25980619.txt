Item(by='sebastien_b', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612114507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978916, text='You &quot;not caring&quot; shouldn&#x27;t mean that everyone else should, or need to &#x27;put up&#x27; with someone else being abusive. I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to put up with someone else&#x27;s loud noise. I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to not be able to sleep (or my kids). Someone deciding to have a party shouldn&#x27;t be a burden on anyone else.<p>In my area, we actually have a legal right to make use of our properties without being excessively inconvenienced by others; some of it is defined by bylaws (ie. noise bylaws), and other ways as well (federal, constitution, etc.) One example: local electric company had installed a new utility pole in a location such that the wires went over someone&#x27;s pool; that family couldn&#x27;t reasonably enjoy their pool because of it. Utility company argued they had easement access (granted by government) and could put their poles anywhere they wanted. Court sided with family and utility company had to move the pole(s) so that the wires routed along property lines.<p>Besides this, doing something this disruptive to other people&#x27;s lives is very disrespectful of others. Of course in some parts of the world, &#x27;individual freedoms&#x27; seems to take priority regardless of any situation, even when it means negative consequences for others.<p>And when I say <i>loud</i>, I mean <i>F$#@ING LOUD</i> - I walked by their house one of those nights, and it was near outdoor-concert-level loudness. <i>Make your ears ring in pain</i> loud. They were down the road from us, with some other houses&#x2F;obstructions blocking some of the sound, and <i>still</i> even with that and the windows closed, we had to turn the TV volume way up in order to properly listen to shows while this went on. I can&#x27;t imagine what it must&#x27;ve been like for their immediate neighbours.<p>As someone else here stated (they had lived in Japan), they could&#x27;ve easily have rented out a space somewhere to do this, that wouldn&#x27;t have bothered anyone. Hell, even used their own basement instead - the properties had postage stamp-sized backyards, which could accommodate 15-20, <i>maybe</i> 25 people comfortably; they actually would&#x27;ve had more space in their basement to do it.')
