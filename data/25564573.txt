So if you go down a slope while the board is full, it can decide to shut down and let you bomb down that hill. Which sounds like an insane pitfall.<p>Or what happens if the board loses its connection to the remote ? I would hope that it brakes progressively but similarly it just does nothing .. so up to you to find a way to stop.<p>It is such a weird blind spot to have. I don&#x27;t think a car manufacturer would ship a product with this kind of blind spot, is that a culture thing ? regulation ?<p>Anyway, fingers crossed that somebody seizes these opportunities.')
