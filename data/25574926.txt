What people do personally in terms of hygiene, vaccinations, etc. is private information and not something people are likely to want to have tattooed on their foreheads.  Something like 50% of guys don’t wash their hands after going to the bathroom.  I would like to know who they are, so I don’t get sick from them, but that’s not going to happen (e-coli infections can be life-threatening.)  HIPPA protects medical information because it’s private.  Anyway, life is dangerous.  We have to take care of ourselves and assume that the other person is not compliant.')
