Item(by='mci', descendants=None, kids=[25208334], score=None, time=1606298973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206226, text='&gt; What population size and density do you need to keep a language alive?<p>IMHO, the answer depends more on the lifestyle than on the number of speakers. As long as everyone lives in a homogenous community along with their grandparents and parents, the new generations learn the language. When people move to larger towns where the majority speaks a dominant language, their children at best speak the minority language at home while the grandchildren rarely acquire it at all, and its death is imminent. Anecdotal evidence follows.<p>* Manx. In 1874: 16,200 speakers (30% of the population of the Isle of Man); in 1974: last native speaker dies. [0]<p>* Belarusian. In 1999: 36.7% of Belarusian citizens spoke it at home; in 2009: 11.9%. [1] Remarkably, it is better preserved among the Belarusian minority in Poland which is concentrated in a few rural communes.<p>* Lower Sorbian in Germany. In the 1880s: 70 thousand; in the 1990s: 7 thousand; around 2010: 2 thousand. Folk dances, costumes, and customs will outlast it like an empty shell outlasts its resident.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Manx_language#Number_of_speakers_by_year" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Manx_language#Number_of_speake...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belarusian_language" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belarusian_language</a>')
