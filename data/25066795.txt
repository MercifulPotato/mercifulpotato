Item(by='_cs2017_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605159281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25063232, text='I&#x27;m trying to use Google Photos but find it hard to manage albums. Like I have a few thousand photos, I want to find all the ones that I didn&#x27;t assign to albums yet. Doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s a way to do so.<p>I also want to press one shortcut key to put a photo into a certain album and at the same time archive it. As it is, it takes several buttons and a mouse selection and a mouse click (with some delay in between), which is super painful when you have to repeat it thousands of times.<p>Edit: Hmm, I saw there&#x27;s Google Photos API. If it&#x27;s easy(ish) to use, could I possibly write some small python or JS scripts to get this functionality? Or is there a reason this isn&#x27;t as simple as it sounds?')
