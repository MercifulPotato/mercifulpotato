The solution is quite mundane, a plastic bottle tax to pay for processing it. People litter and makes processing cost more? Increase tax.<p>They need to figure out ways to reduce this tax burden beyond lobbying. Ie campaign to avoid littering, glass bottles, etc. Currently they wage multi million campaigns against this simple tax all over the world, even in Australia where tax is 10c per bottle.')
