It&#x27;s certainly more complex then a straight popular vote. But consider that there are many many parliamentary systems in the world that have a degree of complexity and subtly on the same order as the electoral college (though the unequal sizes of states does mean the EC is more complex).<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think the electoral college is a good system for modern day America, but I also think that it&#x27;s blamed for far too many ills.
