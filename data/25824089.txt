More conventionally you&#x27;d want finer grained control over update schedules for production use (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapcraft.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;keeping-snaps-up-to-date" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapcraft.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;keeping-snaps-up-to-date</a>) rather than block updates entirely. Claiming that you cannot do it, with emphasis, though, is outright false and is an invalid claim only used by the haters. I bet you&#x27;re now going to come back and tell me how the control isn&#x27;t good enough somehow, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. The point is that you can control updates, and you&#x27;re being outright misleading by claiming otherwise.')
