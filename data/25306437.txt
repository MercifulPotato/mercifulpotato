This may not be exactly true anymore for performance reasons, but it&#x27;s the logical model behind it.  A single set of expressions to run in order &quot;a=1+1;&quot; is a conformant JavaScript script; hence, it&#x27;s a scripting language.  It doesn&#x27;t take much imagination about how to have a JavaScript console that operates interactively from user input.<p>Java code has lots of structure required to write a minimal program.  Java is transformed by compilation into a set of .class files.  Then, in turn, a loader loads, resolves all the classes, and begins transforming and executing code.<p>These distinctions can be muddy sometimes.')
