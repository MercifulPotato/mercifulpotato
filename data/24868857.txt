PII means information about a person who can be identified. In that context, IP adresses are an identifier, not the information itself.<p>If you store IP adresses in your customer database, the information is that a person with that IP is one of your customers. This information is considered PII if it&#x27;s possible to use the IP to identify the person the information is about, e.g. using a government database of everyone&#x27;s IP address. If the data never reaches someone with access to such a database, it&#x27;s not PII.<p>(This is a somewhat pendantic distinction, but it matters legally. Data protection law doesn&#x27;t care about which identifiers are being used, but about the data associated with it and whether it tells you something about a specific identifiable person.)')
