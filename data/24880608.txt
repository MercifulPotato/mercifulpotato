In typescript&#x2F;javascript you have a few options, but none that are any good.<p>In js you can freeze an object to avoid mutation, but there&#x27;s a performance penalty and a lot of hassle. As for side effects, you have the async keyword which often tells you if a function contains a side effect or not.<p>In typescript you can use readonly for objects and arrays to avoid mutation, but it becomes a hassle for nested objects, and it doesn&#x27;t work for local state where it&#x27;s actually ok to mutate things. There is an issue open for typescript that proposes to add a &quot;pure&quot; keyword, but I think it&#x27;s quite hard to implement.<p>What I do instead these days is to separate pure from impure by using separate files, but as you noted in a sibling comment, this can quickly fall apart if people aren&#x27;t onboard with the idea.')
