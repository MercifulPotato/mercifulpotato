We are simply not privy to what, exactly, youtube is doing.<p>I think it&#x27;s wise to heed Guillaume Chaslot&#x27;s warnings. In the same way that youtube exploited (inadvertently or not) glitches in the brains of preschoolers (remember &quot;Spiderman and Heidi&quot; videos? if not, don&#x27;t look it up). There&#x27;s reason to believe these things can fly under our radar and influence adults in ways that are not perceptible and not something we would approve of in advance.')
