Let’s hope Biden will have the courage to do even more about price transparency. If we can’t have something like Medicare for All they should at least make sure the “free market” works like an actual market. The minimum requirement for a market should be that the participants know at least how much goods cost. The current situation is just ridiculous where hospitals and insurance can do pretty much whatever they feel like and the patient has no way to know if they are being overcharged or not.')
