They paid them back with interest, the tax payer profited.<p>SpaceX was also mostly built with Musk&#x27;s personal fortune, after they developed the Merlin engine, and got the Falcon 1 to orbit, only then did they get contracts from NASA, and they actually saved NASA money, because SpaceX launch costs are significantly lower, ergo, in a way, they also paid the taxpayer back.<p>Pretty much most large successful companies have been subsidized by tax payer money in some way, if not by direct loans or contracts, then by taking publicly financed research from the military or academia, and commercializing it. Silicon Valley was started by Fairchild Semiconductor whose first contracts were military contracts. Computing started out funded by military. The CIA through In-Q-Tel put $150 million into 90 companies, including Google. Google Maps, acquired from Keyhole, was a CIA funded satellite mapping company.<p>Let&#x27;s dispense with the rugged individualism. We all benefit from the government, and we all have a duty to pay it forward.')
