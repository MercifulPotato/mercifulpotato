It was used in the V2 rocket and US nuclear submarines. It&#x27;s abandoned tech though and was never pushed beyond 1MHz. If however you have a decade to compute your reactions then that might not matter.<p>Superconducting magnetic loops also store their flux indefinitely, and in space keeping it cool would be trivial.')
