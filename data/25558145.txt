It means the person is dedicated to his&#x2F;her cause. For example, if you read through nobel price winners you find one very strong common factor. They were always emotionally involved in their work.<p>Humans are emotional beings, not robots. If you want to have high performance, you want the performer to care deeply about his work.<p>Biases should not be <i>hidden</i> though! I think that is the pathology people generally confuse with bias. Bias is a positive thing, hiding it is not.<p>This does not contradict the above examples (lawyer, doctor, dev) but rather highlights there are different situations and no single approach to bias suffices.<p>Besides, journalism is almost never unbiased. If you don&#x27;t know the bias of the writer, it means the writer has a hidden agenda. Much better to flaunt the agenda, then.')
