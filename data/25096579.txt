Nothing is scriptable. Their chip might have been perfectly fine, but working with their software was torture. They treat their customers like idiots -- you have to pull teeth to get something as basic as a memory map so that you can fix things when they inevitably don&#x27;t work.<p>Completely agree with the 0&#x2F;10 assessment. I&#x27;d sooner quit my job than use one of these chips again.<p>Edit: Another comment suggests that Cypress has a new, less insane software tool now, that&#x27;s cross platform and can work with Makefiles. <i>shrug</i>')
