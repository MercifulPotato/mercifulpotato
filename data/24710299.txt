How do you know the photons don&#x27;t pass through the mirror? What you are seeing are photons from the flipped alternate world on the other side of the mirror. Your reflection sees you and you see your reflection.<p>In a sense if you replace the mirror with a real reflected universe the same photons will hit your eyes and your perception of the reflection will be identical as if you are seeing an alternate world. That is what we perceive instinctually and we wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. You literally cannot prove it, but that&#x27;s besides the point.<p>When people refer to flipping in the reflection they are not referring to the physical phenomenon of reflection but they are referring to the interpreted equivalent meaning that if the reflection was replaced with an identical universe to our own how is this reflected universe transformed relative to ours? The answer is: Something flipped.<p>In this case what we are saying is that the z-axis flipped.')
