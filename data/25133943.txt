You know when you see a stylish person, even if you can&#x27;t put your finger on why that is.<p>Fashion is a vehicle to sell you more crap. It&#x27;s a maze of ever-changing rules that you&#x27;re supposed to navigate or risk a fashion faux-pas.<p>If the advice comes in the form of rules like &quot;always leave the bottom button of a waistcoat undone&quot;, run away.<p>If it&#x27;s more like,&quot;an off the shoulder design is more flattering for larger sizes&quot;, pay attention.<p>But also: you can wear whatever you want. The difference between a faux-pas and a bold fashion statement is confidence and (sadly) attractiveness of the wearer.<p>So wear what makes you feel good&#x2F;confident. That&#x27;s your best investment.')
