Not only that, but it would be a tax paid twice by developers, because they have to buy the land and then sell the finished development.<p>The reason YIMBYs opposed that proposition is for exactly this reason. It wouldn&#x27;t be a tax on rich people, but yet another obstacle to the construction of housing, both affordable and market-rate.')
