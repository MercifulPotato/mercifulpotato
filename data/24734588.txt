Those employees who built those innovations — could be employees of retailer, or employees of the companies, say tech companies, for whom the retailer is a customer.<p>I think the parent commenter’s point is still valid that:<p>&gt;&gt;Someone stocking shelves in 2020 is about productive as someone stocking shelves in 1968.<p>I would phrase it slightly differently: “the skill of stocking shelves in 2020 has been as efficient as it has been in 1968”. It’s the skill of creating innovations in inventory tracking , better statistical modeling and predictions&#x2F;estimates, and probably the advent of tracking all this in digital systems that has multiplied the efficiency at the macro level.<p>Employees who are stocking shelves have not been able to participate in those contributions.')
