Thousands saw the broadcast live. The broadcast was actually shown <i>unedited</i> later that day.<p>This kind of stuff isn&#x27;t new.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a broken record, but I just do not see any way that you can navigate around this. As for all the Moms (and Dads) who clutch their pearls and scream to YouTube, &quot;HOW COULD YOU LET ME SON&#x2F;DAUGHTER&#x2F;CAT SEE THIS KIND OF MATERIAL?!&quot; Well why are we even allowing that question to be asked? The real question is, &quot;Why aren&#x27;t you monitoring your children&#x27;s Internet usage? The Internet isn&#x27;t a babysister. It isn&#x27;t a parent.<p>People need to start taking responsibility for their own lives. There&#x27;s entirely too much passing of the buck.<p>It blows my mind that less than 3000 years ago, 7 years old Spartan boys were already training for war with sticks, and I literally have a friend who gets offended when I tell off-color jokes around his son at dinner. Who is 22. And has graduated college.<p>That isn&#x27;t a &quot;hallmark of civilization&quot;, that&#x27;s crippling our children such that they&#x27;re unable to cope with anything outside of a curated Disneyland. And the Universe is not a curated Disneyland.')
