So, if one wants to talk about the &quot;relativistic mass&quot; of a photon, the result is (Energy of the photon)&#x2F;(c^2) = h&#x2F;(Î»c) = h*(frequency)&#x2F;(c^2) , which is what was implied by what I was originally saying, and which is not 0 .\nSo, the relativistic mass of a photon (if one wants to use the concept of &quot;the relativistic mass of a photon&quot; at all, which one might quite reasonably not want to, and which yes, does depend on the frame of reference) is not 0, in any frame of reference.')
