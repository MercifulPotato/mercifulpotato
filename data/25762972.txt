It seems like the world is moving towards &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what to look at&quot; and I hate it.<p>&gt; The RSS to email thing is surprisingly good<p>RSS is a great example. I just filter them into folders and read them when I have time. I never miss a post. Futhermore it is synced across all of my devices and available offline (although I wish I could find an email click that would pre-download images for selected folders&#x2F;labels).<p>&gt; I&#x27;m currently looking to put the same thing in place for a read-it-later usecase<p>I would use this. An easy button to send an article to my email (automatically filtered into a folder of course) would be fantastic.<p>&gt; when subscribing to a mailing list, by design you don&#x27;t have access to the archives, you will only receive new emails<p>I think this is the biggest failing of email. Of course for some use cases this makes sense but there are cases where you mentioned where it would be amazing. Even when forwarding messages to friends it would be amazing if I could also give them access to fetch the referenced messages from me. If people are just mass quoting the whole message it kinda works (but is really bad UX) but natively seeing the whole thread would be amazing. Same problem with mailing lists when you subscribe and start getting replies to mesasges you haven&#x27;t received yet.<p>It would be interesting to apply some IPFS to email. Imagine replacing message IDs with IPFS CIDs of the encrypted content. Then when you forward a message you could reference CID+key to share the messages with the receiver. (There are a lot of details to work out but it seems like an interesting idea)<p>(I use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogtrottr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogtrottr.com&#x2F;</a> and am very happy but self-hosted options are easy to set up)<p>Another use case I would like to replace with email is push-notifications. Most notifications I get on my phone aren&#x27;t device specific and it would be great if I could get them via email on all of my devices. This gives a huge amount of features that aren&#x27;t available in the (pretty basic) notifications feature on phones.<p>- Cross-devcie\n- Archived (if I wish)\n- Snooze&#x2F;filtering&#x2F;organization\n- Customizing notification policies (phones do have some form of this)\n- Easy forwarding if desired.<p>I think the only thing that I would miss is the apps can dismiss notifications that are no longer relevant.<p>Of course email is probably not the optimal protocol for this. But everyone has it and it works well. Something like Matrix is probably better however I don&#x27;t find that the &quot;room&quot; organization is optimal for everything. Email could probably use something like that (mailing lists seem like a slightly hacky solution) but I also like that email is based around &quot;send me a message, I&#x27;ll figure out how to organize it&quot; whereas Matrix and other IM systems make the sender do the organization and to a large degree everyone in the network needs to respect that.')
