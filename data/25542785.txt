He laments how size has been ignored by political scientists, and that the pursuit of political unity is actually the pursuit of tyranny. He argues the ideal  political structure is the sovereign city state, especially with regard to democracy. It’s not the best writing, but it completely changed my perspective on government.<p><i>The Book of Tea</i> by Okakura Kakuzō (1906)<p>Essays on tea, its history, and its relation to Japanese aesthetics. Also includes commentary on art, and the cultural relationship between East and West.')
