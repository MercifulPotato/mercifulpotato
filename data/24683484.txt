I often hear &quot;landlords need to make an income too&quot; as an argument against rent relief &#x2F; freezes. However:<p>a) Many landlords have financing at their disposal that renters don&#x27;t: loan forbearance, mortgage freezes (and yet rent freezes are unfair?), etc.<p>b) In good times, the defense for landlords raising rents is &quot;they&#x27;re taking a financial risk by renting out their property others&quot; -- if that&#x27;s the case, then why is it the government&#x27;s priority to protect them more than the tenants these landlords are evicting? You invested in the opportunity to generate income. Not the guarantee. If you lose your shirt, that&#x27;s on you -- nothing prevented you from putting the money in savings or less risky account.<p>This may be my own subjective view and politics coming through, but I firmly believe that if you&#x27;re wealthy enough to afford a property to rent out to the less wealthy, the needs of the tenants trump the needs of the landlords; similarly, the needs of the landlords should trump the needs of the banks. The economy is hurting, everyone is hurting, yes. But why is it the people at the bottom have to hurt the most?')
