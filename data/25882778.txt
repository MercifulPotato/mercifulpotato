Individual folding events (and nucleation events) are superfast but takes forever to trigger (a lot of stars have to align so to speak). This is why, from just looking at frames 1&#x2F;25s apart, it looks like suddenly things appeared out of nothing, but really there were eons of time in between the frames in the video.')
