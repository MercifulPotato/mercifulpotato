The stock growth should take care of that, easily. There are probably like 100 of successful companies in Bay Area between 2010 to 2020.<p>There are thousands of people achieving this in Bay Area.<p>In Europe, the base salary is lower. The stock comp is also lower. If you are a regular IC, these 2 always go together. You would need a much higher stock growth. This level of compensation is rarely heard of that it seems impossible.')
