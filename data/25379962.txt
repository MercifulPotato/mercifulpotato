Video, more-so. Ever listen to Tucker Carlson? His voice is almost hypnotic and he feels like a friend, one I&#x27;d love to punch, esp. for making me think that.<p>Limbaugh? His voice probably makes some people trust him, or build a rapport with him.<p>It&#x27;s all about psychology, just an observation I&#x27;ve had recently. I find if you try to listen to news without &#x27;clinging to personalities&#x27; and &#x27;personal biases&#x27; (not an easy task), you can get more &#x27;facts&#x27;, than &#x27;opinion&#x27;. Sticking to print media from trusted publications is another way, but then - &#x27;trusted by who&#x27; leftists, rightists, centrists?<p>I&#x27;d love to see a media network that&#x27;s all round table discussions - but you&#x27;ve got like TYT vs FOX vs CNN vs MSNBC hosts on each round-table. At least you get ALL view points, opposed to one.')
