Let’s not use this moment to downplay the violence of people who may share our political sympathies.<p>25+ people were killed in the riots this summer. Over $2B was done in property damage. Police stations, post offices, libraries, and courthouses were stormed and set on fire.<p>In Portland, rioters with guns and knives threw bombs at a courthouse and tried to burn down the Mayor’s condo building. In Seattle, militants with assault rifles took over part of downtown for a month, killing and assaulting people. In DC,\na mob tried to storm the White House. In Wauwatosa, a mob fired shots into the home of a police officer. People in many cities were dragged from their vehicles and beaten. Hundreds of protestors and police were seriously injured. Many similar incidents which I don’t have the time to dig up and link right now.<p>There were also many incidents of police brutality, such as the clearing of peaceful protestors in Lafayette Square, which likewise should not be minimized.')
