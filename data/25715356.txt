Since this happens on your device, there&#x27;s nobody who can interfere with this.<p>Further, it also means that you can trust your peers when you want. One default behaviour is that if you do NOT follow a feed A, and feeds B and C, who you do follow, each block A, your client will not <i>by default</i> replicate A&#x27;s messages and thus you won&#x27;t see them. Of course, if you unfollow B and C, or if you choose to explicitly follow A, then you&#x27;d see their content again. That&#x27;s what I would understand by &quot;close moderation&quot; anyhow.')
