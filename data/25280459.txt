Let alone most of the people I see that own a Porsche are 50+, that probably already have a big house and bunch of kids. Those people live on different planet and still they are nowhere near to 1% of the richest.<p>I see most of people are already committed to long term goals like rising children, buying a house. It takes for them a lot of time to achieve those goals. It is the silent majority that wakes up goes to work and just live their lives. All those people that realized, they will never buy a Porsche an what is even more important they don&#x27;t need one.<p>I would say more eye opening would be:  \nPresenting how much of that fake lifestyle is promoted and presented by media, social or otherwise, compared to how many people don&#x27;t care and live normal life of paying off mortgage, being happy about an ice cream they were able to afford.')
