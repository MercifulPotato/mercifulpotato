More and more grad students are investing huge amount of time and building larger and larger radio telescopes just to learn more about black hole formation and the properties of pulsars. Little consideration is given to how to more efficiently use inexpensive consumer telescopes purchased at Walmart! Where are the big discoveries? New planets in our solar system? A new structure for the Milky Way? I sincerely hope that the Julia language will allow us to discover ET radio signals, because we all know that Python lacks this capability.')
