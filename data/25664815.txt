I do think that adding slack into the system is an important step in fixing educaction. But my comment was trying to point towards the question of <i>how come</i> there&#x27;s no slack in the system? What ate it? Answer: market pressures. Not some elites thinking a dumber populace is easier to control and wishing a weaker educational system into existence.<p>&gt; <i>A free market in education would do a lot to empower educators to offer real, functioning education because they&#x27;d be able to charge what they needed and compensate their teachers appropriately.</i><p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing completely, but I have many concerns about this view. Free market is good at optimizing for behaviors that yield immediate, short-term profit. Good education is very hard to price, with profits following the actions by many decades. I fully expect that making education governed by the market directly would make it settle on even stranger proxies in lieu of delivering proper education. On top of that, free market for commodity labor doesn&#x27;t equal happy labor, but rather unhappy labor living on minimum wage.')
