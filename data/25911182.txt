No bipartisan election committee is going to buy their stuff anymore when it is an article of unshakable faith among one of the two parties that their machines fraudulently stole an election.<p>So now their owners[1] need to figure out how to get whatever value they can.  This isn&#x27;t a &quot;campaign&quot;, it&#x27;s just a business effort.  They&#x27;ve been transformed into something like an IP holding company, where the IP is the damage suffered by the original outfit.  They&#x27;ll sue everyone they can.<p>(They&#x27;ll also probably manage to recoup some value by selling what&#x27;s left of the company to someone else who then rebrands them and tries to sell back into the markets that have been poisoned.  Something very similar happened with Diebold a decade ago, which was then sold to ES&amp;S and thence to, yes, Dominion.)<p>[1] No idea how they&#x27;re structured, but per wikipedia they&#x27;re a private corporation.')
