It takes a child 6 to 10 years to get fluent in their first language, and they don&#x27;t spend 3 hours per week studying it, but 80. For adults, there are language schools with an immersive program. They are expensive, but successful. You probably won&#x27;t get as good as when you&#x27;d have been immersed from day 1 in your life, but you can get quite far.<p>&gt; This may not be the best way to prove the thesis conclusively.<p>It certainly isn&#x27;t. For starters, it does not provide a comparison to normal language.<p>&gt; The researchers saw little to no response to code in the language regions of the brain<p>And I say: screw that logic. It&#x27;s faulty beyond comprehension. That a brain region doesn&#x27;t light up doesn&#x27;t mean anything. It could even mean their scanner was broken.')
