I always assumed, for some reason, that it was an incremental upgrade in sound+ANC, but more of a major upgrade in hardware dept. Never tried XM4 myself though, so that is purely from hearing people talking about it, not actually testing the device myself.<p>If you confirm that ANC is actually significantly better than on XM3 (which I already liked a lot anyway), then now I know what I will be upgrading to, in case Airpods Max end up not delivering on their promise :)')
