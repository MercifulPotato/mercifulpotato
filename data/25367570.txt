Sure it measure output in some fashion, but is a pretty fallible proxy for the real thing we’re after: knowledge.<p>But the question remains. There’s so many books and only so much time. For myself after years of taking a haphazard approach (bill gates list, stuff recommended on blogs, economist books&#x2F;arts,etc) I’ve been working on a new strategy for the past few years and it feels like it’s working out well.<p>There is a 10-year reading plan for the “Great Books of the Western World. Within each year the books progress chronologically, and each year supposedly gets a bit more difficult.<p>Using that as a baseline does a few useful things for me.<p>- I never need to figure out what book is next.<p>- I can be reasonably confident that reading the books won’t be a waste; even if I don’t dig a particular book it provides context since, it being an important book, it likely influenced others.<p>- related to the above, I feel like reading the classic books gives me a better understanding new books; either because of a direct reference by the author or because the author is trying to dress up a not-so-original idea.<p>Of course the Great Books are not the be-all and end-all of human knowledge, so I make space for modern books, eastern books, etc. for that it’s as haphazard as before, the only difference is I’m more comfortable about skimming a book in(preface, conclusion, index, ToC, random chapter) and tossing it away if it doesn’t jump out at me.<p>I’ve actively worked on getting better at this. Excited to see other comments in this thread.<p>Also I recommend underlining and making notes in a book. This way when you go back to it you can engage with the ideas more efficiently.<p>EDIT: I also want to plug “how to read a book” which I feel like I do a lot on here. Really really good')
