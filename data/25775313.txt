The encapsulation is great, of course, but it was already possible to have &quot;reusable components&quot; back in the jQuery days and before.<p>All the WebComponents usage I&#x27;ve seen professionally lately were wrapping React&#x2F;Vue or using some other lightweight framework that does something similar.<p>Not saying WCs are bad tech: just saying I think there are some great ideas in Vue&#x2F;React that still don&#x27;t have a native API. Would LOVE to see a new version of WebComponents adopting some of those ideas (only the good ones though haha)!')
