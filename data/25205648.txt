If you ended up out with one of those other girls and a goth girl swipes back and you miss that opportunity are you still happy.  Plus you waste an evening to beef up your goth profile to attract all 5.  You could be using the time to research what areas have more goths and move.<p>If you want any girl, swipe everyone.  In that case why not use the money you were planning on impressing this girl and just hire a girl for the evening.  Your odds&#x2F;costs will be less and relationship prospects about the same.<p>Let&#x27;s say you swipe, find success and meet this person. \nGetting to that hook up finish will take much more legwork compared to if you are prequalified.<p>For job prospectives I find if I do that (apply to every job) you end up wasting a lot of time and energy in low chance opportunities or high chance but low quality opportunities.   It worked when I first started but didn&#x27;t work out so well after 15 years of experience.')
