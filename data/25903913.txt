Rust maintains a small but high quality standard library in part to avoid the problems that Python&#x27;s standard library fell into. Things like cli parsers can be downloaded easily using cargo&#x27;s amazing tooling. We get packages like structopt for example, which provides a custom derive parsing command line arguments:<p><pre><code>   #[derive(StructOpt)]\n   struct Opt {\n       #[structopt(short, long)]\n       debug: bool,\n    \n       #[structopt(short = &quot;c&quot;, long)]\n       nb_cars: Option&lt;i32&gt;,\n    \n       #[structopt(short, long)]\n       level: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n   }</code></pre>')
