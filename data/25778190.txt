I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Intel makes a comeback eventually. It&#x27;s not a huge deal to me who&#x27;s in the lead at any given time, I&#x27;m more interested in competitive CPUs.<p>I&#x27;m most interested in the future of x86 as a whole. It&#x27;s definitely got a while left, but I wonder how much market share will start to be taken by ARM (and hopefully RISCV).')
