You&#x27;re misunderstanding how the edition mechanism works. Each compiler knows how to turn source code of any given edition into the same internal IR, but that&#x27;s purely internal. You still cannot compile an rlib with Rust compiler version 1.X and use it in a program compiled with Rust compiler version 1.Y. You <i>can</i> compile an rlib with Rust compiler version 1.Z that uses edition 2015 and use it in a program compiled with Rust compiler version 1.Z that uses edition 2018.')
