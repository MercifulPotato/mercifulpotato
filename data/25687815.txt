It had some cool stuff but it’s mostly waiting in line and being uncomfortable wearing a mask constantly.<p>The ocean and sun did. We drove out to the coast and spent a few days at the beach. I saw the ocean for the first time in 15 years, the second time in my life I’ve been there. The sound of the waves against the shore filled with me a sense of awe and overwhelming calm that I didn’t know was possible. My daughter couldn’t stop yelling “this is amazing!”, it was her first time. We went to the beach at midnight and she wished on a shooting star. We both got a nice tan. If I could do it again I’d have just spent the whole week on the beach.')
