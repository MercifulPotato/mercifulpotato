Physicists know quite well they don&#x27;t fully understand what happens in every black hole situation.<p>&gt;  It’s fine to suggest they don’t exist, just realize you’re disagreeing with the vast majority of physicists and evidence we have.<p>We don&#x27;t have any evidence, only conjecture and [incomplete] math.<p>Two things that might prevent black holes: Quark degeneracy pressure (unknown, not even the magnitude is known), and time dilation, which leads to &quot;frozen stars&quot; which hover just before becoming black holes, but never do because that last bit of mass that takes them over the edge takes an infinite time to arrive.<p>Neither of those two are &quot;fringe&quot; theories mind you, they have both been discussed by prominent theorists (I also get to appeal to authority :)')
