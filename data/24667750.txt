Much appreciated, and interesting.<p>&gt; The data isn&#x27;t &quot;here&#x27;s the life of Joe over the last 5 years&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;here&#x27;s the life of people without college degrees that are X years old with Y years of experience with X &amp; Y held constant over 5 years&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an excellent point.
