I typically use the command line, Chrome, SQLDeveloper (my workplace is an Oracle shop), and Emacs (usually attached to a Clojure repl).<p>Our server environment is all headless Linux with a couple of exceptions for exporting X over ssh for Java-based ETL tools.  So the match between my dev env and our deployment env means I don&#x27;t &quot;context switch&quot; when moving between them.<p>A benefit of the no-desktop-env approach is that I have found that I typically install the bare minimum of utilities, so there is less to go wrong.  Even installing a big Nvidia blob for my GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER just worked.<p>If you find yourself happily using a small number of utilities in any Linux environment, you might find a similar setup rewarding.')
