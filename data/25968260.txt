Those who can&#x27;t, teach&quot;.<p>Clearly there are lots of people who genuinely choose to enter teaching, but in certain subjects, for some people, it is the de-facto profession if you cannot use your degree to do something else. See Avenue Q&#x27;s &quot;What can you do, with a BA in English?&quot;.<p>This is more about high school than university-level though.<p>[Note - I was mistaken - please see the clarification in post below!]')
