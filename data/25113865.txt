Yes, food companies make crap food, but you don’t have to eat it. You don’t need to eat the volume of it most people do. We’ve known it’s crap food for years now. However, you can have 1 cupcake or 1 pizza every now and then and be a healthy weight. You can’t have 10 cupcakes a day and be a healthy weight.<p>Let’s not discount exercise as well - a bad diet can partly be overcome with an active lifestyle.')
