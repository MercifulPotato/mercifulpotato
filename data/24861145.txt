It&#x27;s also repeatedly taxing the same money every year eventually down to whatever the cap is.<p>I&#x27;d rather set taxes&#x2F;caps at generational wealth transfer if you&#x27;re going to try and incentivize something - might as well go after dynastic wealth and the children that benefit from it without creating anything. I think focusing on housing and land use&#x2F;zoning would also directly benefit more people by fixing existing perverse incentives.<p>PG writes about some of this in essays, Tyler Cowen&#x27;s book Stubborn Attachments was also interesting on the growth aspect (though wealth taxes aren&#x27;t specifically mentioned).<p>Why do we think wealth will be better allocated by a government? This money is largely already taxed either via capital gains or income. I&#x27;d suspect a lot of our problems are problems of incentives and competing priorities, not of available cash flow for government programs.<p>That&#x27;s my take anyway, I suspect a &#x27;hate the rich&#x27; motivated reasoning position pushing the idea of a wealth tax more than any serious thinking about incentives and what it might do. It seems political.<p>(I am nowhere near the level where the proposed tax would start and probably never will be.)')
