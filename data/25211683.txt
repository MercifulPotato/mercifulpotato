IPFS can serve streaming video, and host massive archives like Wikipedia.<p>Also, Freenet actively seeks out data from the network to store locally, to give plausible deniability to users (there&#x27;s no way to tell if something is locally cached because the user requested it, or whether the client fetched it automatically). IIRC this can be disabled by limiting oneself to a whitelist of peers (preventing network chatter that might reveal Freenet&#x27;s presence). IPFS will only cache what&#x27;s requested, so it&#x27;s more predictable and useful for building infrastructure (e.g. hosting assets for a normal Web site); and presumably leaner on data requirements too.<p>IPFS isn&#x27;t really competing with Freenet IMHO; it&#x27;s competing with HTTP and BitTorrent.')
