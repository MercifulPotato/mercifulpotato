That said, I’ll happily argue that your language should have something like unwind-protect as an easy to use concept before getting something like exceptions.<p>A big issue with exceptions lately is that they integrate terribly with async style code because they can’t simply unwind past where a promise was created and a promise can be raised to multiple times. The other issue is that they are so pervasively nonlocal that typical code can’t know what might be raised (or what restarts might be available)')
