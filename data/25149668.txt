To match movies as much as they can. Now that I think about it, it&#x27;s probably an inferiority complex (don&#x27;t really know why either since video games have been surpassing movies in raw sales for years now). Hopefully with the success of Doom 2016, we&#x27;ll continue to see reinvigorated focus on what mamakesde video games so great in the first place: the game play.')
