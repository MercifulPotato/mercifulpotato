Medication in those places tends to be literally locked down (initially just for drugs of abuse but recently I&#x27;ve heard most medication is becoming tracked and locked down). Although since the vaccine has to be stored in a freezer, I&#x27;m not quite sure how hospitals will keep their supply secure other than having a guard.<p>Once the second phase opens next year and allows anyone with a risk factor including some pretty common ones; diabetes and obesity, I expect the rules to be bent a bit more and a black&#x2F;greymarket to gain traction. Although, wealthy people tend to be older anyway which makes them more likely to qualifying risk factors.')
