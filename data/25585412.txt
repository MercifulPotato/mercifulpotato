We allow violent prisoners more freedom (social contact at meal times, exercise time, and visits), and even prison cells may be more spacious compared to some cruise ship cabins.<p>Makes me thankful for my relatively comfortable lockdown time - alone in a relatively small apartment, but with plenty of home comforts and able to go outdoors for exercise.')
