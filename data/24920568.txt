I can never willingly place myself back into a large city.<p>there is no reason the concept of public transportation does not include self driving vehicles in many sizes.  already this day we run separate transit vehicles for those with handicaps which make regular bus and train travel difficult or impossible to access. So why not smaller cars that can serve any one in need at any time regardless of where they are located.<p>one of the most common traits in any recently freed or booming economy is the personal vehicle and for good reason. it offers the means to travel where and when you want to not be trapped in one location.')
