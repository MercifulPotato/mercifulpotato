The language should be feature-complete enough to provide built-in unit testing with mocking of everything under the sun (including static methods etc) - if you can provide APIs to operate on XML and obscure X.509 formats, you damn well can provide APIs and syntactic support to make modern unit testing possible and well-supported.<p>As it stands, the necessity to relax members to `public` all over the place drives a giant bulldozer through any remaining delusions that Java is a language where actual OOP can be achieved.')
