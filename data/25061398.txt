But if you&#x27;re just working a W-2 job, have stable income, and live within your means, then the only &quot;reasonable&quot; debt to have is a mortgage and _maybe_ a car payment.<p>Plenty of people use debt wrong and that&#x27;s why it gets a bad rep. Poor communities are often not taught proper financial management and may use credit card balances and payday loans because they believe that&#x27;s what necessary to survive. Even though in the end, they are handing over a sizeable chunk of their modest income for no good reason.<p>Middle-class people wind up in bankruptcy because they use debt to fund luxury purchases that they didn&#x27;t need and arguably couldn&#x27;t afford. (Cars, boats, McMansions, etc).')
