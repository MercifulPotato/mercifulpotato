MMO people are usually on the short end when IQ and social IQ were distributed.<p>I was complaining in guild chat about I&#x27;m sick of people who don&#x27;t wear masks on public transport.\nAnd the silly person claims that you have the right to not wear a mask.\nI&#x27;m thinking, &quot;you dumb b.... you have the right to infect other people potentially killing them?&quot;\nThen 3 people &quot;stood up&quot; saying that masks aren&#x27;t effective.<p>YES MASKS ARE FUCKING EFFECTIVE - WEAR THEM! ffs<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if they filter 100% or 75% if everyone on the bus&#x2F;train&#x2F;etc wears a mask the risk is a lot lower to get infected than if no one wears a mask.<p>Then the silly person said that the virus is a lot smaller than what a mask can filter... always the same lies. Well how the fuck is that virus transported?<p>I hate when people are uneducated and stupid and refuse to learn and think they know it all. Usually you can ignore those but in public transport you have to deal with them EVERY FUCKING DAY. And fight with them to wear a mask.\nEspecially teens act like you don&#x27;t exist when you tell them to wear the fucking mask. Some people are friendly and say thanks, some don&#x27;t have money to afford masks and I give them one of mine.<p>She also claimed &quot;you know when you&#x27;re infected&quot; NO you fucking DON&#x27;T know when you&#x27;re infected. That&#x27;s the whole fucking point of this pandemic and the lockdowns (you stupid c...).<p>Governments should distribute masks for free. And not just the nurse masks but FFP2 or better. What are we paying up to 70% of our income for (in most EU countries)?\nIn Germany as a single, un-married person about 50% is robbed from you by the state, so you earn let&#x27;s say 5k&#x2F;m 2.5k is stolen by the state and on the rest you even have to pay VAT of 19%. And they don&#x27;t want to produce or distribute masks to people? Instead they gave you up to 9k one time if you were self-employed or an entrepreneur and ONLY if you spend that money on your expenses.<p>And now they want to do away with encryption after they already effectively criminalized hosting companies with Article 17 (ex Article 13).<p>You ask me why I&#x27;m mad? Because the corruption in the EU and worldwide, because 99% own 1% of all money and some people barely have enough to eat while the bureaucrats throw away OUR MONEY with 10k-15k€&#x2F;m wages and ridiculous expenses like moving from Brussels to Strasbourg and back each month costing 180m€. But they can&#x27;t afford to supply the population with masks? Why am I mad? Because the heap of shit that stinks to heaven.\nAnd don&#x27;t get me started on climate change. So a few assholes have bigger numbers on their accounts with money they can never spend in their whole life we&#x27;re killing our base, polluting us and our environment.<p>Society is sick and corrupt.<p>China, an autocratic regime has eliminated COVID19. Of all governments, China. While Mr. Orange Dickfarts refuses to leave his seat in the US and claims &quot;there is no virus the election was a lie&quot;. WTF<p>WTF?!?<p>A few days ago I read we&#x27;ve passed the point of no return, irreversible damages to the climate have happened and we can&#x27;t do anything about it anymore. No matter what we do we&#x27;re fucked. We knew it 30 years ago and nothing was done and we know it now and nothing is being done. Are you calling a few windmills something? Are you saying E-Cars will change that?<p>Time to learn Chinese, if only it wasn&#x27;t so damn complicated to learn')
