For example 2d&#x2F;ui&#x2F;gui engines don&#x27;t render detalized vector shapes (like glyphs)  from scratch every frame - glyphs rasterized to pixels, pixels stored to cache and used for subsequent rendering until zoom changes. And if you cache pixels for each 2x zoom level you just need to downsample next zoom level whan user changes zoom or resizes object (which is very fast comparing to rendering from scratch)')
