There is a heavily armed, deeply mistrustful subculture in this country that has been TRAINED by its leaders (including most of the now-minority party) that it is going to need to overthrow the government someday.<p>And they tried.  Last Wednesday.  What happens when they succeed?<p>Now, to be fair: I don&#x27;t think guns (as machines) are the core problem here.  Removing the guns doesn&#x27;t remove the domestic terrorists.  But nonetheless gun <i>culture</i> is part and parcel of the right wing terror we just saw, and that needs to be fixed.')
