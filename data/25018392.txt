We can’t trust anything!”<p>Rather, it’s how much is fraudulent.<p>For example, if I spend $1m and $10k was fraud clicks, I might be ok with that. Sure not ideal, but if I still got great results with $990k, the overall campaign still did good.<p>How do you know how much is fraudulent? Just look at your internal data. If Facebook says it delivered 100 clicks, but you only see 10 show up that is something to investigate. But if you see 90ish, move on with your life.<p>Part of being in tech is not worrying about edge cases too much.  (Unless you are in security or reliability or something where that’s crucial). Otherwise you’d never get anything done.')
