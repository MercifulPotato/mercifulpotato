Once you get over the initial hassle (getting used to the Emacs+SLIME tool chain and learning to read the compiler diagnostics) it really gives you the productivity of Python with the performance of C++.  And a lot of that performance is thanks to the tireless effort of the SBCL developers, who have been churning out a new release every few months for the last decades.<p>Kudos to all SBCL contributors!')
