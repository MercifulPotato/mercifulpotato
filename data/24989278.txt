Item(by='ovi256', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604499734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988953, text='&gt; why it isn&#x27;t talked about more<p>Because reducing energy use reduces quality of life at constant dollar income (at least medium term), and reduces economic growth (energy&#x27;s an input in all economic activities), with all the social negative consequences that produces. It&#x27;s a third rail, politically. No one&#x27;s going to get elected by saying &quot;your children have to live worse than you&quot;.<p>The Western world is already (slowly, over decades) reducing this (look at per capita energy use dropping nicely since the 90s), and there&#x27;s significant pushback even at this rate (gillets jaunes, cost of living protests). All future energy use growth is elsewhere (Africa, China, India) with no plans to stop and if the Western world tries to impose their views on them, it&#x27;ll look a lot like neocolonialism for environmental reasons.')
