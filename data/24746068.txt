However, there are a few cycles of time mentioned in Hinduism, which consists of several iterations of such &quot;Kalpa&quot;-s. First one of them is referred as &quot;One Month of Brahma&quot;, which consists of 30 Kalpas and successive dissolution phases. Each Kalpa in the series are distinctly identified by different names. Current &quot;Kalpa&quot; is referred to as &quot;Sweta-Baraha&quot;, next one will be &quot;Neel-Lohita&quot;. Combining 12 such &quot;Months of Brahma&quot;, one year of Brahma is formed. 100 such years of &quot;Brahma&quot; is called as a &quot;Maha-Kalpa&quot;. Length of a Maha-Kalpa is almost 310 Trillions years. 8000 such &quot;Maha-Kalpa&quot;-s form one &quot;Yuga of Brahma&quot;, whose length is 2.4 Quintillion years. There are other greater cycles whose lengths are 22.3 Sextillion years, 670 Sextillion years and 201 Septillion years respectively.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legendofbharatbarsha.home.blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;detailed-history-of-time&#x2F;#beyond" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legendofbharatbarsha.home.blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;detailed-h...</a><p>Scientists really should read the Vedas.')
