Basically, I grew up in USA as a Canadian Citizen cause parents moved to USA when I was young. Lived in a really bad area of Michigan from childhood to adulthood. I now finally live in Quebec away from that dreaded past. Yah life isn&#x27;t worth living as my other comments somewhat explain.<p>In Canada I haven&#x27;t had success getting surgeries coverage for fixing either my voice or face from what characteristics people gender me. I tried for a few years to get coverage and even appealed my insurance&#x27;s decision against my psychiatrist&#x27;s letter saying the surgeries are medically necessary. I went to a surgeon that&#x27;s the head surgeon for the surgeries transwomen get and he said none of his colleagues understand Gender Dysphoria to know why the surgeries should be medically necessary. The public insurance only cares about the surgeon&#x27;s opinion.<p>So I&#x27;ve basically given up on coverage. I find it even more irritating nowadays since I&#x27;ve read about the common cancers when I was diagnosed. Women that get breast cancer have no problems getting full coverage for breast reconstruction under the public insurance. I think that obviously should be a thing but it feels like added sting to my situation since I&#x27;ve not even had success with breasts from HRT by starting after puberty.<p>Anyway I tried enough I think and worked hard, but life just never wanted things to work out. I think I&#x27;m just cursed in life so MAiD makes sense.
