I think the only theoretical security risk here would be that Ubiquiti could decrypt the traffic between you and your Unifi controller, if they could somehow obtain it. (Someone please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.) \nUltimately, if you don&#x27;t trust the certificate it comes with, it&#x27;s not too difficult to replace it with one of your own (in fact, the page you linked explains how).<p>I haven&#x27;t had the password manager issue you describe. KeepassXC in Chrome and Firefox both fill out my credentials successfully on the login page. I totally agree about the UX of the web application though. It feels like over time, options have become more and more hidden and the icons more cryptic.')
