Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25665362], score=None, time=1609979225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664884, text='&gt; Election offence is criminal offence<p>Yes, there are criminal election offenses.<p>But those are prosecuted exclusively by public prosecutors, not by campaigns or candidates (even incumbent ones that oversee criminal prosecution authorities) in civil lawsuits in their role as candidates. Nor, even when they are investigated and prosecuted as crimes, do they need to file a case <i>before</i> pursuing search warrants as part of an investigation.<p>&gt; Consider there’s a burglary, you suspect a person and you’ve obtained a sworn statements from your neighbours witnessing seeing the person entering your house. You are in no power to enter suspect’s premises in search for facts of him committing the burglary, unless you have a warrant from a court issued to the police to do so.<p>You don’t have the ability to do so even then, because the warrant is issued to the police, not to you.<p>&gt;  And you cannot have that warrant until you get courts start the official process of hearing from witnesses.<p>No, you can’t get the warrant <i>at all</i>, full stop. The police can get a warrant, if you give them information about the witnesses (which doesn’t even need sworn statements), and they think its worth following up on, and they present the witness statements (and any other evidence they gather if they investigate) in a warrant application to a judge and the judge agrees there is probable cause.<p>You filing a civil lawsuit has <i>no role at all</i> in that process.')
