Developers are the ones who know the workload best. It’s fairer to evaluate everyone together and it’s not easy to make excuses for other people to postpone their work.\n2.After evaluating the workload, the developers take the initiative to claim the requirements. This is not to allow product manager or project manager to be assigned subjectively. Developers want to be responsible for which business, take the initiative, encourage developers to take the initiative.\n3.The iteration will end and the development phase will officially begin.
