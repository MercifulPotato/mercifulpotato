And right now if someone dares to stick outside mainstream views this is considered hate speech, anti-XXX, etc.<p>Can we discuss if overweight people should pay more for sits in a plane? Can we discuss if a trans male who identifies herself to be a woman should be allowed to take part in female sport competition (box, running)? I am afraid we no longer can discuss such &quot;uncomfortable&quot; topics because starting such discussion of Facebook or Twitter leads to being &quot;flagged&quot;, shadow-banned, because this is hate speech or something-foby or hurts someone&#x27;s feeling.<p>I see this as a problem as censorship is precisely what pushes people into bubbles that cannot communicate outside and that get more and more radical. You can&#x27;t have liberal democracy in a bubble society, as there is no respect for opposite opinion, there is only pushing one&#x27;s agenda as soon as a given bubble wins the election. Democracy becomes just a tirrany of those who managed to win election (which means those who has more money and who has better access to media).')
