It&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to give everyone two doses of vaccine as quickly as possible and vaccinate the <i>entire</i> population, so you don&#x27;t have the virus spreading, mutating, and potentially evolving to become vaccine resistant and then endemic in the population.  We only get one really good chance to hit herd immunity.<p>But - longer term - agree with you - wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome if we had full-viral scans of travelers, international or otherwise - would shut down flu pandemics as well (most of them are imported from other countries).')
