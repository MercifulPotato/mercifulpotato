I think those are beside the point. The question is for most consumers right now, and in the future, are Digital Market Place, Smartphone and Apps considered <i>essential</i> as part of our daily lives. If true, the questions becomes if one company holding 50%+ of market shares and 70% of Total Apps Revenue in a market that has near monopolistic market power requires some form of regulation.')
