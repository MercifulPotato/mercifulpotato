With C++ I only compile my own code.<p>That&#x27;s a very good point, and maybe I&#x27;m being needlessly pedantic by considering it a part of the current (and only) implementation rather than a fundamental part of the language.<p>&gt; We have already learned to scale down from threads and go back to processes for security and stability reasons.<p>Who is &quot;we&quot;? I still see a <i>lot</i> of parallel code being written with threads or async&#x2F;await, and Rust&#x27;s ownership system gives additional safety in both cases.')
