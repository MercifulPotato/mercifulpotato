Before China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea had large service sectors and advanced manufacturing, they had to develop a large working class of manufacturing workers to provide demand for goods, and develop the sophistication to at least make things like toys and clothes reliably first before they jumped into semiconductors and phones and LCDs.<p>When a country is dominated by donated or secondhand goods, the need to develop the knowhow and ability to manufacture anything reliably and cost-effectively isn&#x27;t needed for entry-level goods (since those are all available secondhand for cheap) but you can&#x27;t bootstrap <i>any</i> manufacturing as a result.')
