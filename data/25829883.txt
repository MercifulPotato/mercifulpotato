I&#x27;ve been putting off going to the dentist to have my back molar pulled. I&#x27;ve had this toothache since December but the pain has intensified the past week or so. It&#x27;s a constant low-level pain that spreads to my front teeth and vamps up as I try to sleep.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if I should &quot;tough it out&quot; and suffer through the pain until the molar completely dies and crumbles away? The process has already started and the tooth is a jagged mess. Will the pain then stop or will my mouth become infected?<p>I work at a homeless shelter and they suffer through toothaches, often without medication of any kind. At least I can take ibuprofen when the pain gets too much.<p>Is suffering the dentist of the homeless?<p>Update: Thanks for the comments, they are helpful. I will make a dentist appointment in the morning.')
