I.e.: in one tick you process all inputs of each entity, and put them to outputs, maybe having a queue on each. This will always scale linearly, and you can also parallelise this quite comfortably.<p>In comparison collision detection and AI need to rely on a lot of trickery (and thus bugs) because na√Øve approaches explode in complexity.')
