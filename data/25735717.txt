Even if a horrible plague or even a civil war happened and 100m people died, they still have plenty of people to accomplish anything they want.<p>They have Ph.D. scientists, many trained at top Western universities, who are equal to anyone in the West.  They are doing an amazing job in manufacturing and technology; virtually all high value objects are manufactured in China, and, increasingly, designed there as well.<p>They&#x27;re pushing into automotive and aerospace and every other field.  I don&#x27;t see them slowing down any time soon.')
