And that&#x27;s not even addressing that someone currently or formerly working at Facebook would just blow the whistle at some point.<p>The problem with this conspiracy theory is that people just don&#x27;t care about numbers and facts. They usually have an anecdote (&quot;I was talking about cheese and hour later I got an ad for cheese&quot;) and that removes any need for hard evidence. Hard evidence that shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to collect considering you own both the device and the network on which this supposed listening is happening on.')
