Those who breached the capitol violently should be charged accordingly w&#x2F; the federal crimes they violated.  I personally think Trump is also responsible for inciting the angry mob, and should face the according consequences.<p>However, while there certainly were some riots in the summer done out of spontaneous rage, there certainly were planned events as well.  For example, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in Seattle, which lasted 3 weeks:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;2&#x2F;21310109&#x2F;chop-chaz-cleared-violence-explained" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;2&#x2F;21310109&#x2F;ch...</a><p>Also the 100 consecutive days of protest in Portland, where the federal courthouse was set on fire:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;b57315d97dd2146c4a89b4636faa7b70" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;b57315d97dd2146c4a89b4636faa7b70</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=B8z0jFxOmFo&amp;ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=B8z0jFxOmFo&amp;ab_channel=Bloom...</a><p>As for the peaceful protesters on Capitol Hill, I think they tend to be a bit misunderstood as well.  These folks often get grouped into the extreme right, but in reality, they are moreso moderate people who face a harsh economic reality caused by the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, the automation of jobs, and losing jobs to regulations.  They also seem to be the population most affected by the Opioid epidemic.  However, the left-wing media has an agenda that is increasingly focused on identity politics, and not the economic realities that they face.  Instead, these folks are constantly painted as racist, uncultured, and extreme by the left-wing media.  So lots of them are left with no choice but to support Trump in spite of his delusions, not for them.  So I personally don&#x27;t paint the entirety of the MAGA crowd as the enemy; many are reluctant supporters.<p>But again, the insurrectionists and the violent protesters at Capitol Hill should be punished.  But for sake of consistency, perhaps we should also be also outraged at the riots that occurred this past summer, especially the ones that caused loss of life and&#x2F;or damaged government buildings?')
