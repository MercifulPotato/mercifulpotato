Median size of a post was pretty close to Tweet-sized --- 120 characters or so.  (G+ could ingest very large posts --- I never hit a limit though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was book sized.)  The highly active user population was maybe 12 million (another 300m or so posted <i>at least</i> once).  Volume seems to have been about a million posts per week, for six years.<p>Which works out to less than 100GB of actual user-contributed text.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;plexodus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;afbnvd&#x2F;so_how_big_is_all_of_google_communities_anyway&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;plexodus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;afbnvd&#x2F;so_how_big...</a><p>Adding in the rest of G+ multiplied that out a few times, but likely still well under 1TB data.  Images were asssociated with about 1&#x2F;3 of posts and weighed in at a few MB each, call it 3 MB --- so a picture is worth 24,000 posts.<p>Rendered and delivered, page weight was just under 1 MB (excluding graphics), for a payload-to-page ratio of 0.015%.  (Ironically, about the same as the ratio of monthly posting users to all accounts.)<p>But if you wanted to extract and store just user content and metadata, excluding video, storage requirements are surprisingly modest.<p>Facebook data aren&#x27;t clear, but:<p>&gt; There are 2.375bn billion monthly active users (as of Q3 2018).<p>&gt; In a month, the average user likes 10 posts, makes 4 comments, and clicks on 8 ads.<p>&gt; Hive is Facebookâ€™s data warehouse, with 300 petabytes of data.<p>&gt; Facebook generates 4 new petabytes of data per day.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brandwatch.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;facebook-statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brandwatch.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;facebook-statistics&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;m going to assume much of the 4 PB is system data, not user-generated.<p>2.4 billion users posting 4 x 120 byte comments&#x2F;mo works out to ~15 TB of textual data per year.<p>Values are extrapolated, unconfirmed.
