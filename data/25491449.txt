Reasons:<p>- It&#x27;s relatively cheap, starts under $200&#x2F;yr. It would take years to equal the cost of an equivalent system.<p>- Like most cloud services they&#x27;ll upgrade the hardware over time.<p>- I can log into my exact same workstation from anywhere, on any device and even pick up from where I last left off.<p>- I can upgrade to more powerful GPUs if I need, up to absolutely state of the art 30xx level. The base level has a 1080 equivalent.<p>- It has USB passthrough so I can use whatever I&#x2F;O devices I want.<p>- The virtual desktop has gigabit internet connectivity.<p>Some downsides:<p>- RAM as only 12GB<p>- Disk starts at 256GB (but you can add more up to 2TB)<p>- Windows 10<p>However....there are upgrade packages coming soon with up to 32GB RAM, better GPUs and more default storage.<p>TBH, I have 10 year old laptops in the closet I could use with this that would suddenly make them viable systems again.')
