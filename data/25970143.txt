Maybe even really hard?<p>What if the diffusion of all new ideas, for better or for worse, is just really hard?<p>Please bear with me...<p>How long did it take to confirm Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relatively? How many bumps and bruises were earned along the way?<p>I was just learning about the Eddington experiment [1919] to confirm Einstein&#x27;s prediction [1911] about how much the Sun&#x27;s gravity will bend light.<p>TLDR: It was really hard to do, the results were uncertain, there was drama.<p>--<p>All progress is hard. We have the replication crisis. There&#x27;s misinformation, disinformation, miscommunication, some outright fraud.<p>And yet we somehow forge order from chaos.<p>My optimistic hot take:<p>Truth has a slight edge. On longer time scales. Like years, decades, generations.<p>We are absolutely awash in bullshit. Refutation is resource intensive.<p>But we already know what to do. Run more experiments, share our findings, patiently and tenaciously cope with the inevitable uncertainty.<p>--<p>Thanks for reading this far. Am not a philosopher. So I don&#x27;t know how to talk about this stuff.<p>FWIW, this is the podcast episode that made me think &quot;huh, Truth is hard too&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimruttshow.com&#x2F;michael-strevens&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jimruttshow.com&#x2F;michael-strevens&#x2F;</a><p><i>&quot;Michael Stevens talks to Jim about some of the ideas &amp; stories in his book, The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science: what the great method debate is &amp; how Popper &amp; Kuhn added to the topic, falsification &amp; scientific progress, the messy history of testing Einstein’s theories, understanding the theoretical cohort, Michael’s iron rule, science vs natural philosophy, Francis Bacon‘s view on science, scientific convergence, the Tychonic principal, theory vs experimentation, Newton’s trendsetting approach to science, the war against beauty in science, why science was born in western Europe, and much more.&quot;</i><p>And before anyone gets all epistemological on me, I&#x27;m a Popperian, so you all know what I mean by Truth.')
