The amount of headache saved from accidentally having 2 guards with the same name it way more than the requirement to NOT have multiple symbolic paths to the same file used at the same time.<p>That said, modern compilers just use inode number (and a similar thing on Windows), that covers about 99.9% of real-world systems where you want to build.')
