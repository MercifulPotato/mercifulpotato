In fact, the byzantines welcomed the crusaders and often helped them in military matters - the crusaders states were used as a buffer from the armies of islam.<p>The crusaders did attack and plunder constantinople, but this was after the first crusades ; in fact, a couple decades before the sack Latins were sold into slavery and massacred by the byzantines.
