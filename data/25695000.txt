It&#x27;s not even in downtown, lmao. &quot;killing and assaulting people&quot;. What a joke.<p>But yes, yes, we live in mis-information-hell, so predictably the days following a conservative-led coup were ALWAYS going to contain these elements:<p>- whataboutism with literally anything to distract and derail (in this case, BLM)<p>- false equivocation (protesting numerous statistically significant killings of black folks by cops, VS trying to violently overturn the results of a democratic election)<p>- more false equivocation (implying that storming the nation&#x27;s capital with weapons, and posting up one block away from the SPD East Prescinct with pink umbrelllas, are the same thing)<p>- outright lies that enough of their base will pick up and repeat (I&#x27;ve already seen it in multiple threads here), like, &quot;antifa false flag blah blah blah nonsense&quot;.')
