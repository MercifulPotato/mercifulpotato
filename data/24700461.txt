YAML needs to be reusable and text templates a la Helm are an amusingly bad solution. Moreover, I think static typing is a <i>very</i> nice feature for things that generate YAML since it’s so easy to make mistakes with these kinds of tools. I’ve used Starlark for these kinds of tasks in the past and the lack of static typing has been a sore point.')
