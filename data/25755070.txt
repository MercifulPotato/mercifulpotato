Item(by='ubermonkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610491656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749138, text='I mean, given the opportunity to be nerdy about something...<p>I have a vague sense that the move through 9 and 10 to 11 speed was pretty quick, and that the moment of effective 11-speed hegemony has been long and really shows no sign of truly fading, but I have only a few points to go on.<p>The biggest one is that SRAM has kept its 12-speed stuff segregated. They still sell mechanical Red and Force in 11, and the web site still shows Red eTap (the 11-speed electronic groupset). All the 12-speed stuff is at another tier and uses the &quot;AXS&quot; suffix for branding.<p>Nobody knows yet what Shimano will do. Campy is really on its own in lots of ways (I dunno about you, but in my circles riding Campy is mostly a way to say &quot;I have lots of discretionary income and&#x2F;or a very understanding spouse&quot;).<p>My neighbor is a bike tinkerer and serious rider. He&#x27;s moved a couple of his bikes to AXS, but only by doing some wheeling&#x2F;dealing on eBay &amp; whatnot. It does not appear to have made him materially faster. ;)<p>I was itching for an upgrade on my bike back in the spring, and found the upgrade price for even Force AXS really offputting. I ended up putting Red eTap on, and have REALLY loved it, especially at &lt; 1&#x2F;2 the cost. I didn&#x27;t really even consider the Shimano stuff, as I DRASTICALLY prefer the SRAM cockpit interface -- to say nothing of the simpler install, as eTap is wireless.')
