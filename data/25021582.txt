But those divisions are manufactured and exacerbated over the last 4 years by a made-for-TV president.<p>I couldn&#x27;t help but think, in looking at various TV news channels this past week, that this is all sport. Big numbers on the score board and the play-by-play constantly flashing on the screens. We&#x27;re the spectators, and the politicians are players on the field. Trump played the field better than anyone.<p>I hope that a new president and a new administration can show the USA that the division is not as deep and worrisome as is portrayed. We&#x27;re actually all rooting for the same things here.')
