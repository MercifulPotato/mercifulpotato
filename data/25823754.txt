Statistically, they&#x27;re more likely to commit a crime once inside, so I don&#x27;t want to take the risk.\nAll the black people in town end up going to the restaurant down the street, who had their register robbed one time by a dark-skinned fellow that I turned away because he sure looked suspicious!  I sure hope they&#x27;ve learned their lesson by now.<p>You can bet that as a black person in our town, you&#x27;ll pay substantially more than white folks, because most of us understand that black people have a reputation for this sort of stuff and general trouble, and we don&#x27;t want to take the risk.<p>I really wish there was some kind of certificate to let us know which ones are the docile blacks...<p>(<i>Note</i>: It should go without saying that this is a tongue-in-cheek response)')
