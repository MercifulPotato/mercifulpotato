But they are not done as much and I think this indicates that people make those arguments in bad faith.<p>If we say once a better language comes along, we should say that the old language is shit and should die, then sure keep doing that. But looking at the languages that you have listed above, none of them are dynamically type I belive although not familiar with a couple of them. For some small projects people might prefer dynamic typing, or if you are prototyping something.<p>Also the amount of libraries, frameworks and projects already written PHP is massive so if someone wants to do something fast, why limit people&#x27;s choices by trying to convince everyone that the language is shit instead of letting people decide for themselves? It just feels like a witch hunt to me.')
