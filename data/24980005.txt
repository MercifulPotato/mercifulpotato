Inflation in housing is far higher in “hot” markets.<p>IMHO it makes no rational economic sense to live in a place like SF or NYC unless you are doing it for a while for experience or can land a very high salary job. For SF I would say bail if you are not making $300k by age 30. The only exception is those with no interest in starting a family and don’t mind living in a very small place forever. If you need space and don’t make bank, you will never build equity or significant savings. Real estate will eat everything.')
