With JFK or the moon landing, they would at least try to present evidence and make arguments, however distorted.<p>But if you talk to a QAnon believer or many flat earth people, their arguments do not even have internal coherence -- it&#x27;s just free association.<p>All this being said, I think there should be a strong norm against trying to diagnose specific individuals with mental illness over the internet. But it&#x27;s hard for me not to contemplate this as a possible explanation.')
