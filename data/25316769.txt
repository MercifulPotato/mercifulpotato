Contradictory evidence \ncan be right in front of their eyes but if the programmer already has 10 years of Object Oriented Programming under his belt he&#x27;s not going to flip on a dime and admit that he&#x27;s been doing it wrong for 10 years, it just doesn&#x27;t happen. Instead the person needs to unconsciously recreate a logical perspective of the universe that fits his personal agenda.<p>Another thing to consider is that this and the flaws mentioned in the article exist within our minds because they aided in our survival. These &quot;flaws&quot; were biologically advantageous and that&#x27;s why we think this way.<p>Maybe lying to yourself is technically wrong, but in the end you may be better for it, especially when you&#x27;ve already invested so much time reading and practicing Object Oriented Programming.<p>Does anyone have any examples of their own illogical and illusive scaffolds about world views that they&#x27;ve built to support their biased agenda?<p>If so please reply! I set this post up so that it will be very easy for you to find your own examples.')
