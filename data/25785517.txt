From my limited experience (college senior joining a hft firm shortly, so I&#x27;ve recently been in several quant finance SWE interview loops), firms seem to vastly downplay the financial aspects of the job for software engineers. Compounded on top of that, firms don&#x27;t expect or encourage financial backgrounds for engineers (at least new grads)- the expectation is that whatever limited financial background we&#x27;ll need to work will be given to us when it becomes necessary.<p>Is this because it&#x27;s easier (obviously) to teach a quant engineering than it is to teach an engineer quant finance? Or rather because it&#x27;s expected now that traders will become the bridge between researcher models and implementation, and engineers will simply provide the underlying infrastructure to power these implementations?')
