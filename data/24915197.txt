Is it a cultural thing? (None of the people who are doing “interesting” math care about formalizing It) Is it a technical thing? (Proof assistants and their type theories aren’t good enough?) Are we just missing a big enough “standard library” of mathematics so mathematicians can get to the interesting parts sooner? It’s probably all of the above.<p>What I think might happen is it reaches a tipping point where enough of the pieces are in place to where it rapidly becomes normal or expected to formalize mathematics and we have awesome tools and “standard libraries” to make it good.')
