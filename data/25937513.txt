It looks like they are located near the major truck stops going through the state. That makes sense I guess, but you don&#x27;t pass those places unless you are traveling long distance.<p>I see a fair number of Teslas around town, but I have to imagine they all just charge at home. I know of a single charging station in the area and it supports either one or two cars from what I remember.')
