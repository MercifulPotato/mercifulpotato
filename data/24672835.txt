Doesn&#x27;t even have an indicator for when it&#x27;s done preheating (but if the gas flame stops, that&#x27;s a good indicator it is warmed up). Honestly, it kind of annoyed me at first, but I really don&#x27;t hate it. Biggest change would be a preheat indicator at this point, but even that isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.')
