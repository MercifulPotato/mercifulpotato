I mean, I guess we can&#x27;t argue about &quot;how outraged you are&quot;, that&#x27;s up to you.<p>Do you think those poorly designed progress bars are built to <i>intentionally</i> mislead?  It&#x27;s possible. For what end, do you think?  The TurboTax one seems designed to intentionally mislead. Even if they both are, I still prefer one that isn&#x27;t making me wait artificially longer than the software actually requires though.')
