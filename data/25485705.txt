Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608465996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25477480, text='Just for shits and giggles I grabbed a random book from the shelf and counted characters per column.<p>The book I grabbed was &quot;Spoken Language Processing&quot;, Huang Acero, Hon (ISBN 0-13-022616-5) and I counted 88 characters per line. The book is still very readable, despite exceeding the claimed 70-odd character limit for books&#x2F;columns. Another book sitting next to it (a numerical mathematics textbook) had 82 characters per line.<p>Granted, the limit of no more than 70 characters per line applies if whitespace and punctuation aren&#x27;t counted, but that&#x27;s never done with hard limits in digital documents either, so...')
