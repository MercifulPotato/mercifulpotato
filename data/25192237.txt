Whenever the cell no longer received a signal from the cars computer indicating &quot;the car is healthy&quot; it goes into failsafe mode.<p>Failsafe mode consists of every cell discharging to zero volts through a PTC resistor to keep a constant temperature of 150 degrees C.   That will discharge cells as quickly as possible while avoiding starting a fire.<p>If the vehicle cooling system is functioning, the whole battery will probably be discharged in 30 mins.  If it is not, emergency crews can spray water on the battery and it&#x27;ll be safe as soon as it&#x27;s cool.  Or they can not spray water and know that it&#x27;ll stay at a constant (hot) temperature, but that thermal runaway isn&#x27;t possible due to the PTC heating.')
