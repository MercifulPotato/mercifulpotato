Common Lisp might be a niche, but it appears to be even more of a niche than it actually is when cursory looking at major projects.  Common Lisp (and similar languages) are (particularly, not only) well suited for prototypes created by a small group of well interacting developers.  If you shoot for very large systems, with a very large staff of various talent and experience (and inevitable communication break-downs), then e.g. Java is the safer bet.  For this reason, rewriting a Common Lisp program into Java is not a sign of failure of the language, but a sign of success of the project.')
