Unemployment benefits will kick in, but you and the company are still feeling each other out.<p>After that, you get certain protections, whereby firing you becomes a more lengthy (3-6 month) process with specific regulatory milestones.<p>Speaking from a management perspective, if I have had an employee that has been solidly meeting the bar for a year, I am better off to work with them to remedy performance problems afterwards, then I am to fire-and-replace.<p>Training costs are a thing, and there&#x27;s also a real benefit to not having your workforce continuously worried about being fired on-the-spot.<p>It <i>is</i> fair for newcomers to &quot;earn their stripes&quot; as it were, to show that they can productively participate in and contribute to the organization, but people that have cleared that hurdle do deserve some protection from bad actors in their management chain.<p>As always, I like to hear from others where they think this doesn&#x27;t work. :)')
