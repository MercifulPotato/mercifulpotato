I can name a few startups in my town that use Apple. One just IPO&#x27;d (Root), another is about to (Upstart). There are others as well.<p>The big companies it&#x27;s hit or miss. Depends on if they are working on big enterprise applications or mobile&#x2F;web. Mobile and web teams are all on MacBook Pros, and the big app dev teams aren&#x27;t.<p>When I was last in Mountain View they were on Mac as well but I know that depends on personal preference.')
