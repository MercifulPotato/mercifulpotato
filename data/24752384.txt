When the mental model is already there, changing it is difficult and the trade-offs needs to be in a very advantage position to justify the change.<p>But over the time this argument loose fairness in some direction. Today, in 2020, I would feel awful if in my meetings I argued that creating unit tests is meaningless, as this will point bugs in my code that I need to fight with. Or that QA is a bunch of mean people that do not understand how to use my library and only want to point to &quot;bugs&quot; that is more work to me to &quot;fix&quot;.<p>IMHO the borrow checker _is_ this test that I do not want to write, or this QA engineer that exercise the code to find a corner case when I am causing a memory corruption in my not-perfect work.')
