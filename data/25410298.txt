(I comfort myself knowing I&#x27;m in good company.)<p>Skim reading this, I provisionally label Lyn Adlen as an advocate of monetary policy.<p>As every one knows, abandoning the gold standard, adopting fiscal policy, makes monitarians anxious.<p>Over time, I&#x27;m leaning towards a refreshed Keynesian view: empire means huge military means deficits.
