Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610974481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817792, text='&gt; Apple tho wants macOS developers (and users prefer apps from people dedicated to macOS).<p>This is a very strange argument to make in the context of Safari Web Extensions. Safari already had its own Apple-specific app extensions API, but it seems that Apple decided this was not sufficient, so they implemented the cross-platform WebExtensions API too. Clearly Apple is trying to recruit non-Mac developers with their command-line conversion tool for existing Chrome and Firefox extensions, and automatic generation of a Mac app wrapper.<p>If Mac developers were sufficient for this purpose, then WebExtensions support would not have needed to be added to Safari at all.')
