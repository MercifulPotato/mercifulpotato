Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609869327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648374, text='&gt;&gt; Days before the crash, an employee had warned his superiors that the vehicles were unsafe, were routinely in accidents, and raised concerns about the training of operators.<p>&gt;So despite all the safety failures by the company, just the hired driver was charged...<p>A thought experiment: if a municipality was warned about safety failures about its streets (high speed limits, poor lighting&#x2F;signage, lack of pedestrian crossings), and some kid got killed in a car accident, should the municipality be liable? What if everything that uber&#x2F;the municipality did was within the law, and the only thing they&#x27;re guilty of is not taking <i>additional</i> safety measures? eg. dropping the speed limit to 20mph in suburbs will probably eliminate all pedestrian deaths, should the municipality be liable if it set the speed limit to 30mph and the kid died?')
