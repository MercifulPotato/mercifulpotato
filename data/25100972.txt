I&#x27;ve never been a person who really has &quot;friends&quot; so to speak, I have acquaintances and family, I&#x27;m close with family but beyond that I don&#x27;t have anyone I talk to outside of performing my job. It&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t want people to talk to, but I find myself unsure of whether I can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t try to connect with others.<p>More often than not nowadays, I&#x27;ll get the idea to watch a movie or read a book or just do something, and the idea excites me a little bit, right up until I get to the point where I need to actually do it, and then I just have this crushing moment where I cannot move passed the thoughts &quot;I can&#x27;t be bothered&quot; or &quot;what&#x27;s the point?&quot; To the point where I&#x27;ll just scroll through youtube, looking at everything and have no motivation to watch anything.<p>Anger is the one that most confuses me, because I am fully conscious of the fact that it is completely irrational, but its still there. It&#x27;s always things like people driving too slowly or inadvertently getting in my way at the supermarket, or things like a news article. The big one I&#x27;ve found is social media, I look on social media and see everyone looking happy and successful or even just saying something that I disagree with. But, whatever it is, it just makes me so mad.<p>I’m not really sure what to do, I know I should probably get help, but every time I think about that I keep thinking about how I’ve tried getting help before and here I am, still unhappy, and to top it off, getting worse.')
