Item(by='ccleve', descendants=None, kids=[25139357], score=None, time=1605714649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137655, text='As the parent of a twelve year old, I can tell you that it&#x27;s not so simple.<p>I gave my son an old computer a couple of years ago because he expressed a vague interest in learning to code like his daddy. That really didn&#x27;t work out. But he discovered a great big world out there, and the computer was his window to it. And yes, the effects on his creativity were the same as for the child in the article.<p>So we tried, and partly succeeded, in limiting his time on it. But the truth is, there is a great deal for him to learn on YouTube, and we often do it together. His Minecraft creations are incredible. He maintains relationships with friends, including a distant cousin, through Discord and gaming. He sets up offline playdates the same way. These are not bad things.<p>Plus, with the pandemic, his schooling is all remote now. He has to log on in the morning and jump from Zoom class to class until early afternoon, and then all of his homework and reading is on Google Classroom. No, I can&#x27;t limit access if we want him to attend school.<p>The problem here is not one of addiction and weak parenting. It&#x27;s that screen time is genuinely valuable, and figuring out how to balance on-screen and off-screen activities isn&#x27;t easy.')
