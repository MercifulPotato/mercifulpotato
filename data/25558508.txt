Both in work environments and at homes. They&#x27;ve not been in a shitty category for years now. They won&#x27;t break any records, but they will display websites at high resolution, play clear music, and provide more bandwidth than the link to the internet can handle.<p>Just look at the number of Lenovo&#x27;s AIOs (and similar solitons) in offices.<p>&gt; Full USB-C (or ongoing USB-4) means Thunderbolt which is PCIe.<p>USB 2 is a fraction of the price.
