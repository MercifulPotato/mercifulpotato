Recordings taken on private property or in private situations could be restricted. For example, if an officer comes onto private property without a warrant, reasonable suspicion, or other lawful purpose may be violating the property owner&#x27;s right to privacy, and thus your viewing of the data may also be a violation. A more concrete example would be if the captured conversation included information that is statutorily protected for which the officer is permitted to inquire about the information but a regular person would not (license details for vehicles, firearms, etc).')
