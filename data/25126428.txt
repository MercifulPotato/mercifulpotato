I don&#x27;t believe those should be joined at the hip, because staging and committing <i>should</i> be two distinct actions&#x2F;decisions. Defaulting to including everything would lead to too many human errors and would therefore be dangerous in my opinion.<p>A distinct flag like git commit --all -m &quot;foo&quot; might be OK in my book. Possibly even adding some git config --global commit.all [default|confirm] or something.<p>Then again, who am I?')
