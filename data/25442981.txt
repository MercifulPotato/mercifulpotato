I can have 5 open buffers, side by side, with close to 120 lines being displayed in each one of them.<p>I have a side monitor open with a terminal which shows me the logs of the running application, plus I can easily type any additional command there.<p>On the other monitor I have the browser open, usually with the documentation or stack overflow tab.<p>When I&#x27;m doing web development I have one monitor for the web app and another one for devtools.<p>It&#x27;s amazing. No more fighting with screen space. I highly recommend it.')
