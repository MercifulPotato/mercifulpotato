Hammer is, of course, an exception to this, as long as you call `h_compile` to tell it to use a different backend.<p>Why not use PEGs? In short, they don&#x27;t actually remove ambiguity from your grammar, but rather hide it in ways that are difficult to reason about. You&#x27;re still dependent on code as a definition of the language that you accept, and worse, that code is very fragile in the face of refactoring. Further, the lexical analysis step is generally the source of most ambiguity, and most parser combinator libraries make it extremely inconvenient to parse something that isn&#x27;t a character stream. (Hammer is actually worse than most here; it&#x27;s not possible to use it to parse anything other than streams of bytes, though perhaps it can be excused because of the limitations of C)')
