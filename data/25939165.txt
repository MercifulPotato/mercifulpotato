Alcohol, drugs, and other kind of addictive things, for a great part turn into addictions with negative impact on people&#x27;s lives, when they are a coping mechanism.<p>I have yet to meet an alcoholic or drug addict that has an otherwise perfectly normal life. I don&#x27;t mean &quot;highly functioning alcoholic&quot;, I&#x27;m talking about your stereotype addict. So far all of them have had one thing in common: their life was not headed in a direction they desired, and they couldn&#x27;t see (an easy enough) way to get moving in that direction. After that, any substance or excuse or anxiety was &quot;just&quot; a coping mechanism.<p>Not sure if this makes sense, just needed to say this I guess.')
