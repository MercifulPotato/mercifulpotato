Currently, Covid is attributed to ~2M deaths<p>No, this is an apples to oranges comparison. One is a post-epidemic estimate by independent epidemiologists, while the other is a confirmed-positive-death count subject to contemporaneous political pressure and inability to count accurately.<p>In another year or two once experts have had time to gather and crunch the numbers, the number of Covid deaths from a comparable kind of best-guess estimate is going to go up dramatically. Even in the USA, we are probably missing on the order of 150â€“200k Covid deaths from our confirmed death counts. But many countries have much less capacity than the USA for gathering and reporting accurate numbers. In many places only a tiny fraction of Covid deaths are being accurately reported.')
