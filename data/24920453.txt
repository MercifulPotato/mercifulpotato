Regarding your on point concerns — I gotta share that we felt the very much the same before launching beyond friends and family.<p>Thus far (and, admittedly, it&#x27;s early days), we are growing organically. When people are interview guests for an Artifact or listen to Artifacts involving, friends, family, or colleagues, they are becoming customers.<p>In this way, people are telling us that they can see a &quot;constellation&quot; of Artifacts around them and the people in their lives — and that they&#x27;ll add to it over time. So, we might do an annual Artifact interview with your child from age 9 to 18, capturing their voice and their thoughts, and then you might sit for an Artifact with colleagues as a send off before leaving for a job, capturing that work together. You also might use Artifact to capture family heritage - with parents, aunts&#x2F;uncles, and grandparents, and do so incrementally over time, etc.<p>So yeah, early days but this is what we are seeing. We&#x27;ll be keeping our heads down, focused on providing quality service day in and day out.')
