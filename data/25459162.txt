Anyone working with larger codebases knows that 99% of the time, the code they encounter is years old. It&#x27;s not uncommon for me to stumble upon files whose last non-trivial change was 3 or 7 years ago... Of course other files get more regular updates, but this translates to entire repositories as well, especially in languages where smaller libraries are encouraged. I&#x27;m sure that even among github&#x27;s gem dependency tree, there are open source dependencies that haven&#x27;t seen changes less than 1 year ago. To say these are irrelevant is just wrong.<p>Github&#x27;s search already sucks quite a lot, but for some things it&#x27;s extremely useful. For example, when I&#x27;m interested where my Rust library is used, I can use the toml filetype restriction and search for the name of my library. It will show up way more results than the projects published to crates.io as those projects are only a tiny subset. These projects might not see extremely regular updates, but I consider them still relevant information. I want it to be my choice whether to discard them or not.')
