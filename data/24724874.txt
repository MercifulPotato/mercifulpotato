Period.<p>Stripe&#x27;s core business is being a part of a &quot;credit card sales tax&quot; that is substantial. Much of this is the fault of Visa&#x2F;Mastercard&#x2F;Amex, but that is the problem-space they exist in. Payments are transferring bits, and should be effectively free. If they want to &quot;make the world better&quot;, that is basically the only problem that matters in their space, and I never see any recognition of this fact in anything Stripe puts out.<p>They do a LOT of work to try and make me feel better about the tax (e.g. your money goes towards book publishing!). None of it works, it just seems like the &quot;your tax dollars at work&quot; road signs.<p>Now maybe people at Stripe are working on ways to reduce the tax on businesses&#x2F;consumers. It is not a technical problem, its societal. I hope they are, and they will announce something amazing and I can worship at their feet.<p>Please Stripe, work on reducing the costs to transact online by 1-2 orders of magnitude, where it should be.')
