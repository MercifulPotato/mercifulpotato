You could just as easily make a case along those lines, but both cases would be disingenuous because real life is complicated. Just because it&#x27;s a protection racket doesn&#x27;t mean that it needs to at all times 100% conform to a sentence that you found on wikipedia.<p>As in a real life protection racket, there will always be events that occur in spite of the protection offered.
