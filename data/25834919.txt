How many does it take? Surprisingly few. A few suffice. How else can you read this? You&#x27;re surprised that a necessary number is small? But it&#x27;s <i>always</i> necessary to have at least 0 stable adults and that&#x27;s as small as possible - you can&#x27;t get surprised that it&#x27;s small! Instead you must be surprised that the <i>sufficient</i> number is small.')
