Great way to learn on a little risk free side project, where you can pivot on a whim. This is how I like to learn.<p>Unfortunately at work we have SCRUM teams that practice this methodology religiously, but not on side projects.  One team spent two months building a buggy functional wrapper around gRPC. When asked why- &quot;We did it because it wasn&#x27;t functional&quot;.  The result is gobs of wasted cycles building overly complicated and abstracted garbage, and then further amortizing that over time with ongoing escalations.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to help them gravitate away from shiny things to focus more on outcomes (simplicity, reliability, speed of delivery, meeting needs and creating value, etc..)')
