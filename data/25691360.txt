I&#x27;ve been able to eat 4000 kcal of mostly carbs in one sitting and perhaps up to 7000 kcal in one day, and I need some effort to eat 2000 kcal of meat&#x2F;fat in one sitting (about 1kg of steak).<p>In general I tend to overeat carbs and go above my daily calorie intake if I were to eat until satiety, whereas I tend to eat at or under my TDEE of meat&#x2F;fat and have to sometimes force myself to reach my daily requirements.')
