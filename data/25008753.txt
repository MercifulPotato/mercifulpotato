Ant not only acts like a bank, but also is the largest credit buerau in China. It provides loan based on the credit score it rates on its customers.<p>This article also fails to mention the Basel Accords that Jack Ma criticized. After the 2008 financial crisis, Basel III includes regulations on &quot;shadow banks&quot; like Ant in addition to traditional banks. Is it possible for a bank that has only assets of 3B lends out 300B[1]? No, banks are prohibited due to regulations. But, Ant already did. They created an Asset-Backed Security (ABS) via a process called securitization. It is unprecedented that a financial institution with such big financial leverage and a large amount loan going unregulated.<p>A pawnshop is at least backed by real properties like houses. What back the risk Ant create? Consumers&#x27; credit?<p>If I still cannot make you understand, please google &quot;2008 MBS ABS&quot;. You&#x27;d be surprised at the similarity of what Ant&#x27;s been doing and what caused the financial crisis.<p>I sincerely hope hacker news readers take a look into the underlying financial bubble rather than &quot;Chinese government reaps tech innovator&quot; to which this article tries to mislead you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=en&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;u=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dy.163.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;FQHFENEB0519E14O.html&amp;prev=search&amp;pto=aue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=en&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;u=http...</a>')
