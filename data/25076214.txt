I tried to switch to Linux a few times before I arrived at Manjaro, and it was the perfect introduction. It&#x27;s based on Arch, so you get the most up-to-date packages, but it has a graphical installer and is beginner-friendly. If you can&#x27;t find something in the default repositories, it&#x27;s probably in the AUR (user-maintained repositories). Plus, it&#x27;s just really fun to use.')
