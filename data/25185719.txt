They dont give a breakdown of the stats (e.g. who was on placebo, who was on which dosing regimen\n) but those are small nubmers.<p>I think its possible that this is just noise. The difference between &#x27;60%&#x27; and &#x27;90%&#x27; might just be a handful of cases.<p>They show that it works though, thats the main thing.<p>edit: e.g. of those 130 cases lets assume half were in each regimen experiment. So 65 cases in the &#x27;two full doses experiment&#x27; if they got 60% efficiacy then that means about 26 people with the vaccine got covid vs 39 with placebo. In the &#x27;half dose then full dose&#x27; experiment if they got 90% efficacy then that means about 7 people with the vaccine got covid vs  58 with placebo. So the difference between 60% and 90% is 19 people. They show that the vaccine works but there is lots of uncertainty between the two dosing regimens.<p>Edit: why the downvotes?')
