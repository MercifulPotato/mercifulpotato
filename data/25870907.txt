Both had decent hardware for their time, but only ok-to-subpar firmware. Both were specifically bought because I could easily add custom firmware without any technical know how.<p>By &#x27;de-shittifying&#x27; the product with custom firmware, you can turn it into a much more useful, future proof product. So I can echo your sentiment about supporting hardware hackers, it will actually increase sales, especially if Linux is supported.')
