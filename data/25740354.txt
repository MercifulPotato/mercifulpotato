Even the guy breaking into Congress with weapons and zip ties. Even Sarah Palin claiming this is all an antifa setup to make Trumpists look bad. I&#x27;ll go further (Edit: is this what&#x27;s causing the downvotes? Prove me wrong!): even the ISIS henchman slicing heads off, even the suicide bomber walking into a crowded market to blow themselves up, they all think they&#x27;re the good guy and have (from their pov) great reasons that one should try to understand. And just because you understand their point of view doesn&#x27;t mean you have to stick to reasonable discussion when dealing with them. <i>Some</i> things demand action.')
