Multiple confusing business UIs that you only get between by magic clicks or knowing the URL. Then they don&#x27;t tie together or tied to the personal account instead of the business page or some other random insanity. The initial UI is clean and simple but then there&#x27;s a cliff when you try to do anything more complicated. Then again when I tried to place ads on Twitter it wouldn&#x27;t show me my tweets in the list so I couldn&#x27;t promote them.')
