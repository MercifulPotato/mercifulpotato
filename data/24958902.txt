Not <i>pleasant</i>, but definitely usable.<p>Unfortunately at the time, a bug in the software keyboard and wayland meant that all keyboard input was mangled, so I could never get as far as actually setting up whatsapp and actually testing it.<p>I remember seeing a month or so ago that Purism apparently fixed the bug in their software keyboard, so now it should work? I&#x27;ve been out of the country though, and haven&#x27;t tested it yet.')
