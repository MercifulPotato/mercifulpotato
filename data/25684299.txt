If you want to install more of them, a 1TB nvme drive is not going to cut it. Maybe 10TB either. So what do most people do? They install&#x2F;uninstall frequently. But for those with crappy internet where 30GB take 2 days to download, it&#x27;s better to make a backup before uninstall&#x2F;reinstall. If the backups are smaller, that helps too.<p>So yes, 10GB here and there isn&#x27;t much.. but as a collective, if you have 1000000 users downloading 300GB less per month (I know, silly numbers, it&#x27;s way more in reality), it would make a huge difference to the &quot;gaming industries &amp; network load&quot;-effects as a whole. Plug-in some real numbers (which I don&#x27;t have)(Players X ave number games downloaded per year X ave game size).<p>Other industries like streaming&#x2F;music sites, they optimize their transmission sizes and even small gains are often worth it (10 million people downloading 2MB less per song on spotify, while playing 50 songs per day... the numbers add up quick). Somebody will pay for the transmission - either the consumer or the business. The business only needs to ask is it cheaper to pay a few devs to optimize their code or is cheaper to pay for a fatter data pipe. I think long term, engineering effort always wins vs throwing money at the problem.')
