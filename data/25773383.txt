Every comment and post is public. However, on social networks where you do have that function, a user might have a legit reason to want a video to be private.<p>When you have media that is private, if the numbering is sequential, it is easy to figure out what you can&#x27;t see vs what doesn&#x27;t exist. Using random IDs means that someone looking from the outside cannot reliably figure out how much content is hosted and check for private data on that service.<p>A secondary issue is that having an auto-increment in your database is a recipe for having really slow HA options and you can&#x27;t scale hard either because it&#x27;s fundamentally hard to sync auto-increments between multiple nodes that don&#x27;t leave gaps in the ID namespace or are really slow.')
