Then one of three things happens:<p>- You have morals, grow up and shift into a related career (infosec whitehat or some other computer engineering thing), and optionally stay part of the community, staying well away from piracy stuff.<p>- You end up as a government-side black hat, i.e. NSA, NSO, and its ilk. Whether this is moral, that&#x27;s for you to decide.<p>- You have no morals, embrace piracy, see the money in the business (especially if you also don&#x27;t care for your users and just want to extract as money from them as possible), and join or start a commercial piracy-focused operation, i.e. modchips and such.
