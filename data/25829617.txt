This is hyperbole people are using to grab and consolidate power.<p>If half of the population believes that elections are not fair, it will absolutely, positively destroy democracy.  The very foundation of democracy is fair elections.<p>&gt;Democracy is not a single person that can be killed and taken over. It&#x27;s all of us acting in concert to uphold those values. It doesn&#x27;t end by this person or that person being killed, it ends by all of us collectively agreeing to give up the values that make it work. That&#x27;s the real threat here.<p><i>shouldn&#x27;t be</i>.  People should use critical thinking skills, and not be persuaded by charlatans.  All of that depends on them actively seeking the truth, and we&#x27;ve seen first hand that a large portion of the US population isn&#x27;t interested in actively seeking the truth, they&#x27;re looking to have their beliefs reaffirmed.  When Rudy Giuliani gets on TV and proclaims fraudulent elections, then goes into a court room and admits there&#x27;s no fraud (because he&#x27;d go to prison for lying to the court), but 50% of the population only ever bothers to listen to what he says on TV we&#x27;ve got serious problems.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;judge-cancels-fraud-evidence-hearing-after-rudy-giuliani-admits-this-is-not-a-fraud-case-in-court_partner&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;judge-cancels-fraud-evidenc...</a>')
