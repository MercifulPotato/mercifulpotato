Running any kind of server used to involve purchasing hardware, bandwidth was orders of magnitude more expensive and so on.<p>This server-as-a-service means that for $5 a month I was able to build a Python Twitter bot that tweets the diary entries of a 17th century English naturalist[0,1]. It means I got to do something fun without the overhead of actually running the server. It&#x27;s a small thing, and as I said I agree with what was probably the main thrust of what you were saying, but it really feels like you&#x27;re throwing the baby out with the bathwater through your obvious exasperation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gilbertwhitetwt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gilbertwhitetwt</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gilbertwhitetweets.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gilbertwhitetweets.org&#x2F;</a>')
