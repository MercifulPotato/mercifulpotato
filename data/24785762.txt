They should be able to share this knowledge to other people.<p>With our Lookuq platform, it is super easy to create an object recognizer app without coding. All you need is photos of the objects and some information about the objects in tabular form (CSV, Excel format). Then you can upload it to our website, let the system automatically create and train the model to recognize the objects. After that just use our pre-made app (available on both iOS and Android) to recognize the objects and show related information to the objects.<p>I would love to know what you think about it?')
