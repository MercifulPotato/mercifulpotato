It&#x27;s a fast, lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won&#x27;t work at all. My usual strategy for sites that won&#x27;t render without JavaScript is to simply ignore them. If they can&#x27;t produce something worthwhile without scripting, it&#x27;s probably not worthwhile at all.<p>Honestly, I have a huge problem with this mentality even if I can agree with most other stuff. There is a lot of features and apps that are very useful that won&#x27;t work without javascript. C&#x27;mon, this is a really bad point. It is not javascript itself that is bad, it&#x27;s how people misuse it. Why would native apps be any better? People include tracking and alaytics in those as well and it&#x27;s just even harder to block &#x2F; know what actually gets monitored since the application is likely not sandboxed.<p>I use many apps that require javascript that is really good and privacy motivated. Apps like, Fastmail.com, DI.FM, podd.app etc. I use adblockers and a pihole to take out the worst offenders and tracking scripts.<p>The solution is not to go back in time and try to convince people to use sites without javascript, that will never work because there is a lot you cannot do without javascript. Drag and drop for example, video conference, photo editing etc etc. There are so many examples of apps that weren&#x27;t possible before but now is. The web is clearly the best platform to be on since no one company can block you and you can self publish whenever you want. You are in control, not some shitty american company. I have a hard time actually believing that this person never use anything else than that shitty browser. I just don&#x27;t buy it because the user experience is horrible.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s better to lead by example. Build apps that challanges the modern overuse of javascript and tracking &#x2F; analytics. Don&#x27;t be the old guy that simply complains how everything was better in the past, you couldn&#x27;t do shit on the web in the past and now 80%-90% of the applications I use on a daily basis is web based.')
