As someone who has to support network infrastructure and had many network issues (at all levels) bubble up to them since the start of covid&#x2F;wfh - broadband networks are being stressed during work hours. You can run your own monitoring at home to validate it to differentiate between last mile vs. peering related.<p>The challenge is some of thr broadband networks aren&#x27;t being transparent about it. They won&#x27;t admit to it, etc. Luckily I&#x27;ve found folks in a few companies who are willing to go off the record and explain what is the state of the last mile and give dates around planned upgrades (which are impacted due to permitting delays due to city employees struggling with covid restrictions).<p>I highly recommend getting two ISPs at home (cable + DSL&#x2F;fttx&#x2F;etc.) if you can.<p>As for Corp networks...they should be doing more with providing their employees some tooling to indicate if the issue is their ISP or the Corp network. It&#x27;s a sad state that VPN appliances cost as much as they do (surprise - you could probably build a cheaper&#x2F;better one but something something no one ever got fired for buying Cisco&#x2F;etc).')
