Without experimenter freedom it is hard to make any inferences from the results of experiment. If the experimental choices you make are correlated with the stuff you&#x27;re experimenting on in hard to understand ways then the experimental data you gather is essentially meaningless.<p>To make a dumb example, you measure some system and always observe outcome A. You might conclude that A is a property of the system you measured, but it just so happens that your decision to do the experiment is correlated with the system, so it always has A when you measure it, but it has other properties at other times.')
