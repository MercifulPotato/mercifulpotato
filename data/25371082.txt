I also have ray tracing on Quality mode and I am at an utter loss for how well this thing runs. This is the first game I&#x27;ve played through GeForce NOW and to be honest...I&#x27;m not sure if I need to drop money on a new GPU like I had planned to. I really wanted ray tracing support to replace my aging AMD card but the shortage of GPUs meant I couldn&#x27;t find one. I&#x27;m on FTTH and my goodness even at 1080p it runs at what I&#x27;m guessing is 50-60 fps and looks stunning. There are very rare audible pops&#x2F;hitching when I guess there&#x27;s a network hiccup...maybe once every 30 minutes or so. But I&#x27;ll take it, the game runs flawlessly for me otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m so sorry to hear a bunch of gamers on Reddit are having issues getting this thing to run well on their systems. There appears to be an older Nvidia driver issue that&#x27;s limiting utilization to low tens causing weird glitches in the rendering for people. But I tested it on my aging AMD card in an eGPU on my MBP i9 at 1080p with all the settings turned to Ultra. Even there it runs well for the complexity and liveliness of the city; about 30-40fps.<p>Comparing the GeForce NOW remote rendering with ray tracing against my locally AMD rendering, I much prefer the GeForce NOW version with ray tracing. The game makes really good use of lighting and seeing subtle reflections throughout the game as they would be in real life makes me prefer the GeForce NOW version.<p>NOTE: I went with GeForce NOW because it supports ray tracing. Stadia does not, so just be aware of that.')
