But your claims were that the NYT intentionally published disinformation.<p>The Intercept piece does not seem to prove this, and in fact none of the ten failures include NYT stories.<p>I find Taibbi odious to read, so only skimmed that article. I would appreciate direct links to New York Times articles with disinformation if that is still your claim.<p>Nevertheless, his piece seems to mention.<p>1. The lionization of Robert Mueller by the NYT. I don&#x27;t disagree with this, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this falls under exaggeration and not misinformation.<p>2. A breathless editorial. As an opinion piece, I believe that this is likewise exaggeration.<p>3. The NYT&#x27;s coverage of &quot;repeated contacts&quot; with Russian intelligence. I already mentioned the multiple guilty pleas about this issue, which you did not refute.<p>4. A story about RT appearing over a C-SPAN broadcast, which appears not to be a hack. The NYT&#x27;s story does not assert that the feed was hacked, and contains C-SPAN&#x27;s explanation of likely technical difficulties.<p>5. An NYT story about Russian interference in social media. This one isn&#x27;t even about the Russiagate investigation at all.<p>Once again, I do not deny that the media establishment was breathlessly eager for Mueller to confirm their most extreme suspicions. I don&#x27;t deny that US media relies on evil Russian tropes to push stories. But you are evading my direct questions and requests for information, and gesturing at the tone of Russia-related coverage, instead of backing up your false assertion that the New York Times willfully propagandized the public with disinformation about Russiagate.')
