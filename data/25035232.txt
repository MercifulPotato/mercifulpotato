You&#x27;re innocent until proven guilty, for one. But even if you&#x27;re guilty and convicted, your punishment should be limited to whatever the judge rules it should be.<p>I don&#x27;t see the need for public shaming beyond whatever punishment they get in court should they be convicted. When someone is released after a prison sentence they have a right to resume their life. They did their time, after all.<p>Sorry if I sound like I&#x27;m rambling a bit, English is not my native language.')
