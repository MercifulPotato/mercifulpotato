Item(by='dumpsterdiver', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611339715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868385, text='&gt; A log search service powered by Elasticsearch is okay (again, provided it doesnâ€™t expose Elasticsearch functionality).<p>You speak as if Elastic has any say in how people use OSS. Why would anyone use the newly hampered version of ES when they can use and contribute to Amazon&#x27;s truly open fork? Aside from the bad taste left in everyone&#x27;s mouth from the whole &quot;Doubling down on open&quot; nonsense, all that reasonable people are going to see now when looking at Elastic&#x27;s software (ES 7.11+) is unnecessary risk and legal ambiguity.<p>The disingenous market speak on Elastic&#x27;s blog post was so thinly veiled that it quickly became insulting. It was gross to watch such a shameful justification form on why everyone should be okay that Elastic will continue using the marketing terms &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open&quot;. By forcing a well funded fork by Amazon, Elastic may have just relegated themselves into obsolescence.')
