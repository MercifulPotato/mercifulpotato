There really is no wrong if you like what you hear. </i><p>There are two <i>very</i> different goals that are easy to conflate and that the article isn&#x27;t very clear about:<p>1. If you are a music listener or music producer focusing on making music, you just want a room that <i>sounds great to you</i>. If you&#x27;re making music, you want a sound that inspires you and gets the creative juices flowing.<p>2. If you are a mixing or mastering engineer or a music producer focusing on polishing and mixing your work, you want a room that <i>gives you insight on how the audio will sound in a wide variety of listening environments.</i> Your goal is to get the song sounding as good on as many people&#x27;s speakers, headphones, and rooms as possible and your own personal setup is a proxy for that.<p>For example, if you only have a couple of tiny speakers that don&#x27;t go below 50 Hz, your song may have subbass that you literally cannot hear. But when someone with a subwoofer plays the song, all of that comes out. If it&#x27;s too loud or out of tune, the song sounds like trash, but you have no way of knowing.<p>So the goal is a monitor setup that is relatively neutral so that the song doesn&#x27;t sound <i>better</i> to you than it will to others. You want a fairly flat response so that you aren&#x27;t inadvertently EQ-ing the song to cancel out peaks and valleys in your room because then that will imbalance the sound in other rooms. And you want to cover the full frequency range so you can hear everything others will be able to hear. If the songs sounds great in your room, but it sounds like garbage for everyone <i>not</i> in your room, it definitely is not great.<p>Most articles about monitor placement tend to assume the goal is 2 more than 1. These days, the line is blurry because many musicians and producers are also doing a lot of the mixing.')
