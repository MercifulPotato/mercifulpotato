Item(by='tpoacher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609685712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621135, text='I wouldn&#x27;t call it a clone, anymore than I would call, say, Linux, a &quot;clone&quot; of Windows for needing to have a similar feature-set to appease newcomers. Much like linux vs windows, octave and matlab started life as completely different things, but octave being the &#x27;underdog&#x27; and having a similar enough syntax necessarily tried to match matlab&#x27;s syntax, to the extent that they pride on compatibility (and treat non-compatibility as &#x27;bugs&#x27;), but extend the matlab language to include other features.<p>Now that both projects are mature, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that matlab has &#x27;borrowed&#x27; a lot of octave&#x27;s nicer features over the years too (though obviously it&#x27;s not something that can be publically admitted), like implicit broadcasting, command-line functions etc.<p>Obviously, neither matlab nor octave are strict subsets of each other. Also, I get the impression that matlab has started taking octave&#x27;s compatibility very seriously in recent years, and has taken non-trivial steps to break it (annoying, but totally fair, in my view), which octave has resisted for the sake of backwards compatibility. Ironically this often makes octave a more reliable base for runnin older matlab scripts, than matlab itself. (e.g. in the same way that Wine is more reliable for running Win98 applications than Windows 10)')
