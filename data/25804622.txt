Yes, some institutions have a bad track record and can’t be trusted. Others can be trusted. But OP extends distrust to “every major institution of our society” and then proposes we address the corruption. If your default position is that nobody can be trusted, how do you know that you’ve addressed the corruption? Trust someone to tell you that the corruption has been addressed? You can’t because you default to distrust!')
