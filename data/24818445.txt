And not every gmail user uses the webmail interface either -- many use standalone clients that wouldn&#x27;t normally have this tracking.<p>Also, there is something very wrong when we&#x27;re okay with Google rewriting parts of our emails. How long until they decide to start modifying other bits of our emails? Reading the contents of the email is one thing, modifying it from its original is a whole &#x27;nother ball game.')
