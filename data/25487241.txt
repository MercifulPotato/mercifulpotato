People there must somehow deal with the dissonance of being the best example of entrenched privilege, absurd wealth, sophistication, luxury, comfort. Yet anytime I&#x27;ve been there it&#x27;s all about the virtues of egalitarianism, inclusivity, etc. A jarring juxtaposition of rhetoric&#x2F;reality.<p>&gt; they often justify their entitlement as something they deserve after years&#x2F;decades of not &#x27;living life enough.&#x27;<p>Possibly, although I suspect it&#x27;s more an ego phenomenon. Where they&#x27;re all aware they&#x27;ve hit the jackpot in global relative terms, but they see this as some type of weird manifest destiny and duty where they&#x27;re now tasked with using their privilege to be elite agents of good in the world.')
