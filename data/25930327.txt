Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611765666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25921114, text='&gt; Github provides a very useful project-independent unified UI for drive-by patches and off-the-cuff issues.<p>Unless you value your privacy.  If you take the necessary steps to approximate the level of &quot;privacy in public&quot;[1] that you get by default when dropping into someone&#x27;s disconnected bugtracker or attaching a patch via email, then GitHub is pretty cumbersome to use.  The article argues the case that GitHub is making life easier for people trying to build their personal brand, but not everybody wants that.<p>I don&#x27;t use GitHub for myself and never have, but I used to make exceptions for projects that are hosted there[2].  Not anymore.  There&#x27;s enough toil involved trying to dodge the unwanted social hoopla that GitHub imposes on you, and the returns I&#x27;ve gotten out of &quot;engaging with the community&quot; are so, so low.<p>Nowadays if I report a bug or try to submit a patch and someone gestures towards GitHub and insists that it&#x27;s not just the front door to the building but in fact the only way in, then I explain that the only circumstances where I use GitHub involves for-pay work, so unless there&#x27;s someone I know I can send a bill to, then I&#x27;m perfectly content to just never go inside.  But people in general seem to have a lot of trouble right now grappling with the notion that submitting a patch or a bug report is not something that I&#x27;m doing because it benefits me.  (Imagine working as a plumber, showing up for a call wearing coveralls and carrying your toolbag, finding that you&#x27;ve arriving at a club, and then dealing with someone at the door who&#x27;s trying to argue with you about their entry fee because, hey, this is a club, so they expect <i>you</i> to pay <i>them</i>.)  The only thing people seem to understand anymore is the quest to become someone with influencer-level status, and that certainly has something to do with the culture referenced in the blog post.  It would be one thing if it were just kids, but it&#x27;s something that has infected plenty of old hats who were around before GitHub, which is pretty annoying.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colbyrussell.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-happened-in-january.html#unlinked-identity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colbyrussell.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-happened-in-jan...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colbyrussell.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;13&#x2F;keeping-a-low-profile-on-github.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colbyrussell.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;13&#x2F;keeping-a-low-profil...</a>')
