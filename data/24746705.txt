All of their various SDKs are poorly maintained with zero points of contact. I think it&#x27;s just a handful of engineers who care, working in their spare time at an organization that doesn&#x27;t have any interest in giving them actual resources.<p>For example: their web playback SDK has a provision about &quot;contact us to use for noncommercial purposes,&quot; and there&#x27;s a long-standing GitHub issue specifically about how no one has ever gotten a reply back when they email about this.<p>Meanwhile, when I had a problem with MusicKit JS - the Apple Music equivalent - I actually got a reply back within a few weeks from an Apple engineer about it that helped me resolve it. Obviously not the shortest timescale, but at least there&#x27;s clearly some effort being put into it. It helps that they actually are using MusicKit JS to power their own Apple Music web player, while Spotify&#x27;s playback SDK is a separate codebase, which is why it&#x27;s missing features like Safari playback that are present in the web player.<p>Spotify&#x27;s new mobile SDKs are also unusably awful, and can&#x27;t do basic functions like &quot;playing a single song and stopping instead of autoplaying onwards.&quot; They also have deprecated and killed off several past mobile SDKs that were far more feature-filled. I saw a new Spotify-powered radio app that launched recently (Station Rotation) appears to be using the legacy undocumented SDK for playback because of this - can&#x27;t imagine that app will have much of a future if Spotify ever decides to finally break that SDK.<p>Honestly, I expect Spotify to completely kill their public APIs and SDKs within the next two years. They clearly see no value in them, or they would have invested in maintaining them.')
