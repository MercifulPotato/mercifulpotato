Examples:<p>1.) At an individual level, someone might publish a study on a social issue that&#x27;s important to them, adhering to relevant academic standards, then establish a popular identity as the author of that study.  Afterwards they can comment on blogs, in media releases, on talk shows, etc., using the perceived credibility established through academic publication to pursue their personal goals.<p>2.) At an institutional level, someone might publish a study on some issue relevant to an industry, then use it in political lobbying related to that industry as well as popular press to build good-will.  Many academics have industrial sponsors for this reason.')
