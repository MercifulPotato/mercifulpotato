Unfortunately there&#x27;s still some wastage as you end up having to set up a public IP for both endpoints to allow the routing to be public. (Yes, you can use private IP&#x27;s for routing, but it makes diagnosing issues much more difficult). So then you end up with &#x2F;30&#x27;s used for point to point links, which is 4 addresses.<p>You can use &#x2F;31&#x27;s for point to point if both devices support it, but it&#x27;s still hit or miss whether they do or not.<p>Even when getting a block of IP&#x27;s from providers to a customer edge (think ISP&#x27;s like Comcast or others) they tend to require using the .1 as the gateway, and the others are considered on-link and thus there is a network&#x2F;broadcast address.<p>Your suggestion doesn&#x27;t allow direct L2 communication between machines without sending traffic to the router, even if the two systems are L2 adjacent.<p>Even with v6 you&#x27;d want to assign multiple IP&#x27;s to the same interface, except that instead of getting &#x2F;128&#x27;s routed to a machine you just a get a single &#x2F;64 and you can use any of the addresses out of that range.')
