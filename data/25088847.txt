Thus at least in one partition the service will be unavailable.<p>Forcing all state changes go through a single &quot;master^Wmain&quot; node (for some key&#x2F;shared) is a simple way to achieve CP.<p>This main node can change over time, but in case if a partition it can never move to side of the partition which has no quorum for a master election.')
