Automatic seat adjustment? Bluetooth? Let&#x27;s write a requirement document, or even just a requirement powerpoint and send it out for quote. It&#x27;s not that important and cheapest bidder is fine.<p>Ford Sync 2 (aka MyFordTouch) is exactly this. The interaction design is actually good, people clearly thought about how to go from screen to screen and it would be highly usable, except that the response time is god awful. Rumor is Ford outsourced to Microsoft who outsourced to someone&#x27;s cousin who wrote it in Adobe Air or something. If it wasn&#x27;t slower than molasses, it would be pretty neat.')
