I&#x27;ve sort of considered it. The cost in money and time for law school seems like it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>And while I like to know and understand the law, I&#x27;m finding that more and more of the system is a sham. I&#x27;ve witnessed a trooper commit misconduct, like lying to a magistrate, and so many mistakes that his actions should be considered negligence. I have also witnessed 2 magistrates lack even a basic understanding of legal principles, like dismissing with prejudice or that a summary offense is a grading of a criminal offense. I even contacted a civil rights lawyer over some violations. He said there were rights violations, but without substantial financial impact the courts don&#x27;t want to hear about it.<p>So I like the understanding the &quot;code&quot; of the legal system, but it seems like it isn&#x27;t followed and that it&#x27;s all double speak - rules for thee but not for me.')
