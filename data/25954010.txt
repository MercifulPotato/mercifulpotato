This drives the price down. They’ll then go on to social media and pump GameStop everywhere with memes and stories about taking down Wall Street. This brings in new money to pump the price back up.<p>This is what they’re already doing: Pumping the stock to bring in new money, which they collect by selling the new entrants some of their shares. The new entrants catch on to the game and start recruiting more people to pump the price further, and so on.<p>Eventually people realize this can’t go on forever.

They’ll panic and sell everything, which triggers more people to panic and sell, which drives the price down.<p>Some will try to buy the dip, but eventually the pump will run out of steam and new players will get tired of bleeding money for a mythical “infinity squeeze” that never happens.')
