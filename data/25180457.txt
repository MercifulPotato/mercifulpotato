You just watch what other people do and copy them.<p>It isn&#x27;t helpful (for a foreigner) in that you ask people &quot;how much should I tip?&quot; a lot of service staff won&#x27;t give a clear answer. (They think it is rude to answer or something?)<p>On business trips to the US, I observed what my American colleagues did, and copied their behaviour.<p>I used to always tip 10% until I saw my American coworkers were always tipping 20% so I switched to that.<p>Nobody ever complained when I tipped 10% though. (Maybe they are more tolerant of stingy tipping from obvious foreigners?)<p>(And whether 10% or 20%, it was a business trip so my employer paid for it anyway.)')
