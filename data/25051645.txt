I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you because I haven&#x27;t been to one in over 10 years. However there is this idea that left-wing ideas are correct because those that are educated have them as if they came to these ideas because they are better educated.<p>I see no evidence of this at all. Most people who are educated at a University level seem to be just as misinformed as those that aren&#x27;t about political issues.<p>The difference I find is that those that are University educated have a particular hubris about their political views whereas those that aren&#x27;t typically don&#x27;t.<p>Also poor (logical) reasoning doesn&#x27;t dissapear because someone is university educated. They are typically better at defending their bad reasoning.')
