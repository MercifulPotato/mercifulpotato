It&#x27;s going to keep happening. Different people have different feelings about that, but we&#x27;ve had thousands of front-page-thread comments on much more important stories than Bannon&#x27;s dumb podcast channel. At some point we should just refer back to those threads. I don&#x27;t need to see Bannon&#x27;s culpability litigated on HN; we&#x27;re getting to Politico levels of granularity here.')
