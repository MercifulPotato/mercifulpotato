Partners committing suicide together does happen, and even when only one of them does it can be devastating for the other, and even if they don&#x27;t being in a relationship with a suicidal partner can be heartbreaking.<p>I would seriously think twice, and three times even, before dating someone who was suicidal.  IMO, suicidal people need to seriously get their lives together and overcome their issues with therapy before dating, or they risk ruining not only their own lives and that of their own family, but that of their partner and their family as well.')
