The focus there was getting jupyter notebooks and dashboards that also detail their runtime environment requirements.<p>Compared to R, pythons imports syntax and handling is a god-sent when sharing code, but we still saw a lot of people get stuck after cloning a notebook or dashboard trying to figure out all the dependencies they needed to set up to run it.<p>Now they just copy the notebook&#x2F;dashboard and first run configures everything For them referencing both internal and external dependencies.<p>It’s a small but important difference especially for juniors.<p>In the future I would love for python just to support something like “import pandas==1.1.3@pypi” and having that automatically do what every python developer who works with virtual envs would do if they saw the “==1.1.3@pupi” in a comment after the import. But then obviously also supporting installs from other sources than pypi.')
