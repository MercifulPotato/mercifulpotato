As long as these two are replaceable, I think a device is reasonably &quot;repairable&quot;.<p>While there&#x27;s a definite chance of the CPU and memory etc. failing, I think for most people the trade-off in size and weight to accommodate sockets aren&#x27;t worth it from a repairability perspective.<p>That&#x27;s where I draw my line, anyway. Flash storage and batteries are essentially guaranteed to fail in 5-10 years of use, and absolutely need to be replaceable. As long as the build quality is decent, the rest can be integrated.')
