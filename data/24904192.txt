At the very least, LLVM still needs to generate code after loading, and often everything up to inference still needs to be run as well.<p>Julia 1.6 involved a lot of work reducing invalidations, where old methods are invalidated by new definitions and thus forced to recompile. This has the obvious benefit of reducing the total amount of compilation needed, but the secondary benefit of making compiling to binaries more profitable; it&#x27;s less likely that work will be wasted when someone loads another package.')
