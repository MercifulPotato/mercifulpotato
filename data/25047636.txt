From some quick Googling to refresh on PRISM –<p>&gt;• In July last year, nine months after Microsoft bought Skype, the NSA boasted that a new capability had tripled the amount of Skype video calls being collected through Prism;<p>&gt;• Microsoft helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be unable to intercept web chats on the new Outlook.com portal;<p>&gt;Eight months before being bought by Microsoft, Skype joined the Prism program in February 2011.<p>&gt; According to the NSA documents, work had begun on smoothly integrating Skype into Prism in November 2010, but it was not until 4 February 2011 that the company was served with a directive to comply signed by the attorney general.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2013&#x2F;jul&#x2F;11&#x2F;microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2013&#x2F;jul&#x2F;11&#x2F;microsoft-nsa-...</a>')
