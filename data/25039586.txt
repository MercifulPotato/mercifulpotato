One big constraint is the average attention span of your target audience. Do you have time to care whether a guy designing&#x2F;manufacturing that USB cable on your desk got compensated well? Or the one making your clothes? Or cleaning the corporate toilet? You know, unless you have sewed your shirt yourself, it was probably made a by a person in a less developed country earning about $1 per hour [0].<p>The thing is, we physically don&#x27;t have time to look at every situation from every stakeholder&#x27;s perspective. There are just not enough hours in the day. Like it or not, that&#x27;s a pretty hard constraint and there&#x27;s no better way around it than understanding marketing and product management.<p>So ultimately, it boils down to:<p>* Strategy A that gives you a 10% chance of outperforming your corporate salary and 90% chance of getting bored and getting back to your 9-to-5.<p>* Strategy B that gives you a 0.2% chance of changing the world, 49.9% chance of giving up and another 49.9% chance of seriously burning out and getting into depression. The actual world-changing chance is likely even lower. You can guesstimate it by dividing the number of Linus Tordvaldses by the number of Github users with 1 or more repository.<p>Mind you, strategy A requires a lot of trial-and-error while learning how to do business (and getting burned multiple times), while the strategy B is about just doing what you like do and hoping that it will somehow bring the desired outcome. So please, please, please, be honest with yourself about wanting to change the world vs. just wanting to keep is as a stress-free hobby vs getting face-in-the-mud while learning an orthogonal skillset.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salaryexpert.com&#x2F;salary&#x2F;job&#x2F;sewing-machine-operator&#x2F;india" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salaryexpert.com&#x2F;salary&#x2F;job&#x2F;sewing-machine-opera...</a>')
