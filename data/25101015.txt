Her immediate reaction was “So what? Coffee’s not bad for you.”<p>Now, that’s just one doctor’s opinion, but when I did some follow up research, it did seem like the overall effects were probably very modestly negative at worst and might easily be positive.<p>In terms of quitting caffeine in general (to which I was previously essentially addicted), it seemed to have a trough at day 4-10 and then was better by around day 20 and didn’t miss it much by around the 6th week. I’m back on it, but quitting it cold turkey took a lot longer than I’d have expected.')
