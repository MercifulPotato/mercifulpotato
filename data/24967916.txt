IMO trendsetter :&gt;  But still C64 rules!<p>In mean time I will stick with my lovely Thinkpad X60 - it have 2 Gb RAM less, old wifi, worse display options but better cpu, true-and-only keyboard, &quot;mouse&quot; and display build in !  It runs OpenBSD without a blink, do www stuff, even yt (but fullscreen is a challenge) - perfect for what Pi400 is advertised for.<p>I also have x200, x220, t420 and t430 (&lt;- this is worst tp I ever had - PWM! And never models are all flawed). But lastly my carry around and be happy thinkpad is just x60 :)<p>But also this shows Pi400 is quite capable and ehmm... modern ;)<p>So, RPi Company hurry up that lazy nVidia !<p>And hope Mozilla will not kill&#x2F;waste Firefox and themselves... Like they usually do when MS or G have soon be to present new, shiny browser...')
