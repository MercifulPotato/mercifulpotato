It is overflowing with young people, many of whom moved here from elsewhere. It&#x27;s also a very diverse state, ethnically, economically, ideologically. There is absolutely a &quot;frontier spirit&quot; vibe here, partly created by the hands-off republican controlled state and local governments. I think it is quite honestly a good representation of the USA, certainly more complete than places like San Francisco or New York.<p>I also think those condo towers look terrifically ugly, but they are in good company in that department.')
