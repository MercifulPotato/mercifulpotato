If you have a screen over one eye, there&#x27;s no good way to have what&#x27;s displaying on the screen cooperate with what the other eye is doing.<p>Similarly, I think VR is out: sending disparate signals to each eye would be murder on the inner ear. So that leaves a Google Glass-style AR overlay, which remains an ok idea, but is apparently pretty hard to get right.')
