After a 3-day fast, mine was something like this:<p>Turmeric and ginger Tea<p>+ 30 minutes<p>bone broth<p>+ 30 minutes<p>sauerkraut<p>+ 30 minutes<p>almonds &#x2F; pumpkin seeds &#x2F; sunflower seeds<p>+ 45 minutes<p>avocado<p>+ 30 minutes<p>soup (bone broth &#x2F; chicken broth, kale, tofu, chard, napa)<p>+ 45 minutes<p>yogurt<p>nuts &#x2F; seeds\n...\nbeef bowl for dinner (rice, onions, simple vegetable side)<p>The logic behind this is that the turmeric and ginger causes a (very mild) inflammatory response in the stomach. It gets the body &quot;ready&quot; for food again.<p>The bone broth supplies a very mild, easily digestible form of protein that resupplies immediate deficits. Sauerkraut supplies good digestive bacteria to rebuild your population of digestive helpers. This helps prevent diarrhea, though not entirely.<p>Almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds (preferably unsalted) begin supplying dense packets of minerals. Don&#x27;t have too much, but a few handfuls will be a good start.<p>Avacado! Calories (from good fat) and minerals, and more fiber.<p>The soup is the first serious nourishment. The tofu, chard, kale, and napa provide a range of good stuff. Protein from the tofu, and more minerals and fiber from the leafy greens. Lightly salted broth, (a mix of bone broth and chicken broth for flavor) is also good.<p>Yogurt (active culture) provides calcium and fat, and another excellent boost to helper bacteria.<p>More snacking on the nuts and seeds as you like...<p>A light dinner of thin slices of ribeye with onions and soy sauce over rice, and a nice cruciferous vegetable blanched, dressed with a touch sesame oil and salt.<p>Rebooted!<p>The waits in between are important, as is continued hydration along the way.<p>All that said, many of the benefits you supposedly get from 3-day &#x2F; 5-day fasts, can be had from reduced calorie diets.')
