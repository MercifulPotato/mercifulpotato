Yes, the complaint itself does refer to market share,  but it doesn&#x27;t specifically refer to &quot;92 percent of the world&#x27;s internet searches&quot;. In fact, the complaint refers to market share within the United States, since that&#x27;s geographically relevant to the case. What happens elsewhere isn&#x27;t.
