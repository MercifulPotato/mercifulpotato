If they reply something in the lines of &quot;Yes, I understand&quot; that more often than not[1] translates into either &quot;I have no clue what you are talking about&quot; or &quot;I misunderstood&quot;. Ask them to describe in their own words what you asked them to do. Be also prepared that their answer may make you realize that what you think you want makes no sense. You can&#x27;t ask people draw red lines with green ink.[2]<p>[1] Of course, there are exceptions. but you would not be asking here if you worked with them. And you do quickly recognize the people that just nod and get sh*t done. They are rare, however.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg</a>')
