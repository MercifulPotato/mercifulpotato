Many years ago I wrote an article for Digital Web Magazine called &quot;Color Theory for the Color Blind&quot;, which up until today, I was mostly proud of. This blows that out of the water.<p>The goals were the same: How can we logically and programmatically understand color without relying on intuition, taste, and color sightedness?<p>I don&#x27;t think either of us managed to solve the part about taste. Neither article has a particularly inspired use of color within it. However, I think this approach allows a color-blind programmer to work derivatively from a designer&#x27;s initial concept and be confident that we&#x27;re not butchering the product.')
