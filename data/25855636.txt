And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.”<p>To point out the salient quote, &quot;Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal?&quot; The reason for the death was lying. It was lying to the community. It was lying to look good to community, but in fact not having its interests at heart.<p>This also stands as evidence that Christianity, while wholeheartedly communialist is not communist nor socialist as defined Marx or Engles. The State, i.e. the Church&#x2F;Apostles, does not lay claim to the means of production or personal&#x2F;private property. It asks for charity. Communism has the State own everything. If anyone doesn&#x27;t fall in line, they&#x27;re killed.')
