If Biden wins, let it be because all due process was followed so that the 71MM who voted for Trump can get behind the new president. There are close and contested elections in various states, with mandatory recounts set, as well as lawsuits underway with affidavits of blocked observers and allegations of fraud. For the sake of not dividing the country, let the Trump half of the nation have their day in court, and then let&#x27;s unify behind the new president.')
