Is that true?  Do people go somewhere to live because the state political&#x2F;governmental structure is different from another?  Does it protect or enable extremely conservative (or radical) communities that would be washed out to the average otherwise?  Is it a protection against broad brush government that cannot know or correctly allocate funds and attention to small jurisdictions?<p>Other than to emphasize or give power to certain differences in population that were baked in long ago, what purpose do states serve?   In a country where people move and work almost without boundaries?   Why not delegate some of the finances &#x2F; taxation &#x2F; regulation functions to the federal government?  Is it more effective at a local level?')
