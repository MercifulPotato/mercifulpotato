It may be a bit weird, but eh.<p>Pen and paper forces you to be a bit more deliberate for each word, because each word requires more care to be readable. But at the same time, each word written is done and set for now. And honestly, if I let it sit for an hour or two, it&#x27;s usually a good enough word.
