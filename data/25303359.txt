It&#x27;s sort of a cartoonish cutesy flat design thing that you typically associate with explainer text on a website or subway ads or similar.<p>It seems common with the generation of consumer facing companies that launched about 10 years ago and since, I&#x27;m thinking of Warby Parker or Oscar Insurance as examples among many others. It also seems to be heavily influenced by a Japanese style of &quot;cute&quot; marketing I remember from trips to Tokyo.<p>In my head I&#x27;ve always considered it to be something like the &quot;millennial marketing&quot; style but I wonder if designers have an actual name for it.')
