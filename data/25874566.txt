The marine electronics field is littered with various weird proprietary protocols that are _almost_ the same as open standards in other industries, but not quite. Examples include:<p>- NMEA0183, which is electrically RS-422 (similar to the ubiquitous RS-232, but only sometimes)<p>- NMEA2000, which is basically CAN<p>- Seatalk, which looks like NMEA0183 but is electrically inverted (1 is 0 and vice versa) and also uses weird byte lengths (9-bit?)<p>- Seatalk-ng, which is basically NMEA2000 with a few more message types<p>A $4 device that can translate arbitrary weird PHY protocols into a bitstream on a USB port is awesome in this world.')
