I went to the emergency room in a city hospital, and long story short, I was given a prescription for paracetamol or ibuprofen and something called Norco, which is apparently some kind of opioid.<p>In the pharmacy (CVS i think), the pharmacist was calling somewhere to confirm the prescription and my identity and was trying to understand hard my foreign-issued driving license. After an hour of this identity verification circus, I left the pharmacy with this opioid drug and a pack of Paracetamol&#x2F;Ibuprofen. Back in the hotel I read about it, and seeing something about opioids I threw it away (I guess, for no reason except that it sounded like it sounded like it&#x27;s related to drugs) and treated myself with paracetamol (which worked). The experience in the hospital: 6h waiting and check-up straight in the reception room with 20 people watching, plus a doctor whose biggest concern was that I remember that his name is Lim and not Lime, plus being treated like a potential drug abuser in the pharmacy was a bit surreal.<p>After getting back to EU, the hospital and my international insurer started negotiating price for this 6h waiting and 10 min check-up and an xray. It started with 2000 USD, in the end they settled on 1000 USD or so. Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t pay anything cause international insurance.<p>After a few years, when playing football in Switzerland, I stomped badly and sprained my ankle. I went to the local orthopedic clinic, where I was treated at once in doctor&#x27;s office. Cost: 250 CHF (~250USD), xray included.')
