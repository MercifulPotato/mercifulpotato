You still wrote your last paragraph. That is because you&#x27;re invested emotionally in this.<p>Never shorted a stock in my life. Not going to start now. I cannot predict when this will stop. Nither can you. What currently holds everything together is the unknown. People don&#x27;t know who, when, and how the shorter s are going to close their positions. Once things will clear out I predict it&#x27;s gonna be the beginning of the end.<p>Just to be clear. I don&#x27;t think it will crash to nothing any time soon. It will keep trading much higher than what it was pre this saga. When I say crash I mean down around 70-80% from its current value of $330.')
