We are building a pretty interesting tech product adjacent to the core business.<p>But now I feel myself spending more and more time doing basic tech support for the rest of the team. It&#x27;s probably a decent business decision because maintaining the infrastructure is essential for them to make money, it&#x27;s just not what I want to be doing.<p>Am I right to worry if this will hurt my career opportunities in the future? Should I be looking for a job at a company more focused on software development?')
