But I think they should be solved in the political and legal level, not some technical fix.<p>If you can&#x27;t trust the government, if the government wants increasingly more data, the government should be curbed by protests, voting, and so on. The apps not talking to the vendor is just a band-aid. They can still get your moves from your phone, your searches from Google, and so on.<p>And, in any case, Tor is not a substitute for democracy.<p>&gt;<i>It builds a world in which it is impossible to easily build or distribute tools that the state really doesn&#x27;t want distributed or used, because Apple is too large to deny them their demands.</i><p>We shouldn&#x27;t allow the state to have a say on this, like we shouldn&#x27;t allow censorship.<p>(Of course, many tech people, are all ok for censorship, as long as it happens to the right, that is bad, guys, e.g. those peddling &quot;fake news&quot; -- with the state or the Zuck guaranteeing for them what are &quot;real news&quot;, like the WMDs and other establishment truths).')
