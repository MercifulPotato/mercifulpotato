Measured infections yes, but not many dying anymore, as in most &#x27;phase 2&#x27; countries. NL is very bad at making a clear line; no-one I know who lives there knows what they can and cannot do. Other countries have clear, easy to follow rules or get fined. We are polderaars; every decision must have 10000000 exceptions and it stinks.<p>Otherwise, I am a dutchman and I used to be proud of my country, even though I left it long ago (I like large dense forests and mountains and humid heat; Netherlands very little of any of that), however there is not so much to be proud of anymore. We privatised and sold everything that should not be private or sold, we are less open, less equal, less honest, less direct, the social system is not very social anymore and we are following the USA for pc. Sure there are much worse countries, but they don&#x27;t pretend to be what they are not (anymore).')
