It sounds like something one guy would say to another in a heated conversation. I suspect this entire case will fall apart by the time it goes to trial like all these other fake &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; entrapment cases the FBI likes to trot out for political purposes. The only charge that sticks will be some process crime involving firearm permits.')
