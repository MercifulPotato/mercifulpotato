So often I search something specific, or a topic, and find very little. But I know there are communities on Facebook for this, I know there would be peoples posts out there on Instagram which 100% answer my question. But they may as well not exist. Unless I was “following” then when it was said, and mentally indexed it, these things are mostly unfindable, and that’s if I even have an account for said service (which I don’t for Facebook)<p>It’s sad, more people than ever using the internet, more content &amp; knowledge being created than ever before, yet it’s no longer possible to find the great answers.')
