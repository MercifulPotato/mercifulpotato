I also had extreme physical anxiety after consuming coffee. I used to have 1-2 cups a day for around 5-6 years.<p>Quitting for me was very simple. I just quit cold turkey one day and dealt with some head aches and flu like symptoms (not too bad) for around 3-4 days. I was totally fine after a week and I can not write enough about the advantages of quitting caffeine.<p>Porn addiction on the other hand is something I think I will never get over.')
