Doctors like to charge for each and every little thing, rather than by time like most professionals do.  So each diagnosis, each procedure, each conversation can have different costs which can&#x27;t be known up front.  If a doctor wanted to provide you the codes they will be using, they easily could.  They simply choose not to, to give them the freedom the charge whatever later on, in case they are able to based on what happens during your visit.<p>I love the &quot;new patient&quot; charge code, which is utilized anytime you change to a new doctor.  How the hell that differs from a regular &quot;consultation&quot; code for a yearly checkup is beyond me.  The same time is spent analyzing and talking to you, the content of the discussion is the same.  Surely, the doctor doesn&#x27;t remember you from last year anyway so they need to spend time going over your notes.<p>And yet, you get the honor of paying an extra $150 to $250 simply for talking to a different doctor.')
