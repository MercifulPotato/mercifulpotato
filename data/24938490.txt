His blog in the old days was extremely colorful and featured a lot of leaps of logic. It won him a fan base that included Ed Snowden. He&#x27;s really a terrible journalist who just happened to get his hands on a treasure trove. The Guardian was part of the Snowden story as well and they don&#x27;t publish garbage like the Biden laptop story with any undue credence.')
