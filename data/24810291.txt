Or even the C++ runtime. If any library was built against a different set of standard library interfaces (of any language), do any tools fail with a useful diagnostic?<p>That&#x27;s not to say this isn&#x27;t helpful research, but there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of work to do before all of this is robust enough to be straightforward for end users.')
