Think whether people or companies can purchase any land and build whatever they want on it. No they can, local governments must zone it as residential, and then they usually have strict restrictions on how many units can be built on each area, licenses, permissions, building codes...<p>You are right to complain about this issue, but don&#x27;t blame free markets, because they are not free: government intervention prevent the necessary competition for the market to work and fulfill demand.')
