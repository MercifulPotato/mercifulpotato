I grew up as a dissenter in a fundamentalist Christian family, and the reactions I got when I stood my ground and said that I believed in evolution and a billions year-old earth are incredibly similar to what I see when trying to argue with these extreme activists.  Also similar to my fundamentalist upbringing are the subgroup (minority) of people who obviously derive immense satisfaction from their piety, and won&#x27;t hesitate to condemn others in the in-group for not demonstrating their full dedication to The Mission.  These enforcers fit a personality profile that is identical to what I encounter at my overly woke workplace.  Recently one of these enforcers told a guy (he was raised by Polish immigrants in a poor, inner-city neighborhood of Philadelphia) that he was wrong when he committed the horrible atrocity of celebrating the purchase of his first car, and saying how he &quot;deserved it&quot; after all these years.  She was quick to spoil the happy hour at the outdoor bar by forcing him to acknowledge his privilege.')
