Often two people can be close to agreement on what the facts are, much further apart in which of those facts they think ought to be emphasised.<p>&gt; Regarding the rest of your comment: I don&#x27;t think _anyone_ is arguing that the US electoral system is without flaw. A large system of any kind will have many flaws. Ask any software engineer.<p>Every large system has flaws, yes. But how does the US electoral system compare to those of other countries? It is far from being the worst, but it is also far from being the best. If someone was pointing out flaws in one of the countries with the best organised election systems, then &quot;A large system of any kind will have many flaws&quot; may well be a decent response, but it is less so when pointing out flaws in a system which is at the best somewhere in the middle.<p>Imagine your product has lots of flaws which many of its competitors lack. In such a situation, the truism &quot;a large system of any kind will have many flaws&quot; is missing the point.<p>&gt; That being said, RIGHT NOW is decidedly not the right time. I&#x27;ll be all for having an honest, bipartisan discussion as soon as there are no longer parties actively trying to steal an election<p>I don&#x27;t agree that anyone is trying to &quot;steal an election&quot;. President Trump is being a sore loser, but I am certain he is leaving the White House peacefully come January 20th. His attempts to challenge the result in the courts have always been half-hearted. Back in 2000, each of Bush and Gore made sure they had the brightest legal minds of their respective parties on the case. Trump has not signed up the brightest legal minds of the GOP to challenge the result. I don&#x27;t think he was ever really serious about it, he is just putting on a show. He can&#x27;t steal an election, he doesn&#x27;t even know how to pull that one off. But I think a lot of people – his supporters and detractors alike – fall too easily for Trump&#x27;s shtick.')
