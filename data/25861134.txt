You might find that you have to create your own path and take the initiative to get things done.<p>&gt; I have an idea of what I should be working on,<p>&gt; I feel like there&#x27;s some confusion in my role<p>Fix this first. Reach out to your manager to schedule a discussion about your near-term goals. Don&#x27;t want for your manager to check-in. You need to be proactive. Reach out and clarify.<p>Identify near-term deliverables. The two things you need to clarify, and write down, are &quot;deliverables&quot; and &quot;acceptance criteria&quot;. That is, what are you delivering, and how will you recognize when it&#x27;s done? Until you answer those questions with specifics, you&#x27;ll be lost.<p>Next, identify the &quot;next steps&quot;. What do you need to do next to get closer to delivering the deliverable? If your next steps feel too big or you feel stuck, break it down into smaller next steps. For example, if you need to interface with a certain API, your next steps are to identify that API and find the relevant documentation. If you can&#x27;t find the documentation, your next steps are to start talking to coworkers until you identify the owner. Then your next steps are to talk to the owner to get started. Then your next steps are to make test calls to the API. It sounds basic, but you want to get into the practice of identifying your next steps and clarifying them any time you get stuck. If you can&#x27;t clearly state your next steps, pause to do some thinking about the situation.')
