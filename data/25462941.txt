The part I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re missing is that Option is just a plain old type and ok_or is just a plain old function, so if you don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing you can always just click through to their definitions (which are in normal plain old code) and read them. Even if you don&#x27;t do that, you know that they&#x27;re not doing any magical control flow things. Whereas to understand the first example I have to understand what &quot;if&quot; does and how having a bunch of statements after each other works, and there&#x27;s nothing to tell me that anywhere.')
