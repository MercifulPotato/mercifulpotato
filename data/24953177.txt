That&#x27;s also not unique to India (just think about how many people only marry within their church). The discrimination comes in with the formation of the &quot;untouchable&quot; caste and determination of social opportunities based off of caste. This form of discrimination undoubtedly existed to some level in precolonial times there was a reason so many people converted to buddhism and islam. Then again - a lot of people converted back from buddhism too. And what we call &quot;India&quot; was a collection of dozens of kingdoms, each of which undoubtedly had different interpretations (and in the case of Muslim ruled kingdoms, that&#x27;s a whole different story). It makes it really unclear what pre colonial &quot;india&quot; looked like in terms of caste.')
