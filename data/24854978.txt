I exclusively work on early-stage startups, so all my companies have teams of 3-20. They&#x27;re also mostly bootstrapped.<p>I&#x27;ve tried partnering with ex-consultants in the past, but they add no value. They don&#x27;t have deep industry contacts to sell to. They don&#x27;t have hands-on experience actually building anything. They make nice PowerPoint presentations, and that&#x27;s literally it. They constantly over-promise and under-deliver.<p>They also often demand high salaries at early stages, because they&#x27;re used to making $300-500k, but that&#x27;s a whole other issue.<p>I wasn&#x27;t being trite. I consider having management consulting (especially MBB) to be a negative on a resume of someone I&#x27;m considering working with. It&#x27;s essentially a disqualifying issue for me after many bad experiences. Maybe the next person is the exception, but it&#x27;s not worth the risk for me anymore.<p>Being in leadership is even worse, because you&#x27;re complicit in destroying so much shareholder value. You charge $100M for something that delivers no real value and costs your firm $10M. Why is that something we should admire?<p>&gt; <i>Some of them suck, some of them are mediocre, some of them are spectacularly good.</i><p>What are they spectacularly good at, though?<p>I completely agree that many of them are brilliant, but what skills are they honing, exactly? Brilliance by itself is not enough to make me want to work with someone. Experience is much more useful.<p>The experience gained tt consulting firms seems to be sales (of a very specific type), making beautiful presentations, and bending data to fit whatever narrative people want it to. Maybe they do some legwork gathering data or running some regressions, but they&#x27;re usually starting with a preconception of where they should end up.<p>I have a friend who&#x27;s a partner at Accenture, and he feels exactly the same way about management consulting that I do: it&#x27;s bullshit. Another friend at McKinsey described his analyst job as &quot;knowing how to wear a suit and be on time&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of so many disasters caused by management consultancies. Where are the success stories? At best, they just give a company&#x27;s managers some data that validates what the company already wants to do, but maybe it&#x27;s a little too risky.<p>Somewhere in the middle, perhaps they find a way to sneakily kill a pension program or fire 10,000 people. They&#x27;re creating value for the company, but it&#x27;s not exactly work your family will write about in your obituary.<p>At worst, they burn through piles of cash and accomplish absolutely nothing.')
