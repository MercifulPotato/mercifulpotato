Sure, in an ideal world I&#x27;d rather not trust anyone. Fair enough. With a federated network, however, I generally have to trust <i>every single</i> host that any of my contacts has decided to sign up with, as my metadata will necessarily leak to those hosts when I&#x27;m communicating with those contacts in question. And while I personally put in a lot of time and effort into making sure I only use software and internet platforms that protect my privacy as best as possible, most of my contacts don&#x27;t. The NSA would have an easy time setting up a rogue host.<p>Now imagine that, in addition, there weren&#x27;t just one single version of the Signal app, but dozens of forks by dozens of developers. The security risks would get even greater and I would now also have to make sure that my friends use the right (secure) version.<p>Am I the exception here? Does everyone here only have friends who are IT security experts and know how to tell apart trustworthy hosts and app developers from non-trustworthy ones?<p>On a side note, another reason why I no longer strongly believe in the idea of decentralization is the following: There was a CompSci paper a few years ago that argued that in any human-made (initially) decentralized network&#x2F;graph (whether digital or analog; whether a graph of company relationships or mankind&#x27;s social graph) there will eventually appear &quot;supernodes&quot; which have a disproportionally high number of edges&#x2F;connections to other nodes. (In the same vain, even in federated networks like email, some hosts will become bigger than others and will eventually take over most of the users and traffic.) In short: There is no such thing as full decentralization. Nodes will necessarily &quot;accumulate&quot; and gather around local centers. (If anyone finds&#x2F;knows that paper: Please let me know!)')
