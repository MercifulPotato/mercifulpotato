(I think not getting in trouble is important but orthogonal to this conversation about whether to value work or outcomes.)<p>I don&#x27;t see how valuing hard work is an excuse to &quot;not try&quot; due to ADHD. I think it&#x27;s the opposite? Trying is the requirement.<p>I think maybe I don&#x27;t understand your comment at all. Sorry about that.')
