The paper was published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; and saying that it that it was published in &quot;Nature&quot; as the article did is factually incorrect.  It was literally not published in the journal named &quot;Nature.&quot;  Those are just the facts here and aren&#x27;t really up for debate other than saying that you should open up the paper yourself and read the journal&#x27;s name from the heading.  You&#x27;ll find that it says &quot;Nature Communications.&quot;<p>I agree that it is quite confusing and probably intentionally so to take advantage of Nature&#x27;s prestigious name.  That still doesn&#x27;t make them the same journal.')
