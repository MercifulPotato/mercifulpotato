I hated the bloody things. The expense, the jams, and above all the pointlessness of taking an electronic document and printing it on paper, when everyone has email.<p>I have an HP inkjet now, that I bought for my son&#x27;s school work during lockdown. We had no choice. He was actually expected to print out work, stick it in his book, then send in a photo of the work. FFS.<p>It came with a three month free subscription service, to their automatic ink cartridge resupply.<p>So we had some cartridges arrive in the post, just as the ink was running out, and I changed cartridges.<p>A month later, the free subscription ended, and the printer refused to print, using the cartridges, unless I renewed my subscription, which I had to do through their mobile app.<p>How can you make such a simple technology, so ridiculously complex?')
