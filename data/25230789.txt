Learn the math or physics you need and try to form your own conclusions<p>I studied physics at Harvard, I&#x27;m hardly <i>unstudied</i> in the area, but yes, I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t know QFT or really anything beyond basic QM and general relativity.<p>&gt; This is the great responsibility for anyone alive in our time and it&#x27;s hard, thankless work: to think from first principles and to do our own homework<p>Absurd. I do not need to learn advanced GR&#x2F;QFT from first principles to know enough to comment on Sabine, nor do I need to verify every principle from first axioms in order to come to conclusions.<p>Humans <i>have</i> to learn to rely on trusting the judgements of others in order to make scientific advancement. Physicists can&#x27;t spend their whole life validating that basic mathematical axioms are true, they have to <i>trust</i> the body of academic mathematicians who have done that work. I reject the entire premise of your comment.')
