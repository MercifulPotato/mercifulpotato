You lose your time and effort in getting a job because corps that are doing quotas will interview you despite to intention to hire.  They do it because their interview stats and demographics are scrutinized by the government and they need their <i>interview</i> demographics to look good on paper.<p>As for BLM anyone can see the riots, looting, arson, and destruction that has affected places like Portland, Seattle, Kenosha.  The riots have cost over two billion dollars in damages.  Those are not damages to the government.  Those are damages to ordinary people and business owners.   Housing values go down, police protection is eroded, and some people were beaten or lost their lives.')
