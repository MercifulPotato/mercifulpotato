Is Twitter even really a &quot;tech company&quot;?  What tech do they even produce?  They seem to me to be an advertising company that uses computers and the Internet to serve ads.  They just happen to have a social platform they use to get eyes on those ads.<p>That&#x27;s all Twitter sells is ads.  You can&#x27;t purchase any other service from them.  The only purpose of the social platform is for there to be people to serve ads to.  That&#x27;s not a product, that&#x27;s a marketing strategy.<p>So why shouldn&#x27;t they have a moral responsibility to curb the use of their platform to do societal harm through the dissemination of misinformation?  They don&#x27;t exist to provide an uncensored social platform, they exist to generate profit through advertising.  If their practices do harm they should answer for it.')
