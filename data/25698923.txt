Freeloaders don&#x27;t convert and they become a support burden whether or not you offer support to them. Once you want to shut off the free version, which you will, you&#x27;re going to make those people who used your thing and didn&#x27;t value it enough to pay you for it mad. They wont convert, they&#x27;ll just get toxic, because they&#x27;ll feel entitled to your free service. A free option isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>You made a cool thing. Charge for it.')
