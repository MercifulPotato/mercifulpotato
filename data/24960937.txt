From what I can see with Swift compiler development, there are tons of bugs when compiling down a high-level language. Of course, part of these Swift problems can be that the team choose to pursuit performance and low-overhead above everything else (which complicated the implementation quite a bit). But still, I wonder what Kotlin has done differently to make Kotlin Native reasonably cheap to maintain going forward.')
