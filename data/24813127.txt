Although I do use LibreOffice instead of MS, I also have 25+ years of software, some quite niche, all of which still works fine on Windows.  I don&#x27;t want to waste time and effort trying to figure out how to make Linux compatible with each individual program or even determine if it can be.<p>I do like linux for work, and for use as a basic computer for doing basic things like browsing.  It has come a very long way over the years, IMHO surpassed Windows 7 and left Mac OS far behind.  But Windows 10 is right up there with linux for ease of use, and most importantly has decades of compatibility.<p>Both have their quirks, so that&#x27;s a tradeoff, and neither set of quirks really outweighs the other for me.  But that compatibility with the last quarter-century of my life is a clear point in favor of Windows.<p>For Windows though, I do recommend getting the Pro version and configuring it how you want it.  That eliminates almost all the problems of W10 that people complain about, like the random reboots and the tiles on the start menu.')
