According to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak</a>, the disease caused one death and 13 hospitalizations, and an uptick of Giullan barre reports - a disease that more often than not requires hospitalization and sometimes death. I can assure you it caused more than 13 hospitalizations, and - having known two GBS people who made a full recovery - a very long and painful months long process. So, at 50,000,000 immunized - a 1 in 1,000,000 would still be worse than the flu.<p>I am not anti vax even if HN constantly seems to interpret my comments as such.<p>I am vaccinated, so are my kids. But whenever I mention that immunizations have risks, Iâ€™m treated like a heretic.<p>Everyone is assuming something like cutter cannot happen again. This is a religious assumption, not a scientific one.')
