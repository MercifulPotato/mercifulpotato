As the syscall indicates, it is merely a suggestion. The kernel is free to ignore it and frequently does. This non-determinism makes it nearly useless for many types of page scheduling optimizations. For some workloads, the kernel consistently makes poor paging choices and there is no way to force it to make good paging choices. You have much better visibility into the I&#x2F;O behavior of your application than the kernel does.<p>In my experience, at least for database-y workloads, if you care enough about paging behavior to use madvise(), you might as well just use any number of O_DIRECT alternatives that offer deterministic paging control. It is much easier than trying to cajole the kernel into doing what you need via madvise().')
