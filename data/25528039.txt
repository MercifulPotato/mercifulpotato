I found my own solution to a problem I had but I think this will boost everyone’s productivity.<p>It is totally FREE and I wanted to reach out to the community to seek for guidance.<p>I’d be grateful if you could share your views with me.<p>The extension can be downloaded at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;link-peek&#x2F;ogoenkiecpjnfccaclpikgfpoeddceci<p>Once the website is fully loaded, press CTRL and hover over a link to give it a try. This is going to save you hours every week hopefully. Go to your favorite news website and enjoy. I look forward to your guidance and replies.<p>Cheers,<p>Dogan')
