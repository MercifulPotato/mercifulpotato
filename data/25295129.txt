All money up to $1 million is &quot;taxed&quot; at 15%, and all money after $1 million is &quot;taxed&quot; at 30%. It&#x27;s like income tax brackets in the US.<p>Thus, there is no advantage for trying to stay at $999,999. If you make $1.2m in sales, you get 15% taken on the $1m and 30% taken from the leftover $200k.')
