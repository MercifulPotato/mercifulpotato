At that point it&#x27;s either explicitly on purpose, or implicitly linked with a bias that makes them susceptible to bullshit that confirms said bias.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any ab initio way of knowing if someone&#x27;s spouting nonsense on purpose or not, so character patterns are hard to scale. But that&#x27;s why moderation online is harder and faster than in real life, because you don&#x27;t have a 1on1 interaction in the same way. It&#x27;s up to netizens to behave and think before speaking.')
