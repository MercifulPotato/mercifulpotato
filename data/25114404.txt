China is far more willing to negotiate win-win deals, and is far less of a boogeyman&#x2F;invader, than what mainstream media wants you to believe. Pompeo visited many countries, urging everyone to &#x27;unite and stand up against the bully that is China&#x27;, but the reality is very different from that narrative, and as a result Asian countries signed the RCEP instead.<p>The Western narrative of China is a bubble of alternate reality.
