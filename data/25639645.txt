It didn&#x27;t die, but the plastic got brittle and cracked. I ran it, without flushes, adding tap water when low, for about 18 years. No corrosion, all liquid looked great! I modified the old Swiftech WB to mount to my 3930K, overclocked to 4.5GHz and am typing on that system right now! If you&#x27;re curious, it tops out at about 75*C at ~150W CPU power usage.<p>I still have a CCFL (and my $5 blue LED to replace the power light), and have been thinking of incorporating it into my next build. I plan to build a sleeper system using a case from the 90&#x27;s, but fully watercooled and upgraded (along with an ESP32-powered fan control&#x2F;thermal monitoring system I&#x27;m coding up now - this is where the magic still is in 2021 IMO)<p>I also did cut a window into a PC with a dremel. Those cases are quite thick and hard to cut! I totally don&#x27;t miss hauling that big PC case and a 17 (or 19?) inch CRT to a friends place to LAN. Was really fun, though.')
