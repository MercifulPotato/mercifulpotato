There is no &quot;off&quot; switch for this.<p>If you have a gaming or pro laptop in a bag, this is a <i>fire hazard</i> and could kill people.<p>I don&#x27;t know how this was ever approved within Microsoft, but it is outright criminal negligence that should see them sued into the ground. Better yet, I&#x27;d like to see executives jailed if anyone every dies because of this arrogance.<p>Microsoft employees, get this through your thick heads: Your updates do not matter as much as my life!')
