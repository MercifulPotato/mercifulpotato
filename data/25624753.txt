That seems to be the default fate of internet forums but the goal of this one has always been to stave it off a little longer [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=online%20shaming%20by%3Adang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=online%20shaming%20by%3Adang&amp;s...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=stave%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=stave%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;...</a>')
