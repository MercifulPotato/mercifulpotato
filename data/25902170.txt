Here in the West, we basically had two large disturbances in 2000 years: collapse of Western Roman empire (which wasn&#x27;t even as bad it they made it look because most economy was in the Eastern part of it, that fared reasonably well through that crisis), and Black Death. As a big big stretch, one can also point at Napoleonic Wars and WWII but neither was nearly as bad, not even comparable to the disturbances Chinese society was going through almost every century in the same period.<p>And their collective identity (or huge population) didn&#x27;t help them fighting wars either, they miserably lost almost every conflict they got in, even ones with themselves.')
