Every previous version of CentOS before 8 has been supported until the upstream RHEL pulled the plug.  CentOSâ€™s official page said it would be supported until 2029 ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;7Qmtw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;7Qmtw</a> ).<p>A reasonable person would infer that CentOS (now controlled by RedHat, so, yes, RedHat) made the same promise that they made (and kept) with every previous version of CentOS: That it would be supported for 7-10 years.  <i>Not</i> just over 2 years.<p>I definitely inferred a decade of support.  If I would had known that CentOS 8 would be cut off at the end of 2021 this summer, I would not had installed it.  I would had installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.<p>Indeed, replacing my CentOS 8 installs with Ubuntu 20.04 is <i>exactly</i> what I have been spending all last week doing.')
