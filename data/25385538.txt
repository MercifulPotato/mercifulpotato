Companies have to capture value from their work somehow. Brave&#x27;s advertising strategy involves software on the local device using data on the local device to make a decision about what to show the user. (Not an ever expanding privacy invasive cloud-profile of the user).<p>Additionally, if ads are not your thing, you can always pay for the premium version and everyone still wins!')
