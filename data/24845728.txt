Moreover as others point out, it has actually been done and there are automated \nlines. Safety advantages are probably slim - when there&#x27;s a train accident it makes news, because they&#x27;re RARE.<p>It&#x27;s also not going to significantly improve one&#x27;s choice of transportation - you either have access to rail already, or you don&#x27;t - regardless of who&#x2F;what drives the train. Schedules are already tuned and if it was more profitable to put more trains, it would likely happen even with human conductors.')
