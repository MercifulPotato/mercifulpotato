The second book is heavily influenced by the first.<p>The first one (Edgerton) is history, with the argument being roughly that we should frame the history of technology not just in terms of inventions&#x2F;innovations, but also in terms of <i>what was actually in use at a particular moment</i>. (So the early 21st century is about self-driving cars and the iPhone, but also the Haber-Bosch Process and COBOL.)<p>The second book is more about the present, and is concerned with how we tend to talk too much about innovation and not enough about maintenance. (So they love Right to Repair and Open Source maintainers, among other things.)')
