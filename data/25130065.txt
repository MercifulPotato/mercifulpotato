It&#x27;s NOT someone that doesn&#x27;t think CO2&#x2F;cows&#x2F;etc actually has a role in it.<p>Climate is indeed changing. What he&#x27;s trying to argue is the role of CO2 in all of it.<p>100% right about this:&quot;The important part is recognizing why&quot;.<p>So far no raw data has been made fully available to see see what, how, when and why. At least I was not able to find the data those graphs that you keep popping up are based on. I also don&#x27;t remember seeing any of these graphs taking account solar activity either since that is our heat source after all.')
