I think the difference is that wasn&#x27;t really the casus belli for the Gulf War (the Wikipedia entry doesn&#x27;t mention Nayirah at all, for instance), while the WMD lie was the literal casus belli for the Iraq War.<p>&gt; You claimed that the problem of the last few years was blatant lies gaining traction in the marketplace of ideas. I am pointing out that lies have forever gained traction in the marketplace of ideas, while also being co-signed by authoritative news sources and politicians.<p>I think we&#x27;re using different definitions of &quot;blatant.&quot;  I&#x27;m talking about stuff like QAnon or Stop the Steal.  In comparison, the lies you&#x27;re talking about are far more credible and believable.')
