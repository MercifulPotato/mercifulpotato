With that in mind, what do you think of companies that offer such a work day? You could also do 5 hours a day for 4 days, but I think you&#x27;d gain more efficiency from an extra day rather than one extra hour a day, when after 4 hours can be tiring already.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Five-Hour-Workday-Differently-Productivity-Happiness-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01FGAFDBO<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Shorter-Work-Better-Smarter-Heres&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1541730712')
