The modicon quantum Plc uses the pentium 166 chip and was released in 1994 and I can still buy it today from Schneider although they encourage new installations to use a newer product. I am sure I will still be encountering old quantum Plc in the field when I retire, the platform will have a 50 year lifespan.<p>Even when a line of controllers is end of life the manufacturers provide an upgrade path to their newer product line.')
