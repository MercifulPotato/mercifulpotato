It opens with an explanation that GTK is pretty much not maintained. Later, it&#x27;s compared to Qt:<p>&gt; The advantage of Qt is that it is active developed and supports all important operating systems including the mobile Android and iOS systems with a native look and feel.<p>These feel...like important things for your application framework to support. Qt&#x27;s &quot;bloat&quot; is listed as the only major disadvantage, but only after lamenting GTK&#x27;s own bloat.<p>&gt; For many Windows or macOS users GTK has the disadvantage that GTK draws all it widgets itself, it does not use the native graphical elements of the proprietary systems. GTK allows theming by use of cascading style sheets (CSS) so it can be tuned to look not too strange on Windows and macOS, but look and feel generally does not really map to native apps.<p>Personally, this is one of the worst disadvantages of GTK for me, and makes me cringe when I see an app using GTK&#x27;s default styling. Even Electron (also lamented for its bloat) does &quot;native&quot; controls by default.<p>There&#x27;s really got to be a better argument for using GTK than &quot;it&#x27;s less bloated and is written in C&quot;')
