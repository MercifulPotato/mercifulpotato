First I was directed to a well maintained gravel road, then to dirt track, which forked and forked and slowly faded to nothing.<p>I was driving a 4x4, had an almost full tank, a load of groceries and 12 gallons of water in back, and plenty of time, so I went with it for quite a while. There are lots of long dirt tracks in this area and I kept hoping that it was still a short cut. The shortest alternate route was around 90 minutes longer.<p>I think most sane drivers would have bailed at the first turn off of the pavement. I waited until the stream bed sand was getting deep before turning around. For some optimistic mobility impaired person it could have been a death trap. I&#x27;ve adjusted my expectations of Google Maps accordingly.')
