If you make the fixation reaction more efficient the other ones follow.<p>Another option is increase the amount of RuBisCO in the cell. In cyanobacteria the enzyme is encapsulated in compartments called carboxysomes. Some studies have introduced carboxysome-like components in non-cyanobacterial organisms with varying results.')
