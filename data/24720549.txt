I see HN as a news aggregator, especially through the excellent hckrnews.com. I do post a few comments, read answers, seldom answer back. I certainly receive enlightening answers and upvote them. I often receive downvotes, and generally ignore the noise. I do not thing it is possible to have a real followed argument on HN and possibly on any open forum on the web.')
