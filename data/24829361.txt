Most people who move into the pro gm world have a ton of experience and resources, but the reviews are one of the best ways to have people vetted. We only show GM&#x27;s who have 5+ reviews on our search, but any GM can list a game if it meets our review standards.<p>I like that take on it being a permanent convention set up. The drop in games are definitely filling that niche. A bunch of our games aren&#x27;t in search because GMs use our tools for charging their customers and scheduling sessions, but for private groups. I&#x27;ll be honest, we&#x27;re working to make the ToS more clear as we&#x27;ve learned about other use cases. We mean to say, Minors need a parents consent (credit card to book). As we have grown, we&#x27;re working to create a better and more apparent code of conduct.<p>You also found an interesting bug! If you haven&#x27;t signed up for an account but click become a GM, it won&#x27;t work since our database looks for an account to them upgrade with new permissions. Thanks for pointing that out!')
