There were some days when I thought I couldn&#x27;t take the cold, so I used warm water instead. But I remember the stark difference I felt on those days compared to the rest when I showered in cold water.<p>If you can bear the cold, I would recommend it. Even if you can&#x27;t, take it up as a challenge (that&#x27;s what I did), to get your body to adapt to it. Totally worth it.')
