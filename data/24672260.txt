I never suggested that people must go medication-free, or that therapy is the only option.<p>The point is that optimal medication treatment still requires effort to learn healthy habits, facilitate self-discipline, and improve one&#x27;s ability to focus.<p>If you need medication to begin that process, so be it, but taking medication shouldn&#x27;t mean that you neglect the self-improvement aspect of this. The medication can be a springboard, but it&#x27;s a mistake to give up on self-improvement and hope that medication can do all of the heavy lifting.')
