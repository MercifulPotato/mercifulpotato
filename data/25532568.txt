Leadership approves.<p>4) Click troughs result in dropping at an internal landing page hosting links to the above communications and adds the HR training course to the users profile.<p>For more detail on step 4) the opening of the landing page is a forgiving style not a scolding style, think &quot;Oh no, this could have been from one of the phishing attacks we&#x27;ve been experiencing lately. Don&#x27;t worry, it was just an example attack from us - but did you notice any of signs of a...&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting as part of 2) it was discussed the official communications on end of the year packages would be sent out _before_ the security test, not sure if that was the case in GoDaddy&#x27;s scenario. This year didn&#x27;t include cash bonus at Christmas (we did one in the summer for COVID) but did include unlimited PTO rollover and similar non-cash perks given the situation (and explained there would be no cash bonus).<p>3) Can be tricky when trying to fend attacks on the leadership level, it usually uses a modified approach to this list where lower management of each department is involved instead.<p>As far as the numbers themselves the higher the click through rate the WORSE the score the security group gets, it&#x27;s a score for the amount of improvement from the planned action not a score for how many people you could trip up before you get a pat on the back. At the same time it was modeled after the COVID related phishing emails we had been getting, not something someone made up because it seemed easy or hard to pass.<p>It&#x27;s a very large org and in the end this went well for all teams (even though improvements weren&#x27;t quite as good as we had hoped they were still pretty darn good numbers) and we were able to show with data we had improved security against a real threat. I&#x27;m sure there were a few (given numbers) that were a bit let down after clicking it but given the approach and planning I don&#x27;t think that was a failure of the test approach (though we&#x27;re always open to refinement when an opportunity is brought up. Part of the training material is freeform feedback on how you think the org could better handle the challenges from your PoV).<p>.<p>Anyways the point is it shouldn&#x27;t have to be &quot;tackle real risks or have other groups hate security&quot;, you need to find a way to do both at your place (which may be different than how to do both at another place). And that should be true regardless if GoDaddy managed to implement the test poorly this time or not.')
