I have frequently heard data lineage however,  but again,  that&#x27;s a database&#x2F; enterprise type person lingo: when people use that word I know immediately the background they&#x27;re coming from.<p>Another poster mentioned vendor brochures and trade shows, which is in line with my expectations about which community it stems from, and also explains why I&#x27;ve never heard of it because I try to keep away from such environments these days.<p>Everywhere I&#x27;ve been the things which I take to make up &quot;provenance&quot; have generally been referred to under the simple label of &quot;data quality&quot;, with separate subset definitions and measures such as timeliness, source, authority, format, history, suitability,  verification,  etc.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s assuming people even worry about such things. In practice,  let&#x27;s be frank,  anyone who&#x27;s worked with data science knows they actually get shorter shrift than they deserve in practice: I&#x27;m probably among a minority of people in the real world who actually take things seriously,  and I find myself on a constant crusade to remind people that just because a data point exists in a data set doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useful&#x2F; appropriate&#x2F; truthful&#x2F; unbiased.<p>data quality is a bit problematic,  because I can see it being used by people who think provenance doesn&#x27;t have any thing to do with quality, and from a variety of fields,  but it is also infinitely more popular according to historical search trends,  and in my last three jobs provenance would fall under the data quality framework.')
