Gravity is just the shape of space.<p>This is really a distraction from the discussion. Why is this semantical argument important to discuss? Although, if I were to answer it, &quot;is&quot; is not well-defined in physics. But &quot;is&quot; typically is understood to be &quot;is modeled by&quot;. Yes, in general relativity, gravity is modeled by something different than what it is modeled by in Newtonian gravity, which is a force. General relativity didn&#x27;t exist 300 years ago when gravity was difficult to accept. Newtonian gravity did. Models evolve but sometimes old models remain useful.<p>My entire point in this discussion was that we need new models to understand the complexity of modern society and human behavior. The old models aren&#x27;t good enough. That&#x27;s why I react somewhat negatively to complaining of conspiracy theories at an attempt to understand the complexity of the systems we&#x27;ve created and participate in.<p>This stuff is tough to understand and wrap one&#x27;s head around. Even something as deductive, in a way, as Newtonian gravity and general relativity was met with great resistance, if not outright rejection. We shouldn&#x27;t follow these patterns.')
