While I understand and agree that minorities have been clearly the subjects of clearly unethical medical experimentation:<p>for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study</a><p>it seems a terrible disservice to suggest that any group opt out of potentially life saving treatments. There is already far too much mis-information surrounding Covid and vaccines in the US to be sending persons from historically marginalized communities mixed messages.<p>A year from now people will rightfully say <i>&quot;I didn&#x27;t get vaccinated when everyone else did because there was some suggestion that people of color did not need to be vaccinated&quot;</i>.<p>On Pine Ridge, 10% of the community currently has Covid at this very moment : 10%!!!. Is it ethical to say to them:<p><i>&quot;We have a vaccine and all whites are going to get it and I guess you can as well, if you don&#x27;t feel that would be exploitative. You remember the shitty things we did in the past right...&quot;</i><p>Add that message on top of messaging from Trump and Fox that this is all a hoax and that having Covid makes you stronger then compound it with persistent anti-vax messaging prevalent in the USA and you basically have a recipe for convincing marginalized communities that they would be better off not being vaccinated.')
