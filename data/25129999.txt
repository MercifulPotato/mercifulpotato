So what does the article even mean by &quot;once per minute&quot;? If I put a tab in background, it immediately stops any tick, if I bring the tab back in the foreground 24 real life hours later, it&#x27;ll have been 24 real life hours since its last update, not one minute, as I can see by printing events in the console.<p>That makes it difficult to correctly update how much resources were produced in the game, etc....')
