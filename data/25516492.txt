It&#x27;s as stable as the big boys in the town. I like how it looks in default configuration (I started this thing with C64. I love how old computing looks).<p>You can work relatively fast in XFCE. While it doesn&#x27;t go above and beyond like Dolphin, Akonadi and KDE in general, it can accomplish what it needs to do out of the box. Thunar is capable enough (4.16 brings per folder view preferences, which <i>is important</i>).<p>XFCE, because lack of sheer eye-candy, uses screen space very efficiently. So, it provides you massive amount of space especially in big screens.<p>I don&#x27;t miss KDE&#x27;s interconnectedness and integration while using XFCE but, it needs different solutions. Again I want to emphasize that it&#x27;s not a disadvantage, but a mere difference.<p>If you want a straight, run of the mill but well refined desktop environment, XFCE is the top choice in my book. It can provide you what you need without bloat. I personally don&#x27;t understand why people continuously torture themselves by re-configuring various WMs over and over. I understand i3 and other managers are nice but, they&#x27;re not practical in my book.')
