By the study of the Gerontology Research Group, International Database on Longevity and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research among others, we know that supercentenarians are extremely rare, yet an existent and validated population. The Gerontology Research Group takes the global view on the subject, using stable and defined validation criteria outlined by Dr. Poulain of Belgium in the Supercentenarians monograph (2010). I invite all of you who would like to learn more about the GRG data and its characteristics.<p>www.grg.org<p>Sincerely,<p>Waclaw Jan Kroczek<p>GRG Administrator for Case Validation Reports')
