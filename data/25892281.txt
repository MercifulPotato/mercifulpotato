However, many use cases also require joins and the other goodness that relations provide.<p>So really the use case for mongo etc is &#x27;very high performance requirements&#x27; AND &#x27;does not require relations&#x27;.<p>Many projects may be ok with just one of those. But very few require meet both of those constraints.<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve seen many cases which are sort of the opposite: great performance with mongodb, but then because of the lack of relations for a reporting feature (for example) performance completely plummets due to horrible hacks being done to query the data model that doesn&#x27;t work with the schema, eventually requiring a rewrite to RDBMS. I would guess that this is much more common.')
