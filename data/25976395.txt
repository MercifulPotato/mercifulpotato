I really think the opposite is true.<p>Have you ever worked in a factory, on a farm, etc. on bottom level positions ? Most people would take the money and do nothing without blinking. Hell even a bunch of my college friends would skip years of their life playing games and acquiring 0 life experience if someone gave them this option the only thing that forced them to go out in the world was existential need (as demonstrated by two guys I know who are well off and their parents allowed them to do nothing - one guy has 0 days working experience at 30, he was a top tier COD gamer)')
