I used a lot of console anyway. Why wait for windows and icons to appear? I want animations and decorations to get out of the way. If I&#x27;m playing, it&#x27;s usually fullscreen. When I&#x27;m working, I want to use as much screen as possible. i3 sounded radical at first, but when was the last time an animation or decoration helped you? I mean there are some rare cases, but it needs to be helpful for me to leave it enabled.<p>I now honestly believe mouse interfaces are overrated. They have their place in games and graphical applications. Anything that does NOT require precision is better done with a keyboard. The exception is websites. Mouse is used because it has very low learning curve and you can just click on stuff that interests you without thinking how to reach it.')
