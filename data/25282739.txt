The company I work for doesn&#x27;t allow corporate stuff on personal phones, but they do give them to everyone who asks for them. It&#x27;s pretty nice, you get a choice of android or iOS phone and they just ship new ones out directly from AT&amp;T.<p>What would suck is if you&#x27;re not allowed to bring your personal phone at all on campus. Then if you have to reach family you have to do it from your work phone.')
