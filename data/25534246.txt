You probably couldn&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t try to) do very much else that way. It&#x27;s doubtful whether for example it constitutes an &quot;organisation&quot;.<p>It has no formal legal existence whatsoever, so it can&#x27;t own anything, including money, nor enter into any sort of contract with anybody, it doesn&#x27;t have members, and the staff who make things happen aren&#x27;t working for the IETF per se.<p>Something like ISRG (the organisation that provides the Let&#x27;s Encrypt service you mentioned) is much more conventional, there&#x27;s a not-for-profit legal entity in a specific place with employees, equipment and so on. It would be reasonable to run a TLD that way, and in fact I assume some of them are indeed run that way.')
