Are you interpreting &quot;unanimous public support&quot; to mean &quot;literally every single citizen supports this policy, including corporate decision-makers and legislators&quot;? Such pedantry aside, it&#x27;s entirely possible for an overwhelming majority of the public to want a particular policy decision irrespective of whether &quot;corporate decision-makers&quot; or legislators find themselves in the majority or minority.<p>In whatever case, the statistic I&#x27;m thinking of is from former labor secretary Robert Reich&#x27;s &quot;Inequality for All&quot; documentary. I don&#x27;t care to skim it for exact phrasing or numbers.
