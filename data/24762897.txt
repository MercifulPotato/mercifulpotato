It is a character attack when substantial discussion is warranted. It allows you to undermine opposing viewpoints without examining them. You&#x27;re accusing people of abandoning their stated principles for nefarious reasons. It is toxic. If you want to have productive discussions with people you&#x27;ll be better off not labelling them as evil from the outset.')
