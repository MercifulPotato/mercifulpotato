Probably because discord servers are private, self-moderated, and demographically very skewed towards young men (since it&#x27;s commonly used for gaming chats). I know that some of the more &quot;troublesome&quot; subreddits use discord to discuss sensitive topics without worrying about reddit admin censorship, so communities like those could be causing a bit of FUD around Discord as a whole.')
