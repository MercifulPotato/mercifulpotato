We both had &quot;typical&quot; flu symptoms, but one thing really stands out - that we thought everything tasted terribly bland, and shockingly, our Grey Poupon mustard tasted absolutely disgusting. More of a weapon than a condiment.<p>At the time they hadn&#x27;t talked about losing the sense of smell with Covid yet. But &quot;Hindsight is 2020!&quot; Because we definitely both had that. When it came out in the news that losing smell was a symptom, we were already back to normal health and gave each other knowing glances and simultaneously said, &quot;hmm...&quot; What we both had made us often comment over meals that everything was like eating Mac &#x27;n Cheese with our noses plugged. Try that. You&#x27;ll be surprised. You won&#x27;t eat all of it unless you drown it in salt first.<p>Thankfully once we got better, the mustard tasted like it&#x27;s supposed to again.  I&#x27;m a fan of mustards and pepper sauces. That really freaked me out.<p>The part that sucks is that apparently getting Covid doesn&#x27;t stop you from getting it again 3 months later. Thank Gawd we already know about booster shots, and that&#x27;s exactly how we&#x27;re doing it.')
