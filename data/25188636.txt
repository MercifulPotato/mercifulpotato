We&#x27;re consuming resources at an exponential rate with a population way, way outside what the planet can support sustainably. And we won&#x27;t fix it before it&#x27;s too late, because our base human nature wants more, bigger, better at the expense of all else.<p>I&#x27;m with Musk on this, the only way we survive is to get the hell off Earth. But the reasons why are more than just to have a &quot;backup plan&quot; for humanity.<p>One of humanity&#x27;s best traits is our adaptability. Put us under stressors and we inevitably adapt to any situation, no matter how dire. Now stick a group of humans in space (or Mars, no difference), task them with creating a self-sustaining technological society, give them a lot of time, and when you come back what you find will be a radically different culture than anything we could relate to on Earth.<p>That group of humans will have been forced, for generations, to be ruthlessly efficient with their sustainability and use of resources.  We are social creatures, and with that comes the social pressure to conform for the survival of the group. Because of these pressures, the base nature of individual greed we witness here on Earth won&#x27;t have the space to thrive. Given even more time, we may even be lucky enough to see that trait bred out of us. If that were to happen, we may just have a shot at long-term survival as a species.')
