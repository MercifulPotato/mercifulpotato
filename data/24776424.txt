There isn&#x27;t much stickiness there. It will be a disruptive S-curve, as soon as an upstart starts gaining traction.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that any other company will outcompete Google on search. What will happen is that something better than search will come along. That wouldn&#x27;t be hard, given that today&#x27;s search tends to return a combination of useless garbage and paid results. A better system will emerge - it has to, because what we have today is so bad.')
