Which I&#x27;ve been deploying to for years, I still develop on Windows but only ever deploy our .NET (Core) Apps to Linux (since the same App runs flawlessly on Windows + Linux).<p>The Windows-only .NET Framework (excl Mono) is now considered legacy, it&#x27;s continually supported but all new development + features are being invested in the .NET 5+ cross-platform runtime which is now what &quot;.NET&quot; refers to.')
