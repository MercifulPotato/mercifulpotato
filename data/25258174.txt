The models themselves however require 100+ gpus so we are sort of back in that phase where you need large compute systems to even compete.  A single lab will have issues unless they can leverage a cloud and then also get grant funding to spend that money on the cloud compute... which may be difficult b&#x2F;c its basically a consumable now and you don&#x27;t have any hardware leftover.')
