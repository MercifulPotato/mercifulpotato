More often I have a problem where messages send&#x2F;recieve out of order (even if I&#x27;m stationary or using Wi-Fi calling to send), or one message will send and once will bounce so the recipient will get a picture with no context or a caption with no context.<p>None of us are on the same messaging services (besides Discord I guess, but that doesn&#x27;t have good notifications), so we can&#x27;t switch. This is on AT&amp;T, but Verizon and T-Mobile have the same problem.')
