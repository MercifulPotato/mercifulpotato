Generally the base models have what people want, it&#x27;s only fancy interior or exterior add-ons that make you wait. Base models have ac, sat nav, cameras etc already. Generally you don&#x27;t have to wait too long because the car is already built or there is one to that spec being built soon. I think the most I had to wait was 2 months')
