But the first parameter is a pointer to a struct, and it’s clear enough from the signature that a reference would work. It could be mut to be on the safe side. (Yes, this involves someone making sure that the API doesn’t retain the pointer.). The last argument is, per the prototype, is a string. Admittedly, the Windows API has a truly horrible idea of what a string is, but surely they could do better than using a pointer.')
