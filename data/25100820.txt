But I think Gitea model is how a non-toy software is to be developed.<p>I often look at how many issues are labeled &#x27;bug&#x27; before considering adding a new dependency to my project as well as check how many old issues are unresolved.<p>You don&#x27;t have to resolve all open issues but closing an issue tracker the outright signals &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you have problems and I do not intend for this software to be maintained in any sense of collaborative fashion here on Github&quot;. Above all, such behaviour signals to me that there is only 1 person making commits &#x2F; merging PRs and they are kind of tired of OSS (which is fine, by the way).')
