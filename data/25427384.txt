Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608010811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425683, text='&gt; My first decade in the US was all about climbing out of the pit of “you’re not white enough for us because you didn’t go to a top school”.<p>I likely do not understand what you mean here, because a casual reading of this seems ridiculous. Most white people do not go to top schools either.<p>On the flip side, if one were to list factors that play a role in becoming decently successful, going to a top school is fairly low on that list (as in most successful people didn&#x27;t go to one either).<p>I&#x27;m probably not interpreting the comment as you intended, though.')
