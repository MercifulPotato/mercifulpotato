No chance to resolve the issue with a registrar who can manually review the case and revert changes. This would include anyone working on that level of infra in your company and anyone who hacks them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what would you compare the https cert to without a central authority in that case.<p>We tried the web or trust with PGP and it turns out key management is really hard and apart from few geeks nobody&#x27;s that interested.')
