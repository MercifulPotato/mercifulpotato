Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607824795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403572, text='&gt; Do we have any evidence someone&#x27;s been infected from a momentary passing in open air?<p>We don&#x27;t have the specific history of &gt;99.9% of infections, so, of course we don&#x27;t have great evidence for any scenario.  Therefore I guess it&#x27;s presumed safe, just like licking doorknobs? :P<p>Many of the construction site and agricultural site transmissions took place outdoors, without close contact.<p>Yes, outdoor is much, much, much lower risk than indoor contact-- about a 20x odds ratio.<p>Something I tell all my students in our shop class-- PPE is useless if you have to give a lot of thought about when to employ it.  Yes, everything happening in the lab right now might seem like it doesn&#x27;t require safety glasses... but you might not be assessing the risk properly, you might not know everyone else&#x27;s activities, and you&#x27;re only ever as safe as the riskiest thing someone else is doing in the room.<p>The cost of masking up for most activities is low, and the cost of partial knowledge or a miscalculation could be very, very high.')
