I can tell you that personally I&#x27;ve already been contacted and hired a couple of times exclusively due to a side project I have.<p>&gt; But lets just say that I would have to work full-time on a side project<p>You don&#x27;t. You only need to have something to show for. You are the only one whose input matters and you are free to choose whatever you feel is best for you in terms of learning experience and portfolio. No one cares if you work on it for 14 hours a day or 15 minutes each month. What recruiters do care about is that you have something substantial to show for when they ask you if you have any experience in X.<p>&gt; (..) but according to the grandparent comment, their skills are suspect because they haven&#x27;t spent their afternoons writing dead end projects for fun.<p>Those skills are obviously suspect if they claim prowesses that they have no way to corroborate.<p>What? Do you believe people don&#x27;t lie in job applications? Do you believe no one ever said in job interviews that they were very skilled at X although they never in their life had any contact with it?')
