Git takes time to learn and understand properly, like a lot of things in technology. Sure, it&#x27;s internally very complicated, but it does a great job at providing a sane interface to use it. I think the problem is really in the approach that a lot of git users think of git in the first place. It&#x27;s seen as a requirement rather than an aid and solution to a set of very tricky problems. The actual point of VCS in general can&#x27;t be summed in a sentence. I think the appropriate approach here is to recognize that it will take time to see the value of and learn how&#x2F;why git does things the way it does.')
