The former represents growth, the latter is a dilution (sort of &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot;, but not really, economics is complicated, yada yada).<p>Education costs are indeed part of inflation, as are car prices.  And yes, those are rising, but they&#x27;re being offset on balance by other things (phones, say) getting cheaper.<p>Look, inflation indexes are complicated and there&#x27;s room for argument about exactly how you want it computed.  But statements like &quot;inflation is not low&quot; don&#x27;t really capture the truth.')
