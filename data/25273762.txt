Major scientific projects just got left behind to rust.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to think about it. Some projects like advanced rocket engines were salvaged by people who care and other projects like the Buran shuttle were left to rot and destroyed by petty stuff like rooftop collapse.<p>At the end though, maybe it&#x27;s just a natural selection process. Arguably, saving the Buran might have turned into an expensive mistake considering the fate of US shuttle program.')
