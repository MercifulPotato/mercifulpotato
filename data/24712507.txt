However, specific instructions for the recipes are protected.<p>In addition, though individual recipes aren&#x27;t protected, a collection of recipes <i>is</i> protected.<p>There is a line, though, between copying a few recipes, and an entire collection. That line is not easy to define, but that doesn&#x27;t preclude the existence of such a line.<p>So â€“ is an API considered a single recipe? Or is it a &quot;recipe collection?&quot; That seems to me to be an important distinction.<p>If you were to copy one set of API function names that cover a limited area, then it could be argued that you used just one &quot;recipe&quot; and that it would be OK. However, if an entire collection of API function names across a very broad range of categories was copied, then it is harder to argue that you didn&#x27;t copy any entire collection, and not just an individual recipe.')
