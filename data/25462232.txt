Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25463353, 25462378], score=None, time=1608250215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461415, text='I read a lot of the mailing list threads back when all this was going on, and I don&#x27;t recall feeling any particular sympathy toward McVoy at all.<p>The fundamental issue I saw was that McVoy decided to foist what I consider an unconscionable license agreement upon his unpaid open source users: users were prohibited from working on another version control system without having their license to use the read-only BitKeeper client revoked.  (And reverse engineering BK&#x27;s protocol was also forbidden.)  From the starting line I already thought he was slimy for that.<p>This is where Torvalds should have gotten his big honking &quot;I told you so&quot;, but I expect he took the wrong lesson from it since he was able to whip up an acceptable alternative in git in a fairly short amount of time[0].<p>Anyway, McVoy was usually pretty civil in email threads about the whole thing (likely with a few angry words here and there), but I don&#x27;t think that really mattered to me: IMO he was asking something unethical of his users from the start, and so I think ethically Tridge was completely in the right to reverse engineer BK&#x27;s protocol and write an unencumbered client.  McVoy&#x27;s response to take his ball and go home was of course entirely within his rights, but was oh so childish.  And, surprise, BitKeeper has since failed as a product; I believe it&#x27;s now open source, and has a tiny fraction of git&#x27;s user base.<p>[0] I think it&#x27;s easy for some to take the -- IMO mistaken -- view that &quot;being allowed to&quot; (eye roll) use BitKeeper was a &quot;generous&quot; gift, because it pushed someone to build a viable open-source alternative when their back was against a wall.  My view is that it was just lucky for the open source community that McVoy went up against one of the few people with the talent and motivation to out-build BitKeeper.  This is one of those times RMS&#x27;s preaching against using closed-source software is so spot-on, publicly, painfully correct.')
