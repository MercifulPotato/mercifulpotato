You can get uric acid via two pathophysiologic mechanisms: under-excretion of uric acid, or over-production.<p>Under-excretion is by far and away the most common cause of gout (think ~90% of cases). Causes for this include things like chronic kidney disease or an inborne&#x2F;hereditary problem (like you mentioned), but can also be caused by extrinsic factors such as some medications (common ones include cyclosporine, most diuretics, a few of the TB drugs) as well as more general problems (alcohol decreases UA excretion by itself, dehydration can contribute)<p>Over-production is a whole other kettle of fish. This is most commonly secondary to some problem of increased cell turnover (think leukaemia, lymphoma, haemolytic anaemia etc.), Again alcohol and obesity can contribute.<p>You&#x27;ll note alcohol was in both groups. Alcohol excess (especailly beer) can lead to gout without any other contributing factor. Excess alcohol + excess red meat is an especially bad combo which can lead to gout without any other contributing health issues.<p>So, gout can certainly be caused by what you eat. It&#x27;s not the ONLY cause of gout, though.')
