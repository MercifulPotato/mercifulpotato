But now in December, your city has about 350 people spreading the virus but only to 1.5 close contacts in a two week period, you&#x27;d expect the next outbreak to be 500 people.<p>I think hospitalizations are still a somewhat consistent percentage of cases, and will increase as the number of cases go up.')
