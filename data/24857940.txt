Thanks for mentioning us! First of all, I wanted to congratulate you for this fund raising. I&#x27;m a big fan of what you&#x27;re building and for Retool, Internal, Forest Admin or any others... I think it&#x27;s great to create this new SaaS product category and to design this new market all together! That&#x27;s exciting!<p>From my point of view, Retool helps you build any internal tools using a frontend builder where you can build your UI from scratch or from templates after connecting any type of data sources.<p>With Forest Admin, we decided to focus on the administration panel of any webapps. From the ground up, we&#x27;ve designed our solution accordingly by providing a fullstack framework using an on-premise backend&#x2F;API (open-source) connected to the application&#x27;s database(s) and an off-the-self SaaS frontend (learn more about architecture here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;forest-admin&#x2F;a-deep-dive-into-forest-admins-architecture-and-its-benefits-for-the-developers-who-trust-it-1d49212fb4b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;forest-admin&#x2F;a-deep-dive-into-forest-admi...</a>).<p>The reason behind having such an architecture is to let our users to keep full control of their data and to be able to access the code locally to extend the API without any restriction. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t agree when you say &quot;Forest Admin is good if you want something quickly but have no intention of customizing it later&quot;. Our mission is to do the exact the opposite.<p>To be fully convinced, I think examples are always better than words. We spent time with some of our customers to demonstrate how Forest Admin can adapted to handle complex workflows: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forestadmin.com&#x2F;customers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forestadmin.com&#x2F;customers</a>')
