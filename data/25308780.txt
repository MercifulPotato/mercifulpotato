Consider, if a parent is a musical prodigy, it’s akin to having a fantastic coach at an early age. They can teach you hard-earned insights, help you make the right choices, introduce you to the right people. This makes achievement considerably easier. It’s not as different from financial transfer as we think.<p>&gt; In a century or two (barring intervention to return wealth to the proletariat) I&#x27;d expect the American upper class to get into that groove of wealth consolidation, like how things evolved in Europe<p>As long we live in a free-market society, I think this will be hard to do. Main reason: it is extremely difficult to invest well in the long-term. You can see this by how prized top investors are. Unless one invests well, in a free market society their wealth gets eaten up.<p>Europe avoids this through a highly regulated society — social mobility in and out of the upper class is extremely difficult there.<p>It’s certainly possible that the u.s will lose their position as the bastion of free markets — but whoever picks it up will become as powerful, and most people will start to immigrate there.')
