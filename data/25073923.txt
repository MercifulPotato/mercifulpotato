I am curious though what others consider to be tasteful about Python.<p>It objectively has ignored features from those languages, such as immutability, concurrency, sane scoping, functional ways of thinking, pattern matching, better REPL, etc. which have all been making their way into most modern languages. So what’s tasteful about Python? The benefits it has that I see are that it’s easy to download and run for simple scripts and has clean-ish syntax, but that’s about it. For anything larger, it quickly gets in the way.<p>Popularity is a confusing beast. What has made Python popular, in my opinion, is that it was adopted by scientists, but in my experience, that group of people has little taste in software and little want to figure out what else is out there.')
