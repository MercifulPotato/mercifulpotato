She didn&#x27;t react at all when I started talking about &quot;Dark Patterns&quot;:)\nIt is requirement nowadays, it is not optional. If you as a designer don&#x27;t think about new ways to exploit the user base, you are not worth your salt.\nI moved only to visual stuff for two reasons:\n1. Designers used to think about the user, functionally and aesthetically. Nowadays designers who cannot draw a straight line move templates around and comply with the management without any form of critical thinking.\n2. There is no way for me to be a &quot;writer&quot; and do the dishes.\nYep, nowadays designers must not only code but and write compelling stories to be hired. Utter nonsense.')
