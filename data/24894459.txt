Amongst other things, that .h file contained a list of 10,000 const uints, which were included in every file, and compiled in every file. Compiling that project took hours. At some point I wrote a script that changed all those const uints to #define, which cut our build time to a much more manageable half hour.<p>Project lead called it the biggest productivity improvement in the project; now we could build over lunch instead of over the weekend.<p>If there&#x27;s a step in your build pipeline that takes an unreasonable amount of time, it&#x27;s worth checking why. In my current project, the slowest part of our build pipeline is the Cypress tests. (They&#x27;re also the most unreliable part.)')
