Item(by='riboflavin', descendants=None, kids=[24767927], score=None, time=1602610032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767324, text='&gt; It&#x27;s one of the reasons why I point people to using Wordpress + SEO plugins like Yoast, which deal with most if not all of these edge cases automatically.<p>This is pretty good advice, though what we see more commonly is that Yoast is misconfigured (or not configured at all), which causes more problems than it solves. Another thing that happens is solutions like Yoast will throw lots of errors that actually don&#x27;t matter because Yoast&#x27;s goal is to drive interaction with Yoast. It&#x27;s not always easy to make the distinction.<p>But yes, for a lot of people &quot;just use Wordpress&quot; is a good solution, and an attentive Yoast install can be super helpful!')
