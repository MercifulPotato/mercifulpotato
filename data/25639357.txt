Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#x27;s neat - but I&#x27;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#x27;s pictures.<p>Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#x27;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#x27;t even know where to start. Let&#x27;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces.')
