(Laptop always have small and often a shitty screen)<p>* Adjust the brightness and the contrast. Do a google search to find some colored images with instructions how to calibrate.<p>* Quick rules of thumb, you can always reduce brightness to 50% right away. Modern displays are extremely bright and the out of factory settings are insane, sometimes 80% or 100%, it&#x27;s like starring at a lamppost.<p>* In terms of positioning. Your eyes should be at the level of the top of the screen. Large displays (24&quot; and above) can go quite tall even with the feet at the lowest position, it might not be possible to do that, it&#x27;s okay if your eyes are only at 3&#x2F;4 of the top of the screen.')
