He would only have been 21 or 22.<p>This scared me, so since then I&#x27;ve followed the standard advice on avoiding computer-related injuries very carefully.  I use a desktop computer with an external, adjustable monitor. I use ergonomic keyboards, and use a mouse with either hand. I learned to touch-type with the Dvorak layout, I have an adjustable desk, etc.<p>I haven&#x27;t had any problems, and I don&#x27;t know which (if any) of these actions helped, but I&#x27;m surprised when I see other developers apparently happy to hunch over a laptop keyboard for 8 hours, while sitting on an awkward chair in a coffee shop. Why do this to yourself?')
