And I didn&#x27;t get fired.<p>Basically, I had a habit of starting a new SQL Server Management Studio instance in its own window for each database I was working on. At some point this struck me as wasteful, for some reason, so I closed all my windows and opened all the databases in one window. Then sometime after that I went to delete the test database as a routine maintainance task, but of course I was used to clicking the database at the top of the left pane in SSMS, which was the test database when it was the only database in a window... but now happened to be the production database. Then five minutes later I got a call from the client company that used our system, to ask me if there was any maintainance going on because everyone&#x27;s client had just crashed.<p>The horror when I realised.<p>It was educational, though. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll make that particular mistake ever again. And my bosses were ace to be fair, probably because I worked my ass off to correct the mess that ensued.')
