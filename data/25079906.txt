To exercise fair use defense (yes, it is a defense and not a right in US Copyright law), you must be able to use a process that is non-invasive (as stated in DMCA). So, if a DRM is preventing you to screenshot it, you are actually required to use a camera and exercise the analog hole. This is definitely disappointing, and I am not personally endorsing it, but the law as it stands does not lend credence. (Also, what RIAA is trying to remove is the code that allows to get the music video files from YouTube, which is served differently to normal videos (not just the test units in question). This was conspicuously absent from all discussions I&#x27;ve read.)')
