Apple literally put engineering time + effort just to allow 3rd-party OSes to be run on their chip. That doesn&#x27;t strike me as the move of a company that wants to lock down their OS.<p>You can disagree with the tradeoffs Apple decided to make in the name of security&#x2F;privacy, fair enough. And you can certainly blame them for their mistakes (like not thinking to handle a case where their Developer ID verification servers were offline). But practically, these tradeoffs don&#x27;t really hamper almost anyone&#x27;s usage of the OS, and the few people for whom it does can disable them.')
