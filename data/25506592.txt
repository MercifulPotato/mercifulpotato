This is part of the reason why I eventually came back down to earth after a couple of years of FP zealotry in my early career. I realized that it makes the easy parts easier. And there is something to be said about that -- there are a lot of codebases where just doing the table stakes refactoring that minimizes the surface area of stateful code does a ton to improve the codebase.<p>But in my experience, that&#x27;s only table stakes. It doesn&#x27;t make the hard parts (such as unfucking a broken data model and code + existing prod data which depends on those implicit assumptions) any easier. So it&#x27;s a tool of limited use for most of the thorny issues I&#x27;ve come across in my career, across startups and BigCos.')
