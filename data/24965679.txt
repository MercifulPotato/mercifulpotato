As a child, when I first learnt our home address I immediately dreamed a rather long story where our house was robbed and I was mailed to the other side of the planet.  I still remember when the parcel was opened, and I saw the light again.  I immediately told &#x27;em my home address so that they could mail me back.<p>That said, â€œIt got some headlines when it happened, probably because it was so cute,&quot; followed by &quot;(although they did insure him for $50)&quot; doesnt sit very well with me.  Maybe I a uptight, but some irresponsible actions of parents are not cute, they are just irresponsible, thats it.  I have a feeling parents, when talking amongst each other, like to downplay their obvious shortcomings.  I can almost feel the downvotes coming, because I know parents really dont like to be reminded about that.')
