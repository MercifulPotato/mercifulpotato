Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607228475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320609, text='No, I didn&#x27;t refer to &#x27;VW&#x27; as having integrity - rather the University, i.e. the institution the students were &#x27;backed by&#x27; - that&#x27;s clear enough in what I wrote. (Edit - maybe it&#x27;s not so clear, but if you look at what I wrote overall, it should be clear enough I&#x27;m talking about the students, not VW.)<p>It takes &#x27;rigour&#x27; to counteract one&#x27;s own impulses which usually amount to things like &#x27;I disagree with the war, it was wrong, ergo, any leaking regarding it must be whistleblowing&#x27; - or - &#x27;I agree with the war, therefore any leakage is treason&#x27;.<p>Manning &#x27;cable leaks&#x27; exposed no US crimes, not even any wrongdoing on the part of the US and the questionable nature of &#x27;whistle blowing&#x27; is compounded by the fact that he didn&#x27;t even know what he was leaking in the first place.<p>Manning&#x27;s &#x27;exposure&#x27; didn&#x27;t result in anyone being prosecuted except for himself, which was done by law (under a &#x27;Democrat&#x27; political regime FYI).<p>Just the opposite, it demonstrated a US diplomatic corps trying to do a their very difficult and grinding jobs in a very complex and totally corrupt Middle East political situation.<p>What was the <i>result</i> of the leaks?<p>Mass protests against America?<p>No - it was the Arab Spring - Arabs on Main Street protesting, and in some cases overthrowing <i>their own governments</i> - because they were informed by the cable leaks.<p>So Manning, upset with his own government, leaks &#x27;private information&#x27; - which materially has the opposite of the intended reaction: highlighting US diplomatic corps doing their jobs - and the entirety of the ME in deep corruption - highlighting the very underlying cause of external intervention in the first place.<p>The populist narrative of Manning being an absolute whisteblower is clearly wrong, mostly promoted by those who simply hate the fact the US was involved in a military capacity.<p>If Manning is a hero, it&#x27;s to Tunisian and Egyptians, not to Americans.<p>Edit: for an example of material &#x27;whistleblowing&#x27; relating to the war in Iraq, refer to Joe Darby [1], i.e. Abu Gharib.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Joe_Darby" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Joe_Darby</a>')
