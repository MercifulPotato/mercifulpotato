Listening to him speak on a topic of current interest to him, gives me a IQ bump (self-perceived and short-lived unfortunately, but that&#x27;s on me)<p>I&#x27;m no statistician, but I&#x27;d be willing wager that the two ratios are about the same:<p>1. kids with privilege in the 70&#x27;s: Bill Gates<p>2. people with the ability to spend billions to further a cause: Bill Gates<p>Edit: formatting')
