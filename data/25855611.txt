Item(by='MetaWhirledPeas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611205287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855472, text='This is all just a bunch of nonsense, but I enjoy discussing it regardless.<p>Why bother going back so far? Let&#x27;s think of what would happen if you went back 30 seconds. As soon as you arrive in the past, take a baseball bat to the time machine. What then?<p>And then let&#x27;s take the article&#x27;s scenario at face value. If you went back 5 minutes and somehow events always led back to you successfully using the time machine, your consciousness would be stuck in a permanent 5-minute loop. Maybe you could spice up those 5 minutes but you&#x27;d be right back where you started soon enough. Wouldn&#x27;t the same be true if you went back 5 seconds? That would be hell.<p>But that&#x27;s not the end of it. If you went back in time, why would we assume you&#x27;d displace to a new location? One of two things would need to happen: A) you&#x27;d need to teleport AND erase a blank area of space perfectly sized for your arrival, or B) you&#x27;d rewind like a tape playing backwards.<p>I like to think of the B scenario. If it were true we would never know it. The effects of the time machine would never be observable. We could have working time machines all around us right now for all we know. As I sit in this chair I could be at the destination of a trip through a time machine which I will one day invent. And when I finally enter the machine and flip the button, nothing will seem to happen. A pointless device.')
