Those are an order of magnitude slower than a plugged in desktop PC. Twenty milliseconds for me is a two hundred milliseconds for them!<p>Similarly, <i>many</i> outsourced developers are forced to work on cloud VMs that are not only relatively low-spec (1 or 2 cores), but outright throttled, such as the B-series Azure VMs.<p>Web developers at ISVs like Atlassian are also &quot;spoiled&quot; by having essentially unfettered LAN connectivity with 1-5 millisecond latencies. Worse still, they&#x27;ll do development with the server component running on their localhost, which is basically cheating.<p>Real enterprise networks have at least two firewalls between end-users and the Internet, and at least one web proxy, which more than likely supports only TLS 1.2, HTTP 1.1, Gzip, etc...<p>We have customers that have less Internet uplink bandwidth for 15,000 users than I have for myself at home.<p>But all of this is immaterial to Jira&#x27;s performance woes. It&#x27;s slow in <i>all</i> circumstances. There is no way to make it fast. Not even liquid nitrogen cooled Zen 3 CPUs running at 8 GHz could bring the page load times down to what I would categorise as acceptable.')
