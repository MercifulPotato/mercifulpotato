Facts, which are a subset of universal truths, need to clearly outweigh falsehood. For example, you&#x27;d not find schools teach conspiracy theories like &quot;Earth is flat&quot;, or &quot;Global Warming is a hoax&quot; for a reason. Fringe theories that rely on absurd reasoning and have no basis in actual facts must be curtailed, and under no circumstances do those theories deserve any amplication platform, definitely not one which operates at the scale like Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter.<p>I realise that what&#x27;s a universal fact today needn&#x27;t be a fact tomorrow, but we have got substantially better scientific and socio-political tools to verify and come to conclusions one way or other for <i>many</i> topics. It is only prudent to let fringe theories be fringe and not amplify them for more eyeballs and revenue.<p>Consuming nonsense does affect real people and has real world consequences.')
