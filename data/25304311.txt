Item(by='andrewla', descendants=None, kids=[25304952], score=None, time=1607099830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25301506, text='To take this at face value -- the entire point of the quantum supremacy claim is not that these quantum computers are computing interesting problems that we can&#x27;t solve with classical computers,<p>But instead what is being done is to construct a system where each of the components is simulateable on a classical computer -- we completely understand how they work. But when you put a number of the components together, the complexity of the classical program required to simulate the system becomes exponentially larger, rendering the classical simulating infeasible, while the complexity of the realized physical system increases only linearly.<p>Since molecules are a quantum computer in themselves, this would imply (if it were possible) that to simulate quantum effects on a classical computer for even a small number of molecules would require a quantum computer exponential in the number of molecules.<p>So to simulate one mole of air in its full complexity would require not just ~6e23 bits of computing power but instead 10^(10^23) bits of classical computing power.<p>By contrast, simulating a very long series of classical coupled pendulums, though very complex, is a problem that increases linearly (or sublinearly) with the number of pendulums. Even though this system has nonlinearities that make it nearly impossible to compute in closed form, and exhibit chaotic behavior, simulation can be done feasibly.')
