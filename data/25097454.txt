Emphasizing &quot;genetic&quot; means you care about whether the mechanism of interest is actually inherited.<p>There are some mechanisms that could perhaps be inherited through maternal contribution of enzymes involved in creating the marks. But trying to imagine how somatic epigenetic markers can be transferred to germ cells and then somehow transmitted to offspring past the epigenetic erasure that happens during fertilization is tough. It is definitely an area of research that I think is actually more interesting than studying the mechanisms themselves.')
