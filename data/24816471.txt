Item(by='tluyben2', descendants=None, kids=[24816617], score=None, time=1603012097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24816066, text='Camunda is pretty nice and I have proposed it for projects, but it was shot down almost every time because &#x27;BPM visual modelling is old-world&#x27; (it kind of says that on the homepage as well; &#x27;modernize your legacy BPM systems&#x27;). We did a prototype for a big insurer in the UK and that went well, but covid+brexit killed the project altogether. It is nice to work with and to just toss it aside because of BPM modelling (and the charts belonging to them that make people from the industry who encountered them early 2000s cringe) is shortsighted (considering you can do everything in code). It is just that when people read the homepage, I guess from comments partners&#x2F;clients made, it looks like going back 15+ years when you had fat java applet clients doing BPM and it always turning into a mess in the end.')
