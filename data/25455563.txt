They just assume you have an Internet or TV&#x2F;radio enabled device. Again, having internet is enough as they say you may watch the public media on the broadcaster&#x27;s website...<p>Some years ago they would send people to sniff around your home to find a media device, like taking photos of your car radio in front of your home to prove you can access public media. But if you let them in your home, they&#x27;d write a report of you having a TV etc.<p>But as I said this isn&#x27;t happening any more, they just assume every household has a device capable of accessing public media so everyone must pay.<p>There was a big movement against this but ultimately the Constitutional Court decided all this is A-OK.')
