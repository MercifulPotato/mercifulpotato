Think Microsoft Flight Simulator, but for driving, in VR. I want to simulate real world driving experience as closely as possible.<p>The idea first came to me when I was driving around in Hawaii along the coast a few years ago. The views were breathtaking. I had watched videos of the drive before, but nothing compared to the real thing, not even close. That&#x27;s when I thought, maybe we can generate the driving experience in VR.<p>Think about it. You are not moving anywhere relative to the car when you are driving. If we can build a car that can simulate inertia, acceleration, bumps on the road, the rumble of the car etc., we can almost fool our brains it&#x27;s the real thing.<p>The software sides of things is &quot;easier&quot; IMO, as far as being technically possible. I want to do what MSFS has accomplished. I want to be able to drive around anywhere in the world.<p>I am looking for likeminded folks to see if this thing can be built.')
