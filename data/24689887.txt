It&#x27;s inherently complicated because it&#x27;s very flexible and accounts for all kinds of use cases.<p>The problem is you don&#x27;t need all that power most of the time, but it&#x27;s there. To understand CSS you have to understand a lot of underlying concepts about layout and web page structure. People feel like &quot;Why do I have to remember all these arbitrary rules?!&quot;. I sympathize - and sure a fair few things are arbitrary and never changed due to not breaking existing code - but most of the rules are not arbitrary, they just serve a bigger world than what we might be dealing with as web devs.<p>In the end I prefer to think of CSS as a powerful programming language that gives me lots of _primitives_, not a framework with a bunch of out of the box behavior that matches my narrow needs. If you want those, they are out there of course.<p>But yeah. CSS is hard and it takes study, practice, and time to be good at it. I think half of the time we struggle with CSS it&#x27;s because we expect that it is &quot;easy&quot; and that it should cooperate without us investing time in learning it. It&#x27;s written in short lines that look like plain English. It should do what we expect all the time, right?')
