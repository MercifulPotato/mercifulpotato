Where you have a heading you may want it and its associated content wrapped in a &lt;section&gt;. Where you have a separated paragraph you really do probably want a &lt;p&gt;.<p>So these newlines aren&#x27;t always just replacing &lt;div&gt;s. The page has no structure except what can be derived from headings.<p>2. Wrapping everything in a &lt;code&gt; tag seems like it could cause issues. It would probably be better to use &lt;main&gt; and apply the clever one line of CSS mentioned in the post.')
