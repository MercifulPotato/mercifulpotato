A few comments:<p>* I would probably go with ashift=12 to get better compression ratio, or even as far as ashift=9 if the disks can sustainably maintain the same performance. Benchmark first, of course.<p>* We came to the same conclusion regarding AIO recently, but just today I did more benchmark, and it looks like ZFS shim does perform better than InnoDB shim. So I think it&#x27;s still fine to enable innodb_use_native_aio<p>* We use zstd compression from ZFS 2.0. It&#x27;s great, and we all deserve it after suffering  through the PR dramas.')
