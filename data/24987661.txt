The bare minimum for me is color (printing colored things as grayscale in 2020 is frankly an embarrassment), built-in networking, automatic duplex printing and a scanner.<p>But you can&#x27;t buy just that. The only printers that have those features also have a feeder on the scanner, a fax machine, all kinds of cloud crap, an &quot;app&quot; system (?!?), access control... which drive the price way up the their own - and that&#x27;s before they slap on the &quot;enterprise&quot; markup because that is no longer considered a SOHO device.')
