Intel and AMD never did this; its why they lost horribly in mobile.<p>If you want a more efficient processor you can just reduce the frequency. You can&#x27;t do that in the other direction. If your processor wasn&#x27;t designed for 4Ghz+ then you can&#x27;t clock it that high, so the real challenge is making the highest clocked CPU. AMD and Intel care a lot about efficiency and they use efficiency improvements to increase clock speeds and add more cores just like everyone else. What you are talking about is like semiconductor 101. It&#x27;s so obvious nobody has to talk about it. If you think this is a competitive edge then you should read up more about this industry.<p>&gt;Their bread and butter is desktops and servers, where it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Efficiency matters a lot in the server and desktop market. Higher efficiency means more cores and a higher frequency.<p>&gt;But, long term, it does; higher efficiency means you can pack more transistors into the same die without melting them.<p>No shit? Semiconductor 101??<p>&gt;And its far easier to scale a 10 watt chip up to use 50 watts than it is to do the opposite.<p>You mean... like those 64 core EPYC server processors that AMD has been producing for years...? Aren&#x27;t you lacking a little in imagination?')
