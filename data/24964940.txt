In the future, I don&#x27;t think ML will be a separate field of programming. It&#x27;ll just be &quot;programming,&quot; the same way webdev is.<p>There&#x27;s a tendency to think of ML as &quot;not programming,&quot; or something other than just plain programming. But as the tooling matures, that&#x27;ll go away.<p>(Lisp used to be considered &quot;AI programming,&quot; till it became useful in many other contexts.)')
