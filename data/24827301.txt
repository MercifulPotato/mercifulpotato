I&#x27;m not sure if we should add the orbital speed of Earth to that or not.  Also keep in mind that the Voyagers reached their speeds thanks to several gravity slingshots, so in theory we could boost our Starship speedball probe even higher than that.  If we used a fat Ion engine instead of chemical rockets, we&#x27;d get a lot more delta v as well (although over the course of years instead of a few minutes).')
