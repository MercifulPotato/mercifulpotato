Can someone show me something I can see?<p>Sea levels haven&#x27;t risen.  There are more small birds around where I live than when I was younger.  Things seem to be doing ok.<p>I am a skeptic and I&#x27;m very far from trusting experts.  I don&#x27;t want to be in a state of belief, I want to know.  But I am put in a position that I must take it on trust that it is real.  Is carbon dioxide bad?  Surely, it would just make trees grow.  In reverse, if we had more oxygen in the air we would be more active.  How is it that in the 70s we were told we were going into a mini ice age?<p>On the other hand, I can lay my hands on documents that indicate the Club of Rome and other organisations, want to use climate change as a lever to change the world.  I mean, how does coronavirus relate to climate change, such that we cannot go back to normal, unless we take all these actions?<p>So, for me, climate change and corona virus are a means to get everyone (almost) on board with re-sculpting the world, to suit those who own the big corporations and run those organisations like the UN, WEF, etc.   It is an excuse to usher in a technocracy where those who own everything are able to micro-manage every detail of our lives - where we go, how much electricity or water we use, what job we do, etc, etc.<p>Frankly its dystopian.  Its also blinkered to talk about climate change in isolation of how this issue serves the mega-plans that are in place.')
