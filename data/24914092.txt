The whole sex crime framework needs to be fundamentally revisited.<p>Someone taking a photo of themselves to share privately with someone sounds in the clear.<p>It&#x27;s almost like the political fallout would be so severe that nobody, not a judge or politician is willing to exercise the political capital here so everyone stays in the lane no matter how absurd things get.<p>Being called a &quot;pro-pedophilia&quot; candidate for saying teenagers shouldn&#x27;t get labeled as sex-offending criminals for taking photographs of themselves would be a daunting attack to work through. In a position of power I&#x27;d probably also assess it&#x27;s not worth the political capital and stick with the program as well.<p>Maybe there needs to be a more favorable case like say, a secretly sexually active teenager uses an online medical service to send photographs for querying about a possible infection and their over-reacting zealous parents find out, become outraged, and try to sue the medical service for possessing underage content.')
