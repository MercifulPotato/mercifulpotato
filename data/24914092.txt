The whole sex crime framework needs to be fundamentally revisited.<p>Someone taking a photo of themselves to share privately with someone sounds in the clear.<p>When these laws were written someone would have had to process the film themself, make a print, address an envelope and put it in the mail. A teenager doing that for a casual recipient sounds like some outlandish stunt in a John Waters film. The courts and legislatures can be forgiven for not having accommodated for such things.<p>However we now live in clearly different times.<p>It&#x27;s almost like the political fallout would be so severe that neither judges nor politicians are willing to exercise the political capital so everyone stays in the lane no matter how absurd things get.<p>Being called a &quot;pro-pedophilia&quot; candidate for claiming teenagers shouldn&#x27;t become sex-offending criminals for taking photographs of themselves would be a daunting attack to work through. In a position of power I&#x27;d probably also assess it&#x27;s not worth the political capital and stick with the program as well.<p>Maybe there needs to be a more favorable case like say, a secretly sexually active teenager uses an online medical service to send photographs about a possible infection and their over-reacting zealous parents find out, become outraged, and try to sue the medical service for possessing underage content.')
