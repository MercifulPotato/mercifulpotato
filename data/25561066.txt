Either way these people are anything but normal. The normal people are the tens of thousands who can&#x27;t get an apartment at that price. In the end it fails for the same reason that you can&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; poverty by running a state lottery and seeing a &quot;normal&quot; person win.<p>And even if we don&#x27;t have a problem with this as inherently inequitable, it&#x27;s just ... such tiny, tiny, small-scale thinking.')
