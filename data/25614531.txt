If a customer says ‘I want a faster horse’, you need to ask, ‘what is it that they really want &#x2F; what is it they’re actually saying?’.<p>In Ford’s case that might be something like: ‘I want it to be faster &#x2F; easier &#x2F; cheaper to get from point A to point B’. If the way to deliver that to a customer is better horses or a car, it doesn’t really matter so long as the desired value is provided.')
