Canada and Scotland did just fine without.<p>(In fact, private Canadian banks usually played something like a lender of last resort to American banks in their recurring financial crises.)<p>The Eurozone is a mess, that&#x27;s true.<p>Dollarisation in the strict sense of using the USD is useful when your domestic institutions crash more often than the US.<p>But in the wider sense, currency substitution still makes sense.<p>However, do keep in mind that these efforts really work best when the provision of currency is regulated just like making shoes or any other industry.<p>Historically, many of these economies with privately issued currency ran on some sort of metal standard.  Which is similar to dollarisation plus local banks issuing their own deposits and notes promising to pay the bearer in USD.<p>(Also historically, no single bank ever developed a monopoly on issuing currency, but they quickly settled on a common standard of accounting.<p>Also do keep in mind that the US experiments with private bank notes were bonkers, just like the rest of the regulation of their banking system.  Look to eg Canada or Scotland for how to run a more proper system.)')
