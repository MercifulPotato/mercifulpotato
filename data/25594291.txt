That it seemed very hung on c or pascal.<p>It eventually stuck me as being part of the point.  It is not supposed to be a new language.  It is supposed to be how you would explain an implementation to another person.<p>That is, it is not an attempt to hide the structure of a program.  Such that having an intro section that basically lays out the structure of the language being used for the computer is sort of on key.<p>Seeing a literate implementation of &quot;wc&quot; is not supposed to give more clarity to how &quot;wc&quot; exists as an algorithm, per se.  It is supposed to give a view of an implementation that is readable to a person, though.<p>And, often, the idioms of how you read a whole program should guide how you write the literate one.  This is probably <i>not</i> line by line.  But it probably <i>is</i> guided by your existing knowledge of the implementation language.')
