Though I think it depends largely on the person.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve worked with lots of remote teams from the get go and co-workers I&#x27;ve never met in person. It&#x27;s actually been incredibly fine for me to build strong relationships with them, to the point where I eventually meet them after many years and can pick up conversations with them as well as any of their local colleagues.<p>Though again I think that varies by person. I&#x27;m what I&#x27;d call a very social introvert in that I take part in lots of company&#x2F;industry community but don&#x27;t have a need to socialize like an extrovert might. I think that&#x27;s helped me because I don&#x27;t feel isolated when remote, but I get on very strongly with a wide range of co workers.<p>Anyway, to the point, I think you&#x27;re right in that it&#x27;s harder to build those bonds, but it is doable.')
