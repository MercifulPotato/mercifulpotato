JAMstack really just means relying on external services for dynamic content. You don&#x27;t have to use Gatsby or Hugo or whatever. A JAMstack site can be a single HTML page with a script tag (and all mine usually are).<p>I built my own static site generator and I feel so much more ownership over the code. You should try it. Not only is it my code all the way down, but it only runs on my machine. All the generated assets will remain functional and security bug free as long as browsers understand HTML, CSS and JS, even if I never update the code again.')
