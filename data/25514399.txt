Item(by='yboris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608697677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25512469, text='The housing appreciation is overrated: your house is worth more, but so are all the other houses you want to buy when you move. And people complaining when the housing prices fall also confuse me: so what, the house you buy when you move is cheaper too.<p>The trailer home I bought was built in 1984. With all the people moving out of NYC into New Jersey, similar mobile homes in my development have sold for $80k. I may end up selling for a similar amount. Though I do think you&#x27;re right and it is typical to lose money when re-selling a mobile home.<p>As a side note: I paid 0 tax when purchasing it (it&#x27;s not a house, no house tax). My &quot;closing&quot; expenses were $40 to get the title registered at the local DMV &#x2F; MVC (Motor Vehicle Commission). It&#x27;s pretty nice.')
