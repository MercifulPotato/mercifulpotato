I don&#x27;t mean this to be negative, this is just my ongoing developer blog to keep the Dark community appraised about what&#x27;s going on.<p>There&#x27;s some really great stuff about OCaml. I don&#x27;t think we could have gotten through the first 2 years without OCaml, we repeatedly made very large scale changes to what our product was and how it worked, and that would have been 10x harder in something else.<p>I actually think OCaml stands to be in a great place in the next few years with the work being done by core community members.
