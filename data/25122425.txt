Most people who use git simply don&#x27;t work on anything even remotely close to that scale, and will basically only ever be working from a &#x27;source of truth&#x27; master&#x2F;main branch.<p>Understanding the origins of git and how it compares to the modern Github-is-git workflow really propelled my understanding of the tool and why some of the things that seemed weird to me actually make a lot of sense with that context.')
