Most CS reps are good at helping existing customers with particular problems but there&#x27;s still a huge gap to fill in between CS and Account Manager. A good AM is skillful at finding out what&#x27;s currently missing for existing clients,how it could be arranged and offered at the most suitable time. From what I&#x27;ve seen, these aren&#x27;t the skills everyone&#x27;s got or,more importantly,willing to get.  I do, however agree, that some AMs are grossly overpaid. If I ask simple things during the initial call and all I get is &#x27;let me check with my technical team&#x27;, then it&#x27;s a waste of time.Having said that, I&#x27;ve seen what a good sales person can do in really tough situations,where you&#x27;d think there&#x27;s no way on earth anything cab be done now.')
