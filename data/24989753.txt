Putting people with addiction issues in jail was the wrong approach.<p>A big problem is that addictions are expensive and people are willing to commit crimes to feed addictions when they run out of money. Anecdata of 1, but one of my friends in high school got addicted to heroin, and he ended up in jail not because of possession of heroin, but because he started stealing so he could come up with the money to buy more... so in that sense decriminalization won&#x27;t necessarily help, but I agree that possession of drugs for personal use should not necessarily result in jail time.')
