I&#x27;d prefer fixing the problem &quot;behind the scenes&quot; without engaging the user, except to let them know when the problem is fixed. I consider it vastly more &quot;user friendly&quot; to enable support personnel to solve problems w&#x2F;o distracting the user. I don&#x27;t think very many developers consider that use case.<p>Tools that enable &quot;concierge&quot; support for VIPs, executives, Customers who will pay more to be doted-upon, etc, is a valuable attribute in software to me. Moving toward user self-service is laudable, but not if it&#x27;s at the expense of dedicate support personnel&#x27;s capabilities. In my experience, at least, the satisfaction and praise users express from having issues resolved without bothering them has been significant.')
