They don&#x27;t see the difference between BTC and altcoins -- they&#x27;re <i>all</i> altcoins.<p>Maybe the system will stabilize on those top 10 coins, and the others will fade out or become irrelevant. But I don&#x27;t see any particular reason why they would. Most of those 10 ten coins were created in the last three years, and could easily be displaced.<p>BTC is the granddaddy and could yet be the foundation of a stable basis. But it has enough problems that competitors keep arising, and that makes me skeptical.')
