Of course people are bound by the actions of their predecessors - that&#x27;s why Americans are still apologizing and making things right to native Americans, that&#x27;s why things like affirmative action action exists to put things right for how people were treated half a century ago, that&#x27;s why Germans still apologize and pay reparations for WW2....we can keep on going. Of course you have to take responsibility for the things you&#x27;ve done to the world. Otherwise you&#x27;ve reaped the benefit at the expense of others but hey, it was in the past so it&#x27;s fine?<p>&gt;&gt; They can&#x27;t do anything about it.<p>Of course they can. If not them, then who?')
