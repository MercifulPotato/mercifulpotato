All of the value is in these interconnected networks and being able to send traffic to arbitrary endpoints regardless of your provider.<p>There is no “base layer” beneath TCP&#x2F;IP. That’s the beauty of the Internet. The underlying ISPs connecting together will have different lower level protocols, different internal routing protocols, different hardware, different software, different power sources, different currencies, different spoken languages, etc.<p>AWS&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Cloudflare could cease to exist tomorrow and the Internet would continue on just fine. There would be a ton of websites down for US&#x2F;European residents, but the Internet would work nonetheless.')
