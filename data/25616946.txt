I did however break the screen of my surface tablet, but I dropped it off the roof of my car after forgetting it was up there.<p>I use one of my laptops for my business and code on it, albeit on windows, but I&#x27;ve never had freezing or crashing.\nNever had to deal with support so can&#x27;t say much about that experience.<p>It seems you&#x27;ve just gotten super unlucky with MS products.
