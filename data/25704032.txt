You might as well just have a bunch of latches.  The real point of delay lines, shift registers, or core memory is to reduce the address space: you store bits in a way that is slower but <i>simpler</i> to access, which means you can store more things.  Mercury standing waves would not make it any easier to store bits, so there&#x27;s no advantage.<p>Still, you could make a device like that.  Only 2&#x2F;3rds of the tube can store memory- the rest is a quarter-wave transformer, which basically makes the tube act as if it was open at both ends.  You can construct arbitrary patterns with fourier decompositions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Periodic_summation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Periodic_summation</a>')
