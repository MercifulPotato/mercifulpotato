We are alive and breathing. Although it&#x27;s not known well enough we are being targeted by DDOS attackers on monthly basis, usually over the weekends.<p>We do have most of the basics covered:<p>- rate limits based on IP (configured at nginx level)<p>- rate limits for authn users to prevent abuse (configured at app level)<p>- WAF by AWS Shield (before requests hit the Load Balancer)<p>- auto scaling system is in place too<p>However, we are seeing attacks which range from 500k-2M req&#x2F;min lasting for about couple of hours. After a while the autoscale doesn&#x27;t help much. WAF works in most cases, however, sometimes WAF blocks only about 4-10% of these DDOS requests which is not effective enough.<p>How can I smartly prepare for next such waves?')
