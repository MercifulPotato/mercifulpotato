Item(by='burntoutfire', descendants=None, kids=[24785223], score=None, time=1602606648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764547, text='&gt; The banana taped to the wall a few years ago inspired people to think about how much art costs to buy, and how art is a money-laundering front for rich people.<p>Before that, we had Artist&#x27;s Shit [1] in 1961 and countless similar stunts. I&#x27;m under impression that the main thing art does today is rebel and &quot;force to reflect&quot;. Perhaps that&#x27;s why almost no one is interested in it, as what it has to say is usualy quite shallow in its message (capitalism sucks, we get it) and also not very linked to the actual piece (The pieces often require lengthy explanation on what the artist was actually trying to say).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artist%27s_Shit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artist%27s_Shit</a>')
