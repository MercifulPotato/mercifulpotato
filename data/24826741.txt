He raised cattle. And he got tired and decided to be lazy.<p>You see, keeping cattle takes a lot of work. Constant vet bills for inoculations, treatments when they get sick. Corn-feeding, to maximize their size, means buying a lot of corn. Constant attention and work. And my parents&#x27; friend, well, he was tired of it.<p>So he put his cattle out into a field. And he did nothing. If one got sick, it went to the dog food place. They ate grass that grew in the field. They didn&#x27;t get as big and he didn&#x27;t make as much money, but he also got to take things a bit slower, easier.<p>Then, organic beef became a big deal. He did not give a shit about &#x27;organic&#x27; or whatever these strange hippies were talking about. But he was more than happy if they wanted to pay him extra for his laziness.<p>(Note: I am paraphrasing a second-hand story and while I grew up rural, I didn&#x27;t raise cattle- mistakes are being made here, forgive me.)')
