Those 1300 participants who got the half dose full dose vaccine also turned out to be significantly younger than the other group who got the two full-dose regime, making those two groups really difficult to compare (apart from the fact that they were also differing in size)<p>Now we have a new number out there, 90% if the two doses are given 3 months apart, does anyone here now what the trial-size was? the age distribution? The statistical significance for that finding?')
