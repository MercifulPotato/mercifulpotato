Or have I missed something?<p>&gt;Despite promising end-to-end encryption, the FTC said that &quot;Zoom maintained the cryptographic keys that could allow Zoom to access the content of its customers&#x27; meetings, and secured its Zoom Meetings, in part, with a lower level of encryption than promised.&quot;<p>Not wonderful but that still, technically, is an E2E encryption scheme. Is it not? Or do they mean one end terminates in Zoom&#x27;s servers and it&#x27;s not E2E through the whole pipe, but rather two pipes stitched together?<p>Agreed it&#x27;s not as secure as they marketed, but this seems to suggest if you want to offer E2E you need a specific kind of key storage to meet this new precedent. Good in practice, but maybe the FTC are not the right people to placing such a hurdle down?<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed something though.')
