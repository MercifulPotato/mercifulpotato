Its truly terrible that such a strong school is graduating people off two years of history, one of which is designed by the College Board.<p>Thinking nothing of the historical objects around us is not terrible. Most people are ignorant of most things, lord knows I am. A problem arises when people insist that defending confederate statues is protecting history, when if you went and asked the people who actually do history for a living they&#x27;d fairly universally disagree.<p>As for Unite the Right, I&#x27;d agree with you that there are people who want the statues to stay up and aren&#x27;t white supremacists.

At that point, I&#x27;d expect an ignorant defender of confederate statues to think &quot;wow, I&#x27;ve made a big mistake&quot; and leave.')
