It has nothing to do with the laptop.<p>The contents of the laptop are not &quot;fake news.&quot; At least one email has had its DKIM signature verified. Multiple people who were copied on the emails have verified their authenticity. The pictures and videos of Hunter Biden on the laptop speak for themselves.<p>It is entirely possible that the story of how the laptop was acquired is at least partially fake, but there&#x27;s no actual evidence of that, and some evidence pointing the other way - why would Biden&#x27;s lawyer ask the computer shop owner for the laptop if he didn&#x27;t have it, and Biden if Biden thought he didn&#x27;t have it?<p>This story is truly shocking to me, not so much for the allegations of corruption, which are neither surprising nor interesting, but for the willful blindness of so many very smart people who are using a lot of brainpower to rationalize it away.')
