Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610962108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810708, text='The fundamental problem with easy repairability is that you need to maintain availability of replacement parts. How can you expect that a given piece of equipment is repairable if you cannot get a replacement PCB? Manufacturing the old electronics is often not possible because regulations change. When leaded solder was banned, some old PCB designs were unaffected, others had to be redone. Components may no longer be available.<p>So if you had to do a repair job it is entirely possible that a replacement PCB has to be designed from scratch. Doing this for every model is not possible so there would have to be a standard PCB used by all models. Considering the high degree of integration in many products, that is a pipe dream.<p>The only real solution is longer warranties to keep the manufacturer accountable.')
