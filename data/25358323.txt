Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607521390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357848, text='Hmm, well, I didn&#x27;t live in the region anymore, so I am not sure how it went from first-hand (I got some second-hand info though). Based on that my take is that there was some pressure for sure. You need to imagine a cold case got assigned, and people want to get this over with. At some point, I even saw my own mother on TV commenting on the story, how she wanted the case to be solved.<p>From the source, 15000 of 21500 people complied. It meant a lot of families (of men) could be excluded, narrowing the gap for the perpetrator (the police figured the perpetrator was from the region as he must have known the area).<p>I am one of these weird outliers. Not only did I not live in the region anymore, I am the only male still alive from that region who fit the profile (12+ male at time of crime, my father and uncle both passed away). Thing is, the family tree can go back multiple generations, including in ways you&#x27;re not aware of. You might have a relative alive who you don&#x27;t even know about. The other reason I&#x27;m an outlier is my family isn&#x27;t <i>originally</i> from that region. Even though my family isn&#x27;t originally from around that area, it might have helped, for the earlier mentioned reasons. Plus, I got myself off the list, too.<p>Its a bit twisting, how you know for sure you didn&#x27;t commit a (rather serious) crime, but you cannot be sure about others, and if everyone says they didn&#x27;t do it therefore don&#x27;t want to cooperate the police cannot narrow down on a suspect. On top of that, my father and uncle were both alive at the time the crime was committed (my father was legally blind at that time though, couldn&#x27;t even drive or walk alone).<p>So how did I eventually get tested? After initially there was no outcome from the samples of people who still lived in the region, the police announced they&#x27;d locate men who were 12+ at time of crime and who live elsewhere nowadays. This included me. I immediately called the hotline for an appointment to get it over with. At that time, our first born was only a few months old, and I wanted to get it over with. They (the police officer) understood this and she made an appointment with me. There were 2 police officers: a female who did the social aspects (talking), and a forensic male nerd. I spoke with them about the case even though I reported the stalking matter in a separate report to the police (because it might have been the same person as the perpetrator). They were as friendly as every police officer I met in my country (always reasonable and friendly, according to my experience). I was approx 15 y.o. when all of this happened.<p>As for anonymity, yes it was supposed to all remain anonymous. All the DNA samples were going to be destroyed when the case was closed. I&#x27;m not entirely sure when that is though, cause of higher court still have to rule.<p>Later on I learned NFI only test a very limited range of DNA, about 50 unique aspects. But in general, all of this increased my faith in this executive branch of the government. As always, YMMV.<p>With regards to your last remark: &quot;The suspect must have had a reason to run, instead of just refusing the test&quot; simply said, the shared theory is his feet got wet. They got DNA samples from his place. Then he got on national TV being sought a suspect, and someone in Spain recognized him. He never admitted the crimes, btw. He argued he found the body dead and put the body away in a nice way, even though his history as pedophile, as well as his DNA all over the place on the victim&#x27;s underwear. He (or well, his defense) argued he was scared to talk to the police because of his history as pedophile. I don&#x27;t know, got me quite angry cause it smelled like BS.')
