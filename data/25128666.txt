In the USA, economists claim the pandemic will cost approximately $16T. If you assume the unmitigated death toll would have been 2.2M absent any restrictions, subtracting the 200k that have died (So 16T&#x2F;2M), theoretically we paid approximately $8 million dollars per life saved.<p>Obviously even one life lost is too much, but one has to wonder if that stimulus and productivity loss could have saved more lives if invested somewhere else, such as healthcare, cancer research or motor vehicle safety.')
