The use of youtube-dl by <i>you</i> to download Taylor Swift is not what the courts are looking at (and note, that would generally not be fair use if your intent was just to watch it later as the time-shifting defense from the Betamax case is generally not applicable to content available on-demand, though using the video in a derivative work like non-profit educational content would probably still be fine).<p>It&#x27;s the fact that youtube-dl holds itself out as being the tool to use so that you can download Taylor Swift that is at issue.<p><i>The person who took a copy has no substantial reason to share it with anyone, as it is freely available through the content providers. Anyone with a copy of youtube-dl can get it, (does youtube-dl enable the download of any paywalled content? If so, that might be a fact that changes the game. But if so, does the RIAA claimant have standing to make that argument?) </i><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if they intend to share the video further. The copyright violation act is the downloading of a permanent copy of video content provided on a streaming&#x2F;on-demand basis. The downloader sharing the video with others would be a separate copyright violation.')
