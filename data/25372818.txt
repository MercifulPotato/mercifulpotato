Not because all parts of the subject are complicated, but more of a result of a layer-upon-layer-upon-layer effect mixed with jargon.<p>Anyway, regarding this contract. What happens if a bunch of random people bet on water scarcity? Well, if there is no water scarcity they will simply lose all their money.<p>If there is water scarcity, however, this will be a clear signal of trouble ahead several weeks (or even months) before the scarcity becomes a real problem for real people.<p>Yes, these greedy speculators will earn a lot of money (from people hedging and from other speculators); but it will not be because of losses of ordinary people using water on a day-to-day basis.<p>Those people, if water scarcity sets in, will have to ask their supplier (the state I suppose? or are there private companies in CA?) why this is happening and solve the problem.')
