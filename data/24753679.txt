Most of the time it&#x27;s the same bail bondsman who facilitates a suspects release that comes looking, since the bondsman doesn&#x27;t get <i>their</i> money back from the court until the suspect shows.<p>Which is the whole point.<p>And that bondsman likely required the suspect to list and confirm the name, address, and phone number of every family member, employer, and close contact they have.<p>Probably 95% of cases are the bondsman just calling the suspect&#x27;s family to get them to encourage compliance.<p>An angry moma is going to be more effective than any manhunt.')
