As the neighbor comment points out, this is necessary if you&#x27;re writing production-quality code -- either your checking exceptions or checking errors, it makes little difference.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing Go almost daily for 5 years and have never thought writing if err != nil is remotely a plague. It&#x27;s an opportunity to handle the situation gracefully, annotate the error or log with details and propagate or swallow. Each invocation becomes deliberate, routine, and meaningful.<p>If you&#x27;re just trying to hack together a tire fire, then sure, maybe this is painful, but also maybe consider why you find this to be painful? What do you value, and if it&#x27;s not what Go provides, why on earth are you using it?')
