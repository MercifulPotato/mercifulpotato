Monica, Dex, UpHabit, Cloze, CJournal etc. I learned that tools are just tools, they’re not magic. The way to keep in touch with people is to consistently keep in touch and write down their information. It doesn’t matter the tool. I now just allocate a few hours each weekend to update and review a custom excel sheet I use as my CRM. You might think it’s inefficient, but the inefficiency is where I actually accomplish the most. Progress often looks inefficient in hindsight. Plus - simple doesn’t mean easy and complexity itself doesn’t equal better.')
