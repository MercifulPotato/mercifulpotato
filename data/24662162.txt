Japanese also has kanji invented in Japan which are not valid in Chinese. There are currently 2136 jōyō (general use) kanji, which are the bare minimum you need to known to be considered literate, but if that&#x27;s all you know you&#x27;re going to spend a lot of time with a dictionary. In practice you need at least 3000 characters, which is about the same as you need in Chinese.')
