Families don&#x27;t like selling their farmland, so they rent it out to another farmer.  There are funds that buy farmland to profit from rental or future resale, but again they are not the operators.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;d be helpful if you provided a few examples of these corporations?  Not incorporated family farms, but these for-hire corporations operating at large acreage scales.')
