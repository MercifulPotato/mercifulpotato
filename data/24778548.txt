It can even rewrite all your Dockerfiles and docker-compose files to use those digests.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;safe-waters&#x2F;docker-lock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;safe-waters&#x2F;docker-lock</a><p>Would love for anyone dealing with this issue to check it out!')
