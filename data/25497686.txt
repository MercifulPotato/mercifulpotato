After generating a batch, I review the images and weed out maybe 10% of the really bad ones. I was actually surprised at how well it worked.<p>For training, I spent a lot of time scraping images. I couldn&#x27;t find any good dataset for this purpose. Controlling for quality is pretty tough, and I didn&#x27;t spend nearly as much time as I should. And it&#x27;s evident in the result. Some of the generated arts have pretty low pixel quality if you look at the original image. Luckily, it looks ok on the cards.')
