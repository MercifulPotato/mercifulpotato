Greenwald.<p>He&#x27;s doing a classic strawman: claiming that the &quot;Russian interference&quot; claim was that the Trump campaign co-ordinated with Russia. Outside some fringe beliefs that isn&#x27;t the claim: instead it was that Russia interfered in the election which was exactly what the report found.<p>It found Russian intelligence agencies hacked the DNC, stole the emails and disseminated them via DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks.<p>In regards to involvement of Trump campaign personnel, Greenwald conveniently leaves out the multiple mentions of Paul Manfort (pg 52-55) which the Republican-led intelligence committee confirms &quot;One of Manafortâ€™s closest aides during his time in Ukraine was Konstantin Kilimnik, who the Senate report identifies as a Russian intelligence officer.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s ironic that Greenwald would do what he claims other publications do: only publish material which confirms his views.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intelligence.senate.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;report_volume5.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intelligence.senate.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;docu...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;trump-russia-senate-report-mueller&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;trump-russia-senate-repo...</a>')
