If you didn&#x27;t, your universe would break. Depending on the postulated mechanisms of action, the principles behind the magical invention will have vastly different impact on societies.<p>Star Trek goes into intricate detail trying to explain its warp drives and comes off looking far less grounded than the vast majority of sci-fi properties with FTL or jumpgates or whatnot that either don&#x27;t explain anything, or just offer a few details. Whether it breaks your universe depends on the themes you&#x27;re trying to explore, such as the nth order effects of radical technologies on society. Most of the time, the story isn&#x27;t about the technology (in the same way that Westerns aren&#x27;t always about animal husbandry and gun manufacturing), and it&#x27;s sufficient that you push some buttons, pull a lever and spaceship go brrr.')
