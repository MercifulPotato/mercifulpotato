I&#x27;ve been a heavy user of google services for more than 15 years.<p>For some months now (maybe a year?) I&#x27;ve been trying to reduce dependency on google services and apps. It is a slow process, but I hope to get it done in the next year or so. Meanwhile I try to use google takeout as much as possible to keep up to date backups of my data.<p>My next step will be moving away from Gmail. Will probably register a domain so that I can have an address that is not tied to a specific cloud provider domain. Does anyone have a suggestion of an email provider I can use with custom domain?')
