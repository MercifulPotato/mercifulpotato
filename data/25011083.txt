It&#x27;s a lot of typing but for the most part stuff works the same with a few exceptions (like tooltips).<p>It&#x27;s kind of important too because bugs in Gtk2 aren&#x27;t getting fixed anymore.  I ran into DBUS related issue with Gtk2 and ScrolledWindows in Ubuntu 20 and the dev response was basically &quot;ew, gross, I&#x27;m not touching that&quot;.  Fixing it required me to rewrite the app to use Gtk3 instead.')
