Having shipped multiple projects using both methods my verdict is clear: It doesn&#x27;t matter. Why it doesn&#x27;t matter you ask? Because 1) I am enforcing either decision with eslint rules and 2) i write unit tests 3) code is transpiled (thus semicolons are handled perfectly at the output). Having these three in place, I have yet to encounter a single &quot;gotcha&quot; out of omitting semicolons.<p>If for any reason you absolutelly can&#x27;t have these in place, better be safe and use semicolons.<p>Edit: for the &quot;gotcha&quot; explained in the link, prettier will automatically insert a semicolon before the array.')
