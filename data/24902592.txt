Item(by='blevin', descendants=None, kids=[24902773], score=None, time=1603753885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902180, text='One layer of the internet is about packets, another is about ordered sequential streams — and both are widely supported protocols.  Above these could potentially sit a dissemination layer, retaining and persisting anything of interest.  But in a legal system where information can be speech or property, it is problematic to do that as a standard protocol.  Instead we have archive.org, The Archive Team, BitTorrent, and a million progressively less durable options from there, including some of us running youtube-dl on videos of interest, grabbing PDF’s off Arxiv, SSRN, etc.  I’m not sure what to do about any of this except a yearly donation to archive.org, and accepting the great distributed fitness function of fate.')
