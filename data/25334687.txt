I just moved into a newly renovated house, it has a brand new gas stove which is amazing. But it also has a gas furnace, gas water heater, and a brand new gas washer&#x2F;dryer. No idea why they&#x27;d install a brand new gas dryer in this day and age - likely the power bill is a little cheaper from it (which is itself a problem), but I plan to install solar panels in the not too distant future like many in my neighborhood already have in which case the gas version definitely becomes more expensive.<p>Plus even for the stove, it has an attached gas oven, which doesn&#x27;t really bring me any benefit except maybe a marginally faster pre-heat time that I can live without. It&#x27;s even a net negative to me because now if I want to do any kind of slow cook in the oven I need to worry about ventilation and it&#x27;s hard for it to hold a steady low temperature. Heck even for the stove, I wish it had half electric burners and half gas, if I&#x27;m doing some slower process like making a stock or chili or something I&#x27;d rather use electric to again avoid the fumes.<p>So despite the fact that I love being able to saute over a flame now, I&#x27;d definitely support a tax that makes using gas much more expensive. A full-on ban would be extreme, I&#x27;d agree with you that&#x27;s overly aggressive control, especially until electric burners get better. But ideally I could choose and in places where I actually get a lot of value from it I could pay the higher price to offset my environmental impact, but in all the other uses it would make more economical sense to avoid it so appliance makers, construction companies, etc would be incentivized to drastically reduce the use of gas.')
