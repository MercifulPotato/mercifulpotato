I feel like you&#x27;re overestimating the ability of our regulatory bureaucracy to implement change, or assuming that if you (or I) were dictator the proposal could be done immediately. But imagine flushing out that proposal nationally, getting it through the Legislature (with all the conflicting interests of the medical field, employers, etc), President and then implementation. Comp structures nationally would radically change, so such an overhaul would have to be phased in even if you did get through the gauntlet of bill approval.')
