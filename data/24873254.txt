For example:<p><pre><code>  &lt;items&gt;\n    &lt;item id=&quot;1&quot; attr1=&quot;value 1&quot; attr2=&quot;value 2&quot; attr3=&quot;value 3&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n    &lt;item id=&quot;2&quot; attr1=&quot;value 1&quot; attr2=&quot;value 2&quot; attr3=&quot;value 3&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n    &lt;item id=&quot;3&quot; attr1=&quot;value 1&quot; attr2=&quot;value 2&quot; attr3=&quot;value 3&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n    &lt;item id=&quot;4&quot; attr1=&quot;value 1&quot; attr2=&quot;value 2&quot; attr3=&quot;value 3&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n    &lt;item id=&quot;5&quot; attr1=&quot;value 1&quot; attr2=&quot;value 2&quot; attr3=&quot;value 3&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n  &lt;&#x2F;item&gt;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not something that an IBM committee would have come up with but it fits the needs of an application.  If XML has an &quot;intrinsic fault&quot; it&#x27;s related to DTDs and namespaces which allow for the creation of horrible, complex monstrosities.  XML can be every bit as stripped down and to-the-point as JSON, trading the curley braces for angle brackets.  JSON&#x27;s best point is that it doesn&#x27;t support any of this needless complexity but it&#x27;s still easy enough, with enough nested objects and arrays, to make something that&#x27;s effectively not readable by a human.')
