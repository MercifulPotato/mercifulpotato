Rust already has a pure-Rust regex library. (I&#x27;m its author.) It is the only non-PCRE regex engine to appear in the first 20 results of the regex-redux benchmark. (The 21st I believe is currently RE2.) When using the regex crate, you would not materially benefit from optimizations across library calls, nor is it the difference maker here. Highly optimized regex engines depend more on internal inlining. Take a look at the object code for a program compiled with PCRE2 or the regex crate. You&#x27;ll find huge functions internal to the regex library where inlining has been forced to reduce overhead. Those things are never going to be inlined across library boundaries.')
