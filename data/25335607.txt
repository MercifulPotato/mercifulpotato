There are problems.  The VR games themselves are generally good.  Games generally &quot;just work&quot; but some of the other VR bits and pieces are troublesome.  Each time I play I have to bounce around menus to enable sound through the headset.  And very few media players work in linux (codex issues).  Skybox VR works, but not on the latest version of proton.  I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to watch youtube in VR.<p>I would still recommend VR gaming under linux for all the same reasons I would recommend linux over windows generally, but not to a casual gamer expecting a seamless experience.')
