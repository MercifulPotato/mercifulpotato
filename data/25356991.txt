But you still have an obligation to minimise their network access.<p>Unfortunately they use services hosted on the cloud in dynamic IPs, so you either need to MITM TLS (can’t, no way to change the trusted CA list in these devices), or you need to MITM DNS &#x2F; SNI. It’s not perfect security, and ideally the business simply wouldn’t buy such poorly securable products, but technology decisions are very rarely vetoed by security considerations, especially when cost is a factor. This is an example of the appropriate level of security for the business risk appetite. Telling the business to buy products that can be locked down perfectly is normally a non-starter.')
