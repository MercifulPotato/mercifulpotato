They announced a new website was coming a couple of weeks ago and had the usually puffery about how it’d be better in vague ways (the old one was not noticeably bad). Then the site was down longer than expected. Then everyone was told their order customizations were lost. Now it’s so bad that they’re skipping an entire week’s delivery for all of their customers.<p>I don’t know how they got there but that’s expensive, disrupts their supply chain, and I suspect they’d cheerfully pay four times as much not to have to slog through this mess.')
