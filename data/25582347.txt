Where was your sticking point with them?<p>I started out with BBC BASIC, eventually with a little 6502 assembly for a few bits &amp; bobs, and had no trouble at all seeing the benefit of dropping that bit of structure when I started tinkering with QuickBasic and then C on a PC.<p>In fact if you had a BBC machine new enough to support ADFS, then you had one with a BBC BASIC version that supported procedures and functions in a way that allowed line numbers to be effectively ignored (no GOTO&#x2F;GOSUB needed) in many cases. In fact there were methods to write without them (write the code in a text editor, like the one built in to the Master series, I forget its name, then TYPE it from the file to &quot;add&quot; the line numbers for the interpreter to like).')
