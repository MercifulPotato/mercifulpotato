I would only recommend a vaccine to those aged between 65 and 80. Below that age and you don&#x27;t need it, above that age and it&#x27;s very risky. There were only 800 people above 70 on the pfizer trials, when that cohort is the high risk for this.<p>2. You are referring to post covid syndrome, it&#x27;s well known and not remarkable for Sars2. Weird things happen from viral respiratory infections all the time, covid is no different. Up to the age of 38 or so the seasonal flu has a higher mortality rate. You have a higher chance of dying in a car crash up to the age of 30.  I don&#x27;t have the sources here but they are easily found. After reading the literature extensively on this subject the portrayal of the risk is blown far out of proportion in the media.')
