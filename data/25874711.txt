Item(by='crossroadsguy', descendants=None, kids=[25875802], score=None, time=1611341239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870623, text='For the last few years I have always rooted (or rather I hoped) for Matrix&#x2F;Riot-&gt;Element. So much that for my recreational and token FOSS IM usage (because for mainstream conversation in my country it all has moved to WhatsApp) with select friends I made it a point to request&#x2F;convince them to use Matrix.<p>But when this WhatsApp T&amp;C thingie happened I had to make a choice and ask all my friends and important IM contacts to move to Signal because let&#x27;s face it Matrix is simply not usable for the average user as of now and I guess they will take forever to figure out Signal&#x2F;WhatsApp and Slack&#x2F;IRC&#x2F;Zoom are not two different types of animals but are aliens to each other, especially from an end user&#x27;s UX expectation point of view. So yeah it had to be Signal because no one was going to move to Wire or Threema.<p>Telegram is perfect for casual groups like the ones which form off places like subreddits — e.g. my country&#x27;s book&#x2F;lit subreddit. Besides their apps are a couple of hundred kilometres ahead of others including WhatsApp.<p>So as of now I am going to use Signal. Come 6-7 Feb, and I am deleting my WhatsApp account. Because I am pissed and as someone who deleted Fb, Instagram 6-7 years ago, I just don&#x27;t want to accept that T&amp;C even though I know Fb may get my data or would track me by using other means anyway. It&#x27;d be my personal tiny F.Y. to Zuck.<p>Having said that Signal does and have always made me very uncomfortable:<p>— It&#x27;s headed literally by a benevolent dictator, and boy he does benevolent dictator.<p>— After a while I literally gave up on trying to make sense of their feature&#x2F;dev priority and delivery.<p>— (As you&#x27;ve pointed out) Dev model of their server code is very much questionable and for an app that is &quot;Signal&quot;, this thing has no reason, no excuse — it&#x27;s either there in the open, regularly, and latest, or it&#x27;s not.<p>— It&#x27;s centralized — a catastrophe waiting to happen (oh wait, a technical one just happened).<p>Hell, Telegram and Signal both have open source apps (in fact I can make my own in case of Telegram but in case of Signal — naah!) and they both essentially have closed source servers (even if you discount that for a centralized service you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s on the server).<p>I really wish there was a Telegram like Matrix — esp. the UX — not like Signal&#x2F;WhatsApp.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builtformars.com&#x2F;creating-an-account-with-signal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builtformars.com&#x2F;creating-an-account-with-signal&#x2F;</a> this is good.')
