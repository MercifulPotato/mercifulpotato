It&#x27;s a social media app, people are on there to look at animal videos, celebrity gossip, answer dumb polls etc.<p>Parler&#x27;s growth is happening directly due to the impact of the election, and Twitter adding disclaimers to claims of ballot interference. It won&#x27;t continue at this rate, because besides political kinship, there is nothing there for users to do. Nobody enjoys the political zones of Twitter, unless they&#x27;re &#x27;dunking&#x27; on the opposition. On Parler, there is no opposition.')
