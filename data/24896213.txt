Say, naming a thing, a function definition, and a function invocation are all very visually different in, say, JS, while in LISP it&#x27;s just a slightly different pattern of parens and two keywords (&quot;let&quot; and &quot;lambda&quot;) that are, of course, not actually keywords but just happen to be interpreted in that way by the eval.<p>And yes, human ability to pattern-match things is astonishing, I am sure if I were to program exclusively in Scheme for half a year, I too would one day grow accustomed and used to it. But do I want to? I am really not convinced about that. A human can get used to pretty much anything, even to almost constantly being in mild pain, but... no. I&#x27;d rather just not.')
