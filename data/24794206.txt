I&#x27;d love to see computed goto&#x27;s added to the C standard, but it&#x27;s far too late to change the semantics of switch. Rather, just accept that their code flow semantics make them slightly more type safe syntactic sugar for goto--not just in how they&#x27;re implemented, but in how they can be used.')
