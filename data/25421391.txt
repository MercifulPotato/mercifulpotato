Here in Vienna I can get to all larger nearby cities and capitals for 30-50€ in a cheap seat that easily beats anything economy class on a plane has to offer. The journey takes longer of course (sometimes), which may not be for everyone but I take a longer ride vs all the airport hassle any day. Plus on a train first class is something you can actually afford if you want more space and quiet (another 30 to 50€ extra here).')
