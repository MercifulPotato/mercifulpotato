BTC or any other crypto currency for that matter is nowhere near passing the grandma test, and until it does it will be nothing but speculative novelty equity for the already baptized and a decent alternative for darknet drug dealers.<p>Ironically, the ridiculous volatility fueled by baseless speculation from people who have no idea what they’re doing is one of the main reasons why crypto currency is not being adopted, because no merchant with any serious stake takes a currency seriously that can change by tens of percent in any direction between it entering and leaving your account.<p>Personally I thought crypto currency was an interesting idea when I first heard of it, but now I’m completely fatigued.
