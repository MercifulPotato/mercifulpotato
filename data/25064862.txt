How does it compare to a language like Idris?<p>How come mathematicians are encoding math in Lean instead of Idris for example?<p>Someone please correct me, I don&#x27;t know much about this at all, but I was under the impression that Lean is in a more &quot;imperative&quot; style, while Idris is a functional language. I would have guessed that a functional language would be a better fit for describing math.')
