Perhaps OP is in the not-so-uncommon position of installing Debian on a laptop that doesn&#x27;t come with the <i>one lonely</i> wifi chipset in the last decade that has FOSS firmware.<p>And to replace a godammned Windows 10 install! Debian + non-free is a vast improvement over Windows 10-- am I wrong about that, my dear Debian devs?<p>Is it a requirement for installing Debian to first go dumpster diving for laptop parts? If no, it is some sadistic shit to post a netinstall image that is guaranteed to be broken for 99.99% of laptop users out there.')
