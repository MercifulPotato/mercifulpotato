Enron traded sky high until it didn&#x27;t. Tulip bulbs traded sky high until they didn&#x27;t.<p>That people are willing to pay for it doesn&#x27;t mean it should be worth anything. Worth is not price. And a high price certainly doesn&#x27;t mean something is good for the world. If I offered $1,000,000 for each silverback gorilla pelt you procure, (a) is that a proxy for its worth and (b) is that good for the world?<p>The market tends to conform to my personal biases, my personal investing account just crossed 14X what it was on 3&#x2F;20. I tend to short irrationality but in this case I have no interest in shooting dice in a rigged casino.')
