As the author says, 6 months of &quot;one person, working alone in their bedroom, was able to build a capability which would allow them to seriously compromise iPhone users they&#x27;d come into close contact with&quot;. Even if we assume the author is paid $1,000,000 a year that is still only $500,000 of funding which is an absolute drop in the bucket compared to most businesses.<p>The average small business loan is more than that at $633,000 [1]. Hell, a single McDonalds restaurant [2] costs more than that to setup. In fact, it is not even out of the reach of vast numbers of individuals. Using the net worth percentiles in the US [3], $500,000 is only the 80th percentile of household net worth. That means in the US alone, which has 129 million households, there are literally 25.8 million households with the resources to bankroll such an effort (assuming they were willing to liquidate their net worth). You need to increase the cost by 1,000x to 10,000x before you get a point where it is out of reach for anybody except for large governments and you need to increase the cost by 100,000x to 1,000,000x before it actually becomes infeasible for any government to bankroll such attacks.<p>tl;dr It is way worse than you say. <i>Every</i> government can fund such an effort. <i>Every</i> Fortune 500 company can fund such an effort. <i>Every</i> multinational can fund such an effort. Probably ~50% of small businesses can fund such an effort. ~20% of people in the US can fund such an effort. The costs of these attacks aren&#x27;t rookie numbers, they are baby numbers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fundera.com&#x2F;business-loans&#x2F;guides&#x2F;average-small-business-loan-amount" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fundera.com&#x2F;business-loans&#x2F;guides&#x2F;average-small-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcdonalds.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;franchising&#x2F;new-restaurants.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcdonalds.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;franchising&#x2F;new-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles&#x2F;</a>')
