Its not one time fee. Its yearly fee.  and $100 is probably half of 1 month salary in many Asian countries.<p>&gt; &quot;Distributing an OSS app requires neither a domain name nor an SSL certificate&quot;<p>One can just release app on homebrew or even github release and guess what they don&#x27;t need domain name or certs.
