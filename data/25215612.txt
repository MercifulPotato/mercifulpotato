Football grew to be what it was from the slums in Latin America. It&#x27;s always been human, analog, with all the faults this may have - perfect in its imperfection. If you&#x27;ve grown up watching the game, many of the memories are about some poor (intentional or not) calls -- offsides that weren&#x27;t, handballs that were let to pass, penalties that weren&#x27;t called, etc. And we still talk about these moments (or even still argue about them) at social gatherings and coffee shops. That&#x27;s part of the appeal of the game. Celebrating the humanity of it, with all its mishaps. Similar to e.g. a vinyl record vs a lossless FLAC multi-channel recording - no denying the latter is superior, but the former has bugs (imperfections) that for some are features. Sadly, with more and more $$ being poured into the game (at least for big leagues like UEFA CL), we&#x27;ve lost some of this &quot;analog-ness&quot; of the sport. You gain something by losing something else.')
