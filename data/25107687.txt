In a few years you will probably start having more frequent attacks. Lossing weight is little more effective. Keeping your uric acid well below 6.0 mg&#x2F;dL is when the process starts very very slowly reversing.<p>Fortunately there is a better understanding of the dissease and more new therapies in the pipeline.<p>&gt; Dedicated gout research, going on quietly in the background of other breathtaking advances in rheumatology, is now paying off. This comes at a time when the number of patients affected by gout continues to rise, mainly due to an epidemic of obesity. An effort to improve lifestyle choices as a society and better management of the disease by clinicians should have a positive impact on gout incidence and outcome in our lifetimes.<p>&gt; Importantly, prophylaxis may prevent the acute inflammatory response to crystals, but will not alter crystal deposition and ongoing joint damage, so the patient may well be unaware of progressive tophi formation and destruction of cartilage and bone. Therefore, prophylaxis should only be employed with effective ULT.<p>&gt; Treatment is lifelong with a dose sufficient to maintain the serum urate below 6.8 mg&#x2F;dl (404 μmol&#x2F;l), preferably below 6.0 mg&#x2F;dl (357 μmol&#x2F;l). Anything short of this does not reverse the process, but merely slows the rate at which crystal deposition continues. The lower the serum urate achieved, the faster tophaceous deposits will resolve [1]<p>Latest evidence on gout management: what the clinician needs to know - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3539261&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3539261&#x2F;</a>')
