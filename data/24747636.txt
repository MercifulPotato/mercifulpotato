Most of the stuff Spotify suggests to me are either complete bangers or listen-worthy at worst.<p>Apple&#x27;s stuff though... It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t have ANY intelligence in the system at all. I listen to 80&#x27;s gangsta-rap once, then I get modern mumblerap shit for months and months.<p>BUT I do love how Apple Music integrates with my iOS devices and I think the sound quality is better. So I just use Songshift to sync the discovery playlists to AM (semi)automatically.')
