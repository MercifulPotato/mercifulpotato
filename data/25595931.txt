If I did, they would likely tell me to fuck off because they are busy with some other task. The only sort of issues where it&#x27;s appropriate to drop what you are doing and immediately fix it are the most severe issues which need to be fixed <i>right now</i>.<p>&gt; I work at a big company, and every time the IT Helpdesk does a password reset they open a ticket, then mark it as closed, every time they do a password reset (because they get marked on how quickly they close tickets).<p>In general, if documenting an issue (of any sort) is more work than resolving the issue, you shouldn&#x27;t bother documenting it.<p>But as a developer, many of those easy to fix issues are found by people who don&#x27;t have the skills or resources to fix them. The best way for someone to communicate those problems is <i>usually</i> some kind of ticketing system.')
