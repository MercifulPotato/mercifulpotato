One was of feeling like an imposter, in that even as a software engineer I lack both the patience and skill to pull the debugging off the article showcased. It&#x27;s both admiration and lament at the same time. The second point was that I personally prefer to altogether avoid issues like this if I can by selecting what I feel is the best available tool at the time. I have tried to use Emacs multiple times, and while this exact issue is not one I have encountered (I did say &quot;these <i>types</i> of issues&quot;), I have come across similar issues, especially with having Emacs talk to another computer or VM. Every time I have tried to get into Emacs, I end up hitting some barrier akin to these things, and so I resign myself to using Visual Studio Code, where then I get off to coding rather than trying to bend the environment to what I&#x27;d like. And it always seems that with Visual Studio Code it both does what I&#x27;d like <i>and</i> works without a million gotchas.<p>Visual Studio Code is not perfect, and I have had issues with it and expect more issues. However, they don&#x27;t hit me as early as they seem to with Emacs, and that&#x27;s an important distinction. The remoting extension is extremely seamless, and I have not seen an Emacs example of matching anything close to it.<p>It really comes down to personality. If I was a carpenter and had a broken hammer, I wouldn&#x27;t go off rebuilding the hammer or designing one from scratch. I&#x27;d do my best to find someone else who&#x27;s already built a hammer that works. That doesn&#x27;t imply I never expect the hammer to never break.<p>&gt; would prefer to know that such issues can be fixed with or without vendor participation<p>Visual Studio Code is open source and well-managed. I&#x27;d prefer that a solution be merged into the tool for everyone, rather than being buried in someone&#x27;s .emacs file.')
