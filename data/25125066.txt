The instances of government&#x2F;corporation reactions to DOH that we have seen suggest that untrustworthy organizations and governments largely oppose the change. They would not oppose the change if it was in their best interest.<p>Worth noting that anyone can set up a DOH server. You can even set up your own server in your own house and use it the same way that you would a Pi-hole. To the extent that malware providers or IoT providers will use this to circumvent blocks, they already had the ability to do that -- and IoT services like Chromecasts have already experimented in the past with setting their own DNS providers and ignoring network settings.<p>We do not need to open up our networks to MiTM attacks to avoid centralization. Unencrypted DNS is a <i>bad</i> idea, it isn&#x27;t complicated.')
