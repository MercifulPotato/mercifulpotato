Any advertising is the devil incarnate to some people.<p>The title worked fwiw.<p>Just take the criticism related to the product itself.<p>Which, to me, looks very interesting, but I&#x27;m not into audio at all.<p>So my dumb question is, do you use this to emulate guitar sounds or can you plug in a guitar through a computer and use this plugin as an amp? D:<p>I&#x27;m too tired, I&#x27;ll re-read the GitHub page to maybe understand it better.<p>Best of luck!')
