This is the MOST important tip. Do not let your past determine your future.<p>2) Be consistent. Have an accountability partner to make sure you are working towards your goal every single day.<p>2) Master one or two specialized skills which are in-demand the most, pay the most, and are likely to be there for the next ten years. Do not learn them, master them.<p>3) Build projects in those areas.<p>4) Whenever you have questions, ask. Ask the top people working in those areas. Make a note of the helpful ones.<p>5) Interact with, and help people who are working in those areas, whenever you get a chance. Attend every webinar, conference and meetup. Nowadays, it is easier because you are not constrained by geography.<p>6) Once you have achieved near-mastery, start applying for jobs in those areas. At the same time, keep building projects. Do not slack off on either one.<p>7) Once you get a job, make sure to save as much as you can. Do not end up with a low net worth ever again. Learn more and more at the same time.<p>8) Get better jobs. Your only criteria for switching jobs should be more salary.<p>Not stock options. Do not gamble, your life is passing you by.<p>Not titles, unless you have a clear plan to leverage your title into a better paying job.<p>Not &quot;job safety&quot; - it is never safe. You being in an in-demand area is your job safety.<p>9) Put your money in low risk investments. Google &quot;best low-risk investments&quot; - there are many sites with lists. Invest in near-zero risk investments and park your money there. Do not touch it.<p>If you really, really decide to invest in stock market:<p>Look at the general trend of stock market. Invest only when it is going up. Never bet against market. If you invest, buy only stocks or indices you plan to hold for ten years. Never sell. Make sure to have stop losses added to do that for you. When those stop losses get executed frequently, get out of the market. Do not try to do value plays. You may not live enough to see the market reversal.<p>Stay away from cryptocurrencies, GME, BB, .... They are not for you. If you want to join the fun, buy ONE stock or one cheap cryptocurrency. Just one. That will give you the same thrill, without the associated risk.<p>10) Retire at the age of 48 or 49 and make a &quot;Thank you HN&quot; post here.')
