It seems that the status quo has failed to facilitate rational discussion.<p>&gt; Which matters more: rational minds, or truth?<p>That question is based on a false premise.  Irrational minds aren&#x27;t going to arrive at truth through their own processes, except by accident.<p>And &quot;free expression of all ideas through current means&quot; hasn&#x27;t allowed the truth to prevail, either.  It&#x27;s allowed even blatant, meritless lies such as QAnon and &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; to become widespread and influential, supported by a whole constellation of other more subtle lies.')
