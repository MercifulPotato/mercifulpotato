Most claims around anecdotes come with an unspoken assumption we ought to see steady improvement over time vs a step-function like behavior. The latter seems somewhat possible given the nature of how improvements in AI systems seem to happen.<p>That is true, but it&#x27;s actually an argument _against_ the assumption of full self-driving capability being just around the corner. Because that assumption itself is based solely on observed recent progress, which - as you correcly state - can be very misleading when used as a means to extrapolate the future due to the tendency of the AI field to have long stretches of very little to nearly no progress at all, divided by huge leaps followed by stretches of very fast progress in specific sub-areas of the field. We clearly have seen such a stretch recently, triggered by the deep learning idea and enabled by an explosion in parallel computing capability over the course of the last decade.')
