Is there really any country in the EU which is not in it for the money and security of its citizens alone? What other motive would a country have to be in the EU, barring ostensibly moralistic arguments, which in themselves will be made with economic motives? Some people win from the recovery fund, and some people don’t. The EU is not a dictatorship. If a country stands to lose, it should be able to make an attempt to have its case accepted. The UK’s hypothetical rejection is no different from a country’s complaint against this very rejection. Both are done with the same motive, and should be treated in an equally sober way.<p>Edit: I’ve tried to make a faithful argument. Please explain instead of downvoting.')
