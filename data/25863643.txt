So this library exposes all of Microsoft’s DLL surface area in an API-native way. That’s important.<p>Now that it’s released, library authors can wrap this with another library, which abstracts over win32, reexposing it in safe rust. Wrapper libraries like that almost certainly won’t cover 100% of the api surface area - there are <i>so many</i> functions in the windows APIs.<p>Anyway, give it time. People will wrap this with safe rust.')
