It&#x27;s fairly common to see adult Japanese reading manga on the train, for instance.<p>The manga adult readers consume is not like the stuff we enjoy, like One Piece. Adult manga appears to fulfill the same role for Japanese that &quot;airport fiction&quot; does for us, and is broadly similar in genre: spy thrillers, workplace dramas, romance, etc. The art style is also way different, more mature and realistic with less broad caricature and more emphasis on adult rather than young&#x2F;teenage characters.')
