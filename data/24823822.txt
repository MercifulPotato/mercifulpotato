I wasn&#x27;t saying the option of turning it off shouldn&#x27;t be given. I&#x27;m saying that the setting should have been mandatory.<p>People wanting to do it the &quot;easy&quot; way (using scare quotes because turning any XSS into an RCE feels like hard mode to me) set contextIsolation to false and they are done.<p>Also consider newly created applications: when the limitations exist from the start, it&#x27;s much easier to build this correctly (the same way it&#x27;s easier to get to 100% test coverage if you start with TDD than if you have to refactor years of static methods and global state and implicit dependencies).<p>By having a default setting and having it default to insecure, even newly created applications will be unsafe and will require refactoring in the future.')
