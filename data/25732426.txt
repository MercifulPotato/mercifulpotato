Think of a newspaper (=private entity) decides to boycott a president and not write anything about him. Wouldn&#x27;t it be the <i>polar opposite</i> of free speech if the president then had the power to force them to write about him?<p>I <i>get</i> that a payment service is not the same as a newspaper, but it is still a private entity.')
