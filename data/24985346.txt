Sure, the occasional paper jam etc., and experience with the office printer that is  beyond it&#x27;s useful lifetime in terms of lifetime prints or underspec&#x27;ed for its monthly duty cycle, and we replace it.<p>As for ink expense, yeah that&#x27;s been an issue for decades though it is not due to lack of technical advances, but to vendor lock in. However, most brands now offer printer options slightly more expensive than an entry level ink jet that have ink tanks instead of cartridges. I recently replaced my 6 year old work horse with one: It came with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and each replacement color is $15, again for the equivalent of 10 cartridges.')
