It reminded me of the Pacific North West in the USA and Canada, but it was just foreign enough and a little bit different to make it seem incredibly magical. For example, you would have brown bears and eagles, but you might also see Siberian Tigers. You could meet an indigenous hunter, like Derzu Uzala, but you could also meet Russians, Chinese, and Koreans. I second the recommendation for the film, and I&#x27;d also highly recommend the book.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Dersu-Trapper-Recovered-Classics-Arsenev&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0929701496&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Dersu-Trapper-Recovered-Classics-Ar...</a>')
