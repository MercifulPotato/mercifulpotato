If there&#x27;s some other use case for that drug (your &quot;off label&quot; application) then it will pass through the approval process with efficacy proven for that.<p>I think it&#x27;s more of a dilemma that off label scrips aren&#x27;t used more often. Since there&#x27;s zero monetary incentive to prove efficacy for a second application and doctors generally prefer officially sanctioned uses, lots of patients miss out on helpful treatment.')
