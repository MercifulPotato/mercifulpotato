It&#x27;s amazing how callous people can be to simply say &quot;good&quot; and move on, nevermind that people actually benefited massively from this and that most of those people used it in good faith, and likely did not attempt to bring ostriches and ponies aboard.<p>Not to mention the comments that say something to the effect of &quot;well even if it did help a few people, it drove up prices for everyone&quot;. The implication being that disabled people only deserve accommodations (and therefore the right to participate in society) when they are convenient for everyone&#x2F;companies.<p>It&#x27;s very telling that these are the responses of the community when it comes to disabled people rather than the responses we see on other threads about how some framework or Salas is dropping support for some beloved feature, i.e. responses such as &quot;why can&#x27;t we try X? Won&#x27;t Y work?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m physically ill reading the comments here.')
