I assume it means government departments, insurance firms, external legal&#x2F;finance services. I don&#x27;t think the data refers to  a salary-bysalary breakdown of costs.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s best to look at these things from the ground up. Doctors, nurses. How many? How much are they paid? Is the diff more or less than mean diff? If no, move on, If yes, dig deeper.<p>You really can&#x27;t even rely on price data to tell you much. Most of these markets have a broken or absent price system. The underlying answer though, inevitably will likely be &quot;because they&#x27;re run differently.&quot;')
