It is pretty well known in military intelligence circles that China wishes to annex the eastern Indian states. They <i>already</i> consider several areas of the Indian eastern states within their national borders - see the official national maps of the PLA.<p>PLA has official strategy - part of their SOP inculcated into their officer corps - to regularly push incursions into Indian territory and check the response of the Indian central government. We have already lost 1000 square km over the last couple of years. 38,000 square km over the last decade if you consider our formally acknowledged boundaries.<p>So, yes, unless you wish to lose the Indian eastern states, access to natural resources and secede control over the vast majority of the Indian water supply, one will need to remain vigilant and ready. That includes heavy military readiness.<p>The other option is to kneel to China and become a vassal state. No double the condition of roads would improve ? All you have to do is love the CCP.')
