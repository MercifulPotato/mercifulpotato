Combined with my MacBook&#x27;s TouchBar that goes to sleep if you&#x27;re thinking and not using the keyboard constantly whilst debugging, it drives me insane as you have to press a key to wake it up for no purpose, look down, find F6 or whatever for continue&#x2F;step over because there&#x27;s no physical keys and it&#x27;s like pressing a ruler, and then flail around to get the scrollbars to appear.<p>It&#x27;s such a regression in usability. Imagine if they did this in cars - simply wave your arms around for the steering wheel to appear when you need it!')
