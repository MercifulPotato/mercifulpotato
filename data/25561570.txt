(Something that I fully support, and something that is actively being worked on by some groups in California, just not any of the supposed &quot;tenant&quot; groups that never support new housing.)<p>Even in Red Vienna or Singapore, there are still market-rate housing! And the only way they keep the market rate housing low is by having enough housing. Singapore, in particluar, is really good at building tons of public housing. And their policies would horrify all the preservationist fake-progressives in SF, because they just build build build, and do it at heights greater than three stories. And Vienna&#x27;s public housing would similarly horrify the fake progressives in SF that stop all new housing.<p>Public housing is great, but if you&#x27;re looking to see it happen in SF, look to the Mods, not the Progs.')
