Is there a reasonable quantity of unused domain names for an individual to own before it becomes unethical?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to hold a domain from someone else who wanted it in good faith and was going to use it (like I hope to, eventually), but if I want a good domain name for a product I&#x27;m building in the future, I have to play the game a bit ahead of time.')
