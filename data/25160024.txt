There was a Warp Speed commitment to by 100m doses after it is approved which you might argue is some encouragement, but Japan did the same thing with 120m doses, and the EU did it for 300m <i>and</i> provided upfront money for R&amp;D.<p>The US did also do the upfront money + commitment to purchase after approval for some vaccines, such as the Moderna one, so if you want to thank the US that is the one to do it for.')
