Vulkan gives me some hope.<p>Cyberpunk is superficially about technology, but I think Noita is a much geekier game. Made in Finland, the country that added demoscene to Unesco. Every pixel is simulated, lots of tinkering, emergence; you craft your &#x27;weapons&#x27; all the time. The game&#x27;s requirements say: &quot;The more cores the better&quot;.<p>Note it&#x27;s common among reviewers to say Cyberpunk is NOT about technology but rather about capitalism in overdrive. The game&#x27;s technical themes are all old cliches: Johnny Mnemonic, brain machine interface, computer viruses.')
