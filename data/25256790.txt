Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=[25257161], score=None, time=1606759405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256423, text='Well, then, citation needed regarding &quot;wealthy heirs with East Coast educations, [and] vestigial Mexican land grants, ...[whose] plan of record really is to block all solutions to SF&#x27;s housing crisis and wait for a recession,&quot;  And, are you willing to even consider the possibility that people in the tech industry actually <i>are</i> &quot;gentrifying techie scum,&quot; or, some significantly less loaded version of that?<p>It&#x27;s pretty indisputable that the tech industry has raised housing prices in the Bay Area, mostly because Silicon Valley is no longer a gigantic orchard. Basic economics says that when you take land and put it to a more productive use, as measured by how much money one can make using said land for said new purpose, the price of the land + improvements goes up.  That&#x27;s literally what&#x27;s happening, and people are being forced out because of it.  That&#x27;s the actual definition of &quot;gentrification.&quot;  &quot;Scum&quot; is just a pejorative qualifier that would be used by those who don&#x27;t approve of this dynamic, which, while it displays an ignorance of basic economic principles, is entirely understandable in terms of human psychology.<p>And, it seems utterly stupid for these people to <i>want</i> to crash the local economy, just to get rid of the most productive sector <i>of</i> the economy.  Unless there&#x27;s some other master plan you&#x27;re not elucidating, and, for which you&#x27;d need to provide an actual citation, Occam&#x27;s Razor says this is absolutely absurd.<p>Do you see where I&#x27;m going with this?  The scenario you posit, in the terms you describe it, makes city leadership sound like a bunch of literal cartoon villains.  While I don&#x27;t believe they are immune from self interest, and the influence of money in politics, chasing that money away deliberately just doesn&#x27;t fit in with the simpler &quot;follow the money&quot; scenario, unless there&#x27;s something more to it than you&#x27;re alleging.<p>Edit: moved the bit about SF leadership being deliberately obstructionist to the correct quote.')
