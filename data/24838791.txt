Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[24839148, 24841239, 24840744], score=None, time=1603208988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24837330, text='As noted by a sibling comment, he&#x27;s not rhyming the -iums, he&#x27;s rhyming the antepenultimate syllable (selenium&#x2F;rhenium, germanium&#x2F;uranium, vanadium&#x2F;radium, gallium&#x2F;thallium, rubidium&#x2F;iridium, samarium&#x2F;barium). But the other thing he leans heavily into is alliteration. The third verse is chock full of this:<p>Holmium, helium, hafnium, erbium (all h, save the rhyme)<p>Phosphorous, francium, fluorine, terbium (all f, save rhyme)<p>Manganese, mercury, molybdenum, magnesium (all m)<p>Dysprosium, scandium, cerium, cesium (all s sounds, save the first)<p>Lead, praseodymium, platinum, plutonium (most p sounds)<p>Palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium (continue p sounds)<p>Tantalum, technetium, titanium, tellurium (t sounds now)<p>Cadmium, calcium, chromium, curium (k sounds now)<p>There&#x27;s also the point to make that most element names are 3-4 syllables long, so the verses are structured with 4 elements per line. The extra-long praseodymium and neodymium are paired with the very short lead and nickel respectively, for example. In fact, prior to the last verse, the 4 elements per line is violated just once (last line before the intermezzo crams in &quot;bismuth, bromine, lithium, beryllium, barium&quot;). The last verse goes a regular 4 elements, then 3, and then launches into this:<p>* argon, krypton, neon, radon, xenon, zinc, rhodium<p>* chlorine, carbon, cobalt, copper, tungsten, tin, sodium<p>The first of these lines rhymes all the -ons at the end, and the second goes for alliteration instead.<p>Of course, there are a few failures to align all the elements by alliteration or rhyme. The ones in the last verse align instead by other means (first you have californium, fermium, berkelium--all named after the same place; then you have mendelevium, einsteinium, nobelium--all named after scientists). Now that&#x27;s clever!')
