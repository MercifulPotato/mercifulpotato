They give out new USDT for $1 a piece.</i><p>If this were the case, Tether would be back by cash. But it isn&#x27;t: they claim it&#x27;s backed by cash, cash-equivalents and receivables from loans, including loans to affiliated entities (or some similar language).<p>So, for example: they could create 1M USDT and immediately loan it to their associated crypto-hedge-fund (for zero interest). The hedge-fund promises to repay that loan in USD (creating &#x27;reserves&#x27; for USDT), and immediately places buy orders for Bitcoin; generating demand for Bitcoin that will raise the price.')
