AFAIK there is no reason to assume it Covid differs in that respect.<p>&gt; Those are confirmed cases. That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s only 4 total.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are more, but how many? There have been hundreds of millions of infections (according to the WHO). If there are a few dozen or even a thousand reinfections among them, it&#x27;s not a phenomenon we need to worry about.<p>We could assume that reinfections are common even without any evidence for or against, but then we are playing something akin to Pascal&#x27;s wager. Also, I think if reinfections were common, by now we would very likely have evidence for that by now.')
