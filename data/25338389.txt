It would raise the temperature, but it wouldn&#x27;t result in human-breathable atmosphere, if that was a goal.<p>Perhaps there aren&#x27;t any better alternatives, but I&#x27;d think that orbital mirrors at least would be an option (like the soletta from Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s Mars trilogy), though the scale of construction would be beyond anything that&#x27;s been done before even if it were extremely thin.  Placing a million square miles of mylar into space doesn&#x27;t sound like an easy problem, though something much smaller and specifically focused at, say, the equator or specific sites might be more practical.')
