If status doesn&#x27;t matter in your corporate culture you just have to be aware of the importance of the meeting. If you company is fighting for survival it is probably not funny to derail the discussion.<p>However, there are many unimportant meetings with people with the same status and I agree that if it doesn&#x27;t become a pattern it can be a sweet&#x2F;nice&#x2F;funny distraction ;-)')
