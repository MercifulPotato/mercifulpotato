No. For token generation I used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canarytokens.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canarytokens.org&#x2F;</a> so the only information I got was abou triggering the token, but not the context in which it was triggered.<p>BTW. GitHub (apart from GitGuardian) also has Secret Scanning feature [1] that basically allows the provider to act on the leaked secret. Amazon is integrated and it should invalidate and inform the owner but this also went to Thinkst, not me, so I don&#x27;t know if it was actually invalidated and alerted.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.github.com&#x2F;partnerships&#x2F;secret-scanning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.github.com&#x2F;partnerships&#x2F;secret-scanning&#x2F;</a>')
