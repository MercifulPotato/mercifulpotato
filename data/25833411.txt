Landings in an aircraft that you have flown for any length of time are not all that hard. In many cases I have been in aircraft that &quot;land long&quot; so as to not have to taxi 3 miles (literally) to get to the gate or parking area.<p>I would imagine there is a bit of risk mitigation with AF1 as it relates to taxiing on the ground. As you state (correctly I surmise) the best place for AF1 to be is in the air. The worst, is unprotected on the ground. The secret service is great, but I don&#x27;t see them clearing a mile of taxiway in multiple directions for the safety of the aircraft.<p>Best to land long, turn off at taxiway and be at your destination with proper equipment nearby as soon as possible.')
