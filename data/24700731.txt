Fatigue is very much a physical thing, not psychological. It&#x27;s just that medically, we have no way to quantify it, so it doesn&#x27;t show up easily in lab tests. That does NOT mean it doesn&#x27;t exist, or that it only exists in the head. (edit: and before someone says &quot;lactate&quot;, keep in mind that that only measures muscle strain, one of the few forms of fatigue that we do know how to measure)<p>How people <i>experience fatigue</i> has a psychological component, but saying to someone who has been fatigued for years that their issues are predominantly psychological is very dismissive. Odds are they&#x27;ve been hearing that from their physicians for a long time already.')
