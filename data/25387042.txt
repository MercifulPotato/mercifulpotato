Once again, Apple has stated that Bootcamp for Apple Silicon is &quot;up to Microsoft&quot;. And ARM Macs are still just a minority of the computers that Apple sells. The rest have Bootcamp, which allows you to just turn your Mac into a Windows machine.<p>Saying that &quot;Apple will never allow you to replace macOS&quot; is just plain wrong when they&#x27;ve been allowing you to do that for the past 14 years.<p>You might as well argue how Bootcamp doesn&#x27;t run on iPads.')
