Guilt is already an emotion that exists for society, not for self-interest, it relies on morals, which all are learned through other people. If people are leaning more towards denial, it means that the cost for an individual to do something immoral is already too high, doesn&#x27;t leave much room for mistakes that people inevitably make from time to time, so more people denying might be a natural feedback loop to make more space.')
