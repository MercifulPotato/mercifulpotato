Maybe I misunderstood the claim.<p>I personally agree that the practical potential of Rust is oversold, especially in areas like kernels, low-level interfaces, etc. Bugs in those types of applications are often precisely at language and environmental interface boundaries, places where stronger type systems don&#x27;t help. Similarly, AFAIU the current Rust toolchain doesn&#x27;t do a stellar job at eliding as many bounds checks as theoretically possible, and I&#x27;m probably less optimistic than most about the pace of improvements on that front.<p>It&#x27;s just like with C++ or Java. It&#x27;s easy to write a small microbenchmark or program where a compiler generates code that readily outclasses a typical, textbook C implementation. But that effect never seems to scale. People end up structuring their C++ and Rust programs the same way they&#x27;d structure a Python program, and even the best compilers can&#x27;t turn lead into gold.')
