It&#x27;s easier that way.<p>Good to hear that. It&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve done so far (transitioning from our own keys, etc. as the project gets closer to finished). It has sometimes been difficult with non-technical clients to, e.g., walk them through the process of getting their own certificates.<p>When we&#x27;re integrating with a client who has their own engineering staff, it&#x27;s pretty much a non-issue.')
