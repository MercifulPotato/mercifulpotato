The NYC Second Avenue subway involves extremely complex construction in a location surrounded by other subway lines and infrastructure.  The Los Angeles subways examined are extremely deep underground in a rocky and seismically unstable situation.  In all of these cases there were extreme challenges unlike those found in other cases.<p>Note that the Second Ave subway had been proposed and discussed for around one hundred years and was consistently considered too challenging to be practical.  Doesn&#x27;t it make sense that a situation like that would be extremely expensive to eventually deal with?  Does finally building a subway line that for one hundred years was considered out of reach really compare directly to the construction currently or recently happening in other countries?')
