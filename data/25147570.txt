Quake 1 had amazing art direction and each chapter had its own feel because each of them was designed by a different dev following his own ideas.<p>I think perhaps the biggest reason why Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal don&#x27;t feel &quot;creepy&quot; like the old games is because they are completely missing the point. The newer games are fun, beautiful, well designed games. However, instead of making a game that captures the essence of Doom its more like a Michael Bay version of Doom. Instead of desperately fighting never ending hordes of increasingly horrifying creatures from hell so you can get out in one piece and save the world, you&#x27;re an unkillable demigod that&#x27;s basically dunking on armies of demons for lulz. The whole way the story makes it seem like its a foregone conclusion that you&#x27;ve won. Its not a struggle, its just you punishing the hordes of hell that are powerless to stop you.<p>Aesthetically they nailed the look of the creatures although as you pointed out less can be more. The sound track is good but at some point the composer was consumed by his own pretentiousness (IMO Dusk&#x27;s composer that replaced him produces far better &quot;Doom&quot; music). The combat is fun and if it wasn&#x27;t a Doom game it would still be rightly lauded as one of the best shooters of the generation, but glory kills annihilate the flow of the game IMO and detract from any authentic feeling it may have had. Glory kills feel like shortened, dumbed-down quick time events that you&#x27;re supposed to spam the entire time you play and quick time events always feel bad.<p>They are some of the best single player games I&#x27;ve played in years, but I was there with Id since the Commander Keen games and this does not feel like a Doom game to me.<p>I mean its literally a Doom game, but the franchise has clearly lost something and I feel like a lot of the people that preach about how authentically they captured the experience might be too young to have bothered to play it.<p>Doom II: Hell On Earth is IMO one of the top 5 games of all time. Quake 1 is also on the list. I hope some day we get proper remakes or spiritual successors that capture not just the aesthetic, but the feel and the point of the original games.<p>Dusk was a decently sized step in the right direction.')
