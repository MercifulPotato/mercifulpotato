This someone wasn&#x27;t able to change any of this, and also didn&#x27;t have power to choose another vendor.<p>If you followed the rules by the book, you couldn&#x27;t even introduce a third machine to authenticate things without this silly protection. So, what should did they do?<p>Installed the antivirus on a virtual machine with no access to the host computer, and program it to be fired up for a couple of minutes a day, just to keep the stupid antivirus happy by calling home.')
