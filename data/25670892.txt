I like the way they are doing many thinks and they have many small goodies (like you can give a small &quot;thump up&#x2F;down&quot; to messages in 1-to-1 chats from the message received notification to indicate agreement&#x2F;acceptance). Or the way they handle accounts (separate from phone number and license, you can give people your Threema id without giving them your phone, the &quot;trust levels&quot;, etc.). Or that they have a clear&amp;clean business model. There are also a bunch of aspects which are useful if used in a e.g. business context like account revoke-ability, in person QR code based key exchange, fixed chat history etc.')
