Well, up until now none of the European car manufacturers have made any real efforts to design, build and market a corporate road warrior car (think Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall&#x2F;Opel&#x2F;GM Vectra, BMW 3 series etc). The kinda thing that batters up and down the M1, M4, M6 etc with a member off staff, a laptop and their suitcase.<p>I reckon their R&amp;D depts have been quietly busy on the problem of extended battery life etc, but for now they&#x27;re milking the ICE for all they can get. It takes on average 6-10 years to bring a new car to market, when properly focused. I reckon the big European names are now very focused. It&#x27;s tick-tock time for Tesla.')
