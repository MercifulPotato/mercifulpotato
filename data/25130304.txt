That&#x27;s what makes the Bay so weird. There&#x27;s no way to escape the high prices.<p>I&#x27;ve lived all over the Northeast and the Northeast is definitely expensive but there are absolutely cheap places out there. You can live in a suburb of Providence, Rhode Island, and commute one hair on a direct train to downtown Boston. You can live in much cheaper Lowell or Lawrence and commute, again, one hour to downtown Boston. You can live in Worcester, again, one hour to downtown Boston. And the city has little pockets of affordability, albeit in less nice&#x2F;higher crime parts, but they do exist.<p>SF really doesn&#x27;t have this. The public transit is lacking so it&#x27;s basically cheaper =&gt; closer to the jobs, with few exceptions.')
