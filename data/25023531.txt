The struggles that America has aren&#x27;t that it doesn&#x27;t have a common culture, the struggles are that it has too many veto points in its political process so it is extremely difficult for popular majorities to execute on a political vision, and it is extremely difficult for the population of the country to hold their leaders accountable when the multiple veto points lead to a diffusion of responsibility. The struggle we have is that popular majorities cannot enact their policy preferences, and then do not receive electoral feedback based on the policies they enact. America doesn&#x27;t need a common culture, it needs a better feedback loop for things to go from idea -&gt; popular will -&gt; political power -&gt; policy change -&gt; impact on the people.')
