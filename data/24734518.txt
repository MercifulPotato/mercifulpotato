Item(by='phobosanomaly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602278123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733628, text='Well, the sentiment of my comment was more in amazement of how broad the official definition of domestic terrorism is (more broad than the colloquial definition as I have used it and seen it used).<p>Any peaceful protest that happens to, for example, temporarily obstruct traffic on a side-street could be characterized as domestic terrorism under that definition.<p>The fire that occurred at the Portland mayor&#x27;s residence was definitely arson. A splinter group of 200 people broke off from the main protest at around 11:00 at night, trashed the ground floor of a residential high-rise, and some people set some newspapers on fire that was quickly put out. 20 people were arrested in association with this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oregonlive.com&#x2F;portland&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;protesters-march-to-portland-mayor-ted-wheelers-residence-monday-throw-birthday-party-demand-resignation-live-updates.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oregonlive.com&#x2F;portland&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;protesters-march...</a><p>So again, the ground floor of a residential hi-rise was trashed, some people lit some newspapers on fire, nobody was hurt, and the people involved were arrested.<p>I really think that&#x27;s stretching the definition of terrorism (as it is used in common language, it does most definitely meet the FBI&#x27;s definition cited in the above comment). Out of the thousands of people who attended the protests, this seems to me like a small subset did something stupid that produced a small amount of property damage.<p>This is not an organized, funded effort to systematically intimidate through the implicit threat of force in the way armed protestors in Michigan have been doing:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-52496514" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-52496514</a><p>The sentiment of those present is summarized by this Senator&#x27;s tweet (cited in the BBC article):\n&quot;Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us. Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them. I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today.&quot;<p>Seems like a pretty clear-cut attempt to intimidate through the implicit threat of violence.<p>Have the Portland protestors attempted anything remotely as organized and intended to intimidate to further a political agenda than the latest Michigan kidnapping plot?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;920314527&#x2F;the-michigan-kidnapping-plot-and-whats-fueling-right-wing-extremism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;920314527&#x2F;the-michigan-kidnap...</a><p>I&#x27;m guessing based on your comments that you are also deeply disturbed by armed, organized, and well-funded right-wing militia&#x2F;terrorist groups running around intimidating Senators with AR-15s and cooking up elaborate schemes to kidnap them. These groups scare me. It&#x27;s not some random protestors doing something stupid and spur-of-the-moment. It&#x27;s well thought out, planned, funded, and armed. It&#x27;s organized with clear goals, and organizational hierarchies. And it has pockets of tacit state support.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wbur.org&#x2F;onpoint&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;right-wing-militias-and-police" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wbur.org&#x2F;onpoint&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;right-wing-militias-...</a><p>If the small splinter group of Portland protestors had secured the ground floor of that residential building, and proceeded to go floor-by-floor with assault rifles taking hostages, then ok sure I would 100% agree with you that it is domestic terrorism. But, that&#x27;s not what happened. Some unarmed idiots lit some newspapers on fire and didn&#x27;t hurt anybody before they were arrested. There is no evidence of a plan, or organization, or a broader, concerted effort to intimidate through the threat of violence.<p>I am not a political scientist, but it is my impression that a lot of the unrest in Portland was at least in part due to the swarm of federal law enforcement (no identification = no accountability) that were dropped-off and given a blank-check to make the situation worse in the midst of a highly-politicized national debate.<p>Here&#x27;s the official line from the feds:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-co&#x2F;pr&#x2F;real-story-federal-agents-portland-op-ed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-co&#x2F;pr&#x2F;real-story-federal-agents...</a><p>And here&#x27;s the sort-of opposing perspective from the journos:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;899882025&#x2F;portland-protests-de-escalate-as-federal-agents-leave-city-streets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;899882025&#x2F;portland-protests-d...</a><p>I think it&#x27;s worth considering what role the federal government played in pouring gasoline on the situation in Portland by throwing their weight around.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong! Show me some numbers, show me some wide-angle aerial photography. <i>Show me anything that shows that the majority of protestors in any city in the United Stated during the George Floyd protests were violent.</i> I&#x27;m an open-minded person. I have my opinions about the issue, but if you have clear proof from a reputable source that my opinions are wrong, I will definitely consider what you have to say.')
