All too often I&#x27;ve seen a code review of a complex feature get derailed by nitpicking of inconsequential things like variable names, formatting, etc.<p>I rarely comment on code style for this reason. I want the review to focus on functionality, not style. I don&#x27;t really believe the notion &quot;imperfect code style is a code smell&quot; anyway.')
