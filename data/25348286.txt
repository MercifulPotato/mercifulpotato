Speculators think that Tesla will be a 1T company (in 2020 dollars) by the end of the 2020s, and I don&#x27;t disagree, but a lot has to go right for that to be true. That means if it hits 1T within the next year, I suspect they&#x27;ll have a decade of stagnation like the tech companies did after the dotcom bubble.<p>But also, the fact that I have to stress that the valuation is in 2020 dollars should tell us all we need to know about this current market and the valuations we&#x27;re seeing. Flood the markets with dollars, and you&#x27;ll have outlandish valuations.')
