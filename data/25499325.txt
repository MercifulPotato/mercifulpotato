Just because it&#x27;s an economic system doesn&#x27;t make it any less coercive. The dictate is clear. A free market <i>requires</i> a <i>voluntary</i> participation of both the <i>buyer</i> and the <i>seller</i>. Threat of death is not voluntary participation, so it is not a free market. In a car crash you are not in a position to negotiate or make providers compete for your business.<p>In functioning systems the government drives down the cost of emergency care by setting the price and insuring everyone, and the results are clear. Canada&#x27;s health care system costs $5447 USD, and Americas costs $10224. That&#x27;s basically all I&#x27;ll say about that.<p>Other necessities like food are in fact subsidized or socialized.<p>- The freeways? Socialized.<p>- The schools? Socialized.<p>- The police? Socialized.<p>- The fire stations? Socialized.<p>- The army? Socialized.<p>- The post office? Socialized.<p>- Healthcare for 40% of Americans? Socialized. (Medicare, Medicaid, VA). Medicare <i>is</i> socialized medicine. [1]<p>Food is also very much provided for if needed. SNAP and food banks provide socialized food to the poor. Americans pay less for food than anyone else on earth in no small part because the Farm Bill subsidizes production of corn and soy to the point these staples are sold at <i>below cost</i> to end users.<p>Either way that&#x27;s a distraction and a red herring. Americans pay less for food than anyone else and more for medicine than anyone else. Eyes on the prize here, and stop carrying water for the insurance companies taking advantage of you :) All we&#x27;re talking about doing is moving the percent of Americans covered by socialized medicine up from 40% to 100%.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialized_medicine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialized_medicine</a>')
