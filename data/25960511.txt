Item(by='hntrader', descendants=None, kids=[25961110], score=None, time=1611944528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953715, text='Jason Hinkel&#x27;s article raises some good points but is hardly a valid rebuttal. It&#x27;s extremely weak. I&#x27;m still firmly on the side of Pinker&#x27;s narrative, which clearly fits the data far better.<p>(1) Hinkel falsely concludes that &quot;The poverty rate has worsened dramatically since 1981&quot;, using a graph of the number of people in poverty (which increases by ~31% between 1981 to 2013) as justification. The <i>rate</i> did <i>not</i> increase. The <i>rate</i> <i>decreased</i> according to his own graph! The population increased by 59% over that same time period, so the correct conclusion from his own data is that the poverty rate actually <i>reduced</i> over that same time period.<p>(2) Not only is poverty better, but almost every other meaningful metric (disease&#x2F;mortality&#x2F;war deaths&#x2F;crime deaths) is also better, which he hand-waves away in a single paragraph after falsely asserting that the poverty rate has gone up!<p>It is borderline dishonest, or perhaps at best he is innumerate. If this is the best rebuttal then I am even more confident in the conclusion that things are getting better - MUCH better - aside from a number of existential tail risks that we need to mitigate.')
