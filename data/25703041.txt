HN is one of them. I&#x27;ve shared several projects that got to the front page. Whenever I post projects to Twitter, even put a shitton of hashtags on it, and all I get is dead silence for my 50+ hours of work put into something honestly interesting, while some &quot;influencer&quot; gets 100K likes and 10K follows for their one-line low-effort armchair tweet bashing Elon Musk that they spend 10 seconds on. That discourages me from wasting more time logging into Twitter.<p>That&#x27;s just my experience as a user. If they want more people like me on there, they need to fix their product to improve discoverability of small creators. If they don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s fine, I don&#x27;t really need Twitter anyway.')
