Why do you have to <i>call</i> the joint on an <i>application</i>? Yelp isn&#x27;t available here, but on the local apps (Algeria), I can make the order by clicking on foods, adding quantities, adding drinks, then confirming the order.<p>For every joint, there&#x27;s their menu with different tabs (drinks, desserts, pizzas, burgers, briskets, pastrami, etc) custom for every joint.<p>The app then tells me when the joint has accepted the order, when the rider picked up my order, and where the rider is. The rider comes to the office, gives me food, I give them money, and good bye.<p>I can even click to re-order the same thing, or make several orders from different places (when you want food from several places). And if the joint is not featured in the app, you can make a custom order where you describe what you want, and put the address of the joint.<p>You can even just buy items (chocolate bars, water) on the app. I don&#x27;t understand why do you have to <i>call</i> on an <i>app</i>. That sucks.')
