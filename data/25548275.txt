However, python:3.7-slim is 112MB (still nearly twice the size of the image you describe, though). But it&#x27;s conceivable that many people running into limitations with the slim image would just opt for the full Python image instead.<p>Maybe a better example is the Tensorflow image, which is close to 4GB for the GPU version. It&#x27;s also the kind of thing that would be a pain to rebuild from scratch if you wanted to find a way to save space.')
