During that time the person cannot vote, cannot be elected, and cannot perform some official jobs or be a civil servant whether they are in jail or not.<p>So it is possible to, say, be sentenced to 2 years in fail, suspended, and in addition to 5 year suspension of civic rights. So the person is not jailed but cannot vote or run for office for 5 years.<p>Google tells me that 25-30,000 people have their civic rights suspended that way every year in France, when found guilty of a criminal offence. Before 1994 anyone convincted of a serious crime would lose their civic rights automatically for life.')
