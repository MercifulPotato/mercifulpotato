I&#x27;ve always thought of access to payment systems the same way as I think of clean drinking water. it&#x27;s basic infrastructure and it should be available to everyone at as little cost as possible, both literal cost and hassle.<p>When I moved to the UK and healthcare basically worked by registering with a GP and that was it and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with insurance any more it was extremely pleasant. I just want the same thing for payments tbh, just give me digital Euros, accepted everywhere and transfer it instantly between people.')
