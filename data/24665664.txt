(btw I don&#x27;t see how &quot;this&quot; fits in here.)<p>The only way I can see it making sense is because a function <i>could</i> take arbitrarily many arguments. Why on earth would that matter if the function doesn&#x27;t do anything with those arbitrarily many arguments? We may not know in advance what a caller gives to a function, but of course we know what the function <i>does</i> with its arguments--it&#x27;s a function&#x27;s body that we&#x27;re analyzing and classifying a Big-O for!')
