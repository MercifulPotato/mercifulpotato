He has statues and a day of remembrance; any attempt to separate this from religious observance is going to have its work cut out for it.<p>I expect this will be interpreted as disrespecting the tenets of that religion, but I revere the Reverend Doctor and abstain from saying slurs out of piety, as well as ordinary fear.<p>I offer this as evidence: if the prohibition were part of a more general idea that we shouldn&#x27;t insult other people, the use-mention distinction would still apply. Yet many lecturers have been dismissed for mentioning the n-slur, without directing it at anyone. The only conclusion which fits the facts is religious taboo.')
