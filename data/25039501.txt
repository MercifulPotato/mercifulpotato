Is a compelling article using stinging quotes what makes you think a knife coming at you is going to be a bad thing?<p>They&#x27;re completely non-comparable concepts. It&#x27;s such an embarrassingly lazy strawman I can&#x27;t believe you bothered to waste words on it, and it&#x27;s silly I should have to respond to it.<p>Innocent until proven guilty is not a concept born for the sake of legal rigor... it&#x27;s born of the fact that &quot;court of public opinion&quot; is easily swayed by nonsense. It&#x27;s largely seen as detracting from the proper functioning of an <i>actual</i> impartial justice system which is why we go to such great lengths to isolate jurors in major cases and why some countries don&#x27;t even publish people&#x27;s information this easily.<p>-<p>So many comments are replying trying to say &quot;there&#x27;s nothing that legally requires me to assume people are innocent!!!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not a clever argument, there&#x27;s no legal requirement to be a free-thinking person.<p>But as I pointed out before, the same way a literal alarm clock splayed out in a box became a national scandal, the burden of proof for the media to sensationalize anything is embarrassing low.<p>Someone could have a picture taken of a simple hobbyist electronics bench and most people would see it as some sort of mad scientist&#x27;s electronics lab.<p>Use your brain cells of a second and think of the context. Someone running at you with a knife? Where the hell does public opinion come into it?<p>Someone asking for money for thousands of hours of free work that they&#x27;ve done after their apartment burns down and they&#x27;re left homeless?<p>And you want to protest that because the Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism of the entire NYPD found some unmixed materials and some reading materials and felt:<p>&gt; the totality of the circumstances that raised our concern to a level where we&#x27;re going to need more investigation<p>Really?<p>If a deputy commissioner of counterterrorism is saying &quot;we&#x27;re just worried enough to look into it&quot; almost 2 months ago and the guy is still out here on the street, <i>you really think you have a leg to stand on protesting the guy getting some money to not be homeless?</i><p>This honestly feels like inverse-concern baiting. The man is asking for money and about to go homeless after spending a good chunk of his life doing free work used by multi billion dollar corporations.<p>Trying to go &quot;oooOOooOo he might be a terrorist!!!&quot; over this weak of an indictment is the height of something so insulting, the words to describe it escape me.')
