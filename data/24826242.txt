I actually like this stuff because it tends to be super light, making it ideal for the phase of life where you move to a different apartment every year or two. stuff inevitably gets damaged during a move anyway, so I mostly have cheap furniture that I don&#x27;t care about.<p>even with the cheapest stuff, I find a little care goes a long way. my cheap ikea bed frame has been moved and reassembled twice now and it still holds a mattress off the floor just fine.')
