Again, for context, this has come from the side of American politics that has for the past four years claimed that &quot;elections have consequences.&quot;<p>To compare these two events on a &quot;look who did more violence&quot; level is reductive at best and at worst a bad faith argument in support of the folks who stormed the capitol.')
