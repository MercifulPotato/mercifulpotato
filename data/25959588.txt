That&#x27;s misrepresenting your actual demand curve.<p>Are you saying that an auction of this kind is a bit complicated, and it&#x27;s possible to make a mistake? I suppose that might be true, but that is a very different assertion from your original position:<p>&quot;since people had to enter a single point on their demand curve as a price and quantity of shares (instead of their entire demand curve)&quot;')
