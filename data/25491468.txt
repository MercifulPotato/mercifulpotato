As a kid in Bangalore I used to eat a lot of instant noodles that had MSG in the seasoning packets. One time I got a very bad case of food poisoning and ended up in the hospital for 5 days. At the time, the doctors said the food poisoning was due to MSG. The circumstances being what they were, I doubt the doctors were influenced by American systemic racism or racism exported from America. (They could well be just plain home-grown racist against the Chinese since Indians are generally not very friendly towards Chinese, but again, I didn&#x27;t eat at a Chinese restaurant and the instant noodles were an Indian brand so...)<p>All in all, I am inclined to believe that MSG does actually have negative effects. However, I think one can build a tolerance to it, because I regularly eat it at restaurants and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it since that time as a kid.')
