I never said &quot;all&quot; retro games makes me sad, not even &quot;most&quot; of them, I said &quot;many&quot;. I am a gamedev myself and understand the appeal of pixel art, including cheaper costs (it is much cheaper to draw pixel art than hightly detailed art).<p>2. There are pixel-retro games that have really, really good art, even with no blurring or dithering, I never said there weren&#x27;t.<p>3. I didn&#x27;t said all pixels were not square, I said pixels werent &quot;necessarily&quot; square, some of them were rectangular, some were triangular even! And some weren&#x27;t even pixels at all (Vectrex for example).<p>What bothers me is just many people could do better, but they just blunder ahead without understanding what they are trying to replicate, it doesn&#x27;t make me &quot;angry&quot;, just sad, because I see lots of great artists wasting their potential.<p>Some mediums allow a lot of interesting things, for example when Donkey Kong came out, Nintendo loved the pre-rendered 3D look, and demanded their next game be that way, Myamoto (that was orignally hired by Nintendo as artist, NOT as game designer), then made Yoshi Island to be the extreme opposite: art that is obviously 2D, with a painted look. I just want to see more people pulling that sort of stuff, instead of replicating something they don&#x27;t understand, when they clearly have skills to do better.')
