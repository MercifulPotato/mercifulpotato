Until GitHub rose to fame a project had reasonable chances to pick mercurial, or sometimes SVN; today the default is git on GitHub. <i>That</i> is the issue: when you choose a tool not because it&#x27;s the best at what you want to do, but for other (very good) reasons: it&#x27;s popular so you&#x27;ll find help easily, more people will interact with you, etc...<p>So, no, GitHub didn&#x27;t create this, but it made it default')
