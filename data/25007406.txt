The Rust language has been stable for a while. It was moving faster a few years ago but is quite stable today. Reminds me of C++, where most of what is added to the language is methods that make things a bit more convenient, like char::from_u32, etc.<p>I would say that the hard thing about Rust programming at the moment is that a number of libraries that you&#x27;d want to use are just a bit too clever for their own good, so it can require research to find a library that makes more reasonable &#x2F; sane tradeoffs.')
