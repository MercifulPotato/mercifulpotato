BVH re-building potentially being faster than the associated transfer cost is something that I didn&#x27;t consider, I&#x27;ll have to try that out and compare.<p>As for the lack of GAS compaction, I added IAS compaction to squeeze all of the beach&#x27;s debris into a single snapshot, and just never got to GAS compaction. Right now each rendering pass is only computing one sample per pixel- so in addition to reducing the BVH footprints, I&#x27;m hoping I can also hide the transfer costs by computing many more samples per pass.')
