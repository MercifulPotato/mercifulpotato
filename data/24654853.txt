Definitions for &quot;bad&quot; vary from person to person, which is why this kind of thing is so pervasive.<p>Also some people can be forgiven while other&#x27;s can&#x27;t.  A group of people will scream that rapists should get the death penalty, but then go on to elect an admitted rapist to represent them.<p>In short, we Americans are really good at being hypocritical when it suits us, and we hold other groups to a much higher standard than we hold ourselves.')
