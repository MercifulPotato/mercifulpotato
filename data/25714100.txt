Yes, this is an anti-pattern, but it is a fact of life. By incorporating an impossible question, you waste the time of honest[1] students.<p>Some will recognise that the question is impossible and move on. Some with good exam technique will know not to get stuck on a problem they can&#x27;t solve until they&#x27;ve had a go at all of the other questions.<p>But some honest and hard-working students will have got a worse grade than they deserved because of this stunt.<p>[1] Consider, as well, &#x27;desperate&#x27; students - students who need a certain grade for some reason or another. Maybe this class isn&#x27;t these students&#x27; priority, but they need to pass to be able to study the classes they love. An impossible question could drive these students to cheat, when they never would consider it otherwise[2][3].<p>[2] Consider the detail &quot;about half the class left the room to use the bathroom during the test - far more than the usual&quot;.<p>[3] This bears resemblance to vigilante groups targeting peadophiles. I don&#x27;t know what to make of that.')
