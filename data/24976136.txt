There were many platforms out there, but kids wanted systems that played the best games.  Being able to tinker and poke around, while learning something in the process was a happy side effect.\nKids have no shortage of systems for gaming these days, but I&#x27;m thinking about getting one of these for my 11yo kid.  I like the idea of gentle, friendly introduction to technology, just for tinkering and gaming without the distraction that comes from a multiuse (eg school) machine.
