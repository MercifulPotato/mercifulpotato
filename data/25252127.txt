Because it&#x27;d be good to provide an alternative. Yes it&#x27;s locked platform, but performance&#x2F;price wise it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens, and it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll have an open alternative to it soon.<p>People replying &quot;no&quot; seem to be doing so for ideological reasons with no regard to practicality. Obviously it&#x27;d be better if it was an open platform, but it isn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s fine. Whatever you think of Apple, you have a very simple option of not using their products. I don&#x27;t use a Mac for that reason. But with the performance and price of new M1 machines, I can definitely see a usecase, probably not as a daily driver, but I&#x27;d still need it to run linux natively. Anyway, people who will take on such an effort (with the appropriate funding) aren&#x27;t necessarily going to be working on something else if this doesn&#x27;t materialize.<p>I don&#x27;t think that asking this kind of question on twitter&#x2F;hackernews is representative.
