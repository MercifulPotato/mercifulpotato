If it says &quot;Hey, BMW EG16WHJ - your warranty is expired!&quot; then yeah, that&#x27;s probably not ok. But if they detect that a BMW with an expired warranty is stopped near the bilboard and just say &quot;hey, is your BMW warranty expired? Renew today!&quot; then it would be very hard to make an argument against it.')
