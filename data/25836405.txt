Attacking a person vs attacking something someone believes in.<p>Saying &quot;Christians are stupid&quot; is different than saying &quot;Christ is stupid&quot;.<p>We should all be able to tolerate having our ideals and beliefs criticized and mocked. But we should stand up for anyone of a race or group being attacked or marginalized. Black, white, gay, straight, religious, atheist, educated or not, whatever.<p>A belief doesn&#x27;t have feelings and doesn&#x27;t feel pain. People do.<p>&gt; can get you arrested or charged with hate speech.<p>Maybe in some democracies, but in America we allow it. Free speech is one of the core foundations of our democracy. If you want to put your foot in your mouth and say something stupid or hateful, be my guest. I&#x27;ll even defend your right to do it. But it doesn&#x27;t free you from being judged by your peers.')
