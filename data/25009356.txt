They lost their way 20 years ago I feel.  And now that they&#x27;ve spun off the HP enterprise, I will never buy another HP customer product again.<p>I also feel like it&#x27;s really informed me that I don&#x27;t trust products with long warranties.  It seems from my personal experience, the longer the warranty the more questionable the quality, and the harder to get the warranty honored.  And of course if the product is terrible, the company will go out of business leaving you high and dry anyway.')
