The current COVID-mandated WFH atmosphere is a lot different than how things were pre-COVID.  In particular, there&#x27;s the impact of children at home, and for ICs there&#x27;s a special stigma (due to COVID) to support isolation.  However, Dropbox&#x27;s culture has always been uniquely supportive of IC independence during pre-COVID times despite the fancy office, &quot;Michelin Star&quot; cafeteria, etc.  Curious to see how the change is assessed, even if the detailed hypotheses supporting it are never fully explained.')
