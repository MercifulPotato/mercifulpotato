Item(by='topspin', descendants=None, kids=[25014606], score=None, time=1604737973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013668, text='&gt; doesn&#x27;t greater transistor density support more sophisticated architectures and hence superior IPC?<p>Intel claims Rocket Lake will deliver 10% IPC improvement over Cannon Lake on the same 14nm node.  Clearly 14nm hasn&#x27;t been tapped out despite the <i>five years</i> and 3-4 (depending on who you ask) previous microarchitectures they&#x27;ve used it for.  Yes, smaller devices enable better designs.  Ironically if Rocket Lake actually delivers 10% then it&#x27;s corroboration that Intel has been slacking on microarchitecture as well.<p>&gt; for the architecture team who have to design for two processes at the same time rather than focus on just 10nm?<p>Intel has been designing devices for at least two nodes as SOP for 13 years now; they called it &quot;tick-tock&quot; which is the cycle of developing a new microarchitecture on one node and then porting to a smaller node.<p>The difference this time is that they&#x27;re going backwards...  In any case the argument that there is some great difficulty with moving cores between nodes is tough to support given the history.')
