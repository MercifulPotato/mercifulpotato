I typed &quot;Neal Stephenson&quot; and got lots of duplicates for his latest novels. Cleaning up the data might be necessary to fix this. It seems biased towards newer&#x2F;recent titles.<p>The ranking is also a bit tricky. If you type &quot;Orwell&quot; you get top results about George Orwell, rather than the book that made him famous (1984). I suspect this will be an issue with many literature works that will have a lot of books talking about these books.<p>Spelling correction is kind of working but surfaces a lot of noise as well. E.g. Neal Stevenson just surfaces a lot of titles and authors with either Neal or Stevenson in them. But impressively it did find one Neal Stephenson title.<p>Building good search and ranking is hard. So, not bad for a 12 hour effort.')
