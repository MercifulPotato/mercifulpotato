Their aviation reporter does not read or comprehend his cited sources.<p>The EA crew dealt with the situation for 5 minutes, the LA crew for 25 minutes. <i>Both</i> crews used the electric trim switches to restore normal trim, <i>multiple times</i>. The trim switches are on the control column right under one&#x27;s thumb. All the reports saying it was impossible or unreasonable or there wasn&#x27;t enough time to do this are false, as both crews did it.<p>I strongly recommend a more reputable source, like Aviation Week 19-Sep-2019. Also an original source,<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MAX-AD-1107.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MA...</a><p>There&#x27;s also an often-cited article going around that&#x27;s written by a Cessna pilot. His opinions on how jet aircraft should be designed have little to do with reality - high altitude high speed jets are very, very different from a low and slow Cessna. (The Air Force thought it would be easy to transition their experienced propeller pilots to jets. A lot of crashes and dead pilots changed their minds.)')
