I&#x27;ve used reflection for dependency inversion, so I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s got to do with it.<p>If you can do dependency inversion without reflection, more power to you :-) We can&#x27;t do classpath scanning in the project I&#x27;m working on because of the size of the classpath, and compile time configuration using direct imports would introduce cycles, so reflection it is for us, in one form or another.')
