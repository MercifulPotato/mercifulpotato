However during the transition from buying to renting clothes, we do have an opportunity to influence the outcome.<p>You&#x27;re right that the terminology of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;captivity&quot; is weird...I&#x27;ve always thought it&#x27;s strange because historically it&#x27;s been <i>so</i> relative.  But I think quibbling over where to draw the line is missing the point, and basically has the same problem as what you&#x27;re decrying.  When we have the power to influence the outcome of something, we shouldn&#x27;t resign in despair because we can&#x27;t cleanly classify it...we can still make informed decisions under that uncertainty.')
