It doesn&#x27;t work for non-programmers. The complexity of &quot;Z = X + Y&quot; is no more or less than &quot;ADD X TO Y GIVING Z&quot;, and bugs will happen at the same rate with either syntax. The added verbosity will only annoy you.<p>Not to mention that verbosity often distracts from meaning, leading to more place for bugs to hide.')
