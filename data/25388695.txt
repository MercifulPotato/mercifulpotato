But now reading <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust&#x2F;issues&#x2F;59943" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust&#x2F;issues&#x2F;59943</a> I see that this is a feature -- I hadn&#x27;t been taking advantage of the fact that you can use dbg! inline; I&#x27;d just been adding extra dbg!(foo) lines to the code. So I should probably (a) pass by reference always and (b) look our for where inline dbg! might be useful (probably lots).')
