I paid for an upgrade again. Sublime Text, iA.Writer, Hemingway App, and Grammarly is my primary writing tool.<p>I was invited to SuperHuman during its beta, and I tried it. I didn&#x27;t upgrade. First reason was of course, the cost. The Second was, it isn&#x27;t for me. In 2008, the first things I did with Mail on the iPhone was to remove that &quot;Sent from my iPhone&quot;. So, the &quot;Sent with SuperHuman&quot; kinda labels do not work with my ways. &quot;This is not the Way.&quot;<p>I have been using emails for just over 20+ years, and I have learned a lot of tricks to manage my emails. Right now, I&#x27;ve reduced to just about 7 mailboxes. I have tried many email clients but I have settled on macOS Mail for quite a while.<p>My MailBox on Dec 31, 2020 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.oinam.com&#x2F;photos-oinam&#x2F;brajeshwar-apple-macos-mail-2020.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.oinam.com&#x2F;photos-oinam&#x2F;brajeshwar-apple-macos...</a><p>Last year - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.oinam.com&#x2F;photos-oinam&#x2F;brajeshwar-apple-macos-mail-2019.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.oinam.com&#x2F;photos-oinam&#x2F;brajeshwar-apple-macos...</a>')
