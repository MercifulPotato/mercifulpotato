Because it will look like politically charged content to outsiders. The following is a rough summary of Indian politics from my perspective:<p>The current leadership has done some fishy marketing tactics for sure. There are swathes of fake news on whatsapp and Facebook which lure unsuspecting citizens into thinking the current leadership is some kind of savior. The local media is mostly silent and doesn&#x27;t broadcast any news that might affect the savior image of the leadership. These media outlets cognitively manipulate people by pushing uncertain news; eg:\n    &quot;did coward china leave the Ladakh region after Modi&#x27;s roar?&quot;<p>Sorry, my English is not very good. But this news is so manipulative when broadcast in the local language.<p>This combined with aggressive Hindutva identity politics, most naive people of India think Modi is a savior, while they are systematically looting this country. BJP is one of richest parties in the world and no one asked where all the money from de monetization went. Modi has not even called a press meet so far.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the opposition party is exploited by Nehru family. INC had a great prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, but he was suppressed in the party itself. He is easily the best PM this cursed country has seen after Late Mr. Shastri.<p>Doesn&#x27;t help there is a vocal minority of liberal arts graduates which even openly support terrorist forces in an attempt to rail against BJP. They call themselves left or liberals but they are not left. They openly support all kind of dammage from Muslim fundamentalists, and try to defame the long standing tradition of the country. You can see lot of those people on r&#x2F;india echo chamber. You will be banned for opposing their viewpoints. The effect? You will be called as leftie&#x2F;liberal&#x2F;communist&#x2F;anti-national for just opposing Modi, among your friend circles who are already likely to be manipulated from the fake news based propaganda.<p>TL; DR This country sucks.')
