I&#x27;m assuming if we have the means to fake the one turbulence, we can also cancel the other. Or the arrow is just not moving, thus no &quot;natural&quot; turbulance to cancel.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that air turbulence wasn&#x27;t a very strong indicator for motion! And I am not sure the technology to fake them completely does exist. But I don&#x27;t see why it shouldn&#x27;t be possible, maybe with a very elaborate set of fans, air ducts and loudspeakers.')
