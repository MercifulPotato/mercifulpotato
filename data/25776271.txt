I highly recommend taking this type of class to anyone who wants to understand what happens on a low level, but not down to the OS internals level. Systems programming.<p>Threads, processes, shared memory, synchronized access, pipes, file descriptors, ...<p>The list goes on, but at the end of the day, basically all higher level constructs boil down to these system primitives. Understand these, and you have a much better foundation to understand high level concepts built on top of them.')
