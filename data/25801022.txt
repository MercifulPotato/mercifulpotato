Start with a goal to fix a tiny issue. It will help you not go too deep, too early and yet give you an overview of the codebase.<p>2. Document the steps to setup dev environment in your own words and highlight the issues that you run into<p>3. Take time to learn the new Library or the tooling you encounter. Learn with the goal of familiarise yourself with the keywords&#x2F;concepts of that library or the tools. It&#x27;s okay even if you don&#x27;t understand exactly how they work. When you really need to understand to solve a problem or a piece of code, you can use the keywords to quickly go to exact documentation references to learn more. A thumb of rule for me is to not invest more than a day to learn these new concept continuously(I can always come back to it if I see the need for that)')
