Keep those separate.<p>Keep in mind also that censorship is a government matter: the government should not censor people; that&#x27;s enshrined in the 1st amendment. But private platforms and companies have every right to design their communications systems the way they see fit, and I expect them to do so ethically with societal impact in mind.<p>I expect soon the government <i>will</i> need to enter into this race and take some wider action, but I don&#x27;t know what that will be, nor how it will play with our constitution. It&#x27;s going to be a wild ride as the psychological nuclear weapons we&#x27;ve created duke it out with the individual rights principles we&#x27;ve laid in stone hundreds of years ago. I can only hope we design some systemic solution that does not require that fight to take place.<p>And just to give an idea of the solution type I have in mind: right now the social network systems we have are optimized for addiction and engagement of content, and quick viral spread of content with minimal thought. Could we instead design systems that are more about human communication and understanding? Could we alter our existing platforms to tune down the addictive tribal dopamine hit in their nature? I bet that would have a large impact.<p>In other words, simply censoring speech without considering the design of the technology would be foolish. The platforms, not the speech, are the problem.')
