I&#x27;m sure Johnson isn&#x27;t the first PM ever to let a minister go on a SPAD&#x27;s advice, but the adviser is usually in the background, not personally firing the Chancellor&#x27;s staff. And how often is it that a SPAD not only <i>survives</i> lawbreaking in his personal life becoming a focus for public outrage (instead of being summarily fired and if <i>really</i> valued directed to a suitably close think tank and told he&#x27;ll be rehired when the fuss dies down) but has the PM stan for his &#x27;utmost integrity&#x27; as the warmup act for his own press conference. You don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s odd that when the public refuses to believe a SPAD claiming the reason he took his wife out for a lockdown drive on her birthday to &#x27;test his eyes&#x27;, the PM swaps his contact lenses for glasses so he can give a statement about coronavirus affecting eyesight? By all means name me a comparable example of a PM brazening it out to defend an underling who in normal circumstances is supposed to be invisible.<p>None of the political intrigue itself has anything to do with rationalism of course, but it does show a pretty archetypical &#x27;rationalist&#x27; whose counsel was ranked unusually highly by a global leader<p>As for Clement, I never said he feigned disinterest, I agreed with the original blogger that that this was one of many examples of ecclesiastical orders getting involved in all the <i>City of Man</i> stuff the Church&#x27;s founding mythology placed them outside; often excommunication was even more transparently nothing to do with spiritual matters. Sure, excommunication proved no impediment to Henry VIII resolving his domestic issues at the cost of only a few centuries of religious strife and antagonistic relations with Catholic states, but unless your argument is that this proves the Church wasn&#x27;t any more influential on the politics and economics of the Middle Ages than LessWrong on the politics and economics of the world today, I&#x27;m not really sure why you&#x27;re twisting my original statement to make that tangential point')
