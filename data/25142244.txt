Certification, in the USA if you want to get paid from the government you must be certified. This isn&#x27;t a small undertaking at all and requires quite a bit of development and then the cost of actually doing the third party testing. It has driven companies out of business and forced consolidation even among the larger players.<p>2. Configurability. EMR&#x27;s are crazy configurable to meet any hospitals requirements. This means lots of consultant hours to get things setup and running. Take a look at how much money Epic and Cerner make just from &quot;consulting&quot;.<p>3. Interoperability. Again, there are standards like HL7 and FHIR are widely used but the data isn&#x27;t always great. We are seeing more and more API endpoints all of this requires a level of customization.<p>All of this adds up to a ton of cost for a small-ish market with a large pool of no or low profit buyers and pretty much a replacement market.<p>Oh, and you are building software that could cause harm or death. I can&#x27;t imagine why people don&#x27;t want to come into this industry and really push the state of the art.')
