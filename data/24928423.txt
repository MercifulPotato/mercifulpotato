Item(by='madaxe_again', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603960692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24925732, text='It’s bizarre, is what it is.<p>I live off grid, and barely a day goes by that I don’t cut myself and have blood dribbling out, somewhere - and it doesn’t bother me in the slightest - even some pretty gruesome injuries (like bifurcating my thumb with an axe) are just “well, crap, that’s going to need stitches”. Even when it was stitched up, the needle going “click” as it pushed through the underside of the nail, I just watched with fascination.<p>That all said, every time I have a phial of blood taken, I faint, like clockwork. I’m not convinced that it’s the sight or thought of blood, but perhaps a marginal drop in BP or available blood glucose triggering syncope - but I’m not a doctor, just confused as to why it’s triggered by blood being drawn, but never by accidental bloodshed.')
