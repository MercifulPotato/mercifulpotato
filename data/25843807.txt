Item(by='emmanueloga_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611129941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25843532, text='&quot;FUD&quot; is a concerted effort to outsell a competitor or something like that... I&#x27;m just an individual with real questions about implications of the licenses involved. I bet others have similar questions.<p>Graal licensing seems pretty complicated to me, and if I get it right Truffle only makes sense when used together with Graal.<p>From what I could find in the FAQ [1]:<p>* &quot;GraalVM Community is free to use for any purpose and comes with no strings attached, but also no guarantees or support.&quot;<p>* &quot;GraalVM Enterprise includes Improved performance and security over GraalVM Community&quot;<p>In general it seems pretty good, but I think it is a bit painful to have to pay for certain optimizations... again, imagine if projects had to pay to, say, &quot;clang -O3&quot;. Also could be painful to get stuck in Graal&#x2F;Truffle version N if version N+1 switches to different licensing terms.<p>In general commercial compilers are a bit of a drag to work with... I use Saxon from time to time and sometimes I need to check the matrix to see if a feature is available or not [2]. For instance, until version 10.0, higher order functions (!) was a feature one had to pay for, for whatever reason.<p>--<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graalvm.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#how-is-graalvm-licensed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graalvm.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#how-is-graalvm-licensed</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saxonica.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;feature-matrix-10.xml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.saxonica.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;feature-matrix-10.xml</a>')
