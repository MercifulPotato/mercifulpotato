Item(by='rubicon33', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612234441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25995759, text='&quot;Don’t let an ADHD diagnosis define your personality.&quot;<p>&quot;... but don’t let the diagnosis become a convenient excuse to let yourself off the hook or explain away concerns that would be better served by some personal growth&quot;<p>I totally understand this perspective and I do think it&#x27;s a healthy one, but, where do you draw the line?<p>I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with ADHD but personally hate the diagnosis.  I don&#x27;t want to be viewed through that lens, nor do I want to view myself that way.<p>That said, there&#x27;s just no denying that I&#x27;m a different (better) person when I&#x27;m treating the condition.  I get more work done.  I fight less with my wife.  I&#x27;m way less frustrated angry on a daily basis, etc.  Small tasks that normally seem like mountains, become mole hills.<p>I&#x27;ve done counseling and I&#x27;ve done exercise, diet, sleep.  I&#x27;ve seen the most dramatic results when I&#x27;ve just accepted I have ADHD and taken medication.  Yet comments like yours re-ignite my desire quit taking the medications, and return to what feels normal ... even if feeling normal was so bad for me.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is ... I think some people DO need to lean into the diagnosis.  Accept that it&#x27;s part of their life.  If treatment improves your life, don&#x27;t shy away from it.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m still just trying to figure it all out myself.  I hate the idea of being &quot;ADHD&quot; but I&#x27;m starting to form the belief that I need to do what&#x27;s right for my future, and my family, even if it means accepting I have a condition that requires something as dramatic as taking medication.')
