Around 50-100 km a week cycling, maybe 10-15 running and once climbing (not anymore since the gyms are closed). Mostly its training for bigger rides I do, I enjoy going to the mountains or around lakes&#x2F;between cities on longer 100-200km rides. This all of course depends on weather and general motivation but I generally stick to it pretty well.')
