The most trivial mistakes are still made in 2020, such as SQL injections. Many people write horribly insecure code, because they were never trained on a security-oriented focus.<p>Story Time: At a customer I&#x27;ve once seen all (web) applications in their docker containerr running with root permissions. I raised an issue but the devops told me this would be fine. They simply did not care about security.<p>They run all their containers on two rented VPS. They dockerized everything, also their mail infrastructure, etc.. This means: If anybody found the easiest remote code execution bug in their webpages, they immediately could take over the whole fucking company. Because root in docker = root on the whole machine. Think about that twice.')
