Play is always voluntary. What might otherwise be play is work if it’s forced. This is axiomatic.<p>Work and play are both voluntary to different degrees. You can survive without working, although your existence will likely be miserable. You can also survive without playing, but again, your existence will also likely be miserable. Play is something we prefer to do voluntarily, but if you don&#x27;t force yourself to play every once in awhile, your life will probably be unhealthy. In that sense, it is not voluntary.<p>Even if I didn&#x27;t work, I still have to do things that I don&#x27;t want to do in order to keep my life at the level that I want. I need to clean where I live, keep myself clean, keep my body healthy by eating healthy food and exercising. Work is just an extension of that. It&#x27;s a choice that I make in order to sustain or progress my life at the level that I desire.<p>Calling work non-voluntary reveals more about the author than it does about the system they describe: that they <i>feel</i> that they have no choice. They have a choice, but the choice is unpleasant. That is not the same as no choice. Declaring that you have no choice is a result of the inability to confront the weakness to acknowledge the unpleasant decision.')
