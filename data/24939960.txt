I regularly publish software that is copyrighted by me.<p>Trying to read the article in the most positive way, I agree with it. Copyleft would not be needed if copyright laws were reasonable.<p>But, being a practical person, I understand that we live in a different situation. Copyright exists and is designed to serve a set of interests that usually does not include the general public.<p>Copyleft is a great way of assuring freedom. MySQL is an excellent example on how non-copyleft open licenses may give you freedom in practice but end meaning the end of a product. QT is going the same road.<p>Many &quot;open source&quot; products are freemium products were the &quot;open source&quot; part is good enough to make difficult to justify the creation of competitors but bad enough that anyone with a serious use have to pay for the professional version.<p>Linux is great and free because its copyleft license. It makes it really hard to embrace and extinguish the project.<p>&gt; one of my main goals is for as many people as possible to use it, regardless of whether it&#x27;s other individuals or giant corporations.<p>This is a false dichotomy. The bigger corporations use Linux and other copyleft products. They are just forced to give back to the community, and only if they offer that product externally. There is limitation on the abuse not the use.')
