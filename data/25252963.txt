It held one 80-column line on each card. When I did it (a looong time ago) the reader printed the line on the top of the card.<p>The cards were one of the reasons CRT-based terminals such as the 2260 and 3270 had 80 characters per line (VT-52 had 64 and there was some 3270-like terminal w&#x2F; 40 columns.')
