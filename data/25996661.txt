People will judge you based on their first impression, rather than taking time to know you more deeply as a person.<p>So, I think for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to play &quot;the dating game&quot;, yes, an effective dating strategy is to accept that they won&#x27;t be able to easily find a partner in the short-term.  Instead, a strategy of self-improvement combined with leading a more social life (via hobby groups etc) in which one regularly meets new people is a great way for them to eventually bump into someone they vibe with really well.<p>I think many people who are desperate for a partner are also unhappy in other aspects of their life -- joining non-romantic social groups centered around a common interest is a great cure for loneliness, until the right person comes along.')
