For example, I thought that the Big Five were considered to be universal, in some sense, and not just descriptive of WEIRD college students. But in fact, it is not simply that the Big Five factors fail to fall out of the analysis of large surveys in other languages and cultures. They donâ€™t even fall out of</i> Big Five-specific <i>questions administered in non-WEIRD populations (Gurven et al., 2013). Many of the concepts mentioned in the Big Five survey instruments do not even exist in non-WEIRD languages as such, particularly abstract nouns (Gurven et al., 2013). Of course a concept that does not exist across cultures could not form the basis for a universally important personality trait, as measured by language.</i><p>Be mindful of other cultures &#x2F; worldviews:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WEIRD" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WEIRD</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross-cultural_psychology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross-cultural_psychology</a><p>Joseph Henrich recently published a book on the topic, discussed about a month ago:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;joseph-henrich-weird-people&#x2F;615496&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;joseph-...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25227902" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25227902</a>')
