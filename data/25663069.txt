Unfortunately, our best source of democracy data (Rome, at least 52 Greek city-states, Greek leagues, etc.) may be 2k years old.  Obviously, we don&#x27;t know much about the media of the day, so it&#x27;ll be hard to test some of the modern social media theories.  Maybe we could compare the behavior of different municipalities.')
