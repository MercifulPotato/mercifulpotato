The 3rd party library ecosystem may be wild because React is superpopular and people are publishing npm packages with half-baked solutions of dubious utility, but there&#x27;s always a good library or two for 95% of tasks (good: regularly maintainted, fully-featured, well-documented, tested, typed, etc.).<p>I don&#x27;t have any experience with RN so I don&#x27;t know how things are there, but your comment seems to be about the React ecosystem at large and doesn&#x27;t correspond to my experience at all.')
