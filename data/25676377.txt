Today we&#x27;re launching Miki, a hosted wiki service based on Wiki.js.<p>Miki is designed to be a one-click, cloud-hosted wiki solution for single users, teams, and enterprise customers. We&#x27;ve built a very powerful backend called MCenter which allows us and our customers to control hundreds or thousands of Mikis remotely. Think of it like WPEngine for wikis.<p>Looking forward to your thoughts and ideas.<p>Thanks in advance -- D')
