I always thought this was because it was much more tedious to check spelling before word processing software became common.<p>Typos on internet forums notwithstanding, I might even guess the age of auto-correct, spell check, and, even things like how some OSs put squiggles over misspelled words in every text field (I think Mac was the first place I noticed this -- though I&#x27;m running firefox on FreeBSD and it&#x27;s doing that in this edit field right now ...), has made the average literate person a better speller than that era.  We get so much realtime feedback on spelling when writing on our devices, these opportunities to learn to spell, notice and correct our mistakes would not have at all been so accessible in 1969.')
