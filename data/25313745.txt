Item(by='intricatedetail', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607167964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303423, text='Reddit used to be a place where you could meet interesting people and talk freely about anything. This days it is dominated by censorship and an army of trolls downvoting anything that doesn&#x27;t align with Marxist doctrine. There are still a couple of subreddits that fortunately don&#x27;t get involved in politics, but still there are people trying to plant some Marxist drivel which then distracts from otherwise interesting topics. To be clear I like to read view points of all sides including Marxists, but I don&#x27;t like the suppression of other views. Those people will surely find a different platform, but that erodes diversity and breeds extremism. We should avoid having people creating their own echo chambers and encourage diverse communication instead of censorship and forcing the only correct world view.')
