You&#x27;re only continuing to restate your opinion and insist it is fact.<p>Claims of objective facts? Objective facts in some context? Badness isn&#x27;t a matter of fact--it&#x27;s a matter of opinion, I say again, you&#x27;re making a value judgement and asserting that as a fact. You may as well tell me an onion is a planet and I can live on it if I believe hard enough.<p>You think I am disparaging your argument by saying it is mere opinion as though they isn&#x27;t good enough to be real true fact. I am not, I am merely pointing out that your statement is actually an opinion which you are incorrectly claiming to be a fact.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m also not making some sort of ad populum argument. As I pointed out, any claim of objective fact has to be made in some context that provides it with semantics. In some languages, the expression &quot;1&quot;+&quot;1&quot; is a type error, in others it produces &quot;11&quot;. Both of those outcomes are objective facts in some context. What your objection really amounts to is saying that there&#x27;s no semantic context in which my claim could be true. That&#x27;s clearly not the case.<p>&quot;Objective fact&quot; isn&#x27;t claimed. You seem to be missing that an opinion even if backed up by evidence still isn&#x27;t itself a fact and thus isn&#x27;t objective. This isn&#x27;t a matter of context. The difference between opinion and fact is not like the difference between true and false.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re lost on this. &quot;JS is bad&quot; is an opinion. &quot;JS is objectively bad&quot; is still an opinion but claims to be a fact, because &quot;badness&quot; isn&#x27;t an objective property. Whether or not something is bad is not a matter of fact, it&#x27;s a matter of opinion.<p>The &quot;+&quot; operator performs both string concatenation and addition in JS. &lt;-- That is a fact, anyone can fire up a JS interpreter and confirm this for themselves.<p>The &quot;+&quot; operator being overloaded to perform string concatenation and addition with implicit type coercion is bad. &lt;-- That&#x27;s an opinion. While anyone can observe the behavior, they have to make a judgement on whether or not it is desirable and desirability is not a matter of fact.')
