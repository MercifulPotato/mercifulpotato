Electron apps are piling up like crazy. Every arch update was like 1+ gb for me. I shifted to all terminal, all web as of now.<p>I am waiting for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciter.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciter.com</a> to go open source in the upcoming months. We can sigh in relief. Also, why aren&#x27;t more apps created using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webview&#x2F;webview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webview&#x2F;webview</a> instead of electron. Windows support is not that bad you know.')
