This is not true. It was all designed for short form.<p>They knew this -<p>&quot;“What you can’t do is take an hour-long TV show and chop it up… it has to be written and shot for this use case,” said (Quibi CEO Meg Whitman. “If we are successful, there will be plenty of competition. We will have accumulated a library [of content] that they can’t go buy.”<p>Their mistake is hard to exactly call. It is definitely minutes of entertainment available though.<p>I think you need to get short form TV to the same pricing model as TV movies then dump a lot of money into a library.<p>A idea I think would be to try and get more length, like 3 hours rather than 90 mins. So you make &quot;TV movies&quot; (Obviously learn to script and shoot for short form) that are 3 hours long that cost less than double the cost. You can binge on a special night. Viewers can go to bed no problem, so no pressure a long movie gives you. It&#x27;s relaxing. It feels like value.')
