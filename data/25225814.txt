How big a project is it? Oh, it&#x27;s sort of a 10K-LOC project. This is a 20K-LOCer. And this is 5OK-LOCs. And IBM wanted to sort of make it the religion about how we got paid. How much money we made off OS 2, how much they did. How many K-LOCs did you do? And we kept trying to convince them - hey, if we have - a developer&#x27;s got a good idea and he can get something done in 4K-LOCs instead of 20K-LOCs, should we make less money? Because he&#x27;s made something smaller and faster, less KLOC. K-LOCs, K-LOCs, that&#x27;s the methodology. Ugh anyway, that always makes my back just crinkle up at the thought of the whole thing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;nerds&#x2F;part2.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;nerds&#x2F;part2.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kHI7RTKhlz0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kHI7RTKhlz0</a>')
