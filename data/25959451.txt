In many cases, you can&#x27;t have one with the other. Privacy or Personal security - pick one.<p>And there is a class component to this. If you live in a nice safe (and affluent) neighborhood, I&#x27;m sure privacy is much more important to you because you don&#x27;t have to worry about your children being hurt by or recruited into gangs on the way to school. You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting mugged or assaulted walking to the store. If you live in a community with a high crime rate, are you sure you want to focus on privacy and rights of criminals?')
