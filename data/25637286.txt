I also appreciate its UX&#x2F;UI being far superior to Teams.<p>Ultimately, the cloud is often a single point of failure that companies become over-dependent. So I&#x27;d favour a free (as in freedom) and open source self-hosted&#x2F;deployed alternative if there was one (even if it was from Slack and for pay).\n    I agree with most on here that there isn&#x27;t such a thing yet - but it&#x27;s well worth building! So those of you out there who are considering implementing &quot;yet another text editor&quot;, maybe this is something to work on.')
