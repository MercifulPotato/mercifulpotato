But he, we are just some people on the internet. I can send you pics of conversion tables in WU cash points in HK which are off by 5-20% from the inter bank rate. Banks can do this cheaply (and you still get screwed with most banks but indeed 1-2%, not 5+) so WU definitely does something bad there.')
