I&#x27;m introverted in the sense that social interaction drains my energy and solitude recharges it (with the stereotypical consequences like I don&#x27;t like parties <i>qua</i> parties). However, I have good social skills in that I can make almost anyone like me, quickly. That is extremely useful in both getting hired and keeping a job.')
