These messages would be huge if everything is inline (especially if the same thing happens in those sub-messages).<p>I agree that inlining all sub-messages works great for dense schemas, but it assumes too much about the schema to be a good design for a general-purpose proto library I think.  Also maps and repeated fields can never be inline.')
