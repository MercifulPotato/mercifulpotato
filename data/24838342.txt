I can even have several days in a row that are optimal for deep work if I&#x27;m careful, but life likes to throw in a wrench from time to time of course.<p>The big things for me have been to eat a very nutritionally heavy breakfast (I hate eating breakfast, it still takes me forever) and to calorie count both to make sure I&#x27;m getting enough and to make sure I&#x27;m getting a decent balance of carbs&#x2F;protein&#x2F;fat. For sleep, going to sleep early and having wind down time so I sleep well (tea and a book are a winning combo for me there usually).<p>Stress is of course the difficult one we have the least control over. Exercise is a huge help but that can also change up the nutrition equation. Even then, it&#x27;s still easy for bad stress days to also muck up the sleep side of the equation and it can take days to get that sorted out.')
