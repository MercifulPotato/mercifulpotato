YouTube is a private company. They&#x27;re pretty much allowed to moderate the content on their platform in an arbitrary way. I would argue that this is a good thing.<p>We can&#x27;t have it both ways, but we want it both ways. We want a non-government controlled way to communicate, but we want to mandate that they&#x27;re liable to uphold the same First Amendment protections that the government has to provide. That&#x27;s insane, that&#x27;s not a good standard to pursue, and we should rather focus on the cost-benefit and pros and cons of either reinstating the Fairness Doctrine or creating a government-run social media website where information can be freely shared and subjected uniformly to First Amendment protections.')
