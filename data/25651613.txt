To me this style represents the urgency to end capitalist exploitation, considering the immense suffering it has caused and is still causing currently.<p>In that sense it gives voice to the anger of the oppressed, the downtrodden. It&#x27;s pure solidarity. Marx&#x27; critique is ammunition. Ammunition to unshackle our chains and claim our communist freedom.<p>&gt; If I kind of saw myself as at-one with the basic Silicon Valley ethos, like I used to, this would definitely put me off before I fully ingested the argument.<p>Would you be willing to share which bits speficifally put you off in this text(or would have before you didn&#x27;t see yourself as at-one with the ethos)? Are there maybe any specific words or labels?<p>&gt; I wish I had an example of an introductory text in the style I would like to see. I will try to find something like that. I&#x27;m sure it exists, given how much writing there has been on this topic over the last decade.<p>Yeah I would love to see that. Please do share if you want to and if you have it at hand.<p>I think being in the bourgeoisie sucks for the bourgeoisie, and I&#x27;m curious to what extent it is possible to describe the alienation experienced by the capitalists&#x2F;dominators (who are consciously dehumanizing proletarians their whole lives). Class traitorism should always be encouraged (Engels, Geuvara, etc.), and I&#x27;m still exploring narratives that support it.')
