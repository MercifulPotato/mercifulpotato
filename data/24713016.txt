Internal Windows programs ran faster and seemed more stable than third party software written to run on Windows.  It generally offered better &quot;UX&quot;, to use today&#x27;s lingo.<p>The thing that is totally ignored by the myopic focus is <i>the value of not being part of the Borg</i>.  Putting small speed differences aside, that value is not insubstantial, though the Google communications department is not responsible for keeping users informed about anything more than the value of Google.<p>The fastest internet would be one without ads (not to mention the other benefits).  Google will not inform anyone about that.  It is not included in any tests.')
