(Not to mention that the number of vendors that I need for any little project has exploded!) I have to wonder if my search results will be censored for me, as if I am somehow not an adult.<p>I can&#x27;t help but feel like something very significant has been lost. It feels a lot more serious to the future of the net and to democracy than even losing a historical artifact like Geocities or Altavista.<p>This new way just doesn&#x27;t feel sustainable. The sea change in the <i>desirability</i> of de-platforming, as if de-platforming your enemies is actually a good thing, just feels irreconcilable with the open ideals that the web was founded on.<p>Can we ever go back to how it was, and even if that were possible, would it even be desirable?')
