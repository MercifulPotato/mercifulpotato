Item(by='Galanwe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604413492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979569, text='&gt; Most people are barely getting 1% annual raises which means income increases by 138% over the same period.<p>Where is that 1% coming from? It seems to me US salaries growth pretty much followed 3&#x2F;5% average for the last 50 years, with some obvious drawdowns during crises.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;wage-growth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;wage-growth</a><p>&gt; In the last 4 decades wages have barely increased, but major assets like cars and houses are 8-10x what they used to be.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. The price of a good should roughly follow an optimum of supply and demand. There is of course a spectrum in which it can oscillate, but your &quot;barely increased&quot; versus &quot;8-10x&quot; comparison is ridiculous.<p>Things are evolving inside a pretty much closed system. Of course that&#x27;s not exactly true, especially with capital movements, and mondialisation, but the ballpark should be there. You cannot take conclusions if you don&#x27;t study the full picture.<p>Take housing prices for instance. The main driver for real estate is not some conspiracy of evil super wealthy people. It&#x27;s just the interest rates. If interest rates lower, then borrowing money is cheaper, people get bigger mortgages, which in turn inflates real estate prices.<p>&gt; From 1984 to 2016 housing prices in the Greater Vancouver area have gone up 800% [1].<p>Real estate cannot be studied in geographical isolation. There are way too much factors that can cause local inflation. In the case of Vancouver&#x27;s real estate, it is notoriously the flow target of a lot of Asian capital. I don&#x27;t think that should be taken as an example.')
