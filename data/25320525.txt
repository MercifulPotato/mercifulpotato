The libraries have tons of warts, and many different styles. And there are perhaps too many object orientation systems built on it. But that you could even build multiple object oriented systems points to how powerful the language is.<p>I think it&#x27;s functional orientation and the way that for loops are neglected make it seem completely insane to many people. But this is a far smaller fraction of people today than it was in 2000. back then, Java and C++ didn&#x27;t even have lambdas. Since then, procedural languages have gained a lot the &quot;mind-breaking&quot; functional features of Lisp-derived languages. Python and JavaScript have become far more common. All the things that made the language of R &quot;weird&quot; and unusable to the Java&#x2F;C++ crowd have been adopted elsewhere.')
