It could train quickly over large data.  It had many utilities for creating complicated pipelines.  It also used every quirk of the google environment to obtain high performance.  I worked on it for a while, and was really glad to see it retired, as the underlying design had some serious problems at scale.  But it&#x27;s still useful that its existence and some of the techniques it used, which have been migrated to TFX, are documented officially.')
