Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25339120, 25337922], score=None, time=1607376593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333467, text='Client IP is city-level geolocation. It&#x27;s sent with every communication to Apple, necessarily, because Apple has not embedded Tor into their OS.<p>AppleID (which you have stipulated) + timestamp (obvious) + client IP (necessary for a TCP&#x2F;UDP connection) on inbound App Store requests is travel history, because client IP = city. It&#x27;s quite simple.<p>Each time you open the App Store not on a VPN, Apple knows which city that Apple ID holder is in.<p>Additionally, the App Store sends the device serial number to Apple (per Apple&#x27;s disclosures), so the device serial number is associated with your Apple ID.<p>The device maintains a persistent, serial-number-linked connection to Apple at all times (APNS) for receiving push notifications.  This device-serial linked connection involves Apple seeing the client IP (and thus city) as well.  Because Apple has linked the device serial with your Apple ID via the App Store, the persistent, 24&#x2F;7 APNS connection allows Apple to track which client IP (and thus city) is in use by which AppleID, in real-time, whenever the device is on and connected.<p>I would appreciate it if you stop systematically responding negatively to so many of my comments. It feels like a pattern of harassment based on my identity to me, rather than you sincerely engaging with what I have to say.')
