Oracle lawyers acknowledge this.<p>You&#x27;re saying the textual contents of the interfaces that define the APIs are not part of the source code base? Of course Google copied them, or a nearly identical paraphrase of them.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure what Google&#x27;s legal theory is. Listening to the oral arguments this morning certainly didn&#x27;t make that more clear to me. But I don&#x27;t think it includes redefining what we mean by copying text.<p>And interfaces, in common parlance, are certainly lines of code.<p>Nor do I think Oracle&#x27;s argument is that no one else can define interfaces that use the same words as in the Java standard library interfaces. read, write, get, put, etc. did not become Oracle&#x27;s property by virtue of them being used as method names.<p>I have a bit of trouble with the concept &quot;the threshhold of too much&quot;, too, as it applies to this case. Google copied or paraphrased essentially _all_ of the text of interfaces they used from Java libraries.')
