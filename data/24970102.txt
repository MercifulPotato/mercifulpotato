What Happened Next?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Nikola Tesla, the electrical engineer that invented the first Alternating Current motor and made major contributions to AC power transmission and generation that is still the dominate backbone of our electric grid, also generated a lot of speculative hypotheses that became legendary as well.  When he died, the FBI ordered his belongings seized, on the grounds that some people thought they might contains workable plans for everything from death ray machines to wireless power transmission.<p>The FBI, of course, had no ability to analyze Tesla&#x27;s stuff, to determine what if anything should be classified and not allowed to fall into foreign hands.  So they called in an expert, a distinguished Electrical Engineering professor from MIT â€“ a man named Dr. John Trump, who agreed to go through it all.  He found no evidence that Tesla had made any breakthroughs in weapons technology.<p>Dr. John Trump is President Donald Trump&#x27;s uncle.<p>Obviously this is a very talented family.  I know of very few cases where two consecutive generations exhibit such incredibly high performance in multiple fields.  The Trump family meets this high benchmark in Real Estate (Trump&#x27;s father), Electrical Engineering (Trump&#x27;s uncle), Politics and Real Estate again (Donald Trump himself).<p>One thing I always tell my engineers, whether they are peers, superiors or subordinates is that they should always filter-out stylistic differences, particularly annoying stylistic differences, and focus on the substance when dealing with anyone, but make absolutely sure to do this when dealing with exceptionally talented people.')
