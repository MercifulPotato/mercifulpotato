Item(by='jennyyang', descendants=None, kids=[24789560], score=None, time=1602775053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24785957, text='&gt; things are going to need to be sacrificed.<p>What a comically cliche and stereotypical error that people keep making. 20 years ago it was the Bush and Cheney saying the same thing. Now its the liberals saying that the &quot;poor, ignorant masses&quot; need to be saved from themselves. For the record, I&#x27;m also a liberal, but old school liberal, not the contemporary liberal that eschews giving the same rights to those that I disagree with.<p>Who gets to decide what gets sacrificed? You? What happens when The Other Side gets control? The laws that protect their free speech are the exact same laws that will protect our rights when the opposition gets control.<p>Never, ever, ever mess with the ideals of Free Speech. No one is smart enough or uncorrupt enough to navigate that properly. The only thing that will save us as a society is completely unadulterated free speech. What we do as a society is to educate as best as we can and let the chips fall where they may. Which is hard, because we have the worst levels of education in developed countries, so we are reaping what we sowed for the last few decades. But basically it&#x27;s herd immunity for information.')
