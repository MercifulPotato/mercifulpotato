In a two-party system, everyone&#x27;s vote is a combination of push and pull, which means that it&#x27;s incredibly normal for a bad candidate to help determine your vote (or as you dishonestly framed it, &quot;force&quot; you to vote otherwise). Isn&#x27;t that what all the &quot;anyone but Trump&quot; voters are saying? I happen to be fairly happy with Biden, so it doesn&#x27;t directly apply to me, but I would have voted for any of the Dem primary candidates over Trump, and for the ones I didn&#x27;t like, he would&#x27;ve &quot;forced&quot; me to vote for them.')
