However, I think the conversation should be focused on the systemic issues that have caused us to arrive at this point. This is an inevitable result to the backlash created by our broken justice system.<p>For years now we&#x27;ve used the justice system and prison to attempt to put an band-aid over or ignore the ills of our society. We&#x27;ve built a morally repugnant justice system that we should be ashamed of and which only serves as a feedback loop to exacerbate the ills of our society. Of course people are pissed off and tired of this system and desperate for reform. It&#x27;s no surprise that there will be consequences to this, and policies will be put in place that have side effects.<p>I don&#x27;t want to prescribe an answer as a silver bullet, but I do think that investing in our society (education, health-care, housing, jobs paying a living wage, etc...) is a better means to an end than just throwing people in jail and pretending to ourselves that it will solve the problem. Throwing people in jail doesn&#x27;t reform them, and when they come out they&#x27;re worse off than they were before and have no safety nets to get their life together, unless they&#x27;re rich or white in which case they have a much better chance.')
