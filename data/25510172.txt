Apple doesn&#x27;t really change that, and they still pay royalties per chip, even with a perpetual license on the ISA AFAIK.<p>Simply having less x86&#x2F;Intel around can&#x27;t hurt. Competitors are going to want similar battery life. This effectively means ARM. Also, there&#x27;s now ARM chips being used in very capable laptop, desktop, mobile, and server applications. All of this reduces cross-architecture friction (cross-compiling, different memory models, etc).')
