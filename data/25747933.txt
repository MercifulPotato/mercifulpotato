A perfect example is championing the destruction and banning of all right leaning social media &#x2F; twitter users... but when SciHub gets banned all the sudden its a travesty of free expression.  Unfortunately, this line of reasoning is not a two way street.  Even as a staunch liberal try my best to not let my anger at the other side get the best of me and play into the hands of the corporatists and statist who actually want to recreate what many refer to as fascism (melding of the state and corporate powers).')
