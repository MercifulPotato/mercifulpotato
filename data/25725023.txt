They just - like I - are very skeptical of data claiming things like &quot;42.6% of Australians have participated in walking&quot;. Regardless of whether or not that&#x27;s actually true under their defined methodology (presumably it is), it&#x27;s probably a pretty good indicator that their methodology is of extremely questionable use, and that other data may have equally (but less obviously) misleading data.<p>I will note that the existing participation section of that article states that soccer has a higher participation rate than any other team sport amongst males (netball being higher for females), so it&#x27;s extremely clearly that editors aren&#x27;t objecting to the tables&#x27; inclusions on that claim alone, given that it&#x27;s made in the article either way.')
