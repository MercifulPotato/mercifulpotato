The US can pay off any amount of debt, because their debt is measured in USD and congress can issue new USD as needed.<p>&quot;How does the debt actually effect the economy? (Does it?)&quot; and &quot;What is the long-term impact of various debt-maintenance strategies?&quot; and &quot;Will political deadlocks prevent effective management of the debt?&quot; (among many others) are better questions.')
