The individual or the population?  Seriously.  Ask a doctor and they would probably agree that, for a particular patient, having access to legal safe alternatives is a good thing.  But ask them about drugs as a whole, for the entire population, and the answer will always be &quot;less is better but zero is best.&quot;  Stemming the supply will damage current users, but illegality also suppresses uptake by new users.<p>Opioids are different than pot.  LSD is different than rohypnol.  Cocaine is not the same as ketamine.  Balling all &quot;drugs&quot; into one category and declaring them legal for traffic and sale is a horrible idea.  I don&#x27;t want to see GHB to ever be sold or transported openly.')
