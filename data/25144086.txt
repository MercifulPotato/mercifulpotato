I like to think of `@apply` and componentization as competing solutions. Just like &quot;composition over inheritance&quot; I believe in &quot;componentization over @apply &#x2F; composite classes&quot;.<p>Ideally, you don&#x27;t have composite `.btn` classes. You simply have a `&lt;btn&gt;` component which encapsulates appropriate Tailwind CSS classes in the component (no external CSS, `@apply` required).<p>With this framing, `@apply` is the less preferred of 2 approaches. It&#x27;s good, even necessary, in some situations, but generally you should seek ways to componentize vs. abstracting compositional classes.')
