However one challenge using free cycle or  free Craigslist is it seems to attract people with a hoarding problem. People that jump on any free thing without a sense for how they would use it. So I feel better giving things away for free when they say how theyâ€™ll use it or show specific gratitude for the item. Or give them to a thrift store where they enable a charity.<p>Does anyone else notice this or have this issue?')
