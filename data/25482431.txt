It can hold its own next to many university libraries&#x27; remote access facilities and it puts Google Scholar to shame.  It is command-line friendly and offers bulk data.  Unlike Google, LG does not try to guess what the user is searching for and answer questions.  One encourages traditional learning, the other is incessantly trying surveil its users in the name of selling online ad services to third parties.')
