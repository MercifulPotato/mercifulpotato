With Matrix if you are communicating with only a handful of people that either self-host or otherwise don&#x27;t use Matrix.org then the largest homeservers don&#x27;t even have a copy of your (encrypted) message history. In order for Matrix to be equivalent to Signal in this aspect, every single Matrix user would have to use Matrix.org (which isn&#x27;t the case).')
