Be specific.<p>None of the examples there really makes a lot of sense in this case. You think this pump (and coming dump) happening with GameStop would convince lenders to lend to GameStop at better rates? Maybe if they had no clue what was happening and did no due diligence, but that is not the case. And I doubt share price is the only consideration made by lenders, if their share P&#x2F;E ratio was very low (which shorting would cause) then this would also affect their lending opportunities positively.<p>You think they were planning to issue new shares? It would have been an amazingly stupid idea which likely would not have been approved by existing shareholders anyway and would have had much the same effect as shorting.<p>Considerations for an investment bank is quite different from the considerations for a game retailer.<p>EDIT: The claim that short selling contributed significantly to the demise of Lehman Brothers is also disputed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lehman_Brothers#Short-selling_allegations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lehman_Brothers#Short-selling_...</a>')
