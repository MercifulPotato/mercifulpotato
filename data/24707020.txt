It&#x27;s also the first time I&#x27;ve seen mention that all &quot;bitter citrus&quot; includes the problematic compounds, including lime and &quot;sour orange&quot; (is that the same as blood orange?).<p>At least for me, it would be better if the headlines would cover this as the broader &quot;bitter citrus&quot;, instead of grapefruit specifically.  I can&#x27;t stand grapefruit, so I never paid much attention to the warnings, but I love lime and blood orange, which means further investigation is warranted.  TFA says it&#x27;s &quot;unlikely&quot; anyone would consume enough lime to have an effect, but how much is &quot;enough&quot;?')
