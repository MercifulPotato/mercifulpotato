Not because they can&#x27;t afford to give some land to those to make their own country, but because they fear that that country (or the population within China&#x27;s borders if no country is created) will be used against them from foreign powers as a pressure point against China. Which is probably justified, as such a thing has happened time and again.<p>The West on the other hand, could not care less about the &quot;plight og Uighurs&quot; either. I mean the politicians and policy makers who use the Uighur plighy against China, not because they give a duck, but because it&#x27;s convenient. They themselves have no qualms with fucking over other countries, or supporting other repressive regimes. As for the people in the West, we have the memory span of a goldfish, and just eat up sob stories presented concerning the &quot;enemy of the day&quot;. Cut the prominent stories from the media, and they&#x27;d forget Uighurs in a second, like they don&#x27;t give a duck for other peoples plights.<p>This leaves Uighurs in a hard spot, which is a crying shame, because short of genocide, what China wants to achieve is impossible. The best thing they should do, and the more humane, to don&#x27;t hurt Uighurs and to get them on their side (to stop any seperatism ideas), is a friendliness war -- shove them with money, support, etc.<p>But there&#x27;s bad blood and BS decisions already, so can this still happen? The Han Chinese need to overcome their distrust of non-Han for this to be a possibility.<p>I say &quot;the Han Chinese&quot; at large, because the party is hardly the issue here. China would do quite the same thing even if they had a democracy. Those things have happened time and again without communist parties in charge - see the re-education camps for Native Americans, Aboriginals, European camps for regufees like Moria and so on.')
