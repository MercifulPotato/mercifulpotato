There is nothing inherently bad about paying $1000 (or $1M) for a political ad.<p>For a mental image, someone paying for a political ad could be running for school board in a medium sized city. A ban on all political ads would restrict that person&#x27;s ability to explain why they want to be on the school board, and would restrict that person&#x27;s ability to advocate for new policies in their school district. Why do you want to impose a ban on this?')
