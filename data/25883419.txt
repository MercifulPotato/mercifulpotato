Bytecodes lose most of the semantics of code - value scope and lifetime; code structure etc. So jit compilers have to reverse engineer all that. They&#x27;d have been better served to simply have the source code.<p>I remember being intensely disappointed when I learned Java produced bytecode (Java 1.0). Even back then I knew better, that losing semantics would be a huge hurdle to be overcome.')
