On the Mac, Rosetta 2 apps seems to take about a 10% performance hit which is impressive. From what I can tell, Windows x86-32 emulation is not nearly as performant.<p>The big performance gap between Mac and Windows Intel support seems to boil down to translation versus emulation. Since Windows 64 bit support still uses emulation, I expect performance of Intel 64 bit apps is still going to be pretty slow.')
