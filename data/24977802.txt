I recently moved ~40 repositories into just a few. What I&#x27;ve found is that anything that releases together (by teams and timeframe), should stay together. This helps ease modification of related components in an agile way, simplify tagging components, simplifies CI workflow (no multi-project pipelines).<p>Anything that breaks with this principle should have a concrete reason for it. If you need to combine the results of several teams into one large release, it may be easier to develop tooling for handling it all in one repository rather than developing tooling for handling many repositories. That&#x27;s really the monorepo tradeoff.<p>Similarily, there are concrete reasons for breaking a service into smaller parts. Perhaps you want to horizontally scale a part of the service. Perhaps you need a part of the service to have a different lifecycle. But you&#x27;re paying with increased deployment complexity, so you&#x27;d better get something worthwhile in return.')
