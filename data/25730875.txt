I&#x27;m paying for the social experience.<p>A local bike shop repair has two benefits over doing it myself - experience and convenience.<p>Unfortunately for bike shops the people who are most in need of their experience are those who are newer to riding (or dusting off a 20 year old unridden bike).  When the workshop labour charge is approaching the perceived worth of a bike the customer is not going to want to use those services (more likely to dump the bike and buy a new one from a sporting goods store or Walmart).<p>People who ride regularly are more likely to have bikes where the cost of a repair is a small fraction of the bike&#x27;s worth (personal or actual) but they are also more likely to have the tools and experience to do the work themselves.<p>I go back into mtb riding 2 years ago and upgraded to a mid-range full suspension bike at the end of 2019.  While I was familiar with basic bike maintenance I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing with some of the newer bike tech.  When my bike needed a service in the summer I tried to use my local bike store - they needed my bike for a month in order to get the work done (backed up due to Covid demand).<p>Rather than miss all those rides I bought the tools and figured how to do the jobs myself.  Now I have the tools I can do those jobs again for almost no outlay (and wrenching is therapeutic).')
