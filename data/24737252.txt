FAT32 has no journaling, ACLs, transactions, CoW, nor any of the other advancements that many modern file systems do (remember we are talking FAT32 and not exFAT which modern systems use when falling back to a FAT32-like file system).<p>Yes caching was required but that was as much to work around slow storage mediums (as was the norm back then) and in fact that capability is built into the OS rather than the file system and is used by all file systems. This is the same for Windows 9x, NT, and even Linux and UNIXes too (ZFS on Linux is the one exception I know of where caching happens within the file system driver).<p>Sure, Win 98 might might a few IO optimisations, I think DMA might even be disabled by default, but it’s also a much lighter OS than modern contemporaries and that will make a hell of a difference too. Remember 98 was designed to run on hardware less powerful than a 10 year old smart phone and the entire OS has a install footprint of around 300MB. There’s going to be less background processes (and particularly on a VM install specifically for Delphi 2 benchmarks). The only draw back is you wouldn’t have SMP; but that doesn’t always help with software compilers because they are traditionally single threaded processes.')
