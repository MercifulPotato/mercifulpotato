It&#x27;s a similar weight (the all-inclusive JARs are 6.9 MB for SQLite and 8.7 for DuckDB), it also stores a database in a single file, it&#x27;s different in many ways, but for me, the killer feature is that it uses the PostgreSQL SQL syntax (and parser). This should make it very easy to migrate from DuckDB to PostgreSQL if that becomes necessary.<p>I currently work on a project based around SQLite, which suffers from that fact. Migrating it to PostgreSQL would be great, but would involve a lot of tedious work.')
