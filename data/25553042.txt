In <i>The Final Hours of Half-Life Alyx</i>, Valve talked about how their 10 year dead period where no single player games were released was caused by their nonhierarchial structure. Half-Life 3 alone was started three times since HL2:E2 and people got bored and stopped touching it. They did work on several original titles and ended up cancelling them due to tech issues or boredom.<p>Alyx, once it gained steam, ended up turning into a hierarchical project and the largest in the company history, and was the only way Source 2 ever got finished (since they now had people waiting on it to get the game working). And it worked, as we finally now have proof that VR is a great way to tell stories. The book is excellent, and goes on sale often on Steam.<p>(A decent summary of the book is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;valve-secrets-spill-o...</a>)')
