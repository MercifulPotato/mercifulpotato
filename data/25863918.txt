Only issue I found is that Wsl2 will not update its dns resolver IPs when connecting to the vpn. There&#x27;s a workaround script. So it&#x27;s either exit the terminal and re enter it or run the script to update them.<p>2. This is my current pain. Windows file system is slow already and accessing it from wsl adds an overhead. Ideally I keep projects in Wsl2 storage and IDEs in Windows. I searched a lot for a solution but haven&#x27;t found one. On the other hand, Wsl2 Linux storage speed runs circles around wsl1.')
