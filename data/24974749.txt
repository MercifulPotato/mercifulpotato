They convert garbage to food (and eggs!) more quickly and efficiently. You can eat one chicken but can&#x27;t eat a similar sized part of a pig, which is important before refrigeration. They don&#x27;t make lard which was a major use of pigs (apparently they were often grown fat on purpose for lard, not meat) but warmer climes had access to and preferred olive oil anyway, since it kept better.')
