Have all aspects been verified or proven<p>In the case of Sel4, yes. The ARMv7 assembly code has been shown to be free of bugs. [0][1]<p>SPARK Ada does not have a formally verified compiler, but there are various Ada compilers that are approved for use in life-and-death applications. The Boeing 777 flies on Ada code, for instance. [2] To my knowledge, compiler bugs aren&#x27;t a major  practical concern for SPARK, although a formally verified compiler would be a great addition.<p>C has a fully verified compiler in CompCert. [3] I know of no other language with a fully verified compiler. (CompCert supports <i>almost</i> all C features, so it will either produce a valid binary for the input C code, or else fail with an error.)<p>Rust has a bit of a history of troublesome compiler bugs. I think we&#x27;re a way off seeing Rust used in critical systems, assuming it would even make sense to use a language like Rust. Memory management is handled quite differently in applications like avionics.<p>&gt; Can a single person fully understand them?<p>The compilers&#x2F;linkers? I imagine the most well-informed developers on the Rust and Ada compilers pretty much know how everything works, but really that&#x27;s just a guess. If someone were to make a compiler specifically for SPARK, it could be simpler than a full Ada compiler, as SPARK forbids most Ada features. I don&#x27;t know that this is likely to happen though.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.sel4.systems&#x2F;projects&#x2F;sel4&#x2F;frequently-asked-questions.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.sel4.systems&#x2F;projects&#x2F;sel4&#x2F;frequently-asked-que...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sel4.systems&#x2F;Info&#x2F;FAQ&#x2F;proof.pml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sel4.systems&#x2F;Info&#x2F;FAQ&#x2F;proof.pml</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.adaic.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;atwork&#x2F;boeing.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.adaic.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;atwork&#x2F;boeing.html</a> (This is about Ada, and is not specifically about the SPARK subset)<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CompCert" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CompCert</a>')
