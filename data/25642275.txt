It is relatively &quot;easy&quot; to solve this particular issue by just not returning highly specific data. Instead of saying &quot;896m&quot;, return &quot;&lt;1km&quot; or &quot;1km-3km&quot; etc. Can you still abuse the data to some extent? Yes in theory, but it&#x27;s significantly harder and takes a lot more work to get anything reasonable.<p>You can also truncate the data you have on users. 2 digits of Decimal_degrees precision is +&#x2F;- 1KM. If you&#x27;re doing an Uber-like service, knowing where a user is down to a few feet makes a different (which side of the street). But if you&#x27;re just concerned with &quot;Hey people nearby you are using this app too&quot; (which is all too common).. Do you really need to know&#x2F;save&#x2F;keep where a user is beyond 1 sq km? No, you don&#x27;t.<p>Yes, Apple has a coarse data that does something like this, but take it that one step farther. Don&#x27;t need the info? Don&#x27;t collect it (your app doesn&#x27;t need to send it) and don&#x27;t store it.')
