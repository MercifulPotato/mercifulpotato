Since good VHS decks are getting harder (and more expensive) to find, I haven&#x27;t got a good[1] one yet. I&#x27;d be interested to know if the difference between the two decks was noticeable!<p>[1] I consider the recommendations on this thread: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalfaq.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;video-restore&#x2F;1567-vcr-buying-guide.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalfaq.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;video-restore&#x2F;1567-vcr-buyin...</a> to be fairly good at separating good VHS decks from the rest of the pack.')
