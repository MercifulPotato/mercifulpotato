I understand why the decision was taken at the time it was (it was before my time, but it was when G Suite had much better collaborative editing than MS offered, and when the company needed to upgrade it&#x27;s on-prem file server, and didn&#x27;t have any capable of managing things like that in house), but it turned out, with hindsight, to be a huge mistake.<p>You get things like issues with a user not having visiblity of items in a folder, and support ask you to check all folders shared with the user to see how many are affected. There are tens of thousands of these, so this is obviously impractical.<p>I had an issue with their &quot;eventually consistent&quot; admin interface not showing whether a user was part of a group, and their response was to wait 24 hours to see if they have been sucessfully added to it, or to email the entire group and ask the user to check whether they got the test email.<p>We had a Google Sheets file that, for whatever reason, was not able to be opened. Months later, the issue is unresolved. If we didn&#x27;t have daily backups that use the API to make a copy, exporting Google Docs, Sheets and Slides files as MS Office documents, using a thrd-party service, we would have just effectively lost this data.<p>It is clear that Google does not treat this as a business class product, and it hurts to business users.<p>It is getting worse and worse IMHO, while the MS competition is getting better and better. It is only a matter of time until we switch I think, and I would strongly caution anyone against adopting it, especially if you plan to use it as the primary file sharing method for more than 10 users. For us, the thing making it hard to move is that our data on Google Drive is a mess. We haven&#x27;t been using Team Drives, because we have been using Google Drive since before they were a thing, so have complicated nested permissions, meaning we can&#x27;t simply move things to Team Drives. If you have used it for as long as we have, when there was no way to prevent users from doing this, and didn&#x27;t have policies about how it was used to prevent this (whiuch we didn&#x27;t, we started using it before I joined the company) I don&#x27;t see how you can have avoided this.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how GCP compares, but I have been pretty disappointed by how slow they have been to support recent versions of PostgreSQL and MySQL in their hosted DB service. We use AWS mostly, and, while there are things about GCP that look nice, they seem to fail to do the basics that would not be at all hard for them to do, and it looks like they don&#x27;t take it seriously as a product either really. It is sad really, given that there really needs to be more competition for AWS and Azure IMHO.')
