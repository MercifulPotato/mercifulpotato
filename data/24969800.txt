Similarly, in most of the rest of the world (which was conquered by Europeans at some time or another), civil administration would have switched to Gregorian when Europeans started administration, although this might not imply a change in local usage of calendar.<p>Islamic countries have had the most resistance to the Gregorian calendar, with Saudi Arabia not using it (de jure, although it was used in private industry de facto) until 2016 and Iran and Afghanistan still not using it.')
