Basically, post-war USA had a monopoly in industrialization. Great Britain, France, Germany, USSR, Japan had all had their industry literally blown up. China  had undergone a huge civil war and invasion and occupation by the Japanese. India was just emerging from centuries of British colonialism which basically exploited its natural resources.<p>In addition, in the USA there was rampant and overt discrimination and harassment against women. There was open racism and segregation.<p>So if you were a white male, your skills were desperately needed as the US now supplied the industrial output for a huge chunk of the world&#x27;s population.<p>Even in Europe, a generation of males had been killed in two world wars. There was a huge labor shortage. And especially for Western Europe, with the Marshall Plan, the US was pumping in loads of cash to enable industrialization to face a perceived Soviet threat.<p>It all came together to create a very high demand on labor, and as such allowed labor to claim a high proportion of the value generated. Those were the days where you could have one man with a high school education, support an entire family in middle class lifestyle with a detached house and yard.<p>Those post-ware days are long gone, and no tax policy will bring them back. The rest of world is industrializing. Globalization is happening with the world getting flatter. A larger percentage of the population is entering the work force.')
