With EARN-IT the responsibility is on the encryption providers, so those two random devs who made the app. You can&#x27;t tell what the users were talking about since communication is encrypted, you can&#x27;t really prosecute any of the users for anything besides maybe using those apps if it becomes completely illegal or you can prove that the app is only used by criminals and no one else.<p>Now you can potentially go after the devs, assuming of course you can figure out who made the app, and assuming these people are in a place where US laws apply. The global nature of the Internet makes things very difficult. If a Swedish team develops and encrypted communication app and distributes it on their website, are they still required to comply with US laws? If they prevent US citizens from downloading the app with geoblocking but people get around it with VPN&#x27;s, are they still required to comply with US laws?')
