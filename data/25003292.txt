There are probably some unpleasant high-value tasks this person needs to be doing instead, so they convince themselves that this is high-value and do this because it&#x27;s pleasant to them.<p>You can actually weaponize this to do things that are &quot;less unpleasant&quot; but still worthwhile. Such tasks are much more palatable in the presence of another, more unpleasant task that you&#x27;d have to do instead.<p>Story time: at Google the most unpleasant task employees have to do is writing their own (and their reports&#x27;, if they have any) performance review, which results in a phenomenon called &quot;perfcrastination&quot;, where a shit ton of work gets done just to postpone writing Perf until the last possible moment.')
