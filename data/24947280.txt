That would let others adjust their expectations.<p>Especially cops, it could be legal to be asleep&#x2F;drunk if the car is autonomous!<p>That being said, it would be great if autonomous cars kept up with traffic. I&#x27;ve seen autonomous cars going 50mph on hwy 101 when other traffic is going 70mph, or 5mph over normal highway speeds. Not a great situation.')
