But I wouldn&#x27;t even dare try in other editors.<p>My experience with vim always seems atypical when I read blog posts like this. For me it&#x27;s a hard-to-kill, reliable text editor. I barely know any of the commands (despite using it for a decade) because I&#x27;ve honestly never felt like I was missing anything. Just having something reliably fast lets me get away with inefficiencies that are problems elsewhere. I can&#x27;t stand hjkl navigation, or remember anything more complex than how to find&#x2F;replace strings. But I&#x27;m perfectly happy with it just like that.')
