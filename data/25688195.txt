Because X number of people feel they need buy in. If you don&#x27;t get them onboard and give them a chance to voice opinions you&#x27;ll be pushing uphill to get work done.<p>And meetings are actually a fairly effective way to do that -- you have a group&#x27;s attention for a set amount of time. If you just sent a doc then you&#x27;d have to follow up, etc.<p>That sort of becomes the default, so there are meetings even when that sort of buy in isn&#x27;t necessary, bc meetings are just how things get done.')
