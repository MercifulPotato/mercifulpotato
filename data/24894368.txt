My laptop has a full-sized HDMI port and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be able to work alongside the one over Type-C, but as it turns out, it doesn&#x27;t work over Type-C at all! It also, despite supposedly supporting Thunderbolt, which includes charging in the spec, does not charge over Type-C (despite many of their other models supporting both fast charging over barrel jack and standard charging over Type-C).')
