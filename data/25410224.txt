The Bell Curve explicitly argues that some racial groups are inherently, biologically less intelligent than others.  In the author&#x27;s view, that in itself is overtly racist (because it argues that one racial group is genetically inferior to another racial group), no matter how much intellectual argument is presented or how gently it is stated.  Perhaps you use the word differently, and believe that something is only racist if the author hates people on the basis of race.')
