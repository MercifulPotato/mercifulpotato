If programming is just getting a job done, and being a good programmer is just picking the right tool to get the job done...<p>The real question is pragmatic, not theoretical. Does your dependence on a tool sometimes make easy things impossible or encourage misunderstandings about lower level processes that lead to bugs or inefficiencies? Is it simply too big or expensive to run in all of the places you might want to program? Does the tool make up for that lack of flexibility with increased productivity? Those are real questions that you can ask about any specific tool (including the shell.) It doesn&#x27;t mean anything to ask them about tools in general, and the idea that sacrifices and benefits must all come out even in the end is just the law of averages.')
