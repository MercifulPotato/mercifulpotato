It was a fun experience and I&#x27;ve used VR helmets since then and its been another fun experience, but we still don&#x27;t have a must have, killer application that is going to bring VR to the masses.<p>iPhones were replacing something that people already had with something that did it so much better than before that it seemed like magic.  I can&#x27;t see VR doing that unless the tech becomes so wonderful that it can be added to spectacles&#x2F;contact lenses or the experience injected right into the brain cheaply and someone creates a killer app that people will want to use repeatedly.<p>There will always be technical and industrial uses - training, visualization etc that can justify expensive headsets and expensive content creation but those are niche markets.')
