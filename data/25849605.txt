So now you&#x27;re comparing the statistical probability of abiogenesis against the product of the probabilities of a half dozen unlikely events (roughly, first abiogensis -&gt; cells -&gt; animals -&gt; intelligence -&gt; civilization -&gt; technological civilization -&gt; society stable enough to spread life amongst the stars). This isn&#x27;t clear cut, but my best guess is that abiogenesis happening twice is rather more likely.<p>The second is via some form of microbial life leaving the star system and spreading to other stars by accident (whether evolutionary accident or &#x27;act of God&#x27;). I think it&#x27;s possible life could leave the star system by some mechanism and with a ridiculous number of individuals and time could hit other star systems rather than floating in between systems forever. Then it has to land on a planet that not only doesn&#x27;t kill it, but allows it to thrive. (Tardigrades aren&#x27;t going to populate the moon.) I&#x27;m not sure how possible or likely this would be, but I&#x27;m guessing it requires a ton of time (that the universe may not have experienced yet) and, if it were likely, we&#x27;d have already found evidence of life on Mars.')
