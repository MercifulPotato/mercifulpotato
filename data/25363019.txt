Item(by='fairity', descendants=None, kids=[25363324], score=None, time=1607541289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360046, text='I think you&#x27;re attributing too much credit to California.<p>&gt; Highly talented employees<p>The vast majority of Tesla&#x27;s &quot;talented&quot; employees came from out of state.  Regardless of that, I don&#x27;t understand the perspective that employment is an act of &quot;taking from the state&quot;.  Tesla pays above-market salaries.  Isn&#x27;t it, then, more accurate to view employment as Tesla giving back&#x2F;helping to the community?<p>&gt; Progressive policies that CA built for clean technology<p>I assume the policies you&#x27;re referencing are the tax credits for solar installation and EV purchases.  Aren&#x27;t these credits independent of where the company is located? If so, Tesla would have been able to take advantage regardless of their location.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s call this what it is - he doesn&#x27;t want to pay a large tax bill for the success that he has had (hence selling all property in CA)<p>It seems reasonable to assume that his tax bill and California policies were both factors in his decision to move.  What makes you so confident that the tax bill is the primary factor?  Do you have some inside knowledge?  If I were in his shoes, I&#x27;d be optimizing for Tesla&#x27;s success, not my personal taxes.  He&#x27;s already wildly rich, and it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that he&#x27;s not doing this for the money.')
