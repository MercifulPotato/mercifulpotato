Hopefully this is a more stable release than Catalina.</i><p>I had several problems with the early releases of Catalina, including my Apple-made USB keyboard not being recognized.<p>Even after it seemingly was fixed, a dot release would break it again. I did at least two clean installs to resolve the problem once a stable version of Catalina was released.<p>It&#x27;s completely different with Big Sur. I upgraded my work machine to Big Sur. After the Spotlight indexing was done, everything was working as it was previously, except I had the latest and greatest operating system.<p>It&#x27;s still only been a few days but so far, I have no complaints about Big Sur.<p>Loving the new desktop dynamic illustrations and how much faster Safari is, even compared to Catalina.<p>Obviously YMMV but so far, it&#x27;s been smooth sailing with Big Sur.')
