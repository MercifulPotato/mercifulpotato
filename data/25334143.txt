I remember my Cargo Operations instructor telling us that &quot;back in the day&quot; when they went into Singapore or other port in that region on a break-bulk ship, they would expect to be in port for 2-3 weeks, and go out and see the sights (read: hookers and bars). &quot;But with containers, these days we&#x27;re lucky if we are in port for more than 12 hours before we&#x27;re unloaded and back out to sea.&quot;')
