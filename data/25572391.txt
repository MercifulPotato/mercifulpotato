Then you risk getting bought &#x2F; pushed out by outsiders that just want a &quot;safe neighborhood&quot; or an &quot;artsy area&quot; and not really a community.<p>It seems like these social groups -- besides needing a non-financial mission, shared rituals and beliefs, and some kind of exclusivity -- need a strategy for dealing with the social connection-dissolving &quot;market&quot; that exists around it.')
