And maybe that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll end up, but I think that&#x27;s a much more malicious result than generated porn. Or maybe anonymity will disappear online, which I find fairly scary, but is another clear thrust we&#x27;re seeing.<p>Also - What about the absolutely bonkers industry that will be consent based generated porn?  We&#x27;re already headed that route now with 3d scanning of actors&#x2F;actresses, and lord knows - I think a lot of folks in the porn industry would be happy to get digitally imaged and then not have to actually engage in the physical process of making porn.<p>---<p>I think this is a real and genuine ethics question that we don&#x27;t have good answers to right now.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with PH pulling down anonymous user content (hell - private company, they can make their own decisions) but I also don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s going to stop this kind of behavior, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t untangle complex social questions around what&#x27;s right and wrong in this space.<p>I will say - I think we&#x27;re undergoing another sexual revolution right now, it&#x27;s just more subtle because it&#x27;s less about what folks do or wear in public, and more about what folks do in private.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how you legislate on this topic either - What&#x27;s art? What&#x27;s porn? can you really &quot;Know it when you see it&quot;? What if you unintentionally make imagery that just <i>resembles</i> a real person?<p>Those are all questions that depend on social context at the time they&#x27;re legislated on, and they set a tone going forward.<p>Basically - My whole point is that this is not some clear win, and again - I&#x27;m not entirely sure there&#x27;s a win anywhere in this discussion.  I think this is just PH skirting around the issue for monetary reasons because they happen to be big enough at this point that they can do without anonymous submissions.<p>I will say - I&#x27;m fairly sure any &quot;it&#x27;s simple and this will solve it!&quot; response is utter bullshit.')
