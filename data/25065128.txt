Debian&#x27;s position is that they do not have the resources for such a team, which is fair enough, but IMO the conclusion should be that they don&#x27;t have the resources to be applying their own patches to security-critical software.<p>More subjectively I get the sense that Debian packagers patch more aggressively and generally think the Debian way of things is better. This isn&#x27;t completely groundless: there&#x27;s a lot of very high quality engineering in Debian, and for a long time their package management was head and shoulders above others, especially if we&#x27;re talking about C programs&#x2F;libraries where upstream dependency management is very weak. But it&#x27;s also made for a culture where packagers think they know better than upstream maintainers, and an approach that ends up conflicting quite a bit with newer languages where there is high-quality dependency management in the upstream builds.')
