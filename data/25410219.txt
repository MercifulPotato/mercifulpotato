I used to use Delphi 4 and it would create 350 KB programs by default.<p>Which was also bad, so I sometimes used that Delphi without the GUI designer and without the VCL, using the win32 API directly, to create 50 KB programs. That is a reasonable software size. Software keeps getting worse every year')
