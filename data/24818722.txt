Most tier 1 panels are expected to last 25-30 years.<p>- I notice that battery prices are roughly halving every 3 years. At what point does it become cheaper to attach batteries to Indian solar plants than it is to operate coal powered plants?<p>At a grid level this is a complex question that I&#x27;m not completely qualified to answer because it goes into the larger question of energy mix and energy security. At a factory or building level, we are not that far - we&#x27;re already offering monthly packages (in terms of cost) which amounts to 10-15c&#x2F;unit of a blended rate (solar + battery). The min it breaches 8c&#x2F;kWHr blended rate, this can become more permanent. I&#x27;m speculating but some of what I&#x27;ve seen in Li-ion and ESS flow costs we may be two years or less out.')
