Both are significantly more rational and less emotional than conservatives.<p>&gt;&gt;Rational does not guarantee correct, if you don&#x27;t consider all the variables.<p>Of course, but a rational mindset is more likely to base its beliefs on evidence and logically sound suppositions, and thus be correct, than an emotional one.<p>&gt;&gt;What is unique to Libertarians I know is an arrogance about the objective correctness (because of their lack of emotion and rationality) of their philosophy.<p>I think the willingness of adherents of non-libertarian ideologies to use the force of the state to force peaceful people to bend to their will reveals a greater arrogance. I find &quot;live and let live&quot; to show the greatest humility, but I suppose this is all subjective.')
