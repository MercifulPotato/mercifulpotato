This amounts to little more than gossip and mud-slinging and if the target were anyone but Paul Graham, it likely would have been flagged to death long ago.<p>The irony is that the attention it gets here may end up accounting for the lion&#x27;s share of exposure it gets.<p>HN Guidelines say:<p><i>When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. &quot;That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3&quot; can be shortened to &quot;1 + 1 is 2, not 3.&quot;</i><p>I guess if you choose your target carefully, you can get around that rule by writing an entire blog post that fails to make any kind of real and substantive argument with anything in particular and merely calls him an &quot;idiot&quot; at length.<p>HN is no longer &quot;turning into Reddit.&quot; Now it&#x27;s turning into &quot;People&quot; magazine as long as the people you gossip about are tech people.<p>If you think Paul Graham is &quot;out of touch,&quot; maybe you can work on an app that helps rich people solve the problem of finding themselves surrounded by a sea of either <i>yes men</i> sucking up to them or haters. I imagine that sucks the oxygen out of their intellectual life for quite a lot of successful people.')
