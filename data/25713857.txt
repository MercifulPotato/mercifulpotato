They&#x27;re mega-platforms with many uses beyond politics (business, hobbies, family, etc).<p>Whilst on there for non-political purposes, you can&#x27;t in practice &#x27;choose to ignore&#x27; the political speech you&#x27;d prefer to avoid, as it&#x27;s made everybody an activist with a massive megaphone. Activism is shared and retweeted into your face relentlessly.<p>If Big Tech as a whole has decided to wage war on &#x27;red team&#x27; ideas (or other competing ideas, such as Unity 2020, banned from Twitter), there&#x27;s a risk that they could transform a bad 2-party political system into a single-party monopoly, where the voters have no power at all.<p>Things weren&#x27;t good when old media (TV&#x2F;newspapers) had all the power+influence.
