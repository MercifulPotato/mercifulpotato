There aren&#x27;t a lot of wealthy people, so if politicians are pandering to the majority, this is the wrong call. It&#x27;s well known not to work for a long time, so logically it&#x27;s also the wrong call. Are most politicians wealthy? Is that why they seem to overly protect the interests of this group over the rest of the population? Straight up self-interest or corruption?')
