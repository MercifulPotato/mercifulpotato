Even with 99% of efficiency they&#x27;d have to shed megawatts of heat. Since there is no convective or conductive cooling in space your steady-state option is radiative cooling which is constrained by surface area, temperature difference and emissivity. You don&#x27;t have much flexibility on the latter two. So you need to increase surface area. The ISS&#x27; radiators take up about 200mÂ² and can reject 70kW. There are non-steady-state options such as sacrificial coolants or plain thermal mass but that would require extra mass, resupplies or additional downtime. In The Expanse the ships just don&#x27;t have enough area considering they&#x27;re powered by fusion reactors burning constantly.')
