I do not &quot;hate big corporations&quot;.   I may dislike some big corporations.  I&#x27;ve enthusiastically worked for others.<p>I <i>hate</i> poverty, injustice, and bigotry.  I cannot stir up strong feelings about an advertising company.<p>On the other hand I am a terrible advertising target, not wholly impervious to advertising but actively resistant, in part having seen under the bonnet of the sector and found little but a morass of grubby lies and folks with broken moral compasses.  I intentionally interpret advertising as noise, not signal.<p>(corollary: attempts to disguise advertising are an irritant and a cognitive burden, so I allocate advertorials, content marketing, and drip-email compaigns to the Brand Damage circle of hell)')
