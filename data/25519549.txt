It all depends on the implementation but ultimately I think it should be a parents choice. Personally I would not be opposed to facial recognition in school and I don&#x27;t think there is any expectation of privacy in schools. Risks could include someone unauthorized coming to take a child out of school (e.g. ex-husband&#x2F;wife)<p>But I&#x27;m open to change my mind and hear the arguments against it.')
