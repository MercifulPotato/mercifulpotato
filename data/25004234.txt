Item(by='kmtrowbr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604629026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002165, text='Proposition L is not enough tax to take away the economic prosperity.<p>I am all for building more and more dense housing. I&#x27;m not sure how to accomplish it. The way I see it, SF either becomes more dense, or it becomes even more of &quot;a toy city for rich people&quot; &amp; loses all hope of economic diversity.<p>I grew up in Michigan. I am well aware of how cities can fall into decline. My wife on the other hand grew up in Minnesota. So in my mind, I often compare Detroit with Minneapolis. I think the problem with Detroit is that, it never diversified. It was all auto industry. Minneapolis&#x27;s economy has several pillars: finance, insurance, healthcare, industry. You can ask yourself whether or not SF is either Detroit or Minneapolis in this example. I tend to think of SF as the New York of the West coast. It has very unique geographical advantages. It will have ups and downs, but will continue to be reborn.')
