According to Kindle insights I&#x27;ve read 95 books this year.<p>I&#x27;ve always been a reader though; my mother would buy me a video game on my birthday or Christmas, but anytime I asked for a book she&#x27;d buy it for me.<p>Your reading speed will increase over time. When I read, I don&#x27;t read word-by-word, line-by-line; I kind of dart back and forth through the page scanning for what I deem important and excluding things like detailed descriptions etc.. Usually the first line of a paragraph will tell you if it&#x27;s worth reading carefully. If it&#x27;s something like<p>&gt; &quot;Character A walked into the detritus of the ancient castle left by the shelling. They were struck by the total destruction of the place, a place that had stood stoically for centuries against endless tides of invaders, all undone...&quot; etc.<p>I read &quot;ok, character A walked into a destroyed castle&quot; and move on.<p>I imagine I&#x27;m not getting the &quot;full experience&quot; by doing this, but even when reading big series like Malazan or the Wheel of Time I don&#x27;t find I&#x27;m suddenly encountering things for the first time: the salient details seem to stick in my head.')
