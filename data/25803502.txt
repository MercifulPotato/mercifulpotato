The project is an implementation of an API which was discontinued by the original developers, but initially was built using Maven.<p>After switching from Gradle (which the project switched to in 2014) back to Maven, build times significantly decreased and development became much more pleasant. I found Gradle to be like a speed bump slowing down development, and reverting back to Maven was like a breath of fresh air. Simple, straightforward, and fast. Maven may not be perfect, but it does the job well.<p>[1] An open source Bukkit server implementation, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GlowstoneMC&#x2F;Glowstone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GlowstoneMC&#x2F;Glowstone</a> -&gt; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GlowstonePlusPlus&#x2F;GlowstonePlusPlus" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GlowstonePlusPlus&#x2F;GlowstonePlusPlus</a>')
