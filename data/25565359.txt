Why <i>were</i> these policies &quot;failures&quot; in Europe? Some of the flaws of the European taxes have been already directly addressed by more recent Bernie and Warren proposals. For another example the issue some European countries had of their wealthy fleeing the country to avoid the tax isn&#x27;t even possible US&#x27;s tax system which will tax you regardless of where you live.')
