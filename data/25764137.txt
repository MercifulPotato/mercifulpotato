It has made SO a toxic place where honest questions that are researched prior are punished. I do understand why it happens though because for every honest question, there&#x27;s probably thousands of questions from people who obviously don&#x27;t do any research.<p>Then having your &quot;Thank you for answering my question&quot; comment removed by SO moderators because they don&#x27;t want thank you&#x27;s on the platform... It&#x27;s just turned into too much of a toxic place and is an absolute last resort.<p>IMO. Others experiences may be different :)<p>The point is that people generally downvote for whatever reason they want. Even with community standards that help to educate people, by empowering people to downvote, they just exercise that right and it has consequences for the community.')
