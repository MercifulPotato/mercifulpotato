The core idea being that if the language makes it easy to spin up descriptive purpose-built dimensions, vectors are the only data structure we need!<p>It started out as a straightforward attempt to program with units and conversions, but slowly generalized to this vector concept. The next steps are about building a static dimension language (like a type language) to slice-and-dice vectors with projections.')
