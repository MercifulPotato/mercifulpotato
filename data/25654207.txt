I’m an SDE 2 at Amazon. Currently looking for an opportunity to leave the corporate world and build something new. My skill set is AWS stack, big data, machine learning, some React. I’ve spent considerable time on large scale distributed systems&#x2F;spark&#x2F;ml research. I love to code, especially when not encumbered by enterprise systems. Previously I worked in investment research and had a minor machine learning startup exit. If anyone is interested in a technical cofounder I would be great! For reference, I have about 7 years experience.')
