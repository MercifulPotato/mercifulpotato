Honest researchers shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;anti&quot; anything. Coronavirus doesn&#x27;t have an opinion on HCQ. It is a virus that either responds biologically to HCQ in vivo or it doesn&#x27;t. Pro or anti are political terms that change the conversation from scientific  to propaganda based.<p>If the research indicates that HCQ has a powerful prophylactic effect against Coronavirus in a double blind study, then let the data speak for itself.<p>However saying that you&#x27;re &quot;pro-HCQ&quot; or &quot;anti-HCQ&quot; immediately discredits you in my eyes because viral pandemics don&#x27;t have emotions and therefore can&#x27;t care whether you are pro or anti anything.')
