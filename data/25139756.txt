This isn&#x27;t just a wired RFP... its supercharged.<p>From Q&amp;A:<p>&gt; Answer: The provider of the information would need to have approvals to provide the\ninformation to DEA and provide it without additional costs or approvals from the original\ndata provider. We would need it to be able to be analyzed outside of the host\nenvironment so that we could take the results of the query and create our own reports and\ndashboards and provide it to the necessary individuals in the field who could use the data\nfor investigative purposes.<p>So... this information is required to be provided to the DEA by law... but apparently some 3rd party entity is receiving it (I&#x27;ll bet this is for LexisNexus) with apparently no restrictions on how its used and now the DEA is going to pay a stupid amount of money so they can do whatever shady shit they have planned.')
