I&#x27;m an american born chinese. I&#x27;m basically a lazy bastard like every other american. If you go to china you&#x27;ll see these people are industrious af. They will work their ass off no question under slave labor until they kill themselves. You&#x27;ve heard of the nets to prevent suicide in Foxconn right?<p>The movie spins the whole situation as a cultural problem. This is partly true. The other part that is 100% true is that Chinese people work 400% harder and faster than you or I. I know from anecdotal experience both from going to China, working in a chinese store with other chinese people under my mom as a kid (and getting fired by my own mom for not being as efficient as the other chinese people) and watching this movie. It&#x27;s real.')
