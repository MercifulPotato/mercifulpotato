Bear that in mind.&quot;<p>This &#x27;nuclear energy is like a nuclear bomb&#x27; delusion is really harmful and pushes a narrative that many ordinary believe - if you use nuclear material for non-weapon purposes it risks behaving like a nuclear weapon. Journalists should take some responsibility for this kind of thing - it has very real impacts on public perception of nuclear and therefore govt decision making.<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SsdLDFtbdrA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SsdLDFtbdrA</a>')
