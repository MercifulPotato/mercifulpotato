Personally, my desire to write long-form text is extremely bursty.<p>If I&#x27;m making notes during a discussion, I might not write anything for a considerable time. However, when an important point is made, I want to record it as quickly and passively as possible, so I can stay connected to whatever else is being said.<p>If I&#x27;m thinking deeply about something, again I might not write anything for a long time. Then if the idea I&#x27;ve been searching for all week clicks, I might make a lot of notes over the next couple of minutes, while the line of reasoning is completely clear in my mind.<p>I type English text at a comparable speed to a professional secretary, but a way of recording important thoughts even faster when I encounter them would be valuable to me. The same goes for concepts that aren&#x27;t plain English, too, such as code, mathematics or some sort of diagram.')
