Having an unsubscribe option on repeated, unanswered solicitations would be helpful.  The emails are not spam, and in the first email chain they are rather straightforward about their proposal and methods.  I&#x27;m not sure what the <i>scam</i> actually is here.. people offering money for dev to <i>scam</i> users out of bandwidth?  I do think it&#x27;s noble of dev ignore the solicitation and provide exposure to this market however.')
