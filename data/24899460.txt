There are many, many Asian students there. In fact, nearly one in five students at Harvard are of Asian descent. The idea that elite schools are purposely excluding Asians is absurd on its face. The people pushing the idea have an axe to grind and it usually isn’t actually in the interest of Asian-Americans.<p>Are there any elite school (so sourcing students from the same pool of applicants) that don&#x27;t include race in their admission process? Would be interesting to compare the demographics.')
