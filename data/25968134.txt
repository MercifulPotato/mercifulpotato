I <i>stress</i> to candidates that they can and should search the web in whatever way they would when tasked with code in real life.<p>The speed at which someone can process search results and stackoverflow responses to filter out crap and find the solution is the best proxy I&#x27;ve found for developer productivity.<p>Some people don&#x27;t search for anything, even after prodding them 3 times that it&#x27;s 100% fine to search and they definitely won&#x27;t lose points.  They still won&#x27;t do it, because it&#x27;s just not how they reason about problems.<p>Other candidates will immediately identify the problem, search with good queries, quickly navigate through a bunch of sites, find the relevant info, copy&#x2F;paste, and solve the challenge.')
