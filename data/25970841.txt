I know of some companies who transitioned to electric vehicles (think skid loaders and other yard vehicles) who had to install their own battery systems and generators because by the time the vehicles needed to start charging, they were hit with way way higher than normal electrical prices.<p>I dont know the specifics- i.e. if not all of their vehicles could go a full day of charging- but only that yes, there are mechanisms in place to force those who can afford it to adapt.<p>Everyone else has to hope they can plug into a smart grid that only actually charges when the price drops.')
