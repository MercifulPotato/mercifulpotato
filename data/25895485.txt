The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily too many clients, but too many transport agents.<p>In a way, they&#x27;re almost all reincarnations of what email,  IRC or XMPP could already do, with a few makeup changes, often designed to lock-in the user and consequently fragment the user base.<p>What we need is perhaps more clients, with different interfaces but using the proven underlying protocols and implementing new features client side. Delta Chat, making use of email, does this, with the added bonus of SMTP&#x27;s natural decentralisation and openness.')
