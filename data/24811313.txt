If your plan is aggressive (pay off in 5y) the return on investment for the following 25y using the full &quot;mortgage payment&quot; works out (money makes money) - but you must be disciplined and determined.<p>Edit: also just to share, I completely underestimated the reduction in cost of living which happened when I moved from a location where houses were very expensive to somewhere much more modest ($$$) but same type of community (nice street, nice neighbors, low crime, etc.). I ended up saving a lot of extra money by accident in just regular life things which I was able to roll over into the extra payoffs. I feel this accident in my math helped work in my favour very significantly to my overall plan, it took me a bit of &quot;where is this extra money coming from?&quot; reflection to realize my initial mistake in the plan. This could of course cut both ways, should you move into a more expensive community with a higher cost of living in your new house.')
