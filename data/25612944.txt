No Internet, no cell phone, effectively no PCs, just a bit of mail order, scheduled TV, etc. I sometimes only half-joke that if I got dropped into my first tech job (as a product manager) in the mid-80s, I&#x27;d quit after a week because I would be so frustrated trying to do my job. (And we even had things like email.)')
