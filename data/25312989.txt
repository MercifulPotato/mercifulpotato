You can&#x27;t on the student loan. Because of this, before you take out a car loan, the bank actually checks on how likely you are to pay it back. They don&#x27;t loan you a $30k to buy a new Camry if you&#x27;re 17 years old making minimum wage. They will happily loan you that much and more to go college even if you are, because they know you&#x27;ll just be in debt forever no matter what.<p>We could fix the college loan problem practically overnight by making the loans dischargeable in bankruptcy. Lenders would be on the hook for the risk they&#x27;re assuming, as they should be. Universities would have to lower tuition because there wouldn&#x27;t be an endless firehouse of money pointed at them to pay whatever they want. It would fix a lot.')
