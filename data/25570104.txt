The metaphor for manipulating files, drivers etc has been the pinnacle of the desktop metaphor (maybe with the exception of BeOS but they just copied and made kinda better version of MacOS classic.<p>I recently bought a Powermac G4&#x2F;553 DA model and it&#x27;s really responsive with Classic. One of the last Classic-compatible models. But it feels really simple compared to any modern OS.<p>And something I&#x27;ve forgotten in 20 years since the last usage of Classic: There&#x27;s no real multi-tasking. Uncompressing zip or sit packages basically blocks the whole OS until the work is done.<p>Oh and other things taken for granted nowadays I&#x27;ve forgotten: one can use _the same computer for other things when scanning photos_. Then even the fastest computer was blocked until the scanning was completed :D')
