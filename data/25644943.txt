The terms I most often associate with them is &quot;high-assurance&quot; or &quot;critical supply chain&quot; software. There&#x27;s bound to be many others.<p>These requirements crop up in stuff like the firmware for ATM keypad. Or Google&#x27;s source code (they vendor everything in their own trees). Or Vegas slot machines.<p>In an amusing twist, software supply chain assurance is such a massive problem that large security consultancies offer code escrow services. If you, as a software seller, can&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll be around 20 years down the line, the buyer can require you to submit your code to such a third-party service. Should you go out of business, the source code will remain accessible to the buyer for their future development needs.')
