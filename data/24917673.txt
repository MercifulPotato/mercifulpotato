For instance, if 80% of the people that did not have to be hospitalized also had a Vitamin D deficiency, then there is nothing meaningful about the deficiency because it is the same between the two groups.<p>I could say pretty confidently that 80% of people hospitalized for COVID have brown eyes. Why? Because the overall population is about 80% brown eyed. We need to look at the difference first and foremost.<p>&gt; The important thing is that the more severe cases had D vitamin deficiency, therefore you have a higher chance to get a severe case if you are deficient.<p>Even if we found a large difference, that is far too little information to assume causation. For instance, it could be that the elderly are more likely to be Vitamin D deficient due to being sedentary and spending most of their time indoors, and the elderly are more likely to be hospitalized due to their age. So it wouldn’t be Vitamin D deficiency, it would be age that was the underlying cause of both phenomenon. We need to be very careful about making these leaps in logic, since it can send us down pointless rabbit holes and have people spending time and resources on things that do not actually help.')
