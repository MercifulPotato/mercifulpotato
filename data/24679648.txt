If Apple is the only store on your device and the government pressures Apple to reject an app you want, you can&#x27;t get it. If anyone can open a store and the government pressures Apple to reject an app you want, you get it from a store that government can&#x27;t pressure, or side load it.<p>Allowing someone to use another store and forcing them to use it are independent actions.<p>&gt; Even in the most free market of countries, you’ll end up with a small set of corporations you don’t trust as he only viable stores.<p>How does that make any logical sense? We already see on Android that there exist stores operated by trustworthy entities, like F-Droid. Opening up to other stores wouldn&#x27;t cause Apple&#x27;s store to cease to exist, if you trust them. And if you don&#x27;t then having alternatives available still wouldn&#x27;t be any worse than the status quo.')
