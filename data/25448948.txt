If there are two 1700 players, the opening player is only better if the game goes according to the prepared moves. A good tactical player who realizes you are going via prep will make a stupid move and pull you out of book. From this point on the tactical player has the advantage because he has experience defending random stuff, while the opening player has to figure out why the move so stupid it isn&#x27;t even in his book is bad and exploit that. Of course if the stupid move is in the opening book then the opening player is better, but that is unlikely.')
