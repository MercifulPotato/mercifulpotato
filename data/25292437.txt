While this yearly spike always poses an interesting infrastructure challenge, it wasn&#x27;t the only issue affecting our load balancing approach.<p>We switched from DNS load balancing to dedicated load balancers a few years back, though for different reasons. We found that the caching of DNS records prevented us from easily  cycling hosts out of rotation (or removing them in case of failures). When serving DNS to clients worldwide a not-insignificant minority will completely ignore DNS TTL. We&#x27;ve had requests follow latent DNS records for over 24 hours. To mitigate this, we switched to a managed load balancer solution that ensures redundant hosting under a static IP address.')
