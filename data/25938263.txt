He said without hesitation &quot;Give me $100.&quot;<p>I always answer and ask to be taken off their list. I know they&#x27;ll never do it, but if we all do it in aggregate, it might waste so much of their time that it&#x27;s no longer worth it for them.<p>When they say they won&#x27;t take you off their list, just hang up immediately. The whole process takes only a few tens of seconds.')
