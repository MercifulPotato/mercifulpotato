I have a 9-string guitar (low C#, F#, B below the usual strings) which I&#x27;ve never really made much use of, and adding a new tuning to the .json file was easy enough, and straight away I can use it to map things out on the fretboard.<p>When I get some time, I want to look into using this to produce PDF output for worksheets as it&#x27;ll be a lot quicker than my current workflow for producing scale diagrams for pupils.<p>Thanks!')
