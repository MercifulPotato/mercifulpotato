A Unix operating system can do everything I described with regular-old data, and it&#x27;s not a distributed operating system. It simply has extensible standard interfaces.<p>Do you need a distributed database to read a .txt file with <i>cat</i>, <i>Emacs</i>, and <i>Firefox</i>? No. Why not? Because there&#x27;s an I&#x2F;O standard they all use. Does that .txt file have to live on a single filesystem, or disk? No. Why not? Because the storage mediums all have a standard virtual filesystem interface.<p>There is no reason databases cannot do exactly the same thing. It&#x27;s just that nobody has made them do it yet. They&#x27;ve stuck with the exact same paradigm, and that then drives how all of us build our systems, with this archaic 40 year old model that requires heavy-lifting maintenance windows and a lot of praying.')
