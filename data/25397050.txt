At least with EV Nova&#x27;s Windows version, it seems to me that if you stripped out the licencing system and tossed it up on Steam, you could have had a nice income stream from there. I&#x27;d have bought it.<p>Most of the other games you might have been able to package into an emulator, like GOG games running in DOSbox.<p>But that&#x27;s my outside perspective, so maybe there were bigger legal or technical hurdles?')
