Such users have submitted sloppy <i>this-works-for-me-style</i> build patches to my project, which later were deemed incorrect by actual macOS experts. I had to do everything over again.<p>Then I was rudely accused of not using cmake, when autotools perfectly support cross builds (better than cmake on Linux).<p>It is not my problem if a purported Unix does not ship gcc or if clang cross builds are painful. Go and install gcc!<p>If Apple were interested in being supported, they&#x27;d fix their tool chain and provide free testing infrastructure to OSS developers.')
