That alone is really not something we should be making huge policy decisions around. It&#x27;s sad, of course, but it&#x27;s extremely isolated. All it does is distract us from making good policy decisions.<p>If I was making policy decisions I&#x27;d order vaccine rollout as follows:<p>Essential workers =&gt; 80+ years old =&gt; 70+ =&gt; 60+ =&gt; etc. as we produce and distribute the vaccines.<p>At some point we might look at the data and say &quot;that&#x27;s good enough, we can resume normal activities while we work to vaccinate the rest of the population&quot;.')
