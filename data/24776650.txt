You have to take into many intangibles, both pro and against your own stance to have a decent argument, let alone a realistic solution to the problem.<p>And if you actually pay attention to the argument, I dont mention to do ONE thing, as you straw manned me as saying to move to the suburbs. I say everyone needs to judge their own situations in an honest and logical fashion to better choose a solution for their personal needs. Not just listen to a random elitist trying to get on their highest of high horses to shame the rest of the population in their superficial future signaling. If you live in a heavy urban area with good public transit and high parking fees, hell no, dont own a car. It&#x27;s a bad idea. But to imagine the exact same solution can apply to everywhere else in the world is a sign of a small minded twat that&#x27;s never experienced life outside of their tiny bubble.')
