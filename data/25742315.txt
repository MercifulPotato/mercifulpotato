This includes all kinds of imitation and mimicry, i.e., simulating a state. Assuming that super intelligence is an extended state of &quot;normal&quot; intelligence, but excelling in capabilities, we must also assume assume that we would be only able to recognize it, if the superintelligence wants to be recognized or allows for it in any other way (e.g., doesn&#x27;t care about being recognized, etc). Now we could obviously take simulation out of the equation (or definition), but then, what are we talking about?')
