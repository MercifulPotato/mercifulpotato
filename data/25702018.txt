Biased - but credible.<p>The fact that a few individuals maybe planned on doing something &#x27;really crazy&#x27; doesn&#x27;t actually mean there&#x27;s a larger movement there either.<p>That&#x27;s why we depend on the press to try to get a generally factual and broad view of the situation. Watching a mix of CNN, PBS, Fox, NBC etc. will give most people a rounded purview of the situation, even if there is a lot of bias.<p>Watching Fox since the election has been a very interesting experience because they cannot support Trump&#x27;s false claims they have to have &#x27;integrity&#x27;. But what some of them are doing (Ted Cruze as well) is saying &#x27;people feel the election was stolen and they have a right to be heard&#x27; - basically they&#x27;ve taken the line of sympathizing with people who are angry, though they full well know the anger is based on absolute falsehood. Fox has been losing viewers to OAN where they take a &#x27;hardcore Pro-Trump&#x27; position no matter the facts, which is what many want to hear.<p>On many Fox articles, the comments are split 50&#x2F;50 with many hating on Trump, many supporting him. OAN and Breibart however, it&#x27;s full on Trump. The language is scary, many calling for violence against Pence etc. as a &#x27;traitor&#x27; for literally not committing Sedition and overturning the election on behalf of Trump.<p>So &#x27;the truth&#x27; is going to be a real problem for the next little while.')
