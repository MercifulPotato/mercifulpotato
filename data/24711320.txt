I didn&#x27;t notice any, way back when I last played Minecraft.<p>Re: a rewrite to C++ for consoles and mobile, yeah, when you&#x27;ve got hundreds of millions of dollars for a game whose prototype took about two human-years to write, seems like a good choice to rewrite it for a few-percent perf gain.  And, repeating myself, console certification standards being what they are, it makes sense for a company trying to ship to console to be terrified of gc stutter, even if GC only drops one frame a minute.  So yes, if you have a console goal, or yes if you have almost infinite engineering money, writing or rewriting in C++ is probably a good idea.<p>Do you know anything about why modern console and older consoles allegedly have separate codebases?')
