However, the Michigan water crisis is not simply a matter of one party accusing another party of misdeeds baselessly. There was a systematic negligence of duty throughout a prolonged period of time from 2014 to 2016. Experts were repeatedly brought in to assess the situation and offered professional recommendations that were ignored by elected officials. This negligence directly lead to the deaths and permanent disabilities of people. This is not a political issue.<p>Officials were warned that the Flint River was not adequately treated for legionella, and they did nothing. Officials were warned that lead pipes were leaching into the water supply because of the more acidic water from the Flint River and they did nothing. Simply because they wanted to save money by switching off of Detroit&#x27;s treated water.<p>This is negligence and the officials responsible deserve to be held accountable. The charges aren&#x27;t even that steep; $1000 or up to 1 year in prison. Given that they are elected officials they&#x27;ll probably get off with a slap on the wrist fine.<p>Sources:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;former-michigan-governor-rick-snyder-facing-neglect-charges-over-flint-water-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;former-michigan-governor-rick-s...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flint_water_crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flint_water_crisis</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;956592508&#x2F;new-charges-in-flint-water-crisis-including-former-michigan-gov-rick-snyder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;956592508&#x2F;new-charges-in-flin...</a>')
