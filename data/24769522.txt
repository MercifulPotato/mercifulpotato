I&#x27;d do 20-30 minute dog walks in the afternoon in shorts and no shirt, plus a few bike rides per week, also shirtless. I didn&#x27;t take any vitamin D supplements and, as far as I know, wasn&#x27;t eating any food with added vitamin D like milk.<p>At the end of it I did one of those mail-in vitamin D tests, and it put me at 40 ng&#x2F;mL. Depending on the source, that&#x27;s very bottom edge of the acceptable range.<p>Walking around with your shirt off feels pretty weird, and I can&#x27;t imagine most people would even be willing to do that. And of course it&#x27;s getting into the rainy season here in the pacific northwest, so there&#x27;s no sun exposure to be had no matter what you do.<p>Seems like, at least for someone like me who works indoors, supplementing is the only option to stay within a healthy range. I figure humans are just not adapted to wearing a lot of clothing and staying indoors all the time. I&#x27;m now taking 5000 IU per day, and I plan to take another test in a few months. Subjectively I can say that I feel far better than I did a few months ago, but that could be placebo or due to other factors. Still, I&#x27;m pretty convinced I should be supplementing vitamin D.')
