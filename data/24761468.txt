This wasn&#x27;t a function of a new age of tech Aquarius, it was simply because I was young and didn&#x27;t have experience - no basis to form loyalties.<p>Youngest workers may not realize the value prop of Outlook and Excel fat clients simply because they haven&#x27;t been hit with requirements that promote or even compel their use, but in the meantime those young workers are never getting highly proficient with the basics of using them. There&#x27;s a reason more seasoned knowledge workers (not 70yo, but 30-60 for sure) rely on them beyond inertia - broader requirements, favored features, road experience and ubiquity.<p>Similar angle on your comment about platform loyalty - a young person won&#x27;t be invested in a platform until they have the experience to recognize the penalties of swapping. Since I mentioned Excel already, keyboard shortcuts in Excel change across platforms. If Excel is considered a given part of your toolbox, this is one of the most aggravating things about swapping OS&#x27;s periodically: your muscle memory doesn&#x27;t apply. That&#x27;s a real hit to productivity. Young people don&#x27;t recognize this until they develop a skill level that will be impacted by these kinds of changes and are busy enough to not have time to deal with them.<p>So I wonder sometimes when I hear about that attitude - are they shooting themselves in the foot by not training early on or even having awareness of the potentially more advanced tooling options?<p>When I start getting into new hobbies I look at the tools the more advanced people use and learn what may (or may not) make them favored - as well as consider new ways of doing things. I also try to start on the better tools even if the learning curve is higher just so I can start racking up XP with them more quickly - so anticipating that a time will come when I too will leverage and appreciate the features, I&#x27;ll not be starting from scratch. That&#x27;s worked well.')
