Now Parlor gets &quot;canceled&quot; by vendors for not doing a good enough job trying to moderate content promoting violence. The bar for getting &quot;canceled&quot; is already moving down...</i><p>I fail to see how this is a movement of the bar.<p>Based on these two examples, the bar seems to be that a site gets canceled if a site is used to promote violence, there is a riot, violence happens, and people return to the site to celebrate and promote future violence.  That was the bar in both 2017 and 2021.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to have moved.<p>Given the fact that the attack on the Capitol was a direct attack on the US government, if anything the bar has been RAISED.')
