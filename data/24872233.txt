The debt has become the reality that the initial abstraction (&quot;all our buttons are the same&quot;) hasn&#x27;t kept pace with the needs of the product as it has iterated forward. Paying down the debt is creating new abstractions and updating all the buttons to be using them.<p>The worst case scenario is probably <i>partial</i> paydowns, where the abstractions get changed but some of the non-aligned stuff remains and so that you end up with a jumble. Especially combined with inadequate documentation (or a culture of inadequate documentation, where people don&#x27;t even look because they don&#x27;t expect it to be there), the old practices can end up being cargo culted forward even when someone attempted to create a better way.')
