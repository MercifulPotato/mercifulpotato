Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[24708085, 24707235], score=None, time=1602068546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24706498, text='&gt;In my opinion, a communication platform this large should be governed by the same free-speech laws we enjoy offline.<p>It is. The same free speech laws that allow Facebook and other platforms to exercise editorial discretion and ban unwanted content also allow newspapers, television and radio to choose what to publish and what not, allow businesses to refuse service and the posting of bills, and me to tell Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to get lost when they show up at my door.<p>Your right to free speech doesn&#x27;t include a right to force platforms to host that speech. It&#x27;s up to the so-called marketplace of ideas to decide whether or not your speech is worth spreading, and just as vendors can choose to stock a particular product or not, platforms can choose to host particular speech or not. Even Ben Franklin recognized this[0]. As a publisher he refused to publish libelous and slanderous speech, yet recognized the right of other publishers to do so if they wished.<p>And yes, this implies that the marketplace of ideas can, potentially, reject a particular kind of speech and that some forms of speech may be more difficult to find a platform for than others. Free speech doesn&#x27;t imply that all forms of speech must be treated equally or given equal merit, or that society cannot make distinctions between one form of speech and another, or discriminate between truth and falsehood, accepting one and rejecting the other. In a marketplace of ideas, it follows that not all ideas are equal.<p>If society decides to toss QAnon into the bargain bin of cultural relevance, that&#x27;s perfectly valid.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23065586" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23065586</a>')
