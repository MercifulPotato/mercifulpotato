The failure rate on any and all Samsung appliances is insane.<p>Their dryers are the worst. The belt tensioner is a plastic pulley with no bearing at all - it just rides on a sleeve. I&#x27;ve had a few of these go.<p>The front loader washers use some sort of zinc mounting place that reacts with the stainless steel drum and causes a failure (usually right after the warranty is up).<p>Just don&#x27;t do it.<p>With companies like Samsung, quality doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate across divisions. Their phones may be okay, but those aren&#x27;t the same people designing the appliances.')
