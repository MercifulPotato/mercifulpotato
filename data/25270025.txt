We are reinventing build engineering with an on-demand SaaS Platform and CLI tool that lets developers automate the building of any runtime environment using any open source language ecosystem on any platform. In Beta right now, we support Python and Perl and we&#x27;re hiring to add more languages and packages! Weâ€™re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to build it.<p>Some of the engineering positions listed have Build Engineer in the title, but these are for two different teams. The positions with &quot;BE&quot; in the code like &quot;2-2020BE&quot; are focused on fixing build problems (package X failed to build on platform Y). The positions with &quot;LE&quot; like &quot;2-2020LE&quot; are coding positions where you work on tools that do distributed builds.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for an Elm Developer and a Senior Product Manager.<p>I&#x27;m a Team Lead here at ActiveState, though none of the open positions are on my team right now. Please email me at autarch@urth.org if you have any questions.')
