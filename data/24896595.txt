If your website is so complex that you need it you are doing something wrong.<p>- Have a js standard library which provides all the common tooling for the remaining non-webapp js use case.<p>- Make it have one version each year (or half year), browsers will preload it when they ship updates and keep the last 10 or so versions around.<p>- Have a small standardized JS snippets which detects old browsers which are not evergreen (like IE) and loads a polyfill.<p>Sure there are some requirements to get there. E.g. making it reasonable easy to have proper complex layouts in a reactive fashion without much JS or insane complex CSS. (Which we can do by now due to css grid, yay).')
