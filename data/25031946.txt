We do some - geared towards measuring ad recall&#x2F;lift - and I find them valuable, especially a giant sample on only two recall + head to head questions<p>You can always ask for gender&#x2F;age and weight it but that&#x27;s part of what I see as the problem. so many &#x27;traditional&#x27; surveys i see make fairly large adjustments, lots of &#x27;looking back&#x27; at past turnout and over fitting based on personal bias. Especially when weighting from very small sub-sample xtab e.g. hispanics. im not a pollster and that&#x27;s just my still fairly-insider &#x2F; polling adjacent insight<p>Another problem with digital surveys is most of the firms do opt-in panels, like having people register to take surveys and get paid on mechanical turk. and then they weight from there. I think this is a problem. The surveys we do run inside of mobile ads, similar to Google &#x2F; FB Brand Lift surveys they go after those who saw the ads or a truly random sample, not a small biased group of survey panel')
