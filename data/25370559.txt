I think people who care about animals should think twice about having a pet if it means forcing that kind of procedure on a living being.<p>That&#x27;s my general take on the subject. To your point about anthropomorphism, I disagree, I think assessing one&#x27;s health and bodily integrity is a primal instinct that is most likely shared by most animals. I can&#x27;t say for sure but I have experienced a lot of body horror myself (torn &amp; deformed limbs) and it was never higher thoughts that prevailed, even in situations without pain (like after surgery).')
