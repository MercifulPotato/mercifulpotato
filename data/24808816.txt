I remember 10 years ago playing with Varnish, and it seriously blows my mind that even today sites get taken down by honestly fairly small traffic from HN. I sidestep the issue personally by having my blog (kn100.me) just be a static site generated with Hugo to keep page weight extremely low, and I stick Cloudflare in front of it. That way whenever something I write finds its way to the HN homepage, the backing server (the smallest instance Linode offers) barely even blinks.')
