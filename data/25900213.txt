Item(by='jfim', descendants=None, kids=[25900573], score=None, time=1611558582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898958, text='&gt; How do you reconcile that belief with the fact that Tesla&#x27;s embedded developers did not understand the extremely simple concept of write endurance?<p>That sounds more like the kind of situation where the software department said &quot;we need to have a system that has X amount of storage&quot; and the hardware department made the hardware for it, but there was some missing communication about endurance. It&#x27;s likely not the same people writing the autopilot software.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not a Tesla customer, and the way autopilot is deployed and marketed makes me very uneasy.')
