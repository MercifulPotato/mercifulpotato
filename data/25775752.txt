The UI is also poorly designed enough that accomplishing anything with it is a distraction (eg- does not separate parked and in-motion UIs, allows navigating 4 menus deep for a feature before throwing up a verbose text warning about why interacting with an option the 5th deep menu would be dangerous). Honda&#x27;s credibility and market didn&#x27;t receive any scrutiny for it.<p>Maybe touchpanels for any major control systems without tactile backups is a stupid idea?')
