For an extreme  example, by taking an extremely restricted subset of Python, Numba is able to get crazy speed-ups, automatic compilation to GPU kernels, etc. I&#x27;ve been waiting for someone to implement the subset of Python that allows for no GIL and huge speedups by cutting out some of the dynamic stuff. I&#x27;d bet 99% of the code I write would fit in that subset.')
