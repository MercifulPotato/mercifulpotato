You can add it on via a macro pretty easily, except that the &quot;selection of backing field&quot; is built in via the repr attribute. An example of this would be packages like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;enum_derive&#x2F;0.1.7&#x2F;enum_derive&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;enum_derive&#x2F;0.1.7&#x2F;enum_derive&#x2F;</a><p>The other stuff isn&#x27;t built in because it would add a bunch of code you may or may not want to your build, and it&#x27;s easy enough to opt into. We also could solve that problem, in theory, a few ways, but there just hasn&#x27;t been a ton of demand for it, so it hasn&#x27;t been done.<p>With bitfields, there has been increasing demand lately, so we&#x27;ll see.')
