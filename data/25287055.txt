Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=[25288696], score=None, time=1606986483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25276044, text='Sad to see this downvoted as it is absolute truth (except &quot;left over for salaries for a half dozen devOp techs&quot; is a bit exaggerated but the rest is spot-on).<p>AWS&#x2F;cloud is extremely expensive. Seen many companies bankrupted by it when they could&#x27;ve run their own infrastructure for pennies on the dollar. For some workloads (very variable ones, in particular) it&#x27;s totally worth it. Most of the time though, the cost premium is a killer. If you&#x27;re running a business where customers are not price-sensitive and your margins are very high, AWS makes sense. That&#x27;s not most of us, I think.')
