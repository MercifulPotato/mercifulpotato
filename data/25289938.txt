The second time they tried it they took them up on the offer.  They were even very nice to work with and were part of the &#x27;do not fire this person or it is chaos&#x27; team.  When he did it the first time he said &#x27;I can only do this once if I try again they will fire me on the spot&#x27;.  He did it a second time just to see if they would match his external offer (they let him ride the 2 weeks at least).  You usually only get one shot at that sort of move.  If you do it all the time, managers start looking for ways to offload you. You will be seen as a threat to org stability as you come off as unreliable.  No matter how key you are.')
