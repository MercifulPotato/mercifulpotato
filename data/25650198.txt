Past a point, I&#x27;ve found that an approach which works well is to encourage engineers&#x2F;operators to drive by metrics, and pay close attention over time to p100&#x27;s (max), as you&#x27;ve suggested with your 500 errors. Lots of goodies can be hidden behind them, just like you&#x27;ve found with the 500 errors.')
