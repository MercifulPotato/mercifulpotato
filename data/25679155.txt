Because even though it is effective after rabbies enters the body I&#x27;m not sure it is effective after the initial immune response which may only occur once the virus reaches the central nervous system. Not saying you&#x27;re wrong, I just genuinely don&#x27;t know if an immune response is triggered by the virus before that.')
