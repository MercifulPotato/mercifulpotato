He claims he paid $1,850,000 in federal taxes in 2015, do you think his secretary earned that much, let alone paid that much in taxes?<p>In addition:<p>“In 2019, Berkshire sent $3.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury to pay its current income tax,” Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders. “The U.S. government collected $243 billion from corporate income tax payments during the same period. From these statistics, you can take pride that your company delivered 1.5% of the federal income taxes paid by all of corporate America.”<p>&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the point of being the wealthiest nation ever on paper, if there&#x27;s terrible schools, high infant mortality, and lead in the drinking pipes?<p>A higher percentage of people graduate from college today than graduated from high school a hundred years ago, infant mortality is 6 per 1000 today vs. 100 per 1000 a hundred years ago, and blood lead levels in children have been reduced so much that it is claimed to be largely responsible for the drop in crime rates since the 1980s.<p>The point of getting wealthy is that it gives you resources to deal with your problems.')
