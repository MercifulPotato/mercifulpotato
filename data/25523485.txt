Item(by='jldugger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608766030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522996, text='LinkedIn makes it pretty simple to get many recruiter contacts a day. These are not qualified leads, and many are dialing for dollars -- hoping to fill a vacancy with a warm body long enough to get the agency fee.<p>Most people ignore these contacts, so it does kinda work to match needy recruiters with underemployed IT pros. But when you&#x27;re already at FAANG making 400k a year, it can take a recruiter phone call, two tech screens, and an onsite before compensation comes up, and you&#x27;re now invested like 10 hours into a negotiation where your BATNA exceeds whatever budget they have written down. I&#x27;ve had one recruiter get a bit angry even over it, as if my number was unrealistic (I assume they were unprepared to make a competitive offer).<p>Since there are so many of these lowball recruiters, some people resort to screening them out up front with a salary negotiation.')
