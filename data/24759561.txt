I don&#x27;t have that urge personally but I can see where it comes from and if that makes you happy go for it! The reason I personally get so defensive and anti side project is because as someone who&#x27;s very defensive of their non-work time (due to spending it on other productive hobbies that bring more joy into my life than anything else) I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of colleagues&#x2F;managers who have tried pressure or belittle me into doing side projects. It&#x27;s been implied that I&#x27;m not a &#x27;real&#x27; engineer or that I can&#x27;t be successful in my career if I don&#x27;t. And frankly I resent that attitude because it&#x27;s bullshit and it tries to take away time from the things that make my life truly joyful.<p>As you say do what makes you happy, side projects or not. Unfortunately a lot of folk on the side projects side don&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t accept them as optional if you want to be seen as a competent engineer.')
