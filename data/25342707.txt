It&#x27;s a regressive tax: a special case to tax working people more for gains on equity. The normal way to recognize income on equities is at the time of sale.<p>This is one of a few examples where California&#x27;s progressive politics haven&#x27;t lead to progressive policies, whereas states that are much more non-progressive in their politics -- states like Texas -- have, as a practical matter, policies that are much better for working people.<p>I suppose that, hypothetically, when you purchase shares with cash it&#x27;s &quot;post-tax&quot; cash; whereas when you purchase shares with labor it&#x27;s &quot;pre-tax&quot; labor.')
