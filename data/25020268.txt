That&#x27;s neat.  I may have to revisit and see what&#x27;s new in 2.0.<p>I went through a CLI-only phase where I didn&#x27;t use a desktop environment.  My &quot;DE&quot; was just tmux in a pseudo-terminal.  The main reason I went back to a graphical workstation was a need for G Suite and Slack&#x27;s horrible support for Weechat.  Mutt was a critical member of the toolkit and I have fond memories of hyper productivity.  Search was crap though.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking about doing this, I recommend trying to live in a VM running Fedora Server or Arch or Ubuntu Server or something.  If you find yourself unable to use a CLI browser for some reason, at least you don&#x27;t have to tell work &quot;sorry I gotta install my OS before I can look at &lt;thing&gt;&quot; (that doesn&#x27;t go over well).')
