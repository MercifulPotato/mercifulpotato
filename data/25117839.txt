I often have a cappuccino in the evening in lieu of dinner, and wouldn’t bat an eye at people having it at any time of the day, except, as you write, immediately before&#x2F;after (or during!) a meal. I wonder what they have in place of taste buds when they do that.<p>I met a wonderful, wonderful lady from Poland who is the joy of my heart, but she once had a cappuccino right after herrings and it was so shocking it’s giving me flashbacks.')
