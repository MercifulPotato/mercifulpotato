It looks indeed much better than SCRAM-SHA, I like how the draft underlines that &quot;clients never disclose their password to the server, even during registration.&quot;<p>Do you know if&#x2F;when it is considered for implementing in the major browsers? Given that even SHA256 digest implementation is missing and that OPAQUE seems much harder to implement, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it takes another decade.<p>Regarding not using passwords at all, unfortunately this is not something I can use as a web user with 100s of logins.')
