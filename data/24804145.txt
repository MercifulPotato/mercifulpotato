My sense, like yours, is that it largely depends on how &quot;community driven&quot; the project is at that point. If it has many independent core developers&#x2F;main contributors, or many diverse companies relying on it, it seems to work ok (for now).<p>That said, it feels like there is a missed opportunity in the space. Most large companies already donate money toward interests in their local communities, etc. Why isn&#x27;t there an easy mechanism for tech companies to donate to sustainable funding of open-source that they all depend on? My guess is that because open-source projects are rarely set up as organizations, they can&#x27;t achieve 501(c)(3). It would not only be tax advantageous for companies, but would also support business continuity and recruiting pipelines. It would also be great for open-source developers and the community.<p>Maybe there are efforts out there to create something like this?')
