Whenever I have to do something non-trivial on the command line that I will 1) likely need to do again at some point and 2) don’t do often enough to commit it to memory, I simply create a new little note. They are viewable in the terminal just like normal man pages so the notes are trivial to read once written. It’s worked extremely well for me!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~gpanders&#x2F;ual" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.sr.ht&#x2F;~gpanders&#x2F;ual</a>')
