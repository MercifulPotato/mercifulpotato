My company has made &quot;home&quot; our primary location in everyone&#x27;s contract as a result of this year. However, we have to stay in the country (why?) and they have stated we should be able to commute to the office for &quot;collaboration&quot; or &quot;important meetings&quot;, meaning we&#x27;re still forced to live in the expensive city.<p>If I can work from my small shared apartment in the city, why can&#x27;t I move to the country where it&#x27;s cheaper and I can afford an actual house or large apartment for myself? I&#x27;d be more productive if I could live a less stressful life.')
