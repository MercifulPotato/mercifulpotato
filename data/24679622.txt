I assume PG&#x27;s website is popular which gives weight to the argument that it should have HTTPS.<p>Except that you&#x27;ve missed that this is an extra overhead for some people and they don&#x27;t want to deal with it. (if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it). x.com is popular (because Elon) but there isn&#x27;t https on there. I don&#x27;t see anyone complaining except tech folk.<p>You can also apply this to PG himself, as he actively tells people to directly go to non-https, that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for his audience.<p>It takes less time for you to go to a non-https than it is for him to set HTTPS up and maintain it, if you&#x27;re so concerned you can mirror his content to a https site.')
