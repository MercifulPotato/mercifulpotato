Item(by='milkey_mouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603096153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824240, text='I can&#x27;t say this is <i>never</i> a problem-can&#x27;t prove a negative-but my house is full of IKEA furniture, half of it bought used, most of it made of particle board like you say (although they do have nicer real wood products), all of which having survived several decades of use.<p>A leg came off my desk once. I drilled new holes and was able to screw the leg back in. Similarly a slide on a dresser drawer somehow got bent out of shape and I was able to get a single replacement part sent to me from IKEA. The only real problem I have with IKEA furniture is that most of it can&#x27;t survive disassembly and reassembly well enough for me to flat-pack it when moving; I have to move it fully assembled.<p>I am amazed that such cheap (in both price and quality) furniture can last that long. Granted, I haven&#x27;t ever tried to karate chop my desk in half, but I have come to the conclusion that even the worst furniture is fine. But I probably won&#x27;t give my $20 desk to my eventual grandkids.')
