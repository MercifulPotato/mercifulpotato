(0)<p>chromium doesn&#x27;t support wayland yet, so it is blurry in HiDPI displays with scaling (chromium-dev does, but it has so many bugs it isn&#x27;t even funny). As a consequence, all electron apps end up blurry... of which there are many.<p>Same applies to all apps that don&#x27;t support Wayland yet. For example, I spend 90% of my time using Emacs, and it is blurry on Sway if I enable HiDPI scaling.<p>---<p>So sure. If you don&#x27;t have a &quot;modern&quot; HiDPI monitor, and if you don&#x27;t need to screen share often, and if you don&#x27;t need to use chromium for work, or any App that doesn&#x27;t support wayland yet, like all electron apps, Emacs, etc., or your work involves ML, or you want to game, or have an nvidia graphics card, which sway does not want to support (as opposed to gnome and kde), and you don&#x27;t want to buy two GFX cards, or if you have to do screen sharing, or probably another dozen other things that most users need to do occasioanlly, or even every day. Then, and only then, Sway might be for you.<p>But you can also use i3, where all this stuff just works.<p>---<p>(0) I&#x27;ve seen people creating virtual webcams using OBS studio to capture their screen and share it as their &quot;webcam&quot; in videoconferences, but no mainstream software really supports this &quot;as screen sharing&quot;, so the quality is quite bad, in a meeting with 10 people everyone needs to pick the webcam because the apps don&#x27;t support this huge hack, etc.')
