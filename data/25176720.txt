But I have recently stumbled upon something that seems quite off... If I visit YouTube I get greeted with the choice to log in or not. If I click &quot;no thanks&quot;, I am prompted with a choice of either accepting Google using cookies or leave the website. In theory, my logic says that if I now leave the website, the next time I visit it, I should be greeted again with the same prompt since I have not accepted any cookie being stored. That does not happen. If I then take a look at the Session cookies that were stored, I see a Youtube cookie  with the following information stored: CONSENT:&quot;YES+CH.en+V9+BX&quot;. I am not sure if this is the consent to them storing cookies or what, but only if I delete this cookies, I get prompted again to log in or accept the terms. Seems kind of weird that they store cookies before you accept them storing cookies...<p>Did I find something here or is it just how it works?<p>Thanks!')
