They&#x27;re a very unrepresentative sample of people that the company&#x27;s actions affect. There&#x27;s a reason we have democracy, not programmerocracy.<p>Political changes aren&#x27;t objectively &quot;for the better&quot;. If that was true, they wouldn&#x27;t be political decisions, but business decisions. The whole reason they&#x27;re political is that we can&#x27;t determine if they&#x27;re good or bad scientifically so we resort to distributed opinion instead.')
