I do not know what is the standard for copying MathJax; I have see this thread of November 2019 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mathjax&#x2F;MathJax&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2240" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mathjax&#x2F;MathJax&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2240</a>) where someone states that &quot; MathJax output can&#x27;t be copied directly from the page in version 3&quot;, so perhaps the copying of the output with the right click menu is the standard now.\nTeXmacs can also export to MathML, I tested it and the output was not satisfactory there.')
