Fortunately for me (and unfortunately for the environment), companies throw away perfectly fine workstation-class laptops every year it seems.<p>I&#x27;d like to get some Ryzen machines next, the performance for the money is unmatched.<p>I&#x27;ve also been thinking a small form factor desktop coupled with any laptop as a display could be a better choice - new laptops come with soldered CPUs, GPUs, even RAM, which is a shame. A desktop would be upgradeable for a good while. And I see you could build them really small, like XBox small, they&#x27;d fit in luggage rather easily.<p>Also, pardon me, but wtf is this about:<p>&gt;  <i>tiny and messy IT shop run by a Chinese in Antwerp, Belgium. The Chinese may not have a reputation for building quality products, but they sure know how to fix things.</i><p>Really man? -_-')
