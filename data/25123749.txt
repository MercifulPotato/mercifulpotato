This included not just package management but also things like gsettings gnome configuration, gnome extension installs, python virtualenv environments, email &#x2F; chat client setup, etc.<p>As it happens, a few months after I did that my hard drive failed on my Centos desktop. I was able to install a new drive, install base OS, and run my ansible role(s). Within ~45 mins I was back to my exact desktop with all local files restored from backup.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve kept up any small changes by keeping my roles in sync with my setup. The result is a self-documenting setup. I started this as an excuse to learn ansible but I now realize I&#x27;ve relieved lots of mental burdens from myself. Its so nice to go thru life now confident that I can go from complete bare-metal to &quot;my setup&quot; over lunch.')
