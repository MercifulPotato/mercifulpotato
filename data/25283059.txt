I keep on mentioning to folks this study I read years ago about teachers who had a student tracking system in their school.<p>The key point from the study was that the teachers who found the system useful are not the ones who got the most detailed or relevant reports, but the ones who actually INTERACTED with the tracking process. Some sort of &quot;obligation&quot; feeling or something drove them to look at the data and then utilize the learnings from it, IIRC.<p>If anyone remembers such a study I&#x27;d be happy to get a link to it.')
