In order to implement ECH which nobody supports yet, no mainstream even nightly web server build has ECH yet, with exception to early alpha Cloudflare go code which based on the initial ESNI debacle is probably ~1.5 years away from being implemented on their production DNS servers.<p>Firefox devs are a buncha losers.')
