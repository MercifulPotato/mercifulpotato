It sprung up not so long ago after the original nyaa.eu (? I&#x27;m not 100% sure on the domain) shut down. Today it&#x27;s not the only surviving clone, but probably the biggest one.<p>I&#x27;m still not sure however, how the repo itself violates copyright. Yes I&#x27;m aware of the explanations but I have a hard time believing it. And I can&#x27;t exactly look up the linked code files.')
