Vendor lock-in is a serious problem<p>I&#x27;m leery of vendor lock-in myself. Self-hosted will be the only way to run my product in the beginning, and the cloud service will follow when it&#x27;s popular enough to make sense.<p>&gt; May I ask what your product is? Just curious :-)<p>I haven&#x27;t published the website yet (it will be at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flowstate.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flowstate.dev</a>), but it&#x27;s a framework&#x2F;runtime for building backend APIs using SQL and JavaScript. It lets you run SQL queries from the browser, among other things. Which sounds crazy, but it actually works well. Once I have a hosted cloud service it becomes a backend-as-a-service platform kind of like Parse or Firebase.<p>I&#x27;m not against open-sourcing it down the road, but it can&#x27;t be an OSI license, and I&#x27;ll wait until it&#x27;s big enough that I&#x27;m less worried about competitors just lifting my source code. I know copyright laws protect against that, but that only matters if you have the resources to litigate.<p>I do want my users to be able to dig into the source if the documentation is lacking, and also to patch&#x2F;modify it if they need to - so I need some kind of source-visible license down the road. I think I would also add a clause that if the company goes under or gets acquired and shutdown then all source code gets published under the Apache 2 license.')
