And I do think this bias has stemmed from cherry picking the worst occurrences and these getting millions of views so this bias was bound to happen.<p>I am not from the US, so it may be true that all police there behave in such manner, but I think it is unlikely.<p>I also believe there&#x27;s many individuals really hoping to get that next piece of viral content and it doesn&#x27;t matter how much the video could be out of context, so I can definitely understand why good hearted police may not like being filmed.<p>That being said I think recording should be allowed, but my point is I can understand why a morally decent police officer might not like being filmed and it is not to avoid accountability specifically, but being taken out of context and becoming a viral victim of hate and judgement.')
