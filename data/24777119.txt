Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[24781037, 24779539, 24782615], score=None, time=1602686979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774214, text='This is a classic dilemma which doesn&#x27;t have any clear answer.<p>Individually, I assume Netflix has the data to back up the fact that each show <i>should</i> have been cancelled -- that no matter how critically acclaimed or how devoted the fanbase, the shows simply didn&#x27;t have <i>enough</i> fanbase to justify the cost.<p>But then in aggregate, it adds up to an unintended narrative that could prove to be harmful to the bottom line: that Netflix cancels shows. So people stop watching the first season to see if a show survives into a third... stop recommending Netflix... and it&#x27;s harmful to the bottom line.<p>The thing is, there&#x27;s no obvious answer. If Netflix didn&#x27;t cancel any of these shows, it would go out of business and&#x2F;or not have the money to fund future (hopefully successful) ones. It&#x27;s the same way with Googling canceling products: it&#x27;s ridiculous and money-losing to keep around every failed product, but individually they add up to a reputation.<p>It&#x27;s a classic damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&#x27;t. People <i>love</i> it when companies experiment and launch lots of new products&#x2F;shows -- that&#x27;s where innovation comes from. But then they <i>hate</i> it when the unsuccessful ones get cancelled, because <i>every</i> product&#x2F;show has <i>some</i> set of users&#x2F;viewers who love it.<p>But I see no solution, except for companies to continue cancelling unprofitable things, and people to continue complaining about it.')
