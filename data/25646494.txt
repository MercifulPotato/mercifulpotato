Sounds truly terrible.<p>Also, unless your voice changer actually selects&#x2F;changes the words&#x2F;pronunciation of the speaker, it will still be easy to identify details about them.<p>Accent, word-choice (soda vs pop), urban fast-talk, rural drawl all can be picked up even with a distorted voice.')
