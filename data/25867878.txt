But I just can&#x27;t get behind what is being proposed in any way because it is so absurd and arbitrary.<p>As a supporter of a free and open Internet, I can&#x27;t see how the logical conclusion of requiring websites to reimburse the other end of a hyperlink for the privilege of linking to them could possibly be a good thing.<p>As a user of the Internet in Australia, I am concerned about what the obvious sovereign risk of the Treasurer having this power to arbitrarily punish web companies does to the availibility of services to Australian users.<p>As a software developer in Australia (albeit one who hasn&#x27;t worked directly in web tech to date), I am concerned about the damage this does to the tech industry, and subsequently my employability and income, in this country.<p>And most of all as a political citizen of Australia, I am deeply troubled by the idea of giving politicians the power of deciding which media organisations do&#x2F;don&#x27;t have the power to arbitrarily extort money out of FAANG as a significant revenue stream.')
