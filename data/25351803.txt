It makes sense because the originals were plural, separate objects.<p>&gt;I saw two AirPods Maxes<p>It is a compound noun, the base word gets pluralized, so it would still be Airpods Max. Like the plural of cup of tea is cups of tea, or sergeants major, brothers-in-law, courts martial, passersby. Airpods would be the base word.')
