Which only speaks great of Sony for supporting it)<p>Brilliant creators of Dreams didn&#x27;t care if software like Maya or 3ds Max are not compatible with their approach - as it wasn&#x27;t the target audience. They didn&#x27;t care for scalability of the tools, pipelines, and the renderer in terms of business practices, parallelism, finishing on time, reusing existing technology, packing with certain features. If your core feature is something unique like this, many other constraints can just go away. Is it the future of rendering? I don&#x27;t think so. Btw. Media Molecule&#x27;s Alex Evans (amazing person, he used to create beautiful art for demoscene) has long history of innovative rendering tech - like LBP used lots of voxel and volumetric representations (look for &quot;Voxels in LittleBigPlanet 2&quot; Siggraph talk) on PS3 and it also didn&#x27;t catch up. Different use-cases = different constraint.<p>See also another example I mentioned in the post - Claybook, it uses SDFs for rendering representation (and physics!), but is also a very unique and special case.')
