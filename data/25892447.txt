(the oxford vaccine is a case in point. THey were paid upfront regardless of outcome, on condition that if it was successful they wouldn&#x27;t be able to mark up the price.)<p>on the micro scale, if you are an indy designer, if a big company comes along and steals your work and sells it, you _should_ have the legal tools to stop them.<p>Unless you want your work to be stolen from you without recourse, we need IP. How its regulated is rightly questioned. What is not legitimate is questioning if it should exist. Taking it away would only benefit big&#x2F;rich companies&#x2F;people.')
