That’s what I was initially thinking:) So glad that it wasn’t something that only I thought was an issue. I did some research in London firstly and even thought it’s the city with the highest number of fully vegan restaurants (150+), there isn’t an app where I could ONLY see the vegan option without having to double check every time I open a delivery app like UberEats or Deliveroo, since the results I’m having after searching an item are mixed. So basically I thought, why isn’t there an app that is both: fully designed for vegans &amp; vegetarians and has all the necessary data on the delivery options. It’d be so much easier and could hopefully save time from checking through places on HappyCow first and then seeing if they are listed on UberEats as well.<p>Plus, the problem with the customization that I also thought would be interesting to try out and see how people and restaurants will react :)<p>But yes, I agree it would be much more appealing for someone who lives in a big city like LA or London to actually discover the available options their restaurants offer instead of searching for their regular choices. And it could be done via the “Search” feature. It’s just that it’ll take us more time to develop it due to big data to be processed, but hopefully the app&#x2F; site will focus on 2 main issues:\n(1) help to find ALL options with as much info on the existing meals and places and (2) encourage people who live in places with less vegan&#x2F;veggie places to start ordering what they like w&#x2F;out worrying about the lack of options.<p>And exactly as you said, those features could be in some way rewarding for different types of customers :)<p>And thanks a lot for the feedback, it does really help us know what others think about the idea from their own experience and perspective!')
