If there are any benefits that they can provide me that are outside the scope of salary and workload, it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ll be able to get something more valuable to me while being more favorable for my potential employer<p>Eg I might negotiate team size if I&#x27;m coming in to lead a team, I might negotiate benefits if I&#x27;m going to a sufficiently small company, I might negotiate how frequently I&#x27;m expected to travel for the company<p>Being able to negotiate quality of life is important because many employers offer _what looks like_ a generous package but then shove their employees into dangerous working conditions.<p>Remember that unions are always less powerful than your employer, and you can influence the union more easily than you can influence your employer (caveats on seniority in which case a union isn&#x27;t for you), for better and worse')
