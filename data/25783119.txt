Thus very cheap in price.<p>So that would mean...<p>- Low Input latency (~30ms)<p>- High Resolution (300+ppi)<p>- Fast CPU<p>- Low Price (&lt;$80)<p>- 7in, 10in, 12in... 30 in sizes.<p>Things that can be excluded and ignored...<p>- Thinness<p>- Storage space<p>- Batter capacity (&gt;1hr is fine)<p>- Bluetooth<p>- Cameras, Infra, etc<p>- Gyro, Accelerometer, etc<p>I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s android but android as OS has too much latency to begin with and IOS only comes with ipad thus too pricey.<p>Is there no one making a tablet specially for standalone display&#x2F;kiosk.')
