I&#x27;m a firm believer that absolutely having to have a job to survive completely wrecks the learning process. Not just for children but even adult students at universities. I had to work to scrape by and my schoolwork, my job, and my mental&#x2F;physical health suffered because of it. Sure, my situation required it and so I&#x27;d be much worse off without doing so but I&#x27;d have been even better off if it wasn&#x27;t a requirement in the first place. That is the future I wish to work towards')
