Item(by='romwell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608630553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502058, text='&gt;Reddit, in its earlier days, was never dominated by the Voat contingent<p>It has less to do with fReE sPeEcH and more to do with reddit being a niche platform for nerds in the early days (and as far as 2008).<p>&gt;They were there, but they were far less extreme there than they were on Voat.<p>Until reddit became mainstream. Then the front page got taken over by &#x2F;r&#x2F;The_Donald crowd. There is a reason that subrredit is no more.<p>&gt;And then whenever they would post rank inaccuracies, there were clearer-minded people to point out why they were wrong, in the same place where the same people could see it.<p>And there flowed rivers of milk and honey.... Wait, no, you&#x27;d get banned from &#x2F;r&#x2F;The_Donald faster than you can blink after you post something that didn&#x27;t align. And it wasn&#x27;t even the worst subreddit.<p>&gt;Meanwhile in the 7% of cases when they actually had a legitimate point to make, they could make it, and the people who benefited from hearing it would actually hear it instead of continuing to be unawares and consequently continuing to be wrong about something.<p>Cry me a river about losing the educational value neo-nazis provide. You don&#x27;t eat an apple that&#x27;s 93% rotten, you throw it into the compost pile. This post shows that the compost pile couldn&#x27;t even sustain itself.<p>&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t work to have one popular platform which allows nearly everyone except for Those Deplorables<p>To the contrary, the platform that works for these  &quot;deplorables&quot; (your words) doesn&#x27;t work for <i>literally everyone else</i>.<p>As a proof, we see this very post. Nobody is interested in having these people around.<p>Reddit wasn&#x27;t a popular platform when it started out. It gained a huge amount of users because Digg messed up. If kicking the Voat contingent out were a mistake, Voat would bethe new reddit (it has the same features platform-wise, after all).<p>&gt;Because witch hunts are bad...<p>Straw man argument. These people were kicked out for their hostile and toxic behavior, not for their ideas.<p>Kicking out people who poop in public places is not a &quot;witch hunt&quot;, because it&#x27;s not based on <i>identity</i>, but on bad behavior.<p>There are <i>plenty</i> of alt-right and neo-nazis on reddit still. They are just behaving a little better.<p>And again, I&#x27;m sorry, but I have little interest in attending venues where throwing poop around is OK. This post is an indication that I am in the majority.')
