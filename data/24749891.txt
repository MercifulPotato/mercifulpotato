We had a conversation about this when I started the work, Brian just doesn&#x27;t have a ton of sensitivity to this in general. I apparently have more :)<p>There are details that matter, but on the codebase I work on, the current worst case (before the work I&#x27;ve been doing) means a compile takes a couple of minutes; more like two than five. I&#x27;m not sure how other codebases at the company are with regards to this, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re <i>super</i> long.<p>What I&#x27;ve been doing drops it to under thirty seconds in basically all cases.<p>So yeah, it hasn&#x27;t been a super pain for us specifically. We&#x27;ll see as time goes on :)')
