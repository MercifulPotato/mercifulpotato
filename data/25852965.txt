So, if the genetic variants used in this study e.g. actually cause someone to seek out dietary modifications&#x2F;solar augmentation of vitamin D, that would not be accounted for here.<p>I don&#x27;t think the biology in this case allows for that to any significant degree, but I&#x27;m not an expert in vitamin D metabolism&#x2F;action or COVID.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an honest assessment<p>The title here is maybe a bit simplified, but the paper is quite honest about its weaknesses if you read it in its entirety.')
