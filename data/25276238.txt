Item(by='11thEarlOfMar', descendants=1, kids=[25276646], score=2, time=1606916587, title='Ask HN: Are You Open-Minded?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Open-mindedness means that you&#x27;re receptive to new ideas and experiences and generally do not reject them outright. Implausible or seemingly impossible, an open-minded person will listen to the basis of ideas, concepts and information and weigh that basis before making a determination about whether or not the idea is true and worth assimilating. Or try a new experience with less pre-judgment of whether you&#x27;ll appreciate it.<p>In my view, there is a critical nuance in open-mindedness: It applies whether or not the idea is consistent with what I already believe to be true. As an open-minded person, I feel that I need to regularly reevaluate my beliefs as new information comes to light, even if that new information directly contradicts a basis for a firmly held belief.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know examples that you&#x27;ve had where you&#x27;ve learned new information that contradicted what you already firmly believed, and through open-mindedness, changed your belief accordingly.')
