The sorts of large binary blobs that can take a lot of memory tend to be, well, large and contiguous, so perfect for moving between SSD and RAM at maximum speed.<p>While I haven&#x27;t seen benchmarks yet, the claim was 2x relative to their current systems, IIRC, which were already crazy fast at &gt; 2GB&#x2F;s.<p>So it would probably do OK even just plain swapping, but really, really well moving these large blobs in and out, for example using mmap() and madvise().')
