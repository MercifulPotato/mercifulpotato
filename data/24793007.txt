Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602791528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24792512, text='&gt; <i>void is the unit type, which has a single inhabitant</i><p>Not in C. <i>void</i> is an incomplete type, with an empty domain. There is no value which is an instance of void.<p>The void type cannot be completed, and so there is no way to instantiate an object of void type. An object of type void cannot be defined or declared. There can be no array of void, nor a structure member of type void.<p>The void keyword in C and C++ just serves as a syntactic&#x2F;semantic hack.<p>Casting an expression to (void) is a gesture which indicates that the value is deliberately being discarded (and is not an actual conversion).<p>A function declared as returning void returns nothing; and a return statement with a value must not be used in its body: even a value that has been cast to (void) type. Because, remember, that is not actually a conversion to a void type, and the function has no return type.<p>In ANSI C, (void) was introduced to distinguish the syntax of a declared-empty parameter list from that of an unspecified parameter list. That&#x27;s a pure syntactic hack. It could easily have been something else, like (static) or (--).<p>There can be a pointer to void, and that is loaded with yet more hacks. Such a pointer can&#x27;t be dereferenced or subject to arithmetic (that being possible is a GCC extension).')
