What sort of support do you have for graphical APIs like windowing, graphics, etc.? I&#x27;d be really interested in working with you to port Veloren (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veloren.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veloren.net&#x2F;</a>), also written in Rust, to Redox at some point in the future: if nothing else, as a demonstration of what a pure Rust tech stack can do. If you&#x27;re interested in this, feel free to message me on Reddit (same username).')
