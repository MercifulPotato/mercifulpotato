Nothing about even the definition of compression that you provided above implies that compression is or isn&#x27;t by definition isentropic (also, adiabatic and isentropic are not the same thing).  Are you trying to argue that flow passing through a shock is not compressed by passing through the shock?<p>I&#x27;m also struggling to understand your point about the hypersonic density ratio limit.  You keep repeating it but how specifically does it support your argument?')
