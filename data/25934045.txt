If anything, the purpose was criticized as being overly narrow, and they recently updated it to be more broad.<p>Whether a firm can do something similar depends on the specifics. I&#x27;m not sure how large IKEA was when they set up their corporate structure in the early 80s, but I doubt they were as large as they are today.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201112042116if_&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2006&#x2F;05&#x2F;11&#x2F;flat-pack-accounting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201112042116if_&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ec...</a><p>I&#x27;m not trying to equate personal and corporate taxation though. If IKEA wants to funnel a large portion of their profits into a foundation to control themselves rather than paying taxes to the government instead, I don&#x27;t see how that is tax avoidance. Many other foundations around the world are set up so the controlling interests of companies can choose how to disperse money instead paying taxes and letting the government choose how to disperse it. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that either, but having a corporation designed to minimize taxes by funneling profits into a foundation doesn&#x27;t scream tax avoidance to me.<p>With that said, there could be other aspects of their corporate structure that I&#x27;m not aware of, but like I said, if other companies can also implement the same structure, even if it&#x27;s across national boundaries, I don&#x27;t see it as being particularly unethical. Although if someone believed for instance that companies should always repatriate all profits, then I could see how they would think this is unethical, so as usual YMMV.<p>Edit - To put it another way, there don&#x27;t seem to be laws restricting investment firms from buying controlling interests in companies to manipulate asset prices&#x2F;consumer behavior, which to me is far more detrimental than someone who may be pathologically frugal deciding they want to minimize taxes by setting up a complicated corporate structure with a foundation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ingvar_Kamprad#Personal_life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ingvar_Kamprad#Personal_life</a>')
