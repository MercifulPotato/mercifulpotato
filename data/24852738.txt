Reason? Electric car exploded while charging. I think that after initial enthusiasm there will be a push back against electric cars due to safety concerns.<p>EDIT: Burning electric vehicles are much harder to put down than, say gas cars, because, for one they don&#x27;t need external source of oxygen, and second, there&#x27;s much more of fuel to burn: 1200 lbs of batteries in a Tesla vs 10 gallons (85 lbs) of gas in the tank of an average car. Electric cars will probably be banned from underground parkings, sooner or later.<p>And saying that gas cars are &quot;destroying the planet&quot; is just ridiculous - they are maybe 5% of total CO2 emissions. And electric cars are actually responsible for even more emissions - not from burning fuel, obviously, but just manufacturing it releases more carbon dioxide than an average gas-powered car will in its 25 years lifecycle.')
