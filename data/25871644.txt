Journalists also do in-depth book-length work that’s less time-indexed and more atemporal.<p>Have you seen the news segment in Wikipedia’s homepage? It directly leads you to a rabbit hole of information rather than build a narrative of any kind.<p>Right now <i>everybody</i> knows not to speak to journalists — it’s a vampiric activity that will prey on your real life in ways you have no control over.<p>I see all the upsides you see (I did say “struggle to find positive value”, not “know definitively there’s none) but the net result of journalists at work is dubious at best. Even a daily news cycle is more about maintaining narrative threads than exploring issues in depth, let alone the 24 x 7 x {style and audience} x {degrees of meta} x {filter bubbles} news space that floods current discourse.')
