Something tells me if I have to be called to show how one needs to use Signal if it was just as easy to use as WhatsApp, then something is wrong there; usability-wise.<p>For example, chat backups in Signal is less usable than WhatsApp. All chats are lost once a user changes their device, phone number, factory resets or loses their phone.<p>As some pointed out, the extra PIN requirement is a trade off that favours security over usability, so there&#x27;s the risk of putting people off from using Signal and it can&#x27;t be turned off or avoided.<p>&gt; When the hype around Signal dies down, and people are trying to get all their friends to migrate from WhatsApp to Signal, itâ€™ll be the UX that makes all the difference.<p>Absolutely put. Small things like this make the difference between why someone will stay on Signal forever or for 1 month and it&#x27;s back to WhatsApp for them.')
