I’ve started gathering some of the material I need to craft this but really don’t know what step 2 would be after that. Do I need a patent right away or what do I do after I make a product. I’m starting to get more serious on this as I have recently spent a few hundred getting what I need but still not feeling very motivated. I am Canadian. I have limited funds to invest. Any thought are welcome. Thank you.')
