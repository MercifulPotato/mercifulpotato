I can scan a hundred resumes in no time. Once you&#x27;ve done it a few times, you can get an idea where the person on the resume is standing in their professional career. And that is pretty much all you can get out of a resume anyway.<p>Apart from some signals that tell me a candidate is interesting (e.g. interesting side projects) I for the life of me can&#x27;t tell from a resume, if a developer writes good maintainable code and I doubt that AI can.<p>The thing that actually takes time is really the part that comes after reading the resume. Bringing people in, making appointments, interviewing, testing their quality, see if they are a fit for the company, find if they are a fit for the team.')
