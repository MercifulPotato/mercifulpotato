How can you have a democracy and agree to respect each other&#x27;s votes if you don&#x27;t have a shared view of the goodness of your basic institutions?<p>Put differently, I tend to agree with you that this vision of extreme pluralism is closer to how America was intended to function, and I agree that would be preferable. But if you&#x27;re going to force my kids to school and teach them A or B, and if people in California and New York are going to have so much federal power over people in Iowa, that makes that sort of radical pluralism hard to achieve.')
