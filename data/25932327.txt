Any attempts at an analogous MOOC&#x2F;YouTube would likely not be very popular.<p>That said, the DS&#x2F;ML job market 2 years later is even more competitive, and niche personal projects on your resume are no longer enough. Even after working as a data scientist for 3 years, I&#x27;m not confident I could get another DS&#x2F;ML job.')
