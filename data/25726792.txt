The project he reports on claims 30MW with 4MW available within 3s for frequency stabilization and the weight is not solid concrete (emissions penalty), but rather compressed refuse that otherwise cannot be recycled (coal ash, demolition debris).<p>The friction would occur as long term tensile strength durability of lifting cables and high torque electrical hoists, which are the primary material penalties. But these things may be relatively cheap to produce and rotate out of service as their known operational lifetime approaches (Tesla has designated labor that changes out public charger cables within a reasonable buffer before they are expected to wear out).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;lh1--ftWWvY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;lh1--ftWWvY</a>')
