I can see the advantage of talking to my Google mini in my bathroom while I am showering. I see the advantage of asking my car to change music while driving. But literally zero advantages of talking to my laptop. My hands can move lot faster than my mouth. I can set shortcuts that help me do things lot faster than the whole pain of talking to the computer.')
