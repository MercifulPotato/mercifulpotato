Public opinion seems to be that if you can&#x27;t do something well, it is better to not bother.<p>The current system of capitalism would also be described by some as a &quot;living nightmare&quot;. The poorest would feel that they have little freedom, and a great deal of oppression. And while many millions will die under such a system, they will not be considered to have died <i>because</i> of the system, because the system is cleverly described as hands-off: they simply died, and it was unavoidable. Whereas any step towards socialism requires being more hands-on - and while a lack of policy is just as effective as a lacking policy, the second is somehow worse.')
