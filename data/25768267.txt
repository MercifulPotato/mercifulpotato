Everybody has a political opinion on almost everything. Even if you&#x27;re only reporting <i>what has happened</i>, you will find people questioning why you&#x27;re looking at these things, and not others.<p>NPR absolutely has political influence, but is it disproportionate? I don&#x27;t think so. Is it unbalanced? I don&#x27;t think so. I think we&#x27;ve just spent 6 years beating each other up over extremes, pushing every envelope, that we struggle to recognise neutral coverage.<p>I know you didn&#x27;t write the head comment, but I think we need to regain trust in neutrality. Perhaps reinstate some laws to redress balance in things calling themselves &quot;news&quot;... I know I don&#x27;t know, but what I know is NPR seems like one of the goodies.')
