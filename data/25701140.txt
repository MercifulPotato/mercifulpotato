Those who represent the voice of others are held to a greater standard.<p>Plenty of every day citizens can cheat on their significant other and aren&#x27;t going to lose their job because of it. Any scandal can destroy an individual&#x27;s career when in a position of authority, judges, chiefs, politicians, etc.<p>Plenty of every day citizens can go on vacation during the pandemic and be fine. Politicians who do this will have their position revoked (look to Canada for easy examples recently).<p>There is and always should be a double standard for those who represent the voice of many vs the single individual.')
