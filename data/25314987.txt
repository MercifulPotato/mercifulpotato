There may be instances where you don&#x27;t want to handle every possible data type and other values should result in a no-op.<p>If you want full coverage then visitation  guarantee that statically. Multi-visitation over m variants each with N possible types also does this statically with N^m instantiations. This balloons quickly, which is why I mentioned yomm2, which can add these handlers dynamically at runtime for polymorphic types.')
