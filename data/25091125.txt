I didn’t expect to hear the whole thing but I got sucked in and couldn’t stop listening. It really bothered me.<p>I sent the following message to Jack Dorsey. I couldn’t find a way to reach Vijaya Gadde.<p>Question to HN: Are my suggestions technically feasible? Does it make sense?<p>My message to Jack Dorsey. [..] 1. Sending message because my tweet would be lost in noise 2. After watching an old joe rogan show w&#x2F;you, here is a suggestion for moderation. 3. A reputation system based on audience input. 4. The more the audience dislikes tweets unpleasant to them, the text of the offending tweeter can ‘fade away’ so even if the tweet goes viral&#x2F;reshared, it wouldn’t be seen by those who don’t care for it. 4. Freedom and segregation is better than interfering w&#x2F;freedom of speech. My 2c. 5. Have a colour coded pin for every user so they can go from neutral to high tolerance to very sensitive. 6. As an immigrant who has faced racism, what scares me more is a silenced racist than a loud racist. Twitter policy is enabling all the nasty things it claims to ‘fix’. Regards. Thanks.[..]')
