While it did have some sexualised content for sure, it wasn&#x27;t too much in frequency and degree, nothing more than you would see on a normal tv drama anyway.<p>And it was just so much <i>fun</i> - mostly teens doing amateur choreography, skids and pranks. I uninstalled it mostly because it was so effective in capturing my attention than anything else.<p>I still see teenagers going about trying to mimic one routine or another, and it always makes me smile as I can see them being creative rather than just consumers. Doing a high quality YouTube video would be too hard for them, but a quick 10 seconds video - they feel they can do it and try to participate, which is great in my book.')
