I wish someone could take it up with me. I was &quot;squatting&quot; on a domain which is about to expire because I cannot even pay for it. :&#x2F; I have no time to work on the design itself, let alone the implementation, because I have to survive on shitty money. I did work on the design quite a lot a year ago when I could afford it, but it has been a while. It would be quite easy to filter out nonsensical articles the way it would work in my case, among other features. I cannot really talk about it on here.<p>That said, there are lots of &quot;may&quot; in the article. As to why someone is telling you this, well, in this case it is to sell you their products. She could consult a doctor about it. What form is the lithium in? How much of the product (which they sell) is actual lithium? Should look at the studies mentioned where they say &quot;may&quot;, so that you would actually have something to base your beliefs on, because &quot;may&quot; is not a claim of &quot;will&quot;, and &quot;may&quot; is not &quot;evidence&quot;, it is just speculation; they are merchants of hope. The article also does not go very in depth with the comparisons of dose. How much lithium do people get daily and from which sources? Might it turn out that micro-dosing is actually a mere 1&#x2F;10th of what people already get normally in a day? Keep also in mind, that some regions have lithium in their tap water already. Plus, people believe the news too, because it <i>sounds</i> believable, but this is not about technical literature alone. People do need to get educated about how to critically comb articles.<p>By the way: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;11838882&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;11838882&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Lithium is commonly found in drinking water and various foods, with dietary intake estimated at 0.6 to 3.1 milligrams per day in the United States in 1985. Lithium supplements are sold as pills, liquid capsules, solutions, and syrups of lithium orotate or lithium aspartate.')
