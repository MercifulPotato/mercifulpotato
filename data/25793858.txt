At that time it was so very cool and West Coast sounding to my ears, and instantly understandable in context.<p>Kids with stricter upbringings had to settle for saying &quot;Hecka&quot; which is still funny to me.<p>Interesting side-note: the same Cali kids that introduced me to the slang word &quot;Hella&quot; also used the word &quot;tight&quot; as a slang word with negative connotation, as in:<p>&quot;My parent&#x27;s grounded me for a month&quot;\n&quot;Oh man, that&#x27;s hella TIGHT&quot;<p>But over the years &quot;tight&quot; has managed to flip to a positive connotation and mean &#x27;cool&#x27;, &#x27;sweet&#x27; etc.<p>&quot;Hella&quot; still means &quot;HELLA&quot; though.')
