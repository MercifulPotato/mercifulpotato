Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603226705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839813, text='&gt; My understanding is the concern would be that closed source applications would use a hardcoded DoH resolver and pinned certs to bypass any unwanted blocks of ads&#x2F;telemetry which could only be resolved with decompilation and patching with varying degrees of difficulty.<p>IIRC, the vision with DoH is that eventually even browsers would do DNS as part of a bunch of pipelined HTTP requests.  So you call up <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.example.com&#x2F;page.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.example.com&#x2F;page.html</a> and www.example.com resolves img.example.com for you since it&#x27;s used on the page.  The downside is www.example.com could also resolve tracker.adnetwork.com for you, too.<p>IIRC, DoH is there to defeat MITM attacks, but stuff like Pi-Hole is basically a MITM attack, so it&#x27;s kinda collateral damage.<p>I bet network-level ad-blocking will eventually have to evolve into literal firewall rules on the gateway.')
