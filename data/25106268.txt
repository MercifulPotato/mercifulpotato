I imagine its partly due to manufacturing improvements (14nm vs 5nm) I mean how can Intel fall so far behind in only a couple years? I know they were one of the earliest investors in ASML’s EUV. Why couldn’t they push for smaller nodes? Is it because they were milking their current nodes too far? I saw them marketing freaking TEC’s to cool down their 500W Cpu gaming rigs on LTT and derbauer recently.<p>What made TSMC so successful? Is it primarily thanks to their business strategy? Or did Intel do something so wrong they tumbled down this far?<p>I know that Intel’s 10nm is closer to 7nm TSMC but still their competition is coming up with interesting and relevant technologies while Intel is like a junkyard of half baked ideas. 5g modems? Arduino competitor? Vaporware  GPU’s since Larrabee? Claims of dominance in NN accelerators with nothing solid? Nirvana? Optane 600 series garbage SSDs? Stupid desktop computing form factor ideas? I can go on...<p>I don’t hate Intel or root for any other company. I’m just trying to understand how incompetence like this happens in companies')
