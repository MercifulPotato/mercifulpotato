There&#x27;s nothing about emulation that requires piracy - e.g. Nintendo Switch Online has NES and SNES emulation without piracy. You <i>can</i> also dump cartridges [1] or buy legal ROMs [2] to play on this Odroid [3].<p>I understand the confusion, but please do be careful to speak about piracy when you mean to speak about piracy.
