This is because when something is not criminalized you don&#x27;t:\n-force only criminals to sell it\n-provide criminals funding by allowing them to sell it\n-prevent users from getting help\n-prevent criminals from solving disputes through the State, instead they have to enforce their own violence\n-people should be free to do things in general that don&#x27;t directly harm others (e.g. pot on the couch is ok, while driving not)\n-jailing people to enforce the criminalization<p>The war on drugs is directly responsible for huge amounts of global violence (e.g. mexico) andenormous incarceration rates in the US (about 10x our peers). The downsides are huge, the upsides are harder to quantify.')
