A government institution can buy any failing bank&#x2F;clearing house&#x2F; if it&#x27;s so vital, and then the public owns it. Buying a commercial bank or clearing house at cents for the dollar and then selling it again in better times isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad idea. It&#x27;s certainly a better idea in terms of moral hazard than simply &quot;bailing out&quot; banks without ownership.')
