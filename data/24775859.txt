Fakes very much have logic since they are implementations of classes.<p>&gt; Or do you have a rule in your company that every class needs a test? Maybe this rule is the problem.<p>No Fakes are, not the fact that every unit should be tested. Fakes are very much a unit, the fact that they are classes is irrelevant.<p>furthermore:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24774752" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24774752</a><p>which demonstrates my point. I don&#x27;t want to have to write tests for tests.')
