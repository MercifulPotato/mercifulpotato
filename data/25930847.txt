Not really unless they themselves announce it. Right now the announcement comes from a third party CNBC reporter, so it&#x27;s not official and there&#x27;s plenty of room to claim a misunderstanding.<p>But there are ways to gain some insight based on how hard GME is to borrow and the shorting interest, and that hasn&#x27;t changed much from yesterday.<p>If Melvin did manage to get out of their short, they handed that short to another party almost share for share, or they found a way to hedge their position. At any rate, GME remains the most shorted stock on the market, which means another short squeeze is possible.<p>This Friday when options expire is going to be an absolute circus.')
