Granted, I scrape at most only once a day, in a batch. So I don&#x27;t know what problems you might face if you scrape more often.<p>The only rate-limit issues I&#x27;ve faced is with Twitter, because the way I do it is that I feed gallery-dl a text file containing the profile URLs that I want to scrape. But gallery-dl doesn&#x27;t add a timeout in-between each input URLs, so Twitter might force a temporary cooldown on you if your list is a bit long.<p>But you can easily avoid this by writing your own shell script with your own custom timeout.')
