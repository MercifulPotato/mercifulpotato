Most of them rely on browser properties such as headers, javascript properties (window.<i>, navigator.</i>), behavior analysis, to build device&#x2F;user fingerprints and match it against a database of &quot;whitelisted&quot; fingerprints (typical user\nbehavior&#x2F;settings&#x2F;device props etc).<p>For the past few months, together with two other devs I have worked on a customized Puppeteer&#x2F;Playwright scraping backend. It&#x27;s essentially a drop-in replacement for default Chrome&#x2F;FF binaries. We managed to successfully go through Coinbase, Amazon, Aliexpress login pages in headless mode without getting captcha, or any other verification. We are planning to roll out a beta version. If you are interested in getting beta access leave us details about your use case here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a90eq67iroz.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;FAkWnrtv<p>The motivation for our project is that open-source solutions such as puppeteer-extra-stealth cover only a small portion of what popular anti-bot software such as Akamai Bot Manager or Imperva use to detect and ban emulated browsers.')
