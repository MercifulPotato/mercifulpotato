Re: Twitter, is very common to hear people say &quot;You have to curate your feed!&quot;, or &quot;You have to use lists!&quot;. RSS is the same, if you subscribe to a handful of personal pages, then RSS will be nice. If you use RSS to subscribe to magazines, you&#x27;re going to get a big list of articles. The same applies to FB or Twitter.')
