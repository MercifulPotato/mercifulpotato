You might actually put a dent in their business and cause them to change whatever you&#x27;re boycotting about. On the other hand, boycotts are totally pointless vs GlobalUltraMegaCorps. If everyone on HN stopped buying from these massive companies, it wouldn&#x27;t even be noticed. Apple sells roughly 200 million iPhones yearly. Do you think it&#x27;s possible to get even 1% of those customers to act on a boycott?')
