I believe children don&#x27;t consciously think of the language they&#x27;re learning, let alone about linguistic abstractions like gender, tense, case,... The concept of a correction doesn&#x27;t occur to them, in my experience when children are corrected they don&#x27;t understand that the sentence fragment uttered applied to what they said. Besides, in many cultures children&#x27;s speech is never corrected, and they all turn out speaking fine at the same rate.<p>The example you give is a bit ironic too, the linguistic shift from &quot;X and I&quot; to &quot;me and X&quot; happened centuries ago and even though it&#x27;s become a classical example of an &quot;error&quot;, there is little hope in ever reversing it. It&#x27;s always been curious to me that this &quot;error&quot; is pedantically pointed out, but nobody cares about the same &quot;mistake&quot; being made in &quot;Who wants cake? Me!&quot;, &quot;He is older than me&quot;, &quot;They are going to the beach, but me, I&#x27;m staying here&quot; and of course &quot;It&#x27;s me&quot;. By the same reasoning of applying case, in all these sentences &quot;me&quot; should be &quot;I&quot;, and especially the last one should be &quot;It am I&quot; (as it is in German and Dutch, translated word-for-word).')
