But failure is a very good topic for discussion.  Here are my thoughts:  Failure is a precursor to learning.  So generally speaking, the more you know, the more you have failed.   Success is defined by goal achievement.  Success is not directly dependent on knowledge, but it helps.  Given this logic, success is only partially a function of failure, and therefore not directly related to the number of failures.')
