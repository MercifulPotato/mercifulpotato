So many awesome models.<p>Why are Lego models so compelling? Often times as compelling or more than other scale models. Trains, doll houses, architectural models, recreations, etc.<p>Much younger me worked for a toy startup, a modular terrain and architecture system for scale model trains. The boss man collected toys, which we&#x27;d play test and learn from.<p>Nothing was as compelling as Legos. Play value wise, Rokenbok was the only competitor, but its construction system sucks. Our own toy system was &quot;neat&quot;, like a less cool Christmas train display in the store window.<p>--<p>I was trying to do the software. Think MineCraft meets LegoCAD. I failed, of course. I&#x27;m still clueless how MineCraft succeeded where so many others have failed. Just build everything with cubes (voxels). I would have never thought of that. My personal &quot;worse is better&quot; war story.<p>We also wanted something like rebrickable.com. Allow customers to share designs, play around inside each other&#x27;s worlds.
