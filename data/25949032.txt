It&#x27;s not a race car, it&#x27;s more like a family sedan. The company has been reasonably good at messaging and a number of other brokerages also halted buying of $gme, $nok, etc.<p>So not only is RobinHood not getting a fair shake (we haven&#x27;t even heard their side of things), but other brokerages are getting _way_ more than what&#x27;s fair for them given that they did the exact same thing.')
