The 5950X would have almost a 40 % clock speed advantage over the M1 (~5 GHz 1C vs 3.2 GHz 1C), yet the M1 is only about 8 % slower in an entirely ALU-limited SIMD benchmark? This suggests the M1 core has like 50 % more EUs and achieves much higher throughput than Zen 3.<p>The SPEC results are... decisive to say the least. Without Zen 3, x86 CPUs would look, well... like shit. All Intel offerings, including the Sunny Cove part (so not a 7 year old uarch), look uniformly bad across all workloads.')
