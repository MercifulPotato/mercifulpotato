It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s better tools on Windows, it&#x27;s that Emacs on windows is terrible.<p>Magit is orders of magnitude slower, for instance, and external tool integration is grossly impeded by the poor availability and quality of package management on Windows.<p>Maintaining Emacs on windows takes considerable effort.<p>Personally, I make do with WSL1 and Emacs. WSL2 is intolerably broken when working on NTFS folders, so it&#x27;s a nonstarter. This means Docker is broken (mounts don&#x27;t work) but Emacs works well.<p>Yah, it sucks.')
