There is too much data being thrown at us to absorb it all.  \nThis has led people to increasingly rely on third parties to prioritize, filter, distill, and curate these data.  The disintegration of revenue models around information production and the consolidation in media publishing and search has compounded the problem.  The result is an increase in hucksterism, fraud, and misinformation.\nNothing can ever be completely proved or disproved and bad ideas never disappear.\nIt&#x27;s a new mode for humanity, which will force us to find a new equilibrium.')
