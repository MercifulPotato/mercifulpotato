I think it&#x27;s the corporations having engaged in decades long propaganda pushing towards unlimited capitalism. It&#x27;s a new brand of authoritarianism. Corporations make all the rules and have all the power. If we as a consumer make a single mistake, we are to pay for it, yet consumers have essentially zero power towards a corporation. Corporations are given nearly endless rights on what they can do and own, and consumers are quickly having ownership rights yanked out from us. Corporations own our data, many of the products we &quot;buy&quot;, and even what we can do with the things we &quot;buy&quot;.')
