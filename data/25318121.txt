Do this immediately. Every day you work 14h+ will extend your burnout by weeks, so stop now. Yes, dropping your working hours may affect your work output, but it&#x27;s completely worth lower performance at work. A bad performance review is nothing compared to long-term burnout.<p>2) Take a break. At least a month. More is better. Many startups with successful exits are good about giving sabbaticals to the high performers that got them there.<p>3) Spend some money on therapy. With that much money, even if therapy does nothing it&#x27;s still worth it. For me, even the weekly break to go to therapy was useful.<p>4) You don&#x27;t have to spend the money on anything right now. I suggest depositing a portion of it into index funds on a monthly basis. You don&#x27;t need the added stress of figuring out the perfect investment method, and with that amount of money nearly any safe investment will provide a passive income you can live on for forever.<p>5) I urge you to consider leaving your job. If the politics and coworkers really suck that much, then why do you even want to be there? There&#x27;s always a few other companies in the same field, and one of them is definitely a better environment. Getting a startup to a successful exit makes you more than qualified to work at one of these other places.<p>6) Take some time to realize how fortunate you are. Realize how much room for making mistakes you now have. You could take the next 5 years completely off and still be ahead of nearly everyone in the world financially, and career-wise.<p>I am partway through recovering from the same situation. At the startup, I was a high performer, but occasionally got bad performance reviews due to politics and burnout. Looking back, I should have taken care of myself and aimed for even worse performance reviews. Bad environments don&#x27;t deserve your stress and hard work.<p>Eventually I left, took a very long break, and eventually started interviewing again. I&#x27;m now at a different company in the exact same field, with better leadership, lower stress, and standard working hours. Ironically, the company has even better productivity than the high stress startup.')
