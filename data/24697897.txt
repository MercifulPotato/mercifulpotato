Item(by='Loughla', descendants=None, kids=[24699457, 24698120], score=None, time=1601994068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697765, text='&gt;It is practical to raise quail for eggs or meat in an apartment.<p>Having raised quail, I just absolutely cannot fathom having them in an apartment. They&#x27;re loud, they smell, and they really, really like flying around. If you raised quail in an apartment, I&#x27;m betting it would be in semi-inhumane small cage conditions.<p>As someone who has not bought food at a grocery store (outside of citrus and other fruits we cannot grow locally due to climate and my absolute fear of scurvy) for the last 5 years, and someone who has cultivated this specific lifestyle for the last 20, I genuinely do not see a way for an apartment of folks to provide for themselves. Nor do I see a functional way for a city neighborhood to do so.<p>It takes so much space just to feed our family of 3 for the year, and that&#x27;s with trading goods that we cannot or do not want to raise ourselves.<p>I agree that it builds a stronger local community and all that. But OP&#x27;s premise is still accurate - this is an unrealistic expectation of people growing their own self-supporting food. The space just isn&#x27;t there - in urban areas.')
