I was thinking more about undergrad: where the parents are expected to pay for their kids studies.<p>Tuition is already 80€ per month, and even that is waived if you come from a low-income family. But how is someone earning 600€&#x2F;mo supposed to send someone to college when rooms cost at the very least 350-400€&#x2F;mo? Plus living expenses, 150€ the bare minimum. Even if you apply for financial aid (which you will get) the amount is woefully inadequate to face this rising costs. The result is that poor families cannot send their kids to uni. That&#x27;s not democracy, freedom, or equality.<p>Also those 225£, what fraction is that of the minimum&#x2F;median household income?')
