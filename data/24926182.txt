But it&#x27;s not quite as dire as you&#x27;re saying.<p>&gt; For most users X is good enough<p>It&#x27;s good to understand the converse is also true. For a lot of users, Gnome with Wayland is also good enough [1]. Fedora&#x27;s default install has been Gnome with Wayland since Fedora 25, which was released <i>almost four years ago</i>. Since then I&#x27;ve primarily used this non-X11 desktop on my Linux desktop, although I did fall back to X11 for specific scenarios. Debian 10 and CentOS 8 (both released over a year ago) also default to Gnome with Wayland for a desktop install. Red Hat&#x27;s and the Debian Project&#x27;s decisions there may have been questionable, but this is still software many, many users use daily despite its limitations. It&#x27;s certainly <i>well beyond</i> a GNU Hurd situation even if it doesn&#x27;t reach your or my desktop standards all the time.<p>Despite the utter mess this transition has been for years, I do think Wayland will persevere in the end and become dominant. Features users expect from a modern desktop, like fractional UI scaling, rich trackpad gestures and browser hardware video decoding are implemented more quickly for the non-X11 desktop stack. People seem to implicitly agree it&#x27;s the future, although to this day some essential parts of it are still left behind. That&#x27;s just the free software community for you - no centralized planning or vison, and nobody works on the boring parts.<p>[1]: It&#x27;s only been Gnome so far that has reached this level of &quot;mainstream acceptance&quot;. KDE with Wayland is almost there, and Sway has a lot of enthusiasm around it too.')
