The actual Green New Deal is HR 109 and SRes 59, the text of which is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocasio-cortez.house.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;ocasio-cortez.house.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocasio-cortez.house.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;ocasio-cortez.house.go...</a> . It is a non-binding resolution, meaning it does not actually change any laws or implement any policies, it&#x27;s simply a statement that the House would like something to happen. It&#x27;s literally just a statement of intent that we should get to zero net emissions. You&#x27;ll hear people tout numbers about it costing $100 trillion dollars or something ridiculous, but it&#x27;s simply not possible to calculate the cost of a vague goal. You&#x27;ll also hear people claiming things like that the Green New Deal will ban airplanes, but again this is a non-binding resolution, and it doesn&#x27;t even describe anything as specific as solid policy proposals.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we absolutely should debate the climate policy in the US. And we can refer to such policies as the &quot;Green New Deal&quot;. But in debates people often act like the Green New Deal is a literal set of laws and policies written down.')
