It was so fun getting into the nitty gritty of these tiny controllers. Spending hours at the lab bench, messing with clock settings and registers. Ended up going towards software after college though, mainly for the money tbh.<p>I still wonder to myself how i can back into this hobby. These kinds of tutorials are nice but they always kind of leave you wondering what else one can do. IMO it takes so much more than just the mC to make something useful&#x2F;interesting, as it&#x27;s just the brains of the operation. One still needs to give their project the arms and legs to really do something.')
