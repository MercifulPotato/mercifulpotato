So sleeping for an afternoon or overnight doesn&#x27;t drain the battery too much. With S3 sleep I&#x27;ve had systems sleep for more than a week with only a little battery loss. It&#x27;s only keeping RAM refreshed so it&#x27;s way lower power than even just minor (massively under locked) CPU activity.<p>That being said I have not owned a laptop in the past decade that I trusted to sleep when running Linux. I&#x27;ve had nothing but problems with things like WiFi not coming back up or the machine randomly waking up in the middle of the night.<p>Those machines running Windows are much better. But really the only machines I trust to wake and sleep reliably are Macs. I haven&#x27;t run into major sleep&#x2F;wake issues on Mac laptops in twenty years of owning them.')
