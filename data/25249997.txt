Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606701163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249783, text='&gt; I would look up others but I think those three make the point. Companies are actively hiring underrepresented minorities.<p>I was questioning the assertion that it was <i>most</i> companies. Three companies, no statistics showing actual improvement, that doesn&#x27;t make the point. Thanks for the links. It looks like Google is having trouble achieving this goal, since the article you linked shows the same percentage of minorities year to year. Apple says they have made progress, which is good. The facebook link doesn&#x27;t have any numbers. Apple says &quot;53% of new hires in the U.S. are from historically underrepresented groups in tech&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t give a timeframe or provide statistics that show how much of their workforce is minority or how much improvement they have made. I&#x27;m not sure that public relations boilerplate actually translates to a commitment to a diverse workforce.')
