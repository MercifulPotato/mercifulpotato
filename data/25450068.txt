Already had a Unifi nanoHD AP, and added one more to the opposite side of the house.  This setup has been running for a couple months, but so far has been the most consistent and reliable setup we&#x27;ve had. Good management and security tools, decent UI&#x2F;UX for the controller. I&#x27;d do it again in a heartbeat, and wish I went with this (or similar) setup a long time ago.  It costs more than what a residential setup costs, but not more than the 3 or 4 setups I&#x27;ve tried over the last 4 years.  If you can swing the higher entry price, I feel that it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s simply a superior experience in every way for us (meaning: there is no experience for the household - things work and I don&#x27;t have to fuss with it unless I want to).')
