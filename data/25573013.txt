So to translate your example, HTML specs would be essential complexity and all authored HTML would be accidental complexity to a front-end web programmer.<p>But this makes complexity a matter of context.<p>A browser is built using a programming language and uses interfaces provided by the OS and other libraries. This makes the browser accidental. And you can take this all the way down. Assembly is accidental with respect to the processor being essential.<p>But now we see how complexity flows through each layer. Just as the accidental complexity of the tax code becomes essential complexity for the accountant, the accidental complexity of HTML becomes essential complexity for the web programmer.<p>And a popular pass time is complaining how much simpler everything could be, only if.<p>(not sure if this is what the original article had in mind but this model seems accurate)')
