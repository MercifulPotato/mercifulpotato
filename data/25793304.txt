I have lots of other ideas, like integrating social media and cryptocurrencies and allowing betting on something other than political bias, but I have my work cut out for me as is. As I&#x27;m not really a developer, I&#x27;m using this idea mostly to learn<p>I think this newsbetting model for a small, select type of content provider offers an alternative to the ad-driven model this author is aggrieved by. My issue with subscription based models is that 1) once you&#x27;ve given something for &quot;free&quot; it is hard to take away and 2) it creates a divide between those who pay for good information&#x2F;content and those who don&#x27;t. This ends up exacerbating existing wealth and education inequalities.')
