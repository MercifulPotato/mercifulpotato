Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609107523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554530, text='Nitpicking, but the documented RISC-V encoding supports anything from 16-bit through 176-bit long instruction words in 16-bit increments, with instruction length being determined by the first 16 bits of the instruction word.  Some encoding space has been reserved for 192-bits or longer.  Recent versions of the RISC-V spec have actually de-emphasized this length encoding, so implementations may well be allowed to use the encoding space in different ways as long as they don&#x27;t conflict with existing 32-bit (or 16-bit if the C extension is specified) instructions.')
