If you start a company, you&#x27;re going to want to scale. Now you have sales, product, and marketing to deal with. Not to mention more engineers, many of which you will not agree with. If your software turns into a slow buggy mess, you only have high level buttons to mash (or you turn into the micromanaging jerk). These buttons are laggy. Tell upper management that your website is slow dogshit and you might see improvements 6 months from now. Maybe. Assuming the product weenies don&#x27;t ruin it all with a dozen A&#x2F;B darts they throw at the wall in the meantime.')
