I would take a look at the places where those `#ifdef GCC` macros are used and see if you can spoof the flags enough to get something workable. Throwing a `-DGCC` in your YCM flags, worst case scenario, will just raise an error message and you can remove it. Best case scenario, it won&#x27;t behave quite the same as GCC but you can get basic linting, autocomplete etc. working. Sometimes this stuff requires a bit of exploration to get working the first time, but once you get a working setup it&#x27;s very satisfying!')
