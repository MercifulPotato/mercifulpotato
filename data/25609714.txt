This means you&#x27;re going to have a lot of people get infected still with the vaccine&#x27;s antibodies present; any mutation that happens that causes escape from these antibodies will prolong disease and increase transmission, even if that mutation renders the virus a bit less fit in a non-vaccinated host.<p>Is that an accurate summation of those who caught it after receiving the vaccine?<p>Seems like if 5% of virus strains circulating aren&#x27;t affected by the vaccine, we&#x27;re fucked anyway. That 5% will become 100% of what&#x27;s circulating in the next year and will be ubiquitous?<p>If it&#x27;s something like &quot;5% of people don&#x27;t respond to the vaccine to build antibodies at all,&quot; on the other hand, it&#x27;s much rosier...')
