Item(by='cooper12', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603208171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836375, text='Wikipedia only accepts freely-licensed content (for example, CC-BY or CC-BY-SA; it must allow commercial use). People who are creating professional-quality video are not giving it away for free. Video takes a non-trivial amount of effort to script, record, create imagery for, and edit. That&#x27;s on top of obtaining equipment like a camera, mic, computer for editing, etc. Sure everyone has a smartphone these days, but I think you were implying more than shaky badly-framed vertical video. If you&#x27;d like to see more videos on Wikipedia, the best place to start is by contributing yourself. I&#x27;ve done the same for photographs of local things in my area.')
