X had its fair share of extensions, but somehow most WMs and DMs managed to agree on things.<p>And in my opinion the whole isolation and security concept is hot garbage. It hinders so many useful things. My Linux desktop is not a smartphone where I download random, badly screened closed source apps from a play store.

Ultimately I don&#x27;t care. If people enjoy creating these needlessly complicated monstrosities, fine. It&#x27;s just that we need to wait ten times as long until we get something usable that way. I guess X needs to keep chugging along a couple more years....')
