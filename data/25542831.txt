Surprised that Naval loved that book so much - but as a consequence, many people have bought and read and praised the book.<p>I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s a narcissist person, and I am not sure he&#x27;s not humble. I think he partially suffers from the same problem that plagues Sam Altman: they both come across in a certain way, because they don&#x27;t seem to have the social skills to present their persona and give justice to the nice parts. I think it happens when you think most other people are super smart and introverts like you.')
