I cringed when I saw people commenting on, say Intel replacing its CEO, or that RISC-V will replace ARM for design houses in the next few year, when it&#x27;s clear the commentators haven&#x27;t taken the time to do even a cursory research.<p>I don&#x27;t even want to think of the comments I&#x27;ve seen for my main subject (cybersecurity, exploits, and vulnerabilities). I will never be able to correct all of them.<p>I think some humility would be nice for all of us. We know what we know and we should be aware of what we don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know much about web programming, and I freely admit to it. I certainly don&#x27;t pretend to have anything insightful to say about them.')
