Item(by='studiocinematic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605418710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097904, text='Thanks!<p>&gt; Crossfade editing is pretty important when doing cuts.<p>I do have a feature that automatically fades out background music when you talk (record yourself) and fades it back in afterwards. I will add more features to allow you manually set where to fade in&#x2F;out. Is this what you mean?<p>Synchronizing audio to video - do you mean, re-recording yourself, or lip syncing to another voice?<p>Time stretching - right now, I only allow this for sound effects, and so far it works correctly.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d hazard against using a &quot;layer model&quot; for audio because that will not scale very far. But audio engines are also a rabbit hole.<p>What would be the alternative?<p>&gt; For SFX editing, a sampler or VST3&#x2F;AU soft synth host with midi playback would be great as a stopgap for full audio editing.<p>Not sure I fully understand what you mean - is this something where you can manipulate different frequencies in the sound (a.k.a, sound equalizer)?<p>&gt; ambisonic mixing&#x2F;rendering alongside 3D video editing<p>I think I might look into this at a later time. At least, I don&#x27;t have proper support for it as of now :)<p>As a side note - I do have something rather unique in my app: custom music visualizers. The ability to have the video&#x2F;text effects react to sound (and you select when&#x2F;where&#x2F;how this would happen). This is early beta, but I do kinda&#x27; really like it :D')
