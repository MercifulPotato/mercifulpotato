I had to &quot;confess&quot; that i&#x27;m racist and promise to do better or it would have consequences for my career. \nSidenote: I volunteer at a refugee center and took in a syrian family. Literally hitler, i know. \nA colleague got fired because he wouldn&#x27;t confess and left the session.<p>So even if that Dean said he is a racist, he&#x27;s probably not unless you warp the definition of racism.')
