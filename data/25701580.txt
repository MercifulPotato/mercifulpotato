Early Sparc chips weren&#x27;t much to write home about. I had a Sparc 10 at home for a while. It made a great X11 desktop. The later UltraSparc systems, like the Enterprise series, were powerful, supported tons of CPUs, memory, and IO but single threaded CPU performance still wasn&#x27;t stellar.<p>At one startup, we had like 10 people logged in to a E3500 for Java builds. The thing had 512 megs of RAM, huge for the time, but with 10 people compiling and running java apps with a min heap of 64 megs, you got into swap pretty quick. It had these enormous disk arrays attached. I think it was 2x Sun Storage arrays with 16 disks each, each one being like 20 gigs or something, for a total of 640 gigs before the RAID. We were also running a database instance on the single box (Sybase, I think), which didn&#x27;t help. A lot of people started running their apps on their Windows desktops.<p>This was pretty early, late 98 or early 99. We basically had built our own app server on top of Apache JServ, which predated Tomcat.')
