However, that seems explainable simply by higher or lower genetic level of catnip response propensity. They are less likely to respond, but I would expect the correlation matrix to be the same. There&#x27;s no particular reason to expect the fundamental biology to be different and thus that a cat in Europe is responding to catnip using a different biological pathway and so whatever overlap there is with the valerian response may be completely different and the correlation within-cat different.')
