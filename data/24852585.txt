That&#x27;s why people described it as a scam- there was no good faith understanding they could deliver what they promised. Compare that to Quibi where they have a platform, they have the content that they paid for. The problem isn&#x27;t they promised something they can&#x27;t deliver, the problem is they delivered something no one wants. It&#x27;s not difficult to see how you&#x27;d pour billions into original content and a distribution platform. Netflix does that. It&#x27;s difficult to understand how a company can show you a fantastic demo, spend billions on development and then produce a product that doesn&#x27;t even slightly live up to the demo.')
