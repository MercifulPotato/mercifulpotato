I am completely with Google. Why should advertisers on Google properties know more about Google business than Google knows itself?<p>Now the question for everyone else is: why should Google (or Facebook) know more about <i>your</i> business than you know yourself? I actively discourage against using Facebook JavaScript SDK in any web project I’m involved in because most of the time all small companies really need is a sharer.php link. It is mind boggling how little people think about “let’s use their SDK”.')
