A knight is basically a medieval super-soldier: an individual with a huge amount of ongoing personal+state investment going into their ability to project power on the field.<p>Even if they&#x27;re <i>also</i> a feudal lord who lives within their own holdings (and therefore someone who&#x27;s not beholden to anyone around them, only to a distant king) everyone working for them is putting a <i>lot</i> of work into keeping the knight&#x27;s equipment, their horse, etc. maintained and ready to go.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t those same people push the knight themselves — for their own sakes! — to stay fit, as another kind of &quot;maintenance&quot;? Wouldn&#x27;t there be mass <i>resentment</i> within a lazy knight&#x27;s power structure, that would lead to said power structure toppling or mutiny-ing?')
