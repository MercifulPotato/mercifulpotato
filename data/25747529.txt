I stike out the things I have completed and add new items on the go. Sometimes the to-do list is ordered (eg. when implementing a step-by-step algorithm); most of the time it is just a few unordered items. When I stop in the middle of such an item, I typically use the same technique as you: I add an invalid line of code, probably with a small note in the source code.')
