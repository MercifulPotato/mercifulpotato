It got polarized into a trans&#x2F;non-trans fight, where all people who supported separate gender bathrooms were dumb, transphobic people. The polarization marginalizes a legitimate argument:<p>Women should not have to walk into a rest stop restroom at night during a road trip, see a man, and then think about whether or not he should be there. And a man should not have the right to be there because he &quot;identifies&quot; as a woman when he really doesn&#x27;t and is just a pervert in a rest stop bathroom. But with a new law, it then has to go through the court to prove whether he had the right to be there. The damage is done way before that day shows up.<p>The polarization and simplification meant that democrats couldn&#x27;t vote against this because it became associated with transphobia. A vote to keep separate bathrooms would mean being canceled and losing their seat. The republicans were villainized, but they have a fairly decent point. Obviously, no one should feel uncomfortable using the restroom, but what unintended consequences come with the law? You can say perverts in bathrooms is an edge case, but I&#x27;d argue a trans person being denied a restroom is also an edge case.<p>Starbucks arguably came up with the best answer with gender-indifferent restrooms that are single occupancy, but this isn&#x27;t always scalable. There are single occupancy family restrooms in many places, so if someone truly feels unsafe to use a restroom, they could use those. These were options that were put into place without laws.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;right or wrong&quot; or &quot;black and white&quot; on nearly any issue we face today. It&#x27;s complex, and federal laws, given they impact 330 million Americans, have more unintended consequences than laws enacted at the local or state level. And that&#x27;s what the republican, conservative party wants - less &quot;big laws&quot; with fewer unintended consequences in favor of state laws that allow people to govern themselves at the local level. It&#x27;s also why any vote to undermine a State&#x27;s right to certify its election results flies in the face of conservatism.')
