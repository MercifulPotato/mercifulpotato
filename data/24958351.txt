These most basic of jobs are taken by people who aren&#x27;t really qualified to do a more skilled or better paying job and to get qualified they certainly need resources. Losing the job they have does not help.<p>Almost nobody chooses a cameraman, truck driver, or supermarket cashier jobs if they actually had a legitimate choice between that and a well paid tech job. But most people here have well paid tech jobs and a narrowed view of the issue.<p>Imagine taking that old food away from a poor person because they now have the possibility to go have a nice juicy steak.')
