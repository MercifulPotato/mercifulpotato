That’s great if you’re stretching passed that, but there’s no reason to design EVs that last decades when most won’t be in service that long. Better to optimize for making as many as possible, as fast as possible, to crowd out combustion vehicles.<p>In an accident of sufficient severity, the vehicle will be written off, insurance will pay out, and the owner is off to buy another (probably newer) vehicle. Whatever remains of value will be stripped by salvagers and rebuilders.<p>TLDR Don’t over optimize for longevity.')
