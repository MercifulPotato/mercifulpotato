I also prefer the feel, since it&#x27;s more analog and connected to the road, and they often did more with less than modern cars, similar to how old computers were often more responsive with less. Cars need safety features and more complicated electronics, just like software needs security and telemetry&#x2F;monetization now. And just like I&#x27;m impressed by modern CPUs and GPUs and SSDs and NNPs, I&#x27;m also impressed by modern turbo engines and things like skyactiv-x. I&#x27;d wager the reason people are always interested in vintage things is actually just that people are always interested in things. If we had access to future tech somehow, people would probably take interest in that as well')
