The order of evaluation of parameters is unspecified, but it&#x27;s not undefined. They will be evaluated in some order before the call to `f()` takes place. If both functions modify the same global state, the order of modification is unspecified. It&#x27;s still not undefined, and your use of global variables is still not recommended.')
