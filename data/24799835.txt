Any &quot;little tweak&quot; to an otherwise simple and elegant spec increases complexity which generations will have to deal with. This complexity often times compounds exponentially. Just see the interaction between Nagle and delayed acks. Each on their own they sound like a cool idea, but the compounding complexity is what kills understanding.<p>Unfortunately, new generations don&#x27;t learn the lesson. Modern web dev for example has so many layers of complexity and bloat, and they all interact and you need to know all layers intimitly for any real understanding as the complexity explodes. It does not have to be that way, if only every layer has a clean, small abstraction. Then you don&#x27;t need to know the details, only the small spec. But that does not work if everybody just adds a hack here and there which breaks some separation but oh well.<p>And that&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t have nice things.')
