Item(by='michaelmrose', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604181060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955001, text='&gt; Based on package.json only one author mentioned, Buu Nguyen &lt;buunguyen@gmail.com&gt;<p>If I distributed the linux kernel with a text document stating I was the sole author it wouldn&#x27;t make it so.  The author wont suffer legal consequences unless someone with a stake in the matter proves in a court of law where all the appropriate protections apply but the court of public opinion is both more fond of drama and less kind. To answer (b) first people are speculating on this topic for the same reason people follow news stories that have zero chance of ever effecting their lives because it has piqued their interest. Describing this as &quot;canceling&quot; reveals more about your perspective than it does about the issue.<p>To answer the more substantial (a) the facts on the ground seem to suggest that the author is sputtering, floundering, and lying. He lied about it being a rewrite. He lied about it being &quot;ok&quot; even if it wasn&#x27;t a rewrite (which is it?) After saying he had rewritten it all he then said it was ok because he had either written or paid for &quot;most&quot; of the original code to be rewritten when it ought to be obvious that &quot;most&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be strictly correct in any case.<p>The obvious conclusion is that he broke or didn&#x27;t understand the law in the first place and never chose to hire someone who did or took their advice.<p>Why defend this?')
