Then, if that goes well, you can go to other markets, for instance open up in the rest of the English speaking world.<p>Facebook started with one college, went on to other colleges, went on to the colleges outside the US and then opened their doors to everyone.<p>Gamification works too. If you can get people in a trade to be motivated to write reviews then you can give them internet points that they might like to have.<p>Also try and work on your own pain points. What have you agonised over buying to arrive at a choice that has worked for you?<p>Products also need the resources to keep them going. Service manuals and part numbers matter.<p>How people use the site matters too, for adding in reviews you almost need a complete product database of every product ever made by barcode with GTIN images magically appearing.<p>If you can engage people to submit reviews, e.g. this week we are looking at toasters, what you got folks? as the topic. Then people could be prompted to help out.<p>As mentioned though, the scope is considerable, larger than an ecommerce project and you need to focus on a niche, get that working and then use the platform for everything else.')
