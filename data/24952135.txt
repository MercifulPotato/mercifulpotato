Converting from 48k to 44.1k is practically lossless: You lose frequencies above 28KHz, but that&#x27;s about the range at which human hearing drops off anyway.<p>&gt; Recall that we couldnâ€™t just throw it on a computer and resample it back then.<p>Of course you could. How else do you think CDs were mastered and produced? The CD was developed with the idea of using it on computers, and for computer storage. And if, in practice, someone wanted to copy it, they&#x27;d just record the CD to tape using analog out (not quite lossless, but nobody cared back then), or copy CD&#x2F;CD with no resampling required.<p>The 44.1k is a mostly historical accident, and it goes back to the Red Book CD audio spec being reused from an earlier project for digital audio that Sony was working on, the U-matic, where 44.1k was basically how much audio would fit evenly into some number of lines in the tape&#x27;s storage.')
