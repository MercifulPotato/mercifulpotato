It&#x27;s so free-form that when you get to a smaller screen, I end up having constantly scroll around to view everything (maybe they should make it responsive like most websites?).<p>Also, it has quirky, but very annoying behavior, like how it won&#x27;t save my position on a page after the screen turns off. This makes it challenging to get back to the step I was on in a complicated recipe (what I mostly use OneNote for now).')
