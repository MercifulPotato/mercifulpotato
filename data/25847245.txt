Rewind the clock a mere 5 years and Intel was in front, with Samsung and GlobalFoundries basically tied for 2nd, and TSMC in dead last (they had the weakest 16nm&#x2F;12nm of that generation - the only one who couldn&#x27;t hit 30MTr&#x2F;mm2 of the bunch)<p>GloFlo then backed out entirely of the race and Intel slammed into a wall.<p>Since then Samsung and TSMC were on &quot;equal&quot; ground at &quot;10nm&quot; (both ~52MTr&#x2F;mm2, both released 2017) and again at &quot;7nm&quot; (both ~96MTr&#x2F;mm2). It&#x27;s not until 5nm that TSMC was actually clearly in-front of everyone else, with their 5nm being 173MTr&#x2F;mm2 while Samsung&#x27;s is only 127MTr&#x2F;mm2.<p>In terms of &quot;TSMC is just so far ahead.&quot; Samsung&#x27;s 3nm is supposed to use GAAFET while TSMC&#x27;s 3nm will still be FinFET. So.. potentially Samsung re-claims the &quot;crown&quot; so to speak at 3nm. And Samsung does contract out their fabs - see Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 3000 series. There&#x27;s also no particular reason to believe that Intel is down for the count for good. They are a huge company with a huge amount of capital, they can fund a rough generation or two.')
