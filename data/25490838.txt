In other words, the function we evaluate on forward pass itself is changing as a result of backprop, so the critical points and output of the function are also in flux.<p>You also lose an increasing portion of each batch to the &quot;important&quot; cases as you add more, so maintaining the size and contents of this pool is difficult - if you added every case, you&#x27;d have no new data.<p>So I think it&#x27;s promising, but it needs more foundational work on deriving the impact of individual samples on the output. (If we ever get that breakthrough in explainability...)')
