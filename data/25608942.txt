For example you would store userscripts in &quot;ycombinator.com&quot; folder, and they would load each time a tab of that domain is open. That would be a clean organization.<p>Then, if websites are made with TabFS in mind, the gap between the concepts of &quot;apps&quot; and &quot;website&quot; is probably filled.')
