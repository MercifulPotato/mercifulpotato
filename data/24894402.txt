Now instead of having to deal with the original problem, you only need to deal with part of it and part of the new problem of <i>using</i> the tool that&#x27;s supposed to help you, plus any leaks you might have because tools rarely solve problems perfectly. It&#x27;s a trade-off, and you need to be aware of these transformations.')
