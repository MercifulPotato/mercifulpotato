The redefinitions are coming from you. So far you&#x27;ve offered three variations: (1) Left-vs-right as based on &quot;outcomes of lives&quot;, (2) as opposed to 35 years ago, and (3) as opposed to some international comparison.<p>The first makes no sense and still lacks any explanation. The other two are arbitrary.<p>These parties are left-vs-right as of 2020 American politics. The definitions are dependent on the context of the time and place because politics change over time. They are also relative to each other; Left means left of the right, and vice versa. And center means in the middle of both. It&#x27;s the current era that determines where the spectrum is actually anchored.<p>Why are you so insistent on using some other scale to label everything differently? What purpose does that serve? Is that not meaningless semantics?')
