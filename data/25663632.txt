Probably, I should work on thinking more before I speak. But - I like to speak my mind - even if it gets me in trouble some times.<p>I do think it&#x27;s a problem that a lot of employees can and do get fired over saying dumb stuff - a lot of times that they didn&#x27;t mean to say. Does this include Trump&#x27;s famous &quot;Grab them by the p#$$y&quot; comment? Maybe.<p>However, there&#x27;s this idea that people should basically be able to send out hate speech memos in a company and not be apprehended for &quot;speaking their mind&quot;. These are completely different. One of them is premeditated idiocracy. The other is a mistake. We shouldn&#x27;t confuse the two.')
