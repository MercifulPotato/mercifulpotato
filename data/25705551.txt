CMake has working <i>FindXyz</i> modules for most major libraries. To write one of those modules is an exercise in soul-destroying tedium, but there&#x27;s a pretty impressive body of existing modules out there, many of them officially bundled with CMake.<p>When used correctly, both CMake and Autotools are capable of robust package-detection.<p>Regarding point 1: CMake works pretty well on Unix, but it&#x27;s a pity there&#x27;s a runtime dependency on the CMake package. Autotools is much better in that particular regard: just about any Unix system can run a <i>configure</i> script, as it&#x27;s just a plain old shell script.<p>CMake certainly falls short on the final 2 points, as I rambled about at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24203172" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24203172</a><p>It&#x27;s too late for me to edit my earlier comment, but here&#x27;s another alternative to CMake for the list: Bazel.')
