People often make a distinction between reference counting and garbage collection. Even though you can use reference counting in a GC&#x27;ed system (example: CPython), in most conversations people talk about reference counting as something different from garbage collection—for example, Objective-C’s ARC is seen as a different memory management technique from GC (you can have one or the other).<p>I think most people would not describe Rc or std::shared_pointer to be garbage collection.')
