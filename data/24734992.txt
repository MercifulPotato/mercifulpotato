Ever since I took this class, I have kept extensive hand written notes that I then turn into Cloze Anki cards.  This takes forever, though.  Handwriting is very slow.<p>To resolve this, I am currently taking time off from new classes to learn Gregg Shorthand.  Soon, I&#x27;ll be able to handwrite faster than I can type, and will get the same brain engagement that I know arises from handwriting.  It is my hope that I can eventually write at the rate that I think, which is a major boon to the creative process of writing and storytelling.')
