Or maybe I could be unenthusiastic about the strike breaking, the utter disrespect he has for people who criticise his PR attempts, going as far as to call them pedophiles?<p>Or maybe unenthusiastic about the fact that all he has is a vision, but has never built anything by himself. When you get kicked out because _Peter Thiel_ is more tolerable than you, that says a tiny bit about his character.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;a little controversy&quot;. It&#x27;s being a sack of shit of a human being.')
