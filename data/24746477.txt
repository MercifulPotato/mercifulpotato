Use whatever version of Webkit is supplied by the distro? This is a security nightmare, as these are outdated and full of bugs more often than not.<p>- How does using 2 or 3 different rendering engines solve the problem for the developer? They have to now put in the extra effort and QA for each engine&#x2F;platform.<p>- So at the time Electron was founded, it might have made more sense to ship Webkit on Windows. But the developers instead chose to plug in all the extras from Chrome (?). Might have been a better choice to build directly on raw Webkit.<p>- Even if a Hello World app was 200mb shipped and took 500mb of ram to run, it&#x27;s still on the developers to get it to a state where it&#x27;s an order of magnitude worse once it gets to do something useful...<p>I&#x27;m still torn on the issue. I firmly believe going full native is the most user-friendly option, but I appreciate the increased cost and complexity of development, testing, support. But using an embedded web view of any kind feels incredibly, incredibly cheap. Especially for companies with the scale and budgets of Github or Slack.')
