Item(by='sneakymichael', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609349956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583580, text='Friends was also shot on film, and cropped to 4:3 for broadcast. Like Firefly, Friends also had unintentional things (crew, microphones, un-dressed sets, etc) appear in the edges in 16:9. While most were probably edited out before the uncropped 1080 re-release; some unintended things remain, which I personally really like seeing.<p>Additionally, like Firefly&#x27;s pure VFX, some footage in Friends also appears in SD in the HD release (seemingly either because the original film stock was lost, or it wasn&#x27;t originally shot on film), with the zoomed 4:3 SD vs 16:9 HD sometimes changing mid-scene, and â€¦that too I find a humbling reminder of the quality of yesteryear.')
