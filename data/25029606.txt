Maybe its some obscure scientific stuff, some weird compiler work or something as simple as beer brewing or gardening. Experiment, hack, enjoy the process. Try a lot of things and find what you are passionate about. Not necessarily one thing, switch often and return to previously dropped things. You are in wonderful position to explore all interesting things in life  without worrying about finances.')
