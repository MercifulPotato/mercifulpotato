They are prone to early failure from portable use because of vibration and drops.<p>Your backup device should stay at home, on the desk or in the closet where you hide your networking equipment. There&#x27;s very little benefit to trying to carry around your backup device with your laptop on a regular basis, and if you <i>do</i>, you still need another backup device that isn&#x27;t going to get stolen at the same time as your laptop.')
