It actually uses FP Promises under the hood[1]. We&#x27;re doing a bit of a trick there (it throws a special value the first time, and then React retries when it&#x27;s resolved). Then the result gets cached, and the repeated render succeeds synchronously.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to offend, but this level of magic behavior sounds <i>terrifying</i> to me. React&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;it&#x27;s just JavaScript&quot;. That made it easier to understand without special knowledge, easier to pair with whichever libraries you wanted to use, and easier to apply tooling to without special integration. But it seems to be getting further and further away from that goal with each passing year, turning into an opinionated, all-in-one framework like Angular.<p>Maybe this is just the cost of gaining and maintaining popularity. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s intrinsically a bad thing, but I personally don&#x27;t feel good about it.')
