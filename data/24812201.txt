If i form an opinion on something based on remote knowledge, i want a hardcopy of it locally.<p>The whole thing will be backed by an immutable content addressed database. With support for structured (SQL) and unstructured (Binary&#x2F;etc) content. All very much WIP, and going on several full iterations over the years due to experiments in immutable architectures.<p>Focused on Git user facing patterns. Which is to say, it should (at a minimum) be syncable over SSH, local FS, etc. No required servers to run, query, sync and etc.<p>This whole idea was heavily inspired by Camlistore &#x2F; Perkeep. I&#x27;m not concerned about my &quot;data life&quot; (tweets&#x2F;etc), but rather being able to keep references to what i put into my head. To refer back later, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this as a precursor to sharing my projects, but rather to distribute the ideas i work towards in hope that more people do.')
