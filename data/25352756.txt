Now since proportional representation by number of raw plays has been replaced by number of deduplicated plays tabulated to the artist, £5 goes to Gaga.<p>Squashing repetitions probably won&#x27;t make much difference, because some people who like unpopular music listen to it repeatedly like crazy, just like people who like popular music. The big stars are not winning due to more plays; it&#x27;s really due to just being more popular.<p>Suppose every Spotify subscriber streams music 24 hours a day. Then is it still unfair to go by plays?<p>By the way, no mater what, I suspect out of any £10 subscription, something like £9.95 goes to Spotify itself.')
