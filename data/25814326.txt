Item(by='sulam', descendants=None, kids=[25814340], score=None, time=1610913499, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814194, text='&gt; 2FA is designed to authenticate that this is you logging in. Wrong off the bat.<p>Pretty sure you are in agreement with the post here. IOW, 2FA <i>isn&#x27;t</i> to authenticate the site.<p>Most of 2FA I use won&#x27;t help you assuming the credentials I just gave the phishing site are immediately forwarded to the real thing. I will see a login verification, just like I expected, from the site I expected it to come from. Maybe, just maybe, I might notice that the login <i>location</i> is not where I am, for 2FA implementations that tell you that.')
