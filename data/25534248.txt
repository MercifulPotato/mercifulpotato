Haskell, OCaml, Rust etc.) makes it hard to write bad code, because it eliminates a large class of potentially &quot;bad&quot; programs, and thus provides guarantees about the code that does type check.<p>If I have an arbitrary Haskell program, it might still be messy and hard to read, but I know I&#x27;ll have certain guarantees about the code. For example, if a function isn&#x27;t in IO, it won&#x27;t have any effects, and a replacing it with a function that returns the same values for the same arguments will be safe.<p>Additionally, the language makes it easy for libraries to have well designed APIs, that ensure that the user doesn&#x27;t forget to make the required checks. For example, removing null, and forcing Option&#x2F;Maybe for functions that might fail forces the the caller to handle the failure case, instead of just forgetting to check for null, which is common.')
