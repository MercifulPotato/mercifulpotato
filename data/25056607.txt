Furthermore, because of COVID Amazon&#x27;s a big deal in most of Europe. Brick and mortar is hurting, city centers are pretty much deserted in all but larger cities.<p>This could come as short sighted but seems like Germany and France are doing this because they want to shake down Amazon for more tax money and they donâ€™t like that American companies are dominating European markets to such an extent.')
