I&#x27;d say its closer to 15kg, and bike quality and weight aren&#x27;t that correlated here. It&#x27;s a lot more about maintenance and not being rusted to hell w.r.t. how likely a bike is to get stolen.<p>In general, since we are so flat a country, bike weight doesn&#x27;t matter much. We&#x27;d rather have extra fancy stuff on a bike than have a lighter bike.')
