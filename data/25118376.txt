I just want to point out that you have nothing to worry about. Now that AlphaGo exists humanity is exactly where it was before it existed. AlphaGo isn&#x27;t intelligent like you and I are intelligent. It&#x27;s just a program that&#x27;s good at calculating the results of a very specific computational task. It&#x27;s like crying because a hand mixer can beat eggs faster than any human can beat them by hand - there are many tasks that humans aren&#x27;t the best at and there&#x27;s nothing concerning about that.<p>Calculators have existed for a long time and they crush humans at doing arithmetic. I wouldn&#x27;t cry if I watched a documentray where a calculator beats the best human at 5-digit-number multiplication. AlphaGo is like a big expensive calculator that&#x27;s specialised to doing the calculation of how to play Go.')
