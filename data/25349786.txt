Apple fans can get smirky when discussing Apple but would&#x27;t chase down and brigate, turning every discussion about competitors into &quot;We are smart Apple elites but good for you for trying&quot;. Competitor hateboys are not common among Apple fanboys.<p>On the other hand they would be always targeted by people who are not in the Apple ecosystem, usually called sheep and explained how they are supposed to not be happy with the product they bought.<p>For me, Apple is the company that cares about experience design as primary concern and that&#x27;s why I care about what they are doing. It&#x27;s intellectually stimulating, much more than chasing the random metric that somehow everyone decided that it&#x27;s the number to look for. \nFor example, lately everyone would talk about bezel to screen ratio. Previously it was Ghz, Megapxels, core numbers and what not.')
