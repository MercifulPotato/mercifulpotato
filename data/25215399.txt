Item(by='drusepth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606346420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212802, text='&gt;do the users like it?<p>This is completely anecdotal (and seems antithetical to the typical HN response to hCaptcha vs ReCAPTCHA), but I feel like I end up spending at least twice as much time trying to solve hCaptchas successfully because they have a lot less consistency in the objects you&#x27;re searching for. I always have to zoom in to the modal and carefully search through each image, which invariably breaks whatever flow I&#x27;m in (moreso than other captchas).<p>For example, here&#x27;s a screenshot from the hCaptcha website&#x27;s &quot;try it out&quot; section [1] -- I barely recognized either boat in image #1 because it was so small. I missed image #3 because I didn&#x27;t realize it was a huge cruise-esque boat (so big you can&#x27;t even see any water) and I spent a good amount of time deliberating on #4 because, well, it looks like a car + windshield but... on the water? If it&#x27;s a boat, I can&#x27;t really tell, but I marked it as one solely because of the water in the background. Not sure if it was right or not.<p>It also seems to occasionally provide &quot;find all the X&quot; challenges without there actually being any X, which feels super cognitively weird (&quot;am I just not seeing it?!&quot;).<p>I&#x27;d say ReCAPTCHA&#x27;s main problem is deciding whether mostly-consistent objects being partially in-frame is enough to &quot;count&quot;, whereas hCaptcha&#x27;s main problem is actually recognizing the widely-varying objects in the frame. I think the former is a little more frustrating when you get something wrong, but the latter is mentally &quot;harder&quot; and takes more time on average, for me at least.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;uyqvs5u.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;uyqvs5u.png</a> from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hcaptcha.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hcaptcha.com&#x2F;</a>')
