At 8 years old, there&#x27;s really not much learned practice in music really occurring unless you&#x27;re in family like the Von Trapps. Even listening to kids sing Happy Birthday or The Wheels On The Bus can be quite interesting in how far off the &quot;notes&quot; are. Kids are just mimicking the words. Even the tempo is not of concern. Unless you get some sort of musical training through choir or band or something, you might not ever learn about flat&#x2F;sharp and how to correct to match the person next to you or more likely the radio.')
