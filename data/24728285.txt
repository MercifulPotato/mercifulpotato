It is code that has been well done, according to all project&#x27;s standards except just for one point: it only <i>partially</i> incorporates our <i>current</i> understanding of the problem domain.<p>When some enlightenment moment happens in a project, the contributors are usually split:<p>- some either understand the new idea or <i>want</i> to understand it,<p>- some shrug it off or even explicitly reject it.<p>Cleaning up this kind of debt will harm the work of the latter for a time. So it&#x27;s decidedly a different decision than refactoring an obvious big-ball-o-mud (the code which is not properly mapping anyone&#x27;s ideas). The discussions can be heated, and so naming&#x2F;popularizing the idea is beneficial.')
