Development is a very non-concurrent activity.<p>Speaking from experience, when there&#x27;s multiple people trying to take over the same bit, they only create conflicting changes all over the place and deadlock the project. It&#x27;s worse than if no work was not done. Now somebody needs to take the lead and remerge things manually and discard what cannot be merged.<p>Regarding maintenance, the later army of maintainers is typically a bunch of contractors mostly sitting idle billing for time. The size of the maintenance team has little correlation to the workload.')
