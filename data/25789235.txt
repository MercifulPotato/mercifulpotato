Programming is a very complicated activity, and of course it can be improved. Anything can be improved. There is no doubt about that.<p>The question is whether it is easy to improve.<p>Writing good software is hard. You say it like programmers have ego, but you know what is better than ego? Money. People would lay down their ego to make money (by making a more user-friendly app).<p>But clearly it’s hard to write good apps. If you try any graphical programs you would see that it sucks.
