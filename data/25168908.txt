There are a few hiccups:\n- Firefox simply does not work in macos after switching accounts. This seems like a completely unacceptable bug, but it has apparently existed for years.\n- home brew does not seem to expect to be used by two users, so I&#x27;ve had to switch into my personal account to use it.\n- configuring my os, shell, browser, etc now requires doing everything twice.<p>So it&#x27;s not a perfect solution, but overall it&#x27;s worth the effort.')
