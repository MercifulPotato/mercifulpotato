If the bible really is a made up document and I&#x27;ve been delusion-ally feeding myself lies for years I would need to stop immediately. I only want only the truth, you should too.<p>The other thing is, you need to stay unbiased during this &quot;trial of faith.&quot; If someone presents to you information that actually definitively proves the bible to be untrue then you must be unbiased and change your conclusions logically on the fly. So far no one has yet presented me with such information and I remain christian at heart.')
