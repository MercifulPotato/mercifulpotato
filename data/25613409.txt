To me this once again exemplifies why a blockchain for assets is the way to go. And by that I don&#x27;t mean an ethereum or bitcoin (or insert popular coin here) type of blockchain.

If enough regulators adopt such a model and allow tax collectors to access its data then that lookup for the ultimate beneficial owners becomes much more feasible.')
