[0] But in the end you could get most of the benefits just by forwarding your X session over SSH with compression enabled. Although X11 is old enough that compression would have used too much CPU back when it was developed.<p>The more interesting comparison between X forwarding and VNC is that X is really only displaying a remote application locally, not an entire screen or desktop. (Unless you use xnest to run X inside X which is pretty cool.) I used to have a FreeBSD workstation with a browser window running on a Linux server and a bunch of terminal windows spun up on different Sun servers, and you couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between your local and remote windows. Remote windows are first class citizens in X11.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Low_Bandwidth_X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Low_Bandwidth_X</a>')
