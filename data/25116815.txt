Yes, building a product with no distribution sucks. So does doing distribution without having anything to show for it.<p>Take this from a guy who spent 2 years studying distribution channels [1]. There&#x27;s nothing wrong about spending a week or two developing a MVP before focusing on distribution.<p>I think the key is to start with 1) The minimum thing you can do and call a &#x27;product&#x27; 2) Try to promote&#x2F;distribute it to see the response. So far you&#x27;ve done:<p>a) A web page explaining what your product is about<p>Some steps to (progressively) get to a &quot;better&quot; MVP may be:<p>b) Make a video showcasing your product (which can be a simple Figma design with static screens that show once you click on them)<p>c) Build a feature that&#x27;s high on the ICE Scoring model [2], and distribute that<p>d) Build a meaningfully different feature than c) and promote it as a SEPARATE product.
