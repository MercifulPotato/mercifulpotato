The Chips I have are supported, but the device ids they have aren&#x27;t supported by the kernel, i would have to check it out from source, add those ids and compile it on my own. At least i could find that for the network adapter, i guess its the same for the sound devices, cause they just use normal parts from realtek and the like.<p>Ive just bought those parts because they had the best performance and features for their price point, i could literally spend over a thousand euros more to only get a little bit more features or performance. I kinda had hopes that nearly everyone who would build a rig these days would buy those and because of that someone would have made them linux compatible in the last two years.')
