And thus I recommend to anyone who already has an Arduino (and doesn&#x27;t have e.g. a stm32) and needs to write Amiga floppies to bootstrap the Amiga they just obtained somewhere.<p>The point to GreaseWeazle and FluxEngine is that they aren&#x27;t Amiga specific, they can handle the weirdest formats, dump copy-protected formats as-is for preservation and recover data from damaged and otherwise unreadable disks.')
