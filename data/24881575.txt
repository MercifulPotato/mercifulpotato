This carbonation of concrete can cause corrosion to rebar or other re-inforcments. A large portion of that CO2 is eventually reabsorbed back by the concrete. Depending on the mix this process can adsorb 1&#x2F;3 to 2&#x2F;3rds of the CO2 produced during production. However, this is a slow process and we keep making new concrete.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concrete_degradation#Carbonation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concrete_degradation#Carbonati...</a><p>Also there is the all energy used for processing concrete which a lot times is not from CO2 neutral source.')
