This is why Javascript made async&#x2F;await. This is why project  loom exists. This is why erlang uses erlang processes.<p>JavaScript async&#x2F;await is different from the others. It requires two colors of functions [1], and it conflates how the code is written with how it&#x27;s executed, so it has the same problem you were talking about at the start of your comment.<p>Also, JavaScript async&#x2F;await is suboptimal in that it&#x27;s ultimately built on top of unstructured callbacks. Or, as Nathaniel J. Smith put it in a post about Python&#x27;s asyncio module, which has the same problem, &quot;Your async&#x2F;await functions are dumplings of local  structure floating on top of callback soup, and this has far-reaching implications for the  simplicity and correctness of your code.&quot; [2] That whole post is well worth a read IMO.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal.stuffwithstuff.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-color-is-your-function&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal.stuffwithstuff.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-color-is-...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vorpus.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vorpus.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-de...</a>')
