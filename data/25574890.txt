Item(by='chrisseaton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609275395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574713, text='&gt; &quot;Colored&quot; functions have a different return type; a future of some sort.<p>This is an aside and possibly pedantic, but everyone seems to have forgotten that the <i>whole</i> idea of futures was originally that they <i>weren&#x27;t</i> some different type. They were the same type, but blocked transparently on demand and had no `get` operation.<p>The construct that came before futures, called eventual-values, had the different-type thing. The <i>only</i> difference of futures, the <i>big idea</i>, was they said &#x27;maybe we can get rid of that part&#x27;.<p>&gt; These “futures” greatly resemble the “eventual values” of Hibbard’s Algol 68 [39]. The principal difference is that eventual values are declared as a separate data type, distinct from the type of the value they take on, whereas futures cannot be distinguished from the type of the value they take on.<p>(Halstead, 1985)<p>But now people write types like `Future[T]`... which <i>completely</i> misses the point! If you start to write `Future[...` then think to yourself... this isn&#x27;t a future. And that&#x27;s how you get this colouring problem you describe... it was already fixed and people have forgotten all about it.')
