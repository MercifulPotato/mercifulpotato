Since ~2016 (ES6) the language is basically completely different and really concise now; consider ES5:<p><pre><code>  function increment() {\n    var out = []\n\n    for (let i of [1,2,3,4,5]) {\n      out.push(i + 1)\n    }\n\n    return out\n  }\n</code></pre>\nvs ES6:<p><pre><code>  const increment = () =&gt; [1,2,3,4,5].map(i =&gt; i + 1)\n</code></pre>\netc. Most people&#x27;s experience with JS&#x2F;TS has simply been before ES6 (which had massive problems, like `var` and `this` scoping etc.), it&#x27;s really nice nowadays.')
