If the system as a whole is round,  the area is proportional to L^2.<p>If the computer had a scalable 3-d structure then you would have the same problem with a bisecting plane (L^2) and the volume (L^3).<p>If you give up the assumption that an arbitrary half of the computer should be able to use the full bandwidth to talk to the other half,  you can do better.<p>For instance,  that &quot;2-d&quot; computer could be built in a 2 tiles x N tiles direction and the aggregate transfer of data between row 1 and row 2 scales as N increases,  but in the other direction it does not scale at all.')
