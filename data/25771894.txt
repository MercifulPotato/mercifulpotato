Someone should design some games for them. For example, a crypto CTF game takes control and locks your chastity cage at the beginning until the server receives a response signed by RSA, to free yourself you must derive the private key by exploiting a padding oracle vulnerability in the RSA implementation or using an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in server&#x27;s input handling code.
