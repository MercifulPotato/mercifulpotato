It frustrates me so much that so many people constantly just talk about left and right while completely ignoring the Y-axis of the political spectrum! To me, both parties are firmly in authoritarian land, and no amount of calling it &quot;both sides-ism&quot; will change that fact.<p>Another frustrating thing is seeing people take a position and just label everything one or the other side, while there are a huge swath of voters and non-voters who don&#x27;t identify with either party.<p>(sidenote: Right now, I am liking the Movement for a Peoples Party.)')
