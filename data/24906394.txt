I like to look over HN during breakfast, so a surprise this morning. I appreciate folks&#x27;s kind words.<p>Can I slide in the back story?  The course I had as an undergrad was very computational.  Matrix multiplication is associative because the indices combine in this way and then you distribute the a_i,j&#x27;s, etc.  I could follow it line-by-line but I didn&#x27;t feel any real understanding.<p>In grad school I learned that it all makes beautiful sense. So when I started teaching, I wanted an approach that conveyed the sense.  I adopted a book that is a great book, very clear and clean, but students did not understand it.  They were good students, but they just were not ready.  They needed more examples, and by-hand calculations, for instance.<p>I resolved to find a presentation that helped bring them to where they would be ready, or at any rate formed part of a deliberate effort by an undergrad program to work on maturity.  I didn&#x27;t find a book that worked for me, so I wrote one.<p>So although there are a lot of examples and a lot of computation, like the text I had as an undergrad, this development keeps trying to direct the attention of students toward the understanding that they get from higher-level ideas.<p>I often see online where someone asks &quot;What is the right book for XXX?&quot;  It seems to me that often there is no one best.  Often, it depends on the audience.  For the students that I see, this approach accomplishes a lot, it seems to me.')
