I have a vision of immortality too. This is a textbook example perfect being the enemy of good. I don’t want to hold any system to the standard of zero fatalities, and further I think this is why “shoot for the moon and even if you miss you’ll land amongst the stars” is faulty. People waste an exorbitant amount of time and fossil fuels commuting in passenger vehicles. Anything that significantly changes that balance should be considered. Progress is progress and letting everybody use the time they used to spend commuting is certainly progress.')
