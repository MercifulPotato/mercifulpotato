With high level languages, the syntax and garbage collector do everything for me. I build complex and nested data structures in Python daily and have no idea how to do the equivalent in C. Zig seems to assume you already know C, so I never see it winning the onboarding crowd. This is also why Clojure, Scala, F#, Rust...etc will struggle to get big.')
