It has wheels and you ride it from point A to B.<p>&gt; While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.<p>&gt; While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;emergencies&#x2F;diseases&#x2F;novel-coronavirus-2019&#x2F;question-and-answers-hub&#x2F;q-a-detail&#x2F;coronavirus-disease-covid-19-similarities-and-differences-with-influenza" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;emergencies&#x2F;diseases&#x2F;novel-coronavirus-2...</a><p>And aside from that, a large problem with covid-19 is the DDoS on the health care system stemming from the severe infection rates, which can create large second order effects.')
