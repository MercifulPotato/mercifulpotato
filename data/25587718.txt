I didn&#x27;t picture myself as a manager and I thought I wasn&#x27;t legitimate to lead the team, being less experienced. But it turned out my team members were quite introverted and none of them wanted to take that role. In the end, it was a fruitful collaboration and a very good experience. I never saw that position as hierarchical, more of a different role within the team.')
