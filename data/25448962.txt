Now, you&#x27;re not wrong. When I was racing I&#x27;d take a bike very similar to my race bike (because when you race, you don&#x27;t just have <i>one</i> bike), stick a trainer tire on the rear wheel, and the trainer had power and cadence readings built-in. The trainer also cost considerably more <i>ten years ago</i> than the author spent recently.<p>Maybe the author just has the one bike and doesn&#x27;t want to unhook all the shite if there&#x27;s a freak winter day when it is not rainy and cloudy in Seattle. Maybe the author is just a dorky geek that likes to build stuff. Maybe if I were still a hardcore cyclist, I too would try and see how much lipstick that $300 pig will hold. &#x27;cuz I&#x27;ll admit that my first thought was, &quot;what, you didn&#x27;t try to cobble a power meter onto that thing? Hold my beer...&quot;')
