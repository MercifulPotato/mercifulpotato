Trying to double your last thousand dollars in the stock market (at the risk of losing it all) is not a great strategy compared to even the payout from a part-time McDonalds job. If you&#x27;re going to learn skills, then might as well learn some marketable ones that can land a 5-digit salary job. Many people learn computer programming online (that&#x27;s what I did), but there are many other paths, some with passive income potential, even.<p>Once you have a more comfortable situation, and can afford to spend free time on risky bets without fear of losing the roof over your head, sure, go learn stocks.')
