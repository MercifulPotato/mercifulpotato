Did it happen to be Three?<p>Either way, in my opinion, designing an abstraction for 3 clients is actually quite complex.<p>The reason the OP advocates pure functions is because pure functions are abstractions designed for N clients, when things are done for N clients using pure functions the code becomes much more simpler and modular then when you do it for three specific clients.')
