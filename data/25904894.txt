These signals are also very low voltage so. Add in that the skulls acts as a low pass filter and you end up in a situation where you just will not be able to recover the information needed to decode what the brain is doing at the required resolution.<p>You can use ECoG which is like EEG but placed on under dura-mater (a protective bag around the brain) but this is also highly invasive. Also the spatial resolution is pretty bad. You can get a hundred or so sensors in a few square centimeters.')
