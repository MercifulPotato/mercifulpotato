My point of view is that of an investor - how would I know if they&#x27;re compounding up or down. Is it a zero? Is it great? All you&#x27;re saying is &quot;trust the management&quot;.<p>I am not saying they&#x27;re doing a bad job, I am merely saying that it looks difficult to tell. Remember, the management has a huge incentive to sell you the stock regardless of the future value of the business, it&#x27;s your job to figure out if it is a good idea.')
