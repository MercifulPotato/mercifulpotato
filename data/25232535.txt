That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m puzzled about.<p>Usually an argument is a series of premises followed by discussion of how those premises combine to lead to a conclusion. The conclusion can be deductive or inductive. I am not demanding a scientific or sociological proof - but there is not even an attempt at explaining why these premises hold. There are two types of people in this world - independent and non-independent thinkers. Why? What if there are 10 types of people in this world, all landing on a spectrum of independent and conventional thought mixed in different aspects of their lives? Why should I accept the premises? What good is reading a conclusion (how to cultivate &quot;independent thought&quot; in the second half of the essay) when I don&#x27;t know if the premises are even valid?')
