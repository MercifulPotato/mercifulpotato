It is the point when there are screams for violence against lawmakers, the vice president, the president elect, the speaker of the house and the speaker of the senate. These are no empty threats as we saw last week and the companies which have the data are seeing plans for more violence being made on their platforms. They know more than we are and they are reacting like this. I think it will get worse in the next days and if there is a coup you are complicit and more important if your intentions in this post are honorable you will try to discuss the exact same thing we are discussing right now and will be shutdown and laughed at.<p>This is no morale debate anymore your choice is life or death. As a German I think about 1923 the attempted beer house coup in Munich and the lax response to Adolf Hitler and can only shake my heads at people like you.<p>At least I hope your sentiment comes from a high morale standpoint and not from misdirection as so many are in these threads.')
