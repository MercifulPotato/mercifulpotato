Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=[25352907], score=None, time=1607466634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351993, text='&gt;You don&#x27;t buy &quot;one&quot; Apple product which &quot;just works&quot;.<p>&gt;You have to buy everything from the ecosystem.<p>Agreed with the first, heavily disagreed with the second. People often end up buying into the Apple ecosystem after just one product, but not because they have to, but because they feel compelled to.<p>That was me with original airpods. They worked superbly with android, no complaints whatsoever. So I was like &quot;huh, let me check out their other newer product offerings, it&#x27;s been quite a while&quot;. Eventually, i ended up buying heavily into the ecosystem, and couldn&#x27;t be happier (sidenote: shared clipboard between your phone and laptop&#x2F;desktop is amazing).<p>In fact, I think the timing and everything about original airpods was a stroke of genius. I single-handedly know quite a few people who couldn&#x27;t care less about Apple ecosystem at all and owned zero Apple devices, but they eventually gave in to try airpods, bought them, and a few years down the road ended up buying an iPhone or a Mac. Some of them were even very staunch pro-android people.')
