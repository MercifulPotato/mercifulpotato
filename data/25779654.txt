Once food &amp; shelter are taken care of, one’s dependence on nature (physical reality) has been disintermediated. This, our direct experience is primarily imagined abstract reality (friends&#x2F;family, employment, society, the act of purchasing&#x2F;consuming, etc).<p>Especially if one gets socially isolated in this world, it’s very easy to decouple one’s notion of reality from others in subtle ways. To be seen, have one’s perspective acknowledged and to be sincerely “touched” by another person  (in a deeper metaphorical sense) is therefore one of the strongest human needs.<p>On the path to so thoroughly servicing humankind’s physical needs, we’ve created a quandary that’s increasingly endemic with waves of economic development.')
