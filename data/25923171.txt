Tons of tools would need to be updated to work with the new ABI. It would be a nightmare.<p>Furthermore, a new fat-pointer ABI would not address lifetime errors like use-after-free, so what would your plan be there? Boehm GC? More complexity, more overhead, more compatibility issues.<p>So in practice this is not that appealing, which is why we don&#x27;t do it.')
