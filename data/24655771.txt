Fast forward five months and I&#x27;ve made more planter boxes, a deck, some steps, acoustic panels to hang in my studio, and a custom desk for my daughter.<p>I&#x27;ve found that while the end results are far from perfect, they&#x27;re still pretty great. Even after figuring in purchasing a few power tools (including a sliding compound mitre saw like you mentioned) we still have spent way less money than had we hired someone to do the same work.<p>I&#x27;m really looking forward to my future projects. My only regret is not taking this up sooner!')
