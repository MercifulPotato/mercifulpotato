We don&#x27;t need to defund police, we need to defund educational programs teaching Critical Race Theory, which argues that the US is illegitimate and the land should be &quot;returned&quot; to indigenous nations, which I guess means removing or killing people of European descent. Look up the claims of the Red House in Portland if you don&#x27;t believe me. Look up &quot;LAND BACK&quot;.')
