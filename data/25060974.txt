I think I view some advantages of using Config.ly as:<p>- Updating content is way simpler. Even non technical folks can do it. (and soon you&#x27;ll have revision history)<p>- I think with the S3 library you can use HTTP caching; Config.ly can do smarter caching (e.g. if you fetch (a,b) and then just a, HTTP caching would fail).')
