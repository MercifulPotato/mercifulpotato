And if the alternative involves having to manage independent versioning of 180 packages and their inter-dependencies then no thanks.<p>I’m not saying the situation is completely perfect (yarn v2 had its rough edges in the beginning for example), but it’s not too bad either. This monorepo is the best organized codebase of this size and diversity I’ve ever seen.<p>Feel free to explain alternative methods to manage 180 packages with 7 developers while sleeping at night.')
