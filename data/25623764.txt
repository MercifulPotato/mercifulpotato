It turns out this is a terrible idea, because if you can&#x27;t count on memory being robust against cosmic rays, you also can&#x27;t count on the software being stored in that memory being robust against cosmic rays.  And when you have thousands of machines with petabytes of RAM, those bitflips do happen.  Google wasted many man-years tracking down corrupted GFS files and index shards before they finally bit the bullet and just paid for ECC.')
