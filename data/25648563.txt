Is an average person able to evaluate what&#x27;s factually correct, and what&#x27;s not?<p>Just think of all the assumptions that you need to make when you figure out &quot;should I take a COVID-19 vaccine&quot;:<p>* Is this vaccine safe? What do I know about the companies that are making it?<p>* What even is a vaccine? Are they all the same? How do the different ones work?<p>* Is COVID-19 even real? Have I personally witnessed people getting sick? Is there statistical evidence that large amounts of people are getting sick? Is the death rate worse than the average flu?<p>* How do we even know this is transmitted between people? Do masks work? What even is a virus? How do they grow and replicate?<p>* Are doctors lying to me? Do they have an incentive to? How do I fact-check these claims when I can&#x27;t travel around the country and see with my own eyes?<p>* et cetera<p>You have to rely on some assumptions to be able to answer these questions, which is the whole point of having an educational system at all, and necessarily prioritizes ones that we have deemed &quot;correct&quot;.
