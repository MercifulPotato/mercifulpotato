Item(by='AmericanChopper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611486469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890968, text='&gt; What I am saying is that you should have connections with the other people in your community at the shop<p>I don’t think this is an essential element of community at all, but as I said “ a majority of [the other community members I interact with] would be other people who go to the same places I go”<p>&gt; It&#x27;s my hypothesis that having a relationship with your local butcher or coffee maker has little to nothing to do with your car<p>I’d say you’re right. But I’d also say that the comment “cities are made for cars not people” is equally as insightful as the comment “footpaths are made for shoes not people”, “cycle lanes are made for bicycles not people” or “rail lines are made for trains not people”. Because at the end of the day, shoes, bicycles, cars, buses, trains... are all made for people. I would suggest that a persons perception of their local community has much more to do with how they interact with it than it does the form of transport they use. I’m also certain that there would be a large number of people who live in the same community as I do, which I find to be particularly vibrant, who spend their time not socializing with anybody, and then go home at the end of the day to take out their phone and complain about lack of community.')
