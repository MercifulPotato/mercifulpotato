Ample power to run a text editor and a textmode browser (Emacs and eww, or any other, lesser, choice you may prefer), but not enough for graphical browsing and other distractions. Too, since they&#x27;re specced to run Chrome for a couple hours, you can easily get 8 to 10 hours of battery life running something less absurd.<p>The keyboards aren&#x27;t what you call great, but they serve well enough. I like a mechanical keyboard as much as the next dork, but I&#x27;ve never really felt the lack when using the Chromebook for writing.')
