I agree. However, harassment isn&#x27;t always the overt act you may be picturing, it can be more subtle. Code of Conducts give a single canonical state for what&#x27;s considered acceptable, but more importantly, give organizers something tangible to point to when there is a violation. In addition to that, they inform people (even the harassed, who may not have considered what&#x27;s happening to them harassment!) of what I&#x27;d acceptable.<p>As a white, male engineer, I haven&#x27;t ever found a need for codes of conduct because I&#x27;ve had the privilege of never having been harassed. This isn&#x27;t the case for all groups, so it&#x27;s best to have one.')
