Don&#x27;t live under that tension. I  know 50 people who had Covid (yes someone out there will say their situation was bad - but the vast majority of those with Covid it was not bad) - but most said it was like the flu and they were tired for 2 weeks.<p>My advice would be quit testing yourself and get out there. I   have been eating at restaurants all year with friends. we go 2x a week. None of us have been sick. That&#x27;s a lot of exposure - if one thought that restaurants were a risk.<p>Go see your friends and live your life. Sure - wear a mask and wash your hands and be respectful of those who are fearful or at risk (like elderly) but go out. You will be fine.<p>It sounds like you are measuring the risk of not going out of your apartment. That&#x27;s hard to quantify but certainly should not be minimized.')
