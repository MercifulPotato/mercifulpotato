We&#x27;d just have people peer reviewing ArXiv. Peer review is a lot more complicated than people think to find the right reviewers, minimize conflicts of interest, prodding reviewers, reviewing their reports. Also having editors read submissions first to see if it is even worth sending to peer review. This costs money and is not free. And it is why we have not seen a free model of this supplant journals.<p>This could be done not for profit or government funded (disclosure I work for a non-profit journal publisher) almost none of the expenses of publication are taking in a PDF, archiving it and paywalling it. The expenses are in review, curation and copy editing. For us this expense is millions of dollars a year and is public information.<p>We already have a free tier of publication in repositories like ArXiv. There is still value in curation, selection and facilitating peer review and that cost is non zero.')
