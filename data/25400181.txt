But we know at this point how network effects function and thats just not a practical solution.  Leaving facebook, youtube, etc.. is similar to leaving your country and moving to a remote island in the middle of the ocean.<p>The solution is (partly) already here, its called breaking up monopolies which are illegal (and it would be wise to break up oligopolies).  For instance YouTube has no real competition.  2000 million users vs what?  Vimeos 1.5 million?  Tech monopolies&#x2F;oligopolies will always make the case that there is a rich marketplace of competitors by pointing out small fringe platforms that cant gain real traction but they know better internally and the stats confirm.  Dont expect anything to change as they keep greasing your representatives.  They spent record money on democrat elections this year and they expect their back to be scratched with lenient H1B visa programs to lower labor costs and lenient marketplace enforcement.')
