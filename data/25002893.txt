Cool.<p>It&#x27;s just that in my eyes nobody is seriously trying to change the shape of the area. But I already admitted in a sibling (and much longer) comment that I am not well informed in the area -- and to be fair I don&#x27;t aim to be.<p>I am just kind of getting disappointed that no real and tangible results are visible in society. What will the apple- or cherry-picking robots achieve save for leaving people without education jobless? Again? And they already struggle to find work anyway.<p>I am aware that most of us are slaves to the wage. But it&#x27;s still saddening that nobody seems to take a stand and try and work on (a) something with a bigger and better social impact and (b) not laser-focused on short-term profit.')
