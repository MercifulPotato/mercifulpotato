Perhaps it&#x27;s nostalgia, but I really enjoyed TED talks in the past. Martin Rees talking cosmology, Richard Dawkins talking about why the universe seems so strange, James Flynn talking about the Flynn effect[0], Barry Schwartz talking about the paradox of choice etc are enjoyable to me even today. There are many others, but I&#x27;ve not enjoyed as many in the recent years.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;9vpqilhW9uI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;9vpqilhW9uI</a>')
