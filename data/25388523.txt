Haven&#x27;t had any sleep or dock issues in a long time. I think that PCs are much better overall about power management than they used to be. I think most of that has to do with the hardware vendors, and less to do with Windows or Linux.<p>Macs have always nailed it. When I worked at a computer store like 15 years ago, people would bring in their Macs, open up the lid and it would wake instantly after being asleep in someone&#x27;s bag for 2 weeks and still have a 90% charge. Any Windows PC in that era would have run until it overheated and melted, or ran out of battery, whichever happened first.')
