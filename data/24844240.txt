EU power projection isn&#x27;t vaguely close to enough to protect all those far-flung islands that make the system work.<p>But there are &quot;cold&quot; scenarios where bombing ground stations wouldn&#x27;t be kosher but denying GNSS services might be. That&#x27;s what Galileo insures against. I don&#x27;t think those scenarios are particularly likely, so it&#x27;s awful pricey insurance, but it&#x27;s also a very important capability so opinions may differ.')
