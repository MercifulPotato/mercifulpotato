The way it worked is you told the software what OS you were connecting to (or it would figure it out itself, I can&#x27;t recall). Each OS had a unique way of generating TCP sequence numbers, which allowed the software to guess which number would come next.<p>Nowadays OSes have protection for this sort of thing. But I&#x27;d imagine you could still fingerprint an OS like that. Combine that with TLS, HTTP, etc. specifics and you could narrow it down quite a bit I bet.')
