I didn&#x27;t comment on whose fault it is and I don&#x27;t care, I just think pretty much everyone is acting like the only two parties involved are WSB memers and hedge funds. And maybe that was true for awhile. But it isn&#x27;t now, there are lots of unsophisticated people who have bought into the frenzy and in a few months all the stories will be about how those people got screwed. Meanwhile, both the WSB folks and the hedge funds will be doing just fine.')
