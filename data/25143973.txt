As your post about Michigan voter database points out, one side is making up facts they themselves don&#x27;t believe in order to push the perception the results are invalid. The objective is not to reverse the results, which it&#x27;s very unlikely they&#x27;ll be able to do, but to use the perception to justify moves you allude to on the first post.<p>All in all, this is dangerous territory here in HN, as most of the debates around these end up in shouting matches.<p>Presenting multiple sides of an argument is only productive if all sides are engaging the debate honestly.')
