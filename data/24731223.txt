Would be nice if they provided more than just screenshots<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon to see video calls at 100kbs-150kbps, which is ~10KB&#x2F;s, and this is for 7fps or so, including audio. So &quot;per frame&quot; that would be 1KB or so (more for key frames, less for I frames).<p>So they say it can be 0.1KB, so better than that... Exciting, if realistic.<p>Also, add on top audio, and packet overhead :-) there is at least 0.1KB overhead for sending the packet (bundle it with audio if possible!)')
