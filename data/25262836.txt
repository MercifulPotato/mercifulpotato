Item(by='saghm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606802848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260439, text='&gt; It&#x27;s such a weird double standard to see HN champion work from home as unequivocally superior to working in an office, yet whenever the topic of learning from home comes up we get a laundry list of what-about possibilities that might make the experience worse.<p>This seems like a false equivalence; most employers don&#x27;t use surveillance software to ensure their remote employees keep their microphone and webcam on, continue looking at the screen at all times, etc. One of the benefits of working from home is that your privacy is _increased_ compared to working an office; if everyone needed to allow their boss or HR or whoever to demand microphone and webcam access to me as they worked (and no, this is NOT comparable to Zoom meetings), then of course they wouldn&#x27;t be praising work as much.')
