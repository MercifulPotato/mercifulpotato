I and many others left feedback to that effect, and this updated draft document reflects that feedback. I think the go team has messed up packaging because they didn&#x27;t correctly understand the problem space, but the multi-year effort to deeply understand parametric polymorphism means this draft is actually quite reasonable. I, for one, am excited for this addition to the language.')
