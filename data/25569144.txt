My own father came out of the impoverishment of war torn Bangladesh to be a successful real estate developer in the west. Why did his elder brother not have the same results? Very simple: the elder brother was responsible for the family. The family has rewarded the elder brother by taking care of him for years now and he is the happiest old man I know. He will die satisfied.<p>The truth that no one wants to admit is that we have to put (very minimal) resources behind the youth to become independent of their families so they can grow.<p>For all his faults, my father understood this for everyone except me (long story) and funded the education of a few people back home. For two boys I&#x27;m aware of, that was about $5-7K&#x2F;year. The two boys lived in a one room shack that routinely got flooded. One is now an accountant, the other is a working chef. Trust me, neither of them are particularly smart.<p>What&#x27;s needed is so minimal but the problem we have is too much grifting occurs. Levels and levels of middleman bullshit.<p>I would start experimenting with Kiva-style microloans if you want to make a difference, tbh.')
