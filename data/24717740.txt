Everything is ephemeral, nothing good lasts, and if you want to find the good stuff you have to keep searching. It&#x27;s the cycle of life for anything of value - first it&#x27;s niche, then it goes mainstream, then it turns to crap.

Some people bemoan this, I like it. It means that the Linux I love won&#x27;t go away...not just yet, anyway.
