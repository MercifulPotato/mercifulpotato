Will it be enough to keep sea levels from rising quickly?  Fasten your seat belt and tighter your sphincter, by 2100 we&#x27;ll know if we&#x27;ve won or lost.<p>Personally I would like to see some temperature mitigation projects right now while we deal with the CO2 levels over the next 80 years.')
