So your economy is based on government enforced imaginary rights to ideas?  The proliferation of tax havens should be a sign that the system is bullshit - it exposes how little is actually keeping the profits of IP endeavors within a nation.<p>There is incredibly little respect for the society owning the means of production in a tangible real sense, instead we have economies that run on intangibles, where the intangibles allow 600lb gorillas like Oracle to engage in much rent seeking while simultaneously avoiding paying dues to the precise body that granted them their imaginary rights.  The entire status quo feels like something some rich tycoons dreamed up to sell to the public the merits of systematically weakening their negotiating position on the promise that one day a Bernie Sanders type would descend from the heavens and deliver universal basic income fueled by the efficiency of private industry through nothing but incorruptability and force of personality.<p>China seems to be successful in part because they have no qualms with flexing dictatorial power to increase the leverage of the state itself.  This may be less economically efficient but it means they actually get to harvest the fruits of any efficiency.  Intellectual property law?  They just ignore it and don&#x27;t get punished, since punishing them would be anti-trade.')
