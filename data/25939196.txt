The word &quot;retard&quot; being &quot;universally regarded as an insult these days&quot; is just straight up not accurate - on that sub or otherwise. I don&#x27;t count myself as a linguist but have learned &quot;get around in an emergency&quot; in a few languages and have studied the history of language a bit, and it&#x27;s very common for words to absorb new meanings in different contexts.<p>As others have pointed out, &quot;retard&quot; is an anagram of &quot;trader&quot;.')
