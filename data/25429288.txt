If it were a one-off I&#x27;d agree.<p>&gt; if the E.U. moves against Google and Facebook, it&#x27;s because it feels these companies are evolving into a threat against the first principles from which the Union has emerged<p>My point was about undermining perceived legitimacy. I&#x27;ve not commented on whether the regulations themselves are a good idea. Do you think phtrivier&#x27;s account of things is mistaken?')
