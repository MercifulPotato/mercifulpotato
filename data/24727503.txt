That is a product of the way it is arranged, which is a matter of design, not of necessity. It&#x27;s hard to imagine any particular reason why a function would need to have &quot;java&quot; in its name in order correctly calculate the maximum of two numbers.<p>But if you want to be interoperable with programs that expect to be able to find the max of two numbers using the specific name &quot;java.lang.Math.max&quot;, then the name _is_ part of the function. It&#x27;s kind of like an electircal outlet. The shape of the outlet doesn&#x27;t really matter as far as delivering electricity, but if you want people to be able to plug in their existing devices, it needs to be in a shape that is compatible with those devices.')
