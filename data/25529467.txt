Also, why would any company sell the very thing that makes them money? :) They can make more money allowing companies to use the data by targeting certain users.<p>&gt;By the past they have proven numerous time that they have a lot the sense of responsibilities -- as employees, as a whole.<p>What &quot;sense of responsibility&quot; does Google have? There is zero accountability here. They continue to spy on users and collect personal data, which now includes health data. A private company doing that for profit, makes it unethical in my view.')
