The good has to outweigh the bad, and we can&#x27;t dismiss potential solution areas because they can be weaponized to some degree or have some set of negative consequences. A lot of the things we take for granted that exist currently could just as easily have been argued-against under the banner of &quot;can be weaponized by the political opposition&quot;. And we&#x27;ve seen that potential, and put various &quot;checks and balances&quot; in place to try to stem that possibility.<p>In my mind, the constructive way to proceed would be, and I&#x27;d hope that you or others would indulge me on this: <i>How can we have a tamper-proof evidentiary record of all the conversations that politicians engage in whilst minimizing the potential of it being regularly abused&#x2F;weaponized and compromising the privacy of the individuals involved?</i>')
