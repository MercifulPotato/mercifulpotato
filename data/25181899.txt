The moment when you try to generify your code to avoid repeating lists of columns in queries and parsing of similar result sets is the moment you create an ORM tool. All the efforts to create DSLs are coming from the idea that silver bullet exists and it’s possible to cover all use cases by a single solution. It doesn’t. Trivial ORM is enough to cover 80-90% of use cases, for the rest it doesn’t make sense to try — they are usually so unique that running plain SQL and parsing the result is the best. So I agree with you, it’s probably a waste of time to build all those DSLs when we could try to improve the simple ORM experience (Spring Data is moving in the Right direction here).')
