Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608264114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463495, text='&gt;Levi jeans today are low quality compared to a few decades ago but they arenâ€™t any cheaper.<p>A simple search contradicts your claim: nytimes says: &quot;A pair of Levi&#x27;s 501 jeans cost $50 in 1998, and $46 in 2008&quot;[1]<p>&gt;Same thing with colleges. Low wage adjuncts as far as the eye can see, but higher education has never been more expensive.<p>The problem here are price insensitive consumers given tons of free money by the government (in the form of guaranteed student loans, regardless of ability to pay back). If you were given the gift of one free TV of your choice (valued up to $2000), your purchasing decision would be very different than if you were simply given $2000 in cash.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;fashion&#x2F;29PRICE.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;fashion&#x2F;29PRICE.html</a>')
