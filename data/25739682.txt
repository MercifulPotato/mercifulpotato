Item(by='Zelphyr', descendants=None, kids=[25740846], score=None, time=1610407892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733085, text='Not to put too fine a point on what you said but since lot of people here are saying, in essence, &quot;Unless you do support storming the Capitol then you have nothing to worry about&quot; I think it&#x27;s worth highlighting with a concrete example that isn&#x27;t outside the realm of possibility.<p>Let&#x27;s say you own a company with about 100 employees. You have never taken a political stand beyond voting.  Now let&#x27;s imagine that two of those employees say something on their personal social media that is insensitive to some. Someone somewhere is going to figure out where those two people work and show up at your digital doorstep.<p>If you as the business owner don&#x27;t respond in a way that people approve of then those same people are going to go to your vendors such as AWS, etc... and demand they drop you as a customer.  If those vendors side with those people strongly enough, or are afraid of them enough, then you may get dropped as quickly as Parler was.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear on a key distinction here: you&#x27;re the CEO of a company providing a SaaS product with no relation or affiliation to politics whatsoever, whereas Parler was clearly enabling and encouraging illegal and seditious activity and their being shut down is completely justified.  That distinction isn&#x27;t clear in the minds of a great many people.  Especially in today&#x27;s highly charged political environment.')
