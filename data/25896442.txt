Opensource.org, for example, pushes their own definition that excludes all those who do not use the perferred license!<p>However, dictionaries that mirror collective understandings, as used by millions of people, tell a different story.  According to OxfordLanguages, Open Source denotes, &quot;software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.&quot;  If you look at Dictionary.com. you will see that Open-Source is defined as &quot;pertaining to or denoting a product or system whose origins, formula, design, etc., are freely accessible to the public.&quot;<p>So, no, open source doesn&#x27;t have a single definition, except to groups who are pushing their own definitions.')
