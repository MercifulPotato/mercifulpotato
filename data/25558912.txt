They are quiet, can be switched 100 times a second if you want more than just on&#x2F;off control for your heating element and they won&#x27;t wear out.<p>But they also leak current keeping the equipment under AC voltage even if not powered and have nasty fault mode where they just fuse and conduct as a very efficient short.<p>The physical relay fixes both problems.<p>I typically have current sense on SSR output so that my controller can compare output from SSR with what was supposed to happen and signal fault if the SSR becomes a very good jumper. So the SSR is only ever connected when the controller decides it should.')
