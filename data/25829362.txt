I mentioned it because I am designing a farming robot where a very reliable Wifi device might be worth the cost and power consumption. I don’t know if this product is “very reliable” but lots of Wifi isn’t. I’m already considering that exact software defined radio for our robot so it could actually represent cost savings if it replaced the Wifi adapter.<p>Moreover I disliked the tone of the reply “why would you need to know the answer to your question, just do it and no one will notice.” It was a perfectly fine question to ask and I find it unreasonable to suggest it wasn’t worth asking without getting more information from the person asking it.')
