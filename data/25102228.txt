Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=[25102312, 25102319, 25103646], score=None, time=1605456813, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102058, text='&gt; If I spend hours building a nice report for you and you won&#x27;t spend 5 minutes reading it and two minutes responding with &quot;sorry but I&#x27;m too busy&quot; then who is the entitled one here? Further for you to look at it as an insult?<p>You? The other maintainer didn&#x27;t ask you to do that. You&#x27;re not entitled to even a minute of another person&#x27;s time just because you unilaterally decided to dedicate hours of yours on something.<p>&gt; I rarely even send PRs these days because those often rot for months or years.<p>Mind you, I&#x27;ve rarely sent PRs, but when I do, I do it with the intention to help. Only around half of the PRs I&#x27;ve ever sent were merged, and most of the others were left open without review. You know what I think about them? Nothing, I just conclude that the maintainer is probably too busy or my proposed changes are not within the goals of the project. I then move on and don&#x27;t let it eat at me.<p>&gt; let&#x27;s be great to one another.<p>I think that includes giving other maintainers the benefit of the doubt. That includes not taking being ignored as a personal insult, I think.')
