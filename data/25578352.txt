Most of your v4 knowledge still applies to v6&#x27;s behavior. Subnetting and routing works no differently, and neither do the addresses themselves (other than being longer). It&#x27;s passing packets around in exactly the same way v4 does.<p>There are a few differences, e.g. default routes, IPs and maybe DNS come from RAs rather than DHCP. You also won&#x27;t be using NAT, but that <i>removes</i> complexity so it should make things easier to understand.')
