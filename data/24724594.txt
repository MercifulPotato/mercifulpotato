You should look into how insane “critical race theory” and garbage like the 1619 project are trying to rewrite history. It’s absolutely indoctrination for a very specific agenda that most reasonable people would never agree with.<p>Nobody opposes teaching an accurate reading of history, good and bad. They do oppose someone telling white people, and only white people, that they are inherently racist and bear responsibility for atrocities of the past to which they had no connection. They also oppose separating the white people and telling them that they are not allowed to speak because they are racist, and if they deny being racist, that is more evidence of their racism. This is the garbage that Robin DiAngelo spews in the inexplicably popular “White Fragility” book upon which much of the CRT training is based.')
