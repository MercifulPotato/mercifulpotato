It was never a majority of car owners that fixed their own cars. I would never have maintained a thousand-dollar toolbox to fix and maintain my car - not then and not now. I&#x27;m just not mechanically inclined. For us, there&#x27;s no difference - we need to take the car in to be serviced either way. The complexification of automobile engineering has disenfranchised a small minority of car owners. But for the rest of us, we just don&#x27;t need to bring the car in for servicing as much. It&#x27;s a huge win for the majority.')
