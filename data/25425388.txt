How about call it &quot;Windows X&quot;?<p>If something like that were available on ARM (even without the baked-in NT support), I&#x27;d probably switch from macOS, or at least buy another computer to use MS Linux for my development work. MacOS is less and less appealing for web development these days, but I&#x27;m <i>not</i> switching to any NT-based Windows.')
