If I start using this with others and the company goes bust in a few months, all the effort put into migrating people to this new system would be wasted. Their trust in me would also reduce.<p>The next question on my mind is that it claims to have end-to-end encryption, but why isn’t it open source? If it’s closed source for commercial motives, then see the first question above again.<p>I’m not comfortable trying a new app or service, especially one that would be used for sensitive and private data, without answers for the above. Maybe when this gets really popular and big I’ll try it, but not now.<p>If you have answers to my questions, please update those in the FAQ so that all visitors to your site will benefit from it.')
