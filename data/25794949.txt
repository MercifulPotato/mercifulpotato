The big clouds have security research security ops teams larger than many companies.  I don&#x27;t think anyone who has seriously spent time looking at this would debate it at all.\nNb. this has no bearing on if it&#x27;s the right <i>business</i> decision, mind you.  That absolutely could end with you being better on your own metal!
