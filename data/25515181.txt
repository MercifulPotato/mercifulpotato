And the best bang for the buck is improving lighting.<p>Sitting in front of a window is a nice solution for an overcast day, but it doesn&#x27;t work after sunset (currently around 4PM where I live) or on a sunny day with hard light. Unlike styrofoam boards, it&#x27;s also hard to control the light because you can&#x27;t move the window.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting everyone should do what I said. I was just sharing a possible solution if you want to make good looking video.')
