This solves the lack of data problem,  but it also prevents the police from using their own footage without authorization.<p>&gt;  Do the math sometime on what kind of bandwidth and storage capacity a large agency like NYPD, LAPD, Chicago PD, etc. would need to upload several hours worth of officer-recorded video each day.<p>You don&#x27;t have to save full quality video indefinitely.  After several days,  remove all color from the video.  After several more,  reduce the frame rate.  After several more,  reduce the resolution.  If you built your system carefully,  you could save much more video than people tend to estimate.<p>Beyond that..  there is a statue of limitations.  I expect the police to keep their body cam recordings for up to 90 days,  beyond that,  unless they&#x27;re directly related to a case,  they should be allowed to reclaim that storage.')
