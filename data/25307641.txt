That doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>I think this happens with a lot of things. The employer can say &quot;be trustworthy&quot; and save money across the entire pool of employees, but the employees who follow the rules have to stand by watching other who break them.<p>Same thing happened with marking spots in my apartment complex. They numbered the spots to go with apartments, but don&#x27;t enforce it. Someone always takes my spot. According to their rules I&#x27;m supposed to park further away in the unmarked spots, or steal someone elses spot. Most people follow the rules, so the office gets less parking complaints. But now people whose spots are taken are left worse off than before.')
