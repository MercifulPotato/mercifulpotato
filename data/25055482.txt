Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605068578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25054863, text='Yes, all normal sites should allow you to use WebAuthn without attestation and should default to switching it off. Apple&#x27;s guidelines recommend enabling it, but that&#x27;s bad advice.<p>Attestation <i>only</i> makes sense if you&#x27;d actually reject authenticators you don&#x27;t trust, which might make sense if you&#x27;re the Foo Corp. Corporate System and you only trust genuine Important Security Inc. authenticators because you issued one to every employee and so that&#x27;s another safeguard against attack (it prevents employees sidestepping security like those webcams showing an OTP key output). But for a public site and <i>especially</i> if you actually offer other less secure alternatives (like SMS or TOTP) it makes no sense to even ask what type of authenticator I&#x27;m using. I always tell Firefox to refuse to answer.<p>However, the attestation certificate in that x5c field isn&#x27;t a unique identifier. So basically Microsoft learns that these two users have bought the same brand and maybe (if that brand sells enough volume to make it worth changing out the EPROM or whatever in batches) the same batch, but it&#x27;s supposed to be at least 10 000 different authenticators sharing &quot;your&quot; attestation.')
