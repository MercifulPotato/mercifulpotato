Those to blame are those which neglected to put the necessary precautions in place.  Where I come from, if you forget to lock your car, police can collect the key and fine you for your ignorance.  Same should apply when health data gets lost.  The patients have virtually no control over what happens with their data after someone entered it into a system.  So all the mishap which happen need to be blamed on those which run these systems.  Not doing so is a pretty blatant attempt of ignoring responsibilities.')
