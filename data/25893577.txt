But it&#x27;s the only option anyone has and it does work. No one is going to wave a magic wand and make the North of England (or those immigrants) NOT have to work hard and take risks and &quot;make it work&quot;. All brexit does it reduce the opportunities they could have used...<p>Thats sort of my whole wpoint here: not only is there is no alternative, refusing to engage is why people are in this position to begin with.')
