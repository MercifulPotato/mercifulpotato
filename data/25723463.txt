I&#x27;ve literally addressed, line by line, every single point you made.<p>The analogy is there to aid your understanding, but if you want to block your ears and go &quot;lalalala left wingerr lalalalala&quot; I guess it won&#x27;t help right? I told you to stop ascribing your political leanings to me, nothing I&#x27;ve said is partisan. It&#x27;s lazy attempts to distract from actual discourse.<p>-<p>You chose one point to explode which isn&#x27;t even related to the topic at hand and still won&#x27;t answer if you actually think &quot;Twitter only removes Right Wing content&quot; which is what started this whole thing!<p>And you just spent an entire comment complaining about Parler&#x27;s removals... you want to be embarrassed real quick?<p>My points about Parler... come from Parler!<p>Here&#x27;s their exact words:<p>&gt; We prefer to leave decisions about what is seen and who is heard to each individual. _In no case will Parler decide what will content be removed or filtered, or whose account will be removed, on the basis of the opinion expressed within the content at issue._<p>You say<p>&gt;you don&#x27;t have any right to talk about Parler and its efficacy in removing illegal content<p>Another weasel! Hate speech is not illegal! At least not in the US!<p>My comment repeatedly says Parler allows <i>hate speech</i> yet amusingly you&#x27;re trying to distract with all sorts of talk about Amazon when _the literal community guidelines_ are bragging that you won&#x27;t be banned for any opinion... which includes hate speech!<p>Stop doing this. Stop trying to throw up a smoke screen by building up strawman after straw man.<p>I won&#x27;t answer you anymore until you answer two questions:<p>1. Does Parler allow hate speech (with the reminder that it is not illegal in their jurisdiction)<p>2. Do you believe Twitter only deletes Right Wing content.<p>Answer thise questions, not with another unrelated question or diatribe which I&#x27;ll easily dismantle. Just yes or no, or you&#x27;ll have shown who&#x27;s really beating around the bush')
