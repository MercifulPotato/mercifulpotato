Item(by='michaelscott', descendants=None, kids=[25057164], score=None, time=1605087714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25056872, text='&gt; If we were to compare this statistic honestly with what women experience, we&#x27;d find that women experience sexual assault at a much higher rate than men are falsely accused of it. It&#x27;s hard for me to see this as a &#x27;privilege&#x27; we afford &quot;young women&quot;.<p>This is a related, but separate problem. I&#x27;m not personally a fan of Injustice Olympics so I&#x27;m not going to compare the two and see which is worse; they&#x27;re both terrible and they both need to be solved (as much as any such societal problems can be &quot;solved&quot;), but OP was specifically referring to false accusations against men which, granted, are asymmetrically punished. Consider the punishment a man receives when he is found to have sexually harassed a woman (both societally and legally) vs. the punishment a woman receives when she is discovered to have falsely accused someone (again, both societally and legally).')
