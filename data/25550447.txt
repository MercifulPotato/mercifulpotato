It adds 3 new science packs and some tweaks along the way that fit into the vanilla feel pretty well for me.<p>It does tweak nuclear a little, giving you a way to use reprocessing side projects for fusion power near the later part of the tech tree.<p>In terms of circuits, the one area in which I always use them is to control oil refining so I didn&#x27;t end up capping on heavy&#x2F;light oil but also didn&#x27;t turn it all into petrol and leave myself without the resources to make lubricant or rocket fuel.<p>Space Exploration pretty much forces you to use circuits too in controllijy what goes to your space stations&#x2F;other planets but it&#x27;s a long mod with most of the content basically starting after a full vanilla playthrough')
