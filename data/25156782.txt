Presumably an advantage to customers would be that they ideally wouldn&#x27;t have any vendor lock-in (they could easily switch to a different RISC-V vendor, or even start manufacturing RISC-V chips themselves). They could also customize the ISA with extensions if they had an application for that (although it seems quite conceivable that that&#x27;s a possibility with ARM too in some way; I don&#x27;t really know).<p>I realize that just having a lot of RISC-V hardware options available isn&#x27;t a guarantee that they&#x27;re particularly <i>good</i> in terms of their price-power consumption-performance tradeoffs, especially in comparison to ARM (the &quot;whole universe of high-quality hardware designs&quot; that you mention). That may well have more of a delay.')
