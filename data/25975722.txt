I played a puzzle on my phone.  I wish there was pinch-to-zoom, and the pieces autorotating when I selected them is almost cheating.  I was able to connect a lot of pieces by just dragging a piece over a pile and seeing what auto-snapped.  I also inaverdently connect pieces that way too.  I don&#x27;t know if those are solvable issues without impacting ease of play.<p>Those may not even be big enough issues to worry about.  Someone wanting to pay for a subscription probably isn&#x27;t the person who is going to want to &quot;cheat&quot;, though inadvertant pieces snapping together might take some of challenge&#x2F;fun away from the user.<p>Maybe if the user has a mouse with a scrollwheel, the scrollwheel could be used to rotate the piece, but then you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the scrollwheel for zoom (I don&#x27;t know if you are already, as I&#x27;m on a phone), or you could just use keyboard keys to rotate.<p>Maybe only have the piece the user is &quot;holding&quot; snap to another piece of the other piece is not being covered by any other pieces.  (If there is a stack of pieces, and the user drags a piece over the stack, the dragged piece should only snap to the piece on top of the stack if it is a match.  Do not let any covered matching pieces snap.)<p>I hope the feedback helps.  Again, great job!')
