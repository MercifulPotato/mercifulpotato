But the media is adding flame to this by giving people half-truths and not being honest in their position either.<p>Is it the case that Trump still lost, even after the recounts? Yep, it is the case. Is it true that there were no missing votes? Media claims so, but the GA recount seems to prove them wrong. The media publications don&#x27;t want to retract their earlier statements about there being no missing votes, despite the fact that recounts proved them wrong. Just because there weren&#x27;t enough of missing votes to change the outcome doesn&#x27;t mean that they didn&#x27;t exist.<p>P.S. Biden won, recounts affirmed that he won legitimately, I am happy. The process of the recount seems to have worked as it was supposed to. But the loud media statements about &quot;no missing votes&quot; aren&#x27;t helping their case, and it doesn&#x27;t seem truthful to say there were &quot;no missing votes&quot; just because there weren&#x27;t enough of them to change the election outcome.')
