Twitter and Facebook have deplatformed some people already (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos) and I think given the history of their conduct, that&#x27;s fair.<p>In the case of a whole party&#x2F;movement, I would say it&#x27;s a really fine line to walk. I wouldn&#x27;t advocate for Facebook to ban parties like the AfD in Germany or FN in France, while they&#x27;re often extremist, there is still some legitimate opposition within the bounds of the constitutions left in those parties. But I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to FB banning e.g. the KKK or some party that explicitly made reference to Mein Kampf or to killing all the Jews or similar.<p>Also beware of the slippery slope fallacy. Just because one believes that deplatforming some parties or movements is legitimate, it doesn&#x27;t mean nor necessarily lead to deplatforming all opposition.')
