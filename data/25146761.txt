If you think that leads to a pedantic debate, then maybe it wasn&#x27;t a good example to begin with. So long as you continue to insist, as you do in your last sentence above, that this is an appropriate analogy for the point you are trying to make, I will regard it as a weakness in your position.<p>To put that aside and address your larger point, then if we had <i>just one</i> candidate that provides &quot;an explanation for BHIP that does not introduce any new assumptions or very small assumptions to existing theory&quot;, then it would indeed be a plausible candidate explanation. That is not, however, the situation we are faced with: Hossenfelder&#x27;s argument is that there are <i>many equally plausible</i> (and equally speculative) ways in which the paradox could be resolved (though none that &quot;[do] not introduce any new assumptions or very small assumptions to existing theory&quot;), with no prospect of us getting the data to choose between them (note that Hossenfelder is highly skeptical of choosing between theories on the basis of &#x27;beauty&#x27;, &#x27;elegance&#x27; or other subjective distinctions[1]. As I explained above, Occam&#x27;s razor is not in this category.)<p>As far as I know, this argument might fail if some data from a seemingly unrelated field supports just one of the candidate resolutions of the paradox. This might be the point you are trying to make, but if so, your &quot;gravity might fail&quot; analogy isn&#x27;t helping, as we are not currently faced with multiple, equally-plausible theories of gravity, one of which will be preferred if gravity stops working in 1000 years (speculating that it might do so is neither an observation nor a theory of gravity, it&#x27;s just speculation.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0465094252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray&#x2F;dp&#x2F;04...</a>')
