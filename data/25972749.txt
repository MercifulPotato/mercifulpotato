Item(by='NobodyNada', descendants=None, kids=[25977155, 25976825, 25972850], score=None, time=1612039011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972530, text='&gt; Books do the same thing<p>Huh? If I have a book, I can lend it to a friend, sell it on eBay, or even put it in a library where thousands of people can read it for free. If I &quot;own&quot; a book on a Kindle, I can do none of those things -- and if our corporate overlords decide they don&#x27;t want me to read that book anymore, then they can remotely remove it from my device, even if I paid for it [0]. The abuse is that DRM is being weaponized to criminalize fair use and other consumer rights that copyright law otherwise would not give corporations authority over -- and because of DMCA 1201, it is illegal to work around DRM even for fair-use purposes.<p>In fact, DRM does next to <i>nothing</i> to prevent piracy, as evidenced by the thriving piracy &quot;industry&quot; today. Every DRM system can eventually be bypassed, somehow -- there has to be <i>some</i> way to decrypt the content, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be able to watch it. It&#x27;s akin to putting up a &quot;no stealing&quot; sign outside my house -- sure, it means that thieves are technically trespassing now -- but they were already breaking the law to begin with and no flimsy little sign is going to stop them. It could be argued that DRM only makes piracy <i>more</i> enticing, because consumers can use pirated content in completely normal, fair-use ways that are blocked by DRM.<p>As Doctorow explains in the article, DRM was never about protecting copyright, it&#x27;s about protecting monopolies. DRM means I can only watch a movie with an approved web browser on an approved operating system on an approved computer using an approved cable to connect to an approved monitor, and that I can only repair a tractor at an approved tractor dealership.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;07&#x2F;18&#x2F;technology&#x2F;companies&#x2F;18amazon.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;07&#x2F;18&#x2F;technology&#x2F;companies&#x2F;18am...</a>')
