Do you simply believe the evidence to the contrary? It does exist, I am aware. It often seems to measure obviously superficial interventions, in my opinion, but I understand the debate.<p>What is the level of parenting beyond which there is no additional return in terms of economic outcome?<p>Because from what I understand, parents play a significant role in not only cognitive development (reading at an early age, for example) but also in terms of setting expectations for their children.')
