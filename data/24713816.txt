Item(by='joppy', descendants=None, kids=[24714325, 24714126, 24714076], score=None, time=1602111637, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713558, text='I interpreted the original game as follows: you can freely choose any of the three doors. Monty then opens one of the doors that you didn&#x27;t pick, and then you may again freely choose any of the three doors. (In the standard problem, there is no reason why you would choose Monty&#x27;s door). The question is: does the strategy &quot;choose a new door&quot; have better odds of winning?<p>We can work out odds for this &quot;always switch away from original door&quot; strategy: suppose you initially chose a door with the car (1&#x2F;3 probability). Then choosing a new door makes you surely lose regardless. On the other hand, suppose you initially chose a door with a goat (2&#x2F;3 probability). Then <i>regardless of which of the two doors Monty opens</i>, you can choose the car (if he revealed the car, choose that. If he revealed the goat, choose the other door). So our odds of winning with this strategy are still 2&#x2F;3.<p>So it&#x27;s up to the interpretation of the modified game I guess.')
