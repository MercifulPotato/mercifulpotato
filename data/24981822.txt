But that testing overhead is often self-inflicted and can be managed. I have anecdotes to prove it.<p>For the speed to write end-to-end tests, shouldn&#x27;t they be the easiest to capture? I need the system inputs and I need to capture the system outputs. If you imagine usage-driven development, then the last step is to capture your initial state, use your new code, capture the final state and voila, here&#x27;s your new end-to-end test.<p>&gt; your important business logic<p>Consider the reality that no one cares about your backend. No one. Is it correct enough for the application is the only business question concerned with the backend (and most applications have a HIGH fault tolerance).<p>What does everyone care about? Your frontend. The colors, dropdown box or search field. That column should be over here. Focusing your testing on the parts of your application people could shrug about is not sound reasoning.')
