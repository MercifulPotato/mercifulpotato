I expect that M1 has an 8-wide rename.<p>Edit: another limitation is that most x86 decoders can only decode 16 bytes at a time and many instructions can be very long, further limiting actual decode throughput.<p>On the converse the expectation is that most hot code will skip decode completely and is fed from the uop cache. This also saves power.')
