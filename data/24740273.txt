When I switch to a regular keyboard my muscle memory for that other keyboard kicks in and I&#x27;m able to use that one fine.<p>It&#x27;s actually harder to switch from using my ErgoDox on Windows to the same ErgoDox on Mac because I use the bottom-left key for control on Windows and the bottom-right key for Command on Mac (both on the left-hand-side of the keyboard).<p>Even that&#x27;s not too bad, but there is a noticeable &#x27;switch over&#x27; time - maybe 5-10 minutes or so.')
