The second half believes mail-in votes were fraudulent. Voter ID would not allay either of these concerns. But let&#x27;s not get bogged down in details, because I understand the wider points you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>&gt; the common trope is that black people are unable or unwilling to get an ID, but that in and of itself is a pretty racist implication<p>Not black specifically, but urban, working poor and the homeless. And it&#x27;s not racist, it&#x27;s rooted in facts.<p>&gt; Any US citizen can go to their local DMV and get a state issued ID.<p>This costs time and money. At my local DMV in California, any interaction takes 2 hours of standing in line. That&#x27;s not counting the time it takes to get there and go back to work. For a person without state ID means taking the bus or riding a bike or walking.<p>Working poor people are hourly workers, and DMVs are not open outside of normal working hours. So a working poor person must sacrifice half a day&#x27;s wages to apply for an ID. And that&#x27;s if all their documentation is in order the first time (don&#x27;t scoff; I&#x27;ve had to go back multiple times because I was missing something or the official made a mistake).<p>Compared to that, an office worker can easily take a half day off with no loss in wages. Is this not a regressive tax in order to exercise a fundamental right?<p>&gt; What it does do, is restore just a small amount of confidence in the election process<p>That&#x27;s the stated reason for voter ID laws. However, good, fair, voter ID laws would also make provisions to ensure that the poor are not disproportionately affected by this new requirement. They&#x27;d keep DMVs open for longer or on weekends (in fact some states did the opposite after passing voter ID laws - by closing DMVs or reducing hours). They&#x27;d waive fees for low-income people. They&#x27;d automatically register graduating high schoolers - do it the same day as yearbook pictures. They&#x27;d let volunteers supervised by government employees run voter ID registration stations at grocery stores, churches, and community centers on weekends and evenings. Collecting documents and taking pictures isn&#x27;t particularly hard - you could get some Boy or Girl Scouts to take ID pictures for merit badges.<p>Given the hyper-partisan nature of American politics, a good voter ID law has a very small chance of being passed anywhere. The point of voter ID laws, as they are written today, is to suppress the urban poor vote. So the side proposing the laws has no incentive to help the urban poor get voter ID. And the side opposing voter ID laws takes umbrage to anything that adds friction to getting voters in the booths on election day, fearing (rightfully) the intentions of such efforts.<p>How do you solve all this?')
