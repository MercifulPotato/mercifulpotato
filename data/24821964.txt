Neural net datasets try to include as many variants of the target concept as possible in order to capture as many of the common features of instances of that concept as possible. A single horse would not suffice, e.g. 1 million images of a white horse would teach a neural net that horses are only white, etc.<p>Also, a child can learn to recognise horses from a caricature of a horse- which is a single image of a horse, not 1 million images. Whatever human minds do when they learn to recognise objects, that&#x27;s not training with big data in real time.')
