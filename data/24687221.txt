Nobody on any team I work with would accept a PR with 3000 lines of change. Each team had a policy, whether formal or informal, to break large work items across PRs so they were more easily reviewable. I would say that 300 lines changed is getting towards the bigger end of what we would accept. If your choice is between 30 or 3000 lines changed per commit, then for sure I&#x27;d pick 30, but above either I think a 300 line limit is more sensible.')
