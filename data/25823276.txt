I had a recurring dream where someone or something was banging on the door. It wanted in, I was holding the door shut, and I was scared to open the door. But at the time I was really into Jordan Peterson, who talked a lot about &quot;embracing your shadow&quot;, and &quot;integrating your shadow&quot;, concepts that Carl Jung came up with.<p>The last time I had this dream, rather than fight it, I flung open the door, and said &quot;come in, come in&quot;. It didn&#x27;t go well. It was like a demon had crept into my mind, corrupting everything I did. I got fired from work because I&#x27;d leave whenever I felt like, couldn&#x27;t concentrate at all, I recklessly racked up credit card debt, I was just in general acting like a shitty human being.')
