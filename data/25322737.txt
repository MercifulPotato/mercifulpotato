Item(by='crails124', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607253086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321770, text='&gt; I would like to end the story with some action items like: “Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.<p>Checking to make sure the locks work seems like a reasonable and already recommended step. How one goes immediately to some AI thing and misses 20 more realistic steps in-between is a bit perplexing to me. Second more reasonable step, keep valuables secured or in your possession.<p>I&#x27;m more paranoid than most with no real reason to be. I take a few moments to look around when staying in a hotel or airbnb. I turn the flashlight on to look for any hidden lenses in smoke detectors and vents etc, identify and disable things that could be used to listen in like smart speakers and tv&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not looking to be some super secure safe room but a few minutes prevents most petty maliciousness or &quot;opportunities&quot;. I&#x27;m more distrustful of Airbnb&#x27;s than hotels.')
