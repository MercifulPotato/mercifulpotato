Item(by='pjc50', descendants=None, kids=[25482121], score=None, time=1608407485, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480074, text='&gt; The attitude here is rapidly becoming &quot;why should I bother if no one else is?&quot;. And frankly, I think the government know and encourage this. Its all but policy. Time and again we see them decline scientific advice, then act surprised when infection rates spike.<p>They always believed in &quot;herd immunity&quot;, so they&#x27;re going to run with the minimum restrictions that achieve an &quot;&quot;acceptable&quot;&quot; death rate.<p>We still don&#x27;t have a great picture of what&#x27;s driving the infections, due to the failure of track&amp;trace. I suspect it&#x27;s schools, universities, workplaces, and (unfortunately) hospitals, but I don&#x27;t have handy evidence for that.<p>Having Folkestone jammed with containers of undistributed PPE while the clock runs down to the Brexit logistics crisis isn&#x27;t helping either.<p>Anyway, the Tory public have been inexplicably satisfied with the performance so far, and are probably going to widely ignore the last-minute changes to Christmas rules.')
