But manual logging is something very painful to do at such intervals. In a parallel universe, one where we don&#x27;t have social media but mini drones the size of an orange,  I imagine these drones would be floating around their owners and logging (locally!) all their activities (algorithms determine the best kind of action for every human activity (e.g., human sitting down with a book -&gt; reading... The drone could even attempt to read the book&#x27;s title and log it as well as metadata)).')
