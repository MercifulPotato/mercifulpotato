Item(by='mindcrime', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611594014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904433, text='At any given time I have somewhere around 50 books &quot;in flight&quot; in the sense that I&#x27;ve read at least a few pages and put it in &quot;currently reading&quot; status on Goodreads. But there&#x27;s usually one (or two) that are getting the bulk of my attention. Right now the main book I&#x27;m focusing on is <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i> by Norvig and Russell. I&#x27;d had this on my shelf for years and never got serious about working my way through the entire thing until recently. And I have to say, I now really regret not starting this project sooner. There&#x27;s so much great stuff in this book.<p>I&#x27;m not just &quot;reading&quot; it like a novel though. I &quot;just read&quot; up to a certain point (basically the end of the section on inference using FOL) and now I&#x27;m going back to a certain point (the beginning of the section on logic based agents) and going back through and doing exercises, implementing the algorithms myself, etc. Once I&#x27;ve satisfied myself that I have done all I need to do with this area, I&#x27;ll pick back up with the section that starts talking about Uncertainty and repeat the process.<p>And I&#x27;ll keep picking through a couple of these other 49 books in random moments of idle time here and there. I&#x27;ll probably finish <i>Behind The Cloud</i> by Marc Benioff soon.<p>Reading frequency? Not sure what you mean. I read everyday with few exceptions, but since books vary in length and density, I can&#x27;t say &quot;I read two books a week&quot; or anything like that. But FWIW, I log my reading with Goodreads, and over the last 10 years or so of my life, I&#x27;ve averaged finishing somewhere between 35-50 or so books per year.')
