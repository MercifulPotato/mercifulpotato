I don&#x27;t know if I am willing to make that trade. I don&#x27;t like the idea of a president being able to hide behind the vale of formal behavior. If my president is a white supremacist sympathizer, I want to know. Scratch that, I deserve to know.<p>I realize public politicking is currently partisan theater, I&#x27;m not trying to deny that either. Still, even from that purview there may be hope, the more we are exposed to it, the sooner we&#x27;ll grow tired and do something about it with our votes. I don&#x27;t know enough about the politicians from that state to qualify if it was a good thing or not, but Georgia just went blue during a runoff of all things! I&#x27;m sure part of that was fueled by the president&#x27;s voter fraud saber rattling.<p>I know its hard to separate the person from the idea, but I really loved that the president, not his staff, tweeted. From it I learned that he either believes or is while to spread conspiratorial narratives as long as he sees a benefit from it. The things he tweeted seemed way worse than the &quot;Smart people said that...&quot; &#x2F; &quot;I heard that...&quot; kinda stuff he did during his rallies. That is a character flaw I don&#x27;t want thumbing over the button.')
