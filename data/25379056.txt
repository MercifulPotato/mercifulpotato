We&#x27;re talking about copyright infringement, not child porn.  Invoking &quot;think of the children&quot; is a cheap way to inflame emotions about a topic to get the knee-jerk reaction you want.<p>Regardless... it depends.  Are they making a good-faith effort to remove that content from their platform, but sometimes come up short?  That&#x27;s to be expected, but I&#x27;d want some commitment that they&#x27;re working to improve.  Did they email me and say &quot;hey, we like child porn and making money off of it&quot;?  Ok, yeah, then I&#x27;d cut them off.<p>If I suspected something fishy was going on but wasn&#x27;t sure?  I&#x27;d report what I knew to the police and let them do a proper investigation.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to destroy someone&#x27;s business based only on my suspicions.  It&#x27;s not ok for the legal system to do that, so why would it be ok for me to do that?  The burden of proof should still be &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, and the best place to determine that is still the courts, as imperfect as they can be at times.')
