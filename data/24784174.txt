There&#x27;s a couple of other posters that outline things that should have been scandals but it&#x27;s not that the media never reported it, it&#x27;s that the public didn&#x27;t get outraged.<p>Not enough people cared about the extra-judicial assassination of a US citizen because he was probably a terrorist so it only lasted one news cycle, that could have been a scandal but it was not.  If people don&#x27;t care about the behavior as being wrong then the event won&#x27;t be a scandal.')
