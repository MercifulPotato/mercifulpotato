My workplace was extremly toxic, people talking behind each others back etc.<p>I got home and instead of hanging out with my gf and 6 months baby I escaped into video games, or news. \nFor some reason, I blamed my family for my shitty life, and where mean to my gf.<p>I used to read a lot of books and be interested in a lot of stuff before, but the recent years all I have had energy for has been to browse my normal time killing websites. In my mind, the reason for this was that I was getting older (just turned 35).<p>Anyway, a while ago I got a &quot;moment of clarity&quot; that I just had to change my current path or give up completely and start drinking or something. I quit my job without having a new job. The first week after quitting nothing changed really, but week 2 then things really started to happen. The heavy anxiety in my stomach dissapeared. This in turn enabled me to do more stuff.<p>Another thing I did was deleting my Facebook account. I have been wanting to do that for years, but I have always resisted since I would then lose my way of communicating with a lot of &quot;friends&quot;. Anyway, after a few days of that, I somehow felt that my head felt clearer. I was no longer filled with other peoples bullshit thoughts.<p>Inspired by this, I stopped reading newspapers online and started buying paper versions instead. That also had a positive impact on me.<p>My relationship with my family got sooooo much better. I started to having long conversation with my gf, something I realized I had barely had for a lot of time. Also, I started to feel all these feelings when being with my kid, and I am so happy that I now can be in the moment with her.<p>In two weeks I will start my new job. I don&#x27;t know how it will be, but I know that if it sucks, I will talk about it with my gf instead of escaping into the internet.')
