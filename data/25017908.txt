While I have mixed opinions about digital censorship in general, it should not be surprising for a (quasi)democratic society that values free speech to silence those in power who would encourage large groups to question those core values.<p>This is especially true since western society regularly tries to interpret and judge intent along with what people say, and it has judged that Trump&#x27;s intent is self-serving and not an honest disagreement, and as a result it has deemed it at least somewhat acceptable to censor him.')
