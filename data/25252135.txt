Item(by='perryizgr8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606728499, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252030, text='&gt; Everybody is paying for your &#x27;free parking&#x27; don&#x27;t pretend that we&#x27;re not.<p>I never asked for free parking. Private residential and office buildings provide proper parking. Only excessive regulations inside the city prevent private owners from making adequate parking available.<p>&gt; In any major city it&#x27;s physically impossible to transport the majority of people to their work places in cars and impossible to store those cars for the work day.<p>Yes, because the cities are poorly designed, by designers starting with the dehumanizing mindset of &quot;moving&quot; people efficiently. Remove the regulations and watch as people solve the parking problem.<p>&gt; Studies have shown that people are happy to use what ever transport is available as long as it&#x27;s fast, frequent and cheap.<p>LOL! People will use whatever best is available to them! Cause rents to soar so they don&#x27;t have money to buy a car. Put excessive taxes on cars so they don&#x27;t have money to buy a car. Design cities in a way that excludes parking, has narrow streets, so people don&#x27;t feel comfortable driving and owning a car. And you get the current outcome. I&#x27;d be willing to bet that a large proportion of the people taking the bus or train would drive or be driven in a car, if their city were properly designed for human living and transportation.<p>&gt; Everybody pays the car tax.<p>It&#x27;s not a tax if you can choose. The problem with public transport is that I can&#x27;t choose. You can find another apartment building without car parks. Or if you feel there is enough of a market you can make one yourself and earn big bucks by offering apartments without car parking (I have a feeling this business would fail miserably). What&#x27;s the option for me who prefers driving? Will you give me a tax break equivalent to the amount that would have gone to public transportation?')
