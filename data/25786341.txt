I think I definitely have a problem mapping sounds to meaning, names especially can take me 3 or 4 times to hear properly when introduced if it&#x27;s a little noisy. It gets embarrassing to ask them to repeat themselves.<p>Spoken conversations also don&#x27;t stick as well in my memory - if I read something once there&#x27;s a good chance I remember it adequately, not so much for listening.')
