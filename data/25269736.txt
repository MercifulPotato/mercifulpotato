On GCP everything is an HTTP request with an id_token in the header and event in the body, almost surprisingly so. As a result services like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run containers are quite literally just generic HTTP handlers. I suspect the integration feel of Lambda, which I agree with, might be a consequence of inter-service communication on AWS being relatively proprietary, or if that&#x27;s not the right word, custom? Maybe the <i>loose</i> feeling of GCP is because everything is an HTTP request? It&#x27;s almost like all of GCP runs on a built-in HTTP API Gateway setup by default. Honestly most of the time I feel like I&#x27;m living in HTTP-Request-land anyway, so not having to context switch when working with the platform is kind of nice sometimes.')
