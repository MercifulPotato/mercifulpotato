Some never multicore CPUs has TDP of +100W, it would probably be much better if we lowered the voltage and frequency for a small CPU performance hit. Thankful to the developers of the driver!<p>&quot;The dynamic power consumed by a CPU is approximately proportional to the CPU frequency, and to the square of the CPU voltage:&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CPU_power_dissipation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CPU_power_dissipation</a><p>ps.
