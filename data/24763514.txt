[1]<p>To go back to my original point, I&#x27;m not arguing that the US successfully handled COVID. Nor am I trying to demonize China or India. I&#x27;m just saying that the author&#x27;s decision of foregrounding absolute death toll over per capita is poor and misleading given the sample they used. It could be seen as bad faith on the part of the authors when the per capita number can support their argument just as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbs.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;india-s-coronavirus-cases-pass-7-million-but-death-rate-remains-mysteriously-low" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbs.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;india-s-coronavirus-cases-pass-7...</a>')
