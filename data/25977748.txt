Some times I lay down for 10-15 minutes but I don&#x27;t fall asleep, and that&#x27;s OK.  Not every nap requires sleep.<p>I think some people (my wife included) get caught up in the thought that in order to nap you have to sleep.  Maybe just lie down, close your eyes, and try to relax (slow breathing, clear your mind, etc.)  If you don&#x27;t fall asleep after 10 minutes (or whatever) get up and go about your day.  If you do, that&#x27;s great too.')
