They say integrated LSP is coming in their next release but I don&#x27;t see how that approach could be better than CoC&#x27;s tracking of VSCode as upstream and bringing all the goodies of that high man-hours product.<p>What makes me consider switching, is a practical exclusive feature like that Tree-Sitter algorithm for syntax-highlighting that neovim team is touting or at least a concrete and reproducible performance benchmark against the regular vim in their usecase scenarios (startup-time, long logs, diffs, binary editing, etc).')
