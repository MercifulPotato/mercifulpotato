There&#x27;s already precedents for what businesses can and cannot prevent you from doing.  If, for instance, you think a business should be compelled to bake a cake with a certain message on it, then you can&#x27;t make the argument that there should be no regulation on how much a business can censor its users.<p>That&#x27;s not the only example.  There&#x27;s extensive case law that establishes how both governments and businesses have to either allow or curtail speech under certain conditions.  A business can&#x27;t legally compel you to do say something or wear a piece of clothing in a way that discriminates against you.  A sex shop can&#x27;t just open anywhere because, while it&#x27;s been argued that they should be allowed as a form of free expression, they tend not to be considered as such under the spirit of the law.  A person can be held responsible for the aftermath of shouting &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded room, even though this speech is superficially supported by the first amendment.  Point being, we make decisions about freedom of speech that don&#x27;t necessarily follow the letter of the constitution or stay within the bounds of the government.<p>Freedom of speech isn&#x27;t just a law.  It&#x27;s a social principle upon which America was founded.  If all meaningful communication is dominated by too-big-to-fail businesses with AI that can scour all correspondence, a reality we are rapidly approaching, then freedom of speech becomes meaningless.  The situation becomes worse when these companies are all politically aligned with the regime.  This is why we can&#x27;t ignore how private companies regulate communication through their systems.')
