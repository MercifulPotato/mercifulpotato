So none of the front page of comments mentioned donations and the blog post didn&#x27;t mention donations. There is a &quot;donate&quot; image on the right, but that&#x27;s on every post.<p>The point of the blog post seems to be much more &quot;we&#x27;re being persecuted&quot; than &quot;we need money&quot; to me.')
