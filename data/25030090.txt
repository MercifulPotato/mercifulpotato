In the 90s they had the biggest number of phone taps in the world, and this is not per capita, but the absolute number! With a population a mere fraction of the US&#x27;s.<p>However the Netherlands is a fairly honest country when it comes to statistics, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the US still came out on top, but they just didn&#x27;t report most of their taps for &#x27;national security&#x27; reasons.<p>But something has really changed in the past 20-30 years. Before this there was no way to literally monitor everyone. It was too labour&#x2F;storage intensive. You really had to be a &#x27;person of interest&#x27; for some kind of (usually legitimate) reason.<p>Whereas now in this digital age (and with everyone carrying a portable listening device in their pocket) this is totally feasible and thanks to Snowden we know it&#x27;s actually being done too.')
