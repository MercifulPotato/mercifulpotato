They create a new value from the old one.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about the context of a game, you&#x27;ll be very likely using monads where this isn&#x27;t the case (IO, ST). Not to mention, even if you do just use a normal state monad, if you don&#x27;t keep the old value around, there&#x27;s no functional difference between mutating the entire program state and creating a new program state while forgetting the old.')
