There is no shortage of applicants. Just the shortage of qualified people.<p>Side note - I do NOT use whiteboard technique in my interviews. I ask the candidates questions about the stuff they mention in their resumes and go deep in the technical discussion based on their responses (or I told them to walk me through one of their recent projects be it a work project or their side project). Using that &#x27;simple&#x27; technique, you can easily filter out so many pretenders (as I&#x27;d like to call them, who have splendid resumes but little to back things up when grilled the details about their resumes).')
