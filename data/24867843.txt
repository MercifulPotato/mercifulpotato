Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24868959, 24876305], score=None, time=1603448165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866235, text='&gt; The proposition that made California the way it is is the one that meant that the primaries are non-partisan and the final race is between the two top contenders.<p>No, it&#x27;s not.<p>It&#x27;s not even a proposition. It&#x27;s that the California Republican Party tries to campaign like it&#x27;s Kansas, that keeps them hovering right at the border of the level where Democrats have a 2&#x2F;3 supermajority in both houses plus control of the statewide offices.<p>&gt; This means that special interests in California need only present their cause through the lens of leftism and they will automatically find sympathetic candidates in the top two,<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty rare that the jungle primary provides same party candidates (and it&#x27;s never, IIRC, done “Democrat plus leftist third party”), so, no, that wouldn&#x27;t be true even if the California Democratic Party was reliably leftist, which it decidedly is not, see, e.g., Dianne Feinstein.<p>&gt; Contrast this with a partisan primary system. In that system, on the final ballot, it would be difficult for special interests to formulate an argument appealing to both candidates.<p>It&#x27;s actually not, you just craft it around the local district not left-right ideology.<p>&gt; for some reason, I am downvoted but there is little engagement or actual refutation of what I&#x27;m saying. If you&#x27;re going to downvote, at least say something.<p>Downvoting is saying that something isn&#x27;t a productive addition to the conversation, engaging is saying that even if it is wrong, it is. There&#x27;s really no good reason to engage when downvoting, or vice versa, they serve opposing purposes.')
