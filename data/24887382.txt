The value of an active Facebook user for advertising is about $25&#x2F;year in revenue, $6&#x2F;year in profit. Facebook spent $2 billion on Oculus. They&#x27;ve sold a couple of million headsets. Let&#x27;s say that they&#x27;re all still active users. That&#x27;s $1k per user.<p>Do you see how utterly implausible your theory about the VR just being a vehicle to drive revenue is? It&#x27;s not that the numbers don&#x27;t add up. It&#x27;s that the numbers are off by orders of magnitude.<p>And oh, just by buying a Quest 2 and a few games, I&#x27;m already a far bigger source of revenue to Facebook than an average user of the social network part. The idea that they&#x27;d be knee-capping the whole ecosystem by intentionally disabling paying customers just to make pennies more on ads is ludicrous.<p>I think it&#x27;s basically guaranteed that the explanation from my original post stands: their anti-abuse team did not consider this use case when building their bulk account models, but will obviously consider it in the future.<p>I&#x27;d happily make a bet that my account will not get &quot;banned&quot; in the next year, despite not having any Facebook friends or Facebook social network activity.')
