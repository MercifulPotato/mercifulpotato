I agree there can be a scale of culpability.<p>Two points I question:<p>You assume that doxxing Belarusian law enforcement is effective.<p>You also imply that Belarusian law enforcement have the power to affect Belarusian policy.<p>These seem like very much unjustified assertions.<p>You also seem to ignore the possibility that doxing Apple employees could affect Apple’s policy which is what people want when they criticize Apple.<p>I am not arguing for doxxing.  I’m against it.<p>However if one believes it would be effective at changing Belarusian policy, it raises the question as to why it would not be effective in changing Apple’s policy?<p>There is also the point made by the parent that Apple’s people have “blood on their hands”, and are “enablers of violence”.<p>From your statement about the relative badness, I presume you don’t agree with the parent comment about this.<p>So it doesn’t seem like your view is representative of the one I was replying to.<p>I stand by my original comment.<p>If someone thinks Apple’s employees have “blood on their hands”, then it is logical to assume that by the same reasoning they support doxxing of police, they would support doxxing of Apple employees <i>because they equate what Apple employees are doing with violence</i>.  That’s what it means to say that someone has blood on their hands.<p>The fact that you don’t actually think that what Apple is doing is so bad, changes nothing about the original comment.  I was replying to a comment that was far less moderate than the opinion you have just expressed.<p>You just don’t share the views of the person I was replying to.')
