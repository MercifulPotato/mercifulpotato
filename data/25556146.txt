IPv4 is never, ever going away because of this.<p>IPv4 has already been eliminated from newer edge networks, and for those networks the vast majority of upstream traffic is IPv6. No doubt those networks will have to maintain 464XLAT for a long time as the long tail of upstream sites that are only v4-accessible, but they&#x27;ll be able to have a smaller and smaller pool of 464XLAT servers and outsource the v4 connectivity support further and further upstream (just as with Usenet), until eventually v4 connectivity becomes a paid add-on and then goes away entirely. Home routers for use with PCs will probably have to offer 4over6 for a long time, because it&#x27;s hard for an ISP to be confident all their users are up to date, but that doesn&#x27;t actually reduce the benefits that much (all your internal network management can still be v6, only the little home user LANs are v4), and organisations that manage all their endpoint devices don&#x27;t even need that much.')
