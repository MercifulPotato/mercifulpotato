Perhaps there&#x27;s a more apt analogy.  Let&#x27;s say there exists a gun manufacturer who&#x27;s developed a new type of gun that&#x27;s particularly effective.  The problem is the guns are in limited supply.  The manufacturer ultimately cares about profit, so it decides to sell the guns to the highest bidder.<p>Most of the guns sold end up providing value to society in the form of protection.  But, in a handful of cases, the highest bidder happens to be a violent regime that uses the guns for ethnic cleansing.<p>Do we blame the gun manufacturer or the violent regime?<p>From this perspective, I agree that a small part of the blame falls on the gun manufacturer for not vetting buyers.')
