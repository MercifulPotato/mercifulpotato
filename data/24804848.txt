It starts as an anecdote about an inmate beaten to death by the wards, like if it was representative, but then the overwhelming majority of deaths are a result of diseases, overdoses and suicides. Also no reference to the denominator, so you canâ€™t really tell if there is an over mortality in jail vs outside (particularly for the subset of the population that is likely to end up in jail - drug addicts, people with mental problems, etc).')
