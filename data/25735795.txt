Also, as best as I can guess, you are advocating for nihilism.<p>How &quot;logical&quot; is it to say that because I have some values, they are indistinguishable from justifying slavery?<p>This sort of &quot;there is no truth or good or bad&quot; is exactly the sort of reasoning that&#x27;s used to brainwash people into supporting <i>anything and everything</i>. Because once there&#x27;s nothing true, there&#x27;s nothing false.<p>If somebody is feeding you this line of reasoning, or some group, or some forum, I would recommend trying to reconnect with mainstream human thought and value of human life for a bit, and see if the nihilism still seems logical. Try to read a mainstream history of the Nuremberg trials, for example. Or read a book about the Reconstruction and the oppression that happened even after slavery was abolished.')
