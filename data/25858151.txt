The seemingly worse option is actually better than placebo (but statistical fluctuations masked this).<p>Given that there are very few studies and that publication bias is a thing, these possibilities are conceivably more likely than the p-value would lead one to believe.<p>The benefit of placebo testing in the first place is that you end up with a simpler possibility matrix (the neither is better than the other outcome also breaks down into a whole slew of cases).')
