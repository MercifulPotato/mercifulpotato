Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607791007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399101, text='Twitter (and social media) is largely not journalism. Twitter is a for-profit organization that chooses how to obtain maximum profit. So far, profit comes from user engagement, regardless of the nature of content. That they are choosing to intervene with the user-created content in new ways does not change their top-level goals. Their responsibility is to make money, and any lesser goals they decide are company values. If you disagree with those values, specifically that misinformation that erodes a bedstone of elected representative democracies should be discouraged on their platform, then by all means, encourage as many people as you wish not to use this ad-supported corporation.')
