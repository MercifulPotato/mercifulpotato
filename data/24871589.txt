The implications of a non-BTC-based standard with the intent of enabling cross-border more effectively is:\n- IMFcoin, UNCoin(and the conspiracies around global banking cartel actually take flight because yeah actually that would be nuts)\n- EUcoin, USAcoin, ChCoin (imagine the geopolitics...)<p>A digital currency that directly fits the digital use-case being described by these papers written by central banks, that is in turn ignored by these papers, is sort of like talking about WW2 without mentioning Germany&#x27;s role.<p>I can definitely understand the aversion given the implications of a non-CB controlled digicoin, but just ignoring its existence really blows a hole in the intellectual rigor of these whitepapers.<p>Ultimately, the network adoption will play out as it plays out. We don&#x27;t have USAweb and RUSweb (maybe moving toward that, but different topic), we have the decentralized, multi-party, ICANN&#x2F;IETF&#x2F;private sector&#x2F;public sector-led The Internet. When you track how the Internet came to be, and how it&#x27;s actually controlled now, it starts to look a lot like the Bitcoin network&#x27;s growth plan at the moment. What will be will be. Once it gets analyzed as a network protocol with digital native payments, vs. a digital currency on the regular internet, the blind spots in BTC criticism start to show.')
