I mean, wouldn&#x27;t it seem strange to take on the moniker of Takeshi while travelling in Japan, or Juan in Mexico, or Alexei in Moscow just to be able to order at Starbucks?<p>p.s. I should add the caveat that Starbucks baristas in Japan do not ask for names. It&#x27;s culturally inappropriate there so Starbucks doesn&#x27;t implement their names policy in Japan.')
