Hopefully, the issues mentioned in the post will be fixed soon, considering this is a quite new product. I can see high value for small personal websites, as they would be able to get something for free and focus on user privacy.<p>Meanwhile, the mentioned issues might be quite beneficial for other companies, such as Plausible or Fathom. They are quite mature on the privacy-focused analytics market, and offer things that Cloudflare analytics doesn&#x27;t. People might start on Cloudflare Analytics (free) and eventually migrate to something more full-featured.')
