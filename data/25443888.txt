It tends to give its users bad habits with respect to structuring code is what I observe.\nIt seems to lack data structures that are quite pervasive in modern programming practise.<p>Also python being a general purpose system brings its own benefits, one can easily hook up ones code to fetch or push data to databases and even easily scrape data of the web or extract&#x2F;reparse&#x2F;rectify&#x2F;reformat poorly&#x2F;complexly structured data before processing.<p>And I find MATLAB not feature rich in terms of being able to manipulate tabular data in a relational DB like manner, that is querying&#x2F;projecting&#x2F;selecting rows&#x2F;colums to find interesting facts.')
