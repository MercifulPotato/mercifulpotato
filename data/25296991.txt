The last of this kind in the mass market would be something like the Amiga, which is still a very different design.<p>Third, it&#x27;s hella fast and many different things, both given its power draw, but also irrespective of it.<p>Fourth, it makes ARM for PC computing mainstream suddenly, after decades where it was relegated to the mobile and hobbyist&#x2F;specialist (rapsberry, etc) space.<p>If that&#x27;s not a revolutionary change, I don&#x27;t know what you expected. A CPU made from flour with alien technology that&#x27;s 1000 times faster and uses quantum bits?<p>Yeah, they didn&#x27;t make that.')
