A lot of bad documentation I&#x27;ve dealt with is often riddled with acronyms and a priori knowledge of underlying systems and external dependencies.<p>I think a good approach is to hire junior developers&#x2F;interns and just ask them to build stuff off your API from scratch and carefully record their pain points, questions, etc. As a bonus, the stuff they build can also later be used as working &quot;best practice&quot; examples -- assuming you get your developers to code review them.<p>I say junior developers because they&#x27;re a good knowledge baseline to aim for and are probably not &quot;contaminated&quot; with a priori knowledge of your system or similar alternatives.')
