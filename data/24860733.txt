Thomas Drake, Bill Binney, and others came forward through the appropriate legal channels and lost their careers, faced prosecution, and absolutely nothing changed.<p>Legally, you&#x27;re technically correct. Snowden is a fugitive. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that he fundamentally changed the way we think about privacy and the government&#x27;s role in digital privacy for the better. James Clapper lied to Congress weeks before Snowden&#x27;s revelations, yet he never faced perjury charges. That&#x27;s what a broken system looks like.')
