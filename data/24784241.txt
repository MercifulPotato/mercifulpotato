Very impressive.<p>Not sure what your reliability metrics are, but I&#x27;ve run Linux and macOS desktops side by side for years now (decades, even), and I don&#x27;t really detect much of a difference. The macOS ones do tend to have the benefit of a rigid hardware platform, which is why I suppose they do a bit less well when forced to run on an arbitrary platform (e.g. inside KVM).')
