They will not have tariffs on everything&#x2F;some things? Does this cap tariffs? Does this uncap capital flows, especially crossing the mainland China border? Does this cap FX exchange rates? Does this make establishing cross-border corporate structures easier? Is there protection for cross-border trade routes for physical goods? Is there deregulation in terms of online services (things like &quot;we&#x27;ll let you store our data&quot;)? Is there agreement on &quot;quality of goods&quot; for things like food or pharmaceuticals? etc.<p>The article explains nothing, other than saying &quot;yeah they agreed on something&quot;.')
