The recent port to Gtk3 lost some functionality as a result of regressions in the toolkit: keybindings in menus are no longer hover-rebindable, and the themes have not been properly ported, leaving me only with bloated Adwaita. For some reason, the package with window manager themes has not been released for 4.12 (the package from 4.10 works fine, though). There’s no path for migration to Wayland. Integration with display managers (i.e. screen locking) and systemd’s power management is flaky.<p>And I am saying all this with regret, as a long time user; I consider it the best desktop environment I have used.<p>I almost wish they had forked Gtk2 instead of porting to Gtk3 (or even more crazily, ported Gtk2 to Gdk3 to take advantage of ‘plumbing’ improvements in the latter, like Wayland support), but I do realise they just don’t have the manpower.')
