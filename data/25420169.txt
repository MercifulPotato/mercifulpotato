Item(by='dgb23', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607966394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397484, text='A window is full of physical metaphors, like buttons, draggable handles&#x2F;bars, tabs&#x2F;paging.<p>But yes, it is also an abstraction of a set of related functions that manipulate or show data. It is even necessarily an abstraction of the computational objects it represents. But the sign(s) of the window points to physical&#x2F;metaphorical objects.<p>Now the name &quot;file&quot; is also a metaphor. It represents (abstracts) a block of physical memory. But &quot;file&quot; is (or was) a sign for a physical thing made out of paper.<p>The metaphor of a file is on one hand useful, as it helps to understand physical memory as a set of objects we relate to in the outside world.<p>However it is also misleading: A real world file is typically immutable, to a high practical degree at least. We usually don&#x27;t change files outside of correcting mistakes. We just add them and put a date. The file is first in &quot;working&quot; mode, then it is &quot;done&quot; quasi forever. To achieve the same with the computational object we need to impose constraints and&#x2F;or discipline.')
