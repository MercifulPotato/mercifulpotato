I don&#x27;t think we can look to the past of computing to understand its future, I think we have reached in the past ten years or so a critical mass and penetration into the fabric of society that the rules are just different know than they were in the 90&#x27;s.<p>Unless the way we interact with our computing devices fundamentally changes (say, a shift from visual&#x2F;touch to, idk, voice or brain waves or whatever), I have a hard time seeing how there&#x27;d ever be a big shift from the web stack to something else like, say, the shift from Win32 apps to web apps. Hell, even if there is, the web might just embrace it. My day job is web-based AR...<p>The stack will evolve, sure, and maybe at the end there&#x27;s nothing left and the clients won&#x27;t know HTTP at all anymore... but I can just as easily see us just piling more stuff on, because I honestly think that, even with voice assistants and AI and whatever, most people are still going to produce and consume text and images from a device a lot like a phone for many years to come, simply because it&#x27;s a system that works well for humans that have eyes and fingers and pockets.<p>And if that&#x27;s the case, then what&#x27;s going to cause a seismic shift in platforms, when almost all software developers are web developers, and all devices run web applications? And if the stack doesn&#x27;t change, why wouldn&#x27;t some of the code stick around, if the business or organization that invested in it does? Some businesses now might replace twenty-year-old code just because, but at least part of that is because of how software stacks have changed and aged, and I think the sheer amount of &quot;webcrap&quot; that&#x27;s being excreted by people like you and me is going to slow that rate of change right down, even if it doesn&#x27;t feel like that in the middle of all the framework churn.')
