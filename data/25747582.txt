My original thought was something that was a subset of Forth, though I get the impression that vanilla Forth is a headache dealing with data types other than ints and the result would be sufficiently custom that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.<p>Something based on TCL or S-expressions sounds like it would give the needed flexibility, though maybe at the expense of being able to implement on microcontrollers. Has anyone played with parsing either of those? I know that the PCB designer tool in KiCAD uses S-expressions so it&#x27;s been done before.')
