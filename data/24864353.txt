After 5 years of development, we’re excited to launch our product to the world.\nOur product StellarX.ai is an award-winning software, built to help teams of all sizes create 3D content. Here are a few things that set our stellar software apart.<p>Even non-programmers and non-pro-users can create 3D and immersive content! Collaboration should be simple, straightforward, and effective; and StellarX empowers business professionals across all industries to better themselves with immersive AI-enabled experiences.<p>A touch of magic... Create an immersive Space that’s totally yours. Use XR to simulate industry-specific environments that are relevant to your field or to make the inaccessible more accessible. Start from scratch or use a template to make each Space your own. Decorate with StellarX assets or import your favourites.\nYour space, your way!<p>There is no &quot;I&quot; in team: StellarX is team-first. That means you can all collaborate together, in an immersive space, or from your desktop. Prototype together, do design thinking, or create a fully interactive world — all within one app.<p>Last time you heard from me, I was telling you about what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes at OVA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ova.ai&#x2F;behind-the-s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ova.ai&#x2F;behind-the-s</a>...). This past year has been... I mean, you know how it&#x27;s been! We&#x27;ve been real busy bees at OVA. We:<p>- got over 5,000 StellarX downloads from around the world;\n- shipped close to 50 releases, with hundreds of improvements. And of course, at every release, we have squashed the bugs that we found;\n- now have a team of approximately 30 people, all coming from different backgrounds: countries such as Tahiti (French Polynesia), Canada, and Chile, for example.<p>In case you need any assistance with StellarX, we have you fully covered with our Help Desk: help.ova.ai<p>And in case you’d like to learn more about what we’re shipping today and where we’re going... follow our Release Notes.<p>A huge thank you to our first users — many of whom are part of the Product Hunt community — for the feedback you’ve shared over the past years. Thank you also, if you shared the love on social networks. It’s been truly incredible seeing what you’ve made with StellarX.<p>The team and I will be hanging out on this thread this week, so if you have questions, feedback, or thoughts, we’d love to hear them.')
