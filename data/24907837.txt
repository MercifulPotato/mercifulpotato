Item(by='toomuchtodo', descendants=None, kids=[24908793, 24908016, 24907856], score=None, time=1603809430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907712, text='401ks are federally protected from creditors. If you’ve maxed your IRA(s), and you have discretionary income you want to invest further, it absolutely makes sense to fully fund your 401k annually. Yes, the funds are tied up but they’re also protected against most creditors and judgements.<p>With that said, the vast majority of Americans would be better served with the 401k being deprecated, IRA limits increased, and IRAs receiving the creditor protection at the federal level 401ks currently have. This eliminates the need for employers to sponsor a 401k plan; an IRA is as easy as opening an account with any discount brokerage (which there are many of). This also eliminates the captive audience problem where 401k plans have higher expense ratios than investment options available in IRA or taxable accounts.')
