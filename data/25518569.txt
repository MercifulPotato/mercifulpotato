I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every platform, including the ones no longer with us (RIP Rdio) and no Spotify isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty good in relative terms. Every platform, after some time, gets stuck in a recommend loop. If I listen to enough recommended tracks, it gives me more recommendations of similar tracks, but if I keep listening, the recommendations eventually just become the songs they&#x27;ve already recommended and they get recommended over and over. Spotify does that but their tree of recommendations has far more branches and playlists from users adds randomness to the recommend algorithm. The other platforms aren&#x27;t as good with that (haven&#x27;t tried Apple Music in a while though).')
