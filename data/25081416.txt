Fiction often depicts nuclear wars as near-extinction events with very few human survivors. Going by similar topics, it&#x27;s safe to assume many people consider this a realistic scenario beyond just fiction.<p>The real strawman is in your comment though.<p>Who said nuclear war wouldn&#x27;t be bad, just because it likely won&#x27;t cause human extinction? Most people agree that regular wars are bad, and there never was any threat of extinction with them.<p>&gt; But I digress, my point is that the rational community seems to have a smarty pants mentality<p>No, the rational community has a rational mentality. One can be against war without claiming it would be the end of the world. Hitting your toe is also not the end of the world but you probably still consider it a bad thing to happen.')
