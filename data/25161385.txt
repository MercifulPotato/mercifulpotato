The 250k deaths from 11M infections number in the US is putting it within the original estimates. If you assume the actual case count is 2x or 3x the tested positive number, then its still roughly 1%, which will result in a lot of early deaths. If your over 50 then you should be taking it very seriously.<p>If the vaccine numbers are right, it could literally save over a million peoples lives just in the US.')
