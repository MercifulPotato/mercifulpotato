Item(by='logicalmonster', descendants=None, kids=[25471980], score=None, time=1608321893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467646, text='&gt; I think what the &quot;legacy&quot; news media failed at more than adapting was effectively communicating the time and effort that goes into serious news gathering and reporting.<p>Among many parts of the public, the perception (that IMO is correct) is that serious news gathering and reporting is the rare exception, not the norm. \nIt certainly seems like most news pieces these days take the form of uncritically reporting anything the government proclaims as fact, thinly veiled activism, and meaningless outrage click farming. \nThe respectable journalists out there with a shred of integrity and effort put into their reporting are very rare. Maybe a Glenn greenwald (who is an idealogical opposite of mine) is a rare exception. But I’d struggle to name more than like 5 journalists i think are even largely interested in truth, willing to take some risks, and have a bit of integrity.\nThe business model of journalism has changed (outrage based click farming) and the profession’s respectability (to me) has changed with it. Journalism was respectable before you could measure clicks and therefore profit.')
