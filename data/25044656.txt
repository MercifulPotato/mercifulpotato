Until I started working with Erlang&#x2F;Elixir, I would probably have agreed with the OP article instead. Or at least its title, for reading about concurrency problems has become rather obsolete (for me).<p>For years, I certainly made my own share of concurrency horrors, in everything from C and Python to Java and JS. Eventually I (sort of) got it right in each, mostly by building up experience in approaching it the right way. But it always remained a source of easy to make mistakes (and sometimes near-impossible to solve complexities, with larger systems).<p>However, since working with Erlang&#x2F;Elixir, I sometimes wonder what the F#$&amp; I was doing all that time. Many ideas were certainly a bit challenging to wrap my head around at first, but once they clicked there (kind of) was no way back.<p>This will probably sounds arrogant, and it&#x27;s okay with me if I get down-voted because of it. But the more I work with Erlang&#x2F;Elixir (and a few others in the FP field), the more it becomes clear to me how much the languages I used to program in (and their typical challenges), now most of all look like a (rather sick) joke to me. Again, I know this might sound pretentious, if not offensive. But it is sincerely what I feel. In my defense: I&#x27;m not some kind of hipster, still wet behind the ears. I&#x27;ve been programming for nearly 3 decades and in well over a dozen different language. I&#x27;m one of those kids that were ripping apart assembly code of &quot;protected&quot; games and desktop software, and hacked around on micro-controllers, during the nineties.<p>While Erlang&#x2F;Elixir may have shortcomings too (although I personally have not found any), it is one of the best things I&#x27;ve encountered for a long, long time. I&#x27;m also charmed by ClojureScript, but for totally different reasons. However, I do like it for when I&#x27;m forced to build something more complex for browser&#x2F;front-end. But that&#x27;s a whole different story, and not much relevant to this concurrency &quot;issue&quot;.')
