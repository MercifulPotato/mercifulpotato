If I was waterprinting a meeting, I would train a system like this on the fly on the people in the meeting and use it to dynamically insert filler words (um...) in a unique pattern into the audio stream for each member of the meeting. That would defeat any audio filter tricks or recreating the meeting from scratch, so you would want to summarize&#x2F;rephrase the meeting too.')
