My real card number and a dummy mastercard number with valid prefix and check digit both returned a 200 OK in around 1.01s. A random 16digit number without valid check digit returned 400 Bad Request in about 800ms. Decided to check that one since they have a completely useless machine-readable catchpa.<p>For Visa it was 835ms for valid, 762ms for dummy, prefix and check digit appears to be checked client side.')
