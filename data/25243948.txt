See 1 Above - this value proposition isn&#x27;t just great for off-shore banks, but also for countries who want less exposure to traffic from other countries (for whatever reason! think copyright laws, political sanctions, incompatible &quot;human rights&quot;, or content-control e.g. social &#x2F; free-speech &#x2F; whatever values our own overlords might disagree with). SCION allows fine grained control over what to impose on who and helps with censorship since not everyone will be affected, it allows micro sanctions on anyone they disagree with and it will be harder for them to say it&#x27;s happening because only they experience it. Think of it as a great-firewall-lite without all the political stigma and dressed up in the language of &quot;security&quot;.')
