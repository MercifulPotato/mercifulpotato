Every protester on the right was a neo-Nazi or complicit in marching with neo-Nazis. The rally explicitly invited white nationalist and neo-Nazi speakers. The stated goals of the rally was to unify the American white nationalist movement.<p>&gt; No one has control who shows up at these huge public demonstrations.<p>This demonstration was intended to be a white-supremacist, neo-Nazi demonstration.
