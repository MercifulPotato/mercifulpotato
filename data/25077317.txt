I&#x27;ve been using it for work exclusively for 3 years. It crashes, hangs, and generally acts weird every day. It&#x27;s not always greener on the other side.<p>The upside is 1) total customization, 2) if there is a problem you have a lot more power to fix it. There are just a lot more problems.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of my daily Linux issues (NVIDIA driver required to use external monitors)<p>1. Resume from sleep causes browsers and electron apps to fail to draw anything. I have to close and restart them. I found a workaround for Chrome (turn on Vulkan) but that&#x27;s not possible for Slack.<p>2. Periodically Linux reports I have no internal speakers and I have to kick pulseaudio<p>3. NVIDIA driver page faults several times a day requiring me to unplug, replug monitors and run xrandr to reconfigure the displays.<p>4. After an upgrade my system now boots to TTY and I can&#x27;t figure out how to fix it.<p>5. Zoom annotations don&#x27;t work<p>6. Discord audio didn&#x27;t work until I found an obscure workaround.<p>7. External monitor detection doesn&#x27;t work<p>8. The laptop display doesn&#x27;t go into power saving mode ever<p>9. Usb devices have to be unplugged&#x2F;replugged to be detected<p>10. Complete system crashes (hang with no recognition of any input, so no way to switch to TTY)<p>So, pros and cons.<p>edit: I should note that the last Macbook (2017 I think) would kernel panic randomly when connecting or disconnecting external monitors (like when going to a meeting).')
