Not some arbitrary dimension of some cherry picked subset of these components.<p>I disagree.  The <i>meaningful</i> achievement is how power-efficient, fast, and cheap you can make a given chip.  (Secondarily, how small and how durable wrt cosmic rays; but for most purposes these are not super important.)<p>If that follows as a result of many discrete electrical components being packed into a small area, great; but the latter isn&#x27;t intrinsically interesting.')
