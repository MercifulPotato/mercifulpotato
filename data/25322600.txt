Virtually all of that (&gt;9MB) are its gifs.<p>9MB of dozens of analytics.js files? Sure, awful.<p>9MB of gifs and &lt;1000KB of html&#x2F;css on a landing page? <i>Who</i> cares.<p>Btw, for lack of a kinder word off the top of my head, your rant about some images on the landing page is very juvenile. The tone of &quot;hmm, it would be a shame if your design choices made me assume you were technically incompetent and a waste of my time :&#x2F;&quot; is really toxic.<p>Everyone here would understand what you mean if you just said the landing page was over the top for you. Fine. OP would know that a bold design to be divisive. And frankly some self-awareness on your part would help temper your reaction here instead of dramatizing it and sounding wounded.<p>Similarly, claiming that a project interested you but you couldn&#x27;t even get past a landing page because it had some gifs is really just your loss, not anybody else&#x27;s. Once again, had you just said &quot;I wish there was a more informative page&quot; (which is certainly a fair ask), someone could have linked you to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.radicle.xyz&#x2F;docs&#x2F;what-is-radicle.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.radicle.xyz&#x2F;docs&#x2F;what-is-radicle.html</a>.<p>I know that now it seems like I&#x27;m the one overreacting, but your comment has some tropes of really bad communication habits that we tend to think are just part of internet discourse, but they aren&#x27;t doing you justice.')
