It&#x27;s true if you break your arm or need a flu shot they cover you.<p>If you have any expensive ailments you&#x27;re going to be paying out of pocket. Cancer? My aunt was paying $10,000&#x2F;month for chemo and that&#x27;s like 1&#x2F;3rd of her annual salary. Insanity.<p>Second tier you get a job your employer does give you health insurance. These are more often than not craptacular. 2 jobs ago the health insurance was that you had to pay 50% of the costs that they are being asked to pay. Most things weren&#x27;t covered. No MRIs, nothing under that crappy health care.<p>Third tier my newer jobs, they were good. You had to pay 20% of most things but some things arent covered. You pay 100%. Current job is a bit better, public sector health insurance. You show that card and you pass lines. My coverage in the military let me jump lines like crazy. In the third tier you will only get a private hospital room if you are infectious.<p>The final tier are the people whose names are on plaques or wings in hospitals. Our hospitals basically dont function without rich people donating very large sums. Those people will jump any and all lines. They get private rooms. Rather nice large private rooms.')
