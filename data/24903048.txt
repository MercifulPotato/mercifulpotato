This is a specific extralegal process for streamlining disputes over copyright hosted on a third party&#x27;s platform.<p>It&#x27;s like if someone is loitering outside of a store the store owner doesn&#x27;t have the right to arrest them and lock them in a cell in their basement. There&#x27;s a process that needs to be followed by people. Just because loitering may be illegal, and you have the right to post a no loitering sign, doesn&#x27;t mean you can enforce that on your own.<p>DMCA Takedowns are an exception that allows parties to quickly remove copywriten material from distribution that comes with heafty penalties (whatever the judge thinks is reasonable) for when something like this goes to court and it&#x27;s found that the takedown is invalid.')
