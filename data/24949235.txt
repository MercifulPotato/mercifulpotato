The dominant desktop is Windows; even macOS has several times the mind&#x2F;market share that Linux has.<p>Windows exposes lots of WM mechanisms to a developer, hence why something like vrdesktop.net could be built in the first place, or previous WMs like LiteStep for that matter.<p>It is also why WINE does not, and cannot, have a working Wayland backend while sticking to the protocol. The same is true for X, but there XWayland requires the compositor developer to implement a sideband window manager to hack around the entire Wayland protocol to get X clients to work.')
