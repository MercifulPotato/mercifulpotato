And that&#x27;s it.<p>Edit 2: The quote in the answer doesn&#x27;t say anything better:<p>&quot;While <i>none of these acts amounted to the crime of conspiracy</i>, all could be described as “collusion.”&quot;<p>Again, the fact in there is &quot;none of these acts amounted to the crime of conspiracy.&quot; Then, claiming that it &quot;could be described&quot; ([by whom?] -- there would be at least such mark in a Wikipedia article) is just an attempt to rationalize that fact to these who were emotionally invested.
