It&#x27;s just that for busy people spontaneity doesn&#x27;t happen often enough to maintain a friendship.<p>Spontaneity doesn&#x27;t happen unless you have lots of extra time lying around and most busy people don&#x27;t have that.<p>In fact ironically I actually have to <i>schedule</i> blocks of unscheduled time for myself and <i>schedule</i> blocks of unscheduled time for time with my partner. Those blocks of time just mean that I don&#x27;t have a specific plan and will do whatever I&#x2F;we feel like doing when we get to that time. That allows for spontaneity in the context of me alone as well as in my relationship.<p>However, for friends that doesn&#x27;t really work so well. It&#x27;s not like if I have a block of unscheduled time that a friend is just going to magically knock on my door (I don&#x27;t live in a college dorm, but if you do, that might work.) For friends we kind of need to agree on e.g. where to meet or what to do, so for friends it&#x27;s usually scheduling scheduled time.')
