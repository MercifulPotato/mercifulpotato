Most people don&#x27;t pay Google a single cent.<p>So it&#x27;s not that I trust Amazon, it&#x27;s that the economic model for Amazon including unlimited storage in my Prime membership makes sense.<p>(Note: I wouldn&#x27;t bet on Amazon staying unlimited for the next 50 years, just providing the counter-argument.)')
