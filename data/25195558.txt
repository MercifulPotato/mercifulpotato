In some countries, say Russia, the system and laws are designed in such a way that bribes are needed to do business. Simple as that. Don&#x27;t pay bribes and 100 cops and forensic accountants will show at your headquarters, closing it down and jailing you.<p>Now, Apple HAS to protect its headquarters and people. For that you need licenses which apparently weren&#x27;t given. So, close Apple headquarters down or...?  99.99% of the fault here lies with the laws &#x2F;state. The problem can be solved by donating <i>before</i> you ask the for &quot;favors,&quot; so no quid-pro-quo. I&#x27;d think that Apple generates quite a bit of business for the county &#x2F;state so they should favor them a bit. Or at least don&#x27;t try to stop them.')
