SMS&#x2F;MMS, historically, have been unreliable cross-carrier domestically in the US. Many cheaper Android phones, especially, seemed to be particularly poor players with SMS&#x2F;MMS group chats. SMS&#x2F;MMS doesn&#x27;t guarantee message delivery order (which can lead to some comical exchanges when the first split of the message shows up a day after the last split, but also obnoxious). MMS, depending on phone, isn&#x27;t particularly useful for a lot of multimedia or mixed content messages (not just text or simple and small images).<p>WhatsApp is free on carriers in many countries (including large portions of Asia and South America), contrasting with other messaging platforms which use a standard data plan. It delivers messages reliably, group messages just work, and it works properly for mixed content messages. And data is (relatively) cheap in most countries where WhatsApp isn&#x27;t free.')
