A company or org is not a body (it is a legal entity with a specific purpose), and a person with what I&#x27;ve called morally negative skills is not a cancer cell (they are a thinking person with actual goals that may align and actual skills that may be required).<p>I can pull out innumerable examples from politics or business here. Take the current US incumbent. Or, as I&#x27;m from the UK, the current prime minister, or his home secretary. Of course, to an observer who feels they are a cancer (I do!) they are what you describe. And they will always force other people out who would <i>seem</i> to have [call them] positive skills that would make them better suited [<i>from my viewpoint</i>], sure. But none of that means they aren&#x27;t skilled, or that they do not have (fairly obvious, as I think about it) &quot;worth&quot;')
