But if you have been using the web since its debut you know that it isn&#x27;t.  Search results are a list of results (links, i.e., addresses&#x2F;locations of the sources), not an &quot;answer&quot;.  The oracle idea (that all searches are questions with an &quot;answer&quot;) is only realistic to some programmers.  When I go to the library and search for sources (books, journals, etc), I might have a question in mind to which I seek an answer, but at the library I am only searching for the location of the sources.  I do not expect an &quot;instant answer&quot; from the library&#x27;s search terminals.  In any event, not all searches are questions.  Does Google Scholar return &quot;instant answers&quot;.<p>For the query you tested, I could only retrieve 101 results.  Could you get more than that.  If you can retrieve more than 300 results (the actual results pages with the links, not just a line about how many results were &quot;found&quot;), I would like to know what headers you sent.  I do not think this is possible anymore.<p>Interesting if you believe critical thinking skills are <i>not</i> on the decline.')
