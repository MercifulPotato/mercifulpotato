Every December for the past too-many-to-remember years, I&#x27;ve added new music to this list. I&#x27;d hate to lose it at this point and I wish I could export it. But there is no doubt Spotify has revolutionized the way I listen to and discover music. I&#x27;m actually happy to pay for Spotify Premium because it means I don&#x27;t have to download anything or keep the physical artifacts of music (vinyl) I used to need to make room for and worry about damaging when I moved, as well as all the stereo equipment, replacing tubes and needles, etc.')
