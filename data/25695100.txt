I was born after the fall of communism, but of course the environment has a big influence on the lens through which you see things (family, friends, stories, history classes, etc.)<p>So when I see what is called censorship in US, it seems a bit funny and strange to me. I immediately think how people in my country during communism would be happy if only that was called censorship and if they had a possibility to use alternative channels to exercise free speech. But of course, I accept that this might be my biased eurocentric view of things and that from a different cultural perspective &quot;real&quot; means something else. Perhaps it will be like that even in Europe in a few years, who knows. We don&#x27;t have much problems for now because we all use US social media and they don&#x27;t really react to foreign languages, except a few universal &quot;trigger&quot; words like antivax. At least for smaller languages and countries (central and eastern europe)')
