It was Russia hacking Clinton&#x27;s emails and the DNC, exactly like Trump asked them to. In addition, Russia engaged in massive ad campaigns using bots and troll farms that benefited Trump. Literally no one ever accused Russia of changing votes or engaging in voter fraud.  This is why it&#x27;s so difficult to discuss anything on the internet. You&#x27;ve done no research at all.')
