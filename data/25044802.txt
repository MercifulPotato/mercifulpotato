Code is the best documentation<p>Strangely, I find both gp and your claims to be nonsense. :-)<p>I&#x27;ve definitely experienced what you&#x27;ve experienced -- until you actually have code, you don&#x27;t know what works and what doesn&#x27;t work.<p>But it&#x27;s frequently not at all obvious what code does, even in the normal case; and even code which looks obviously correct often has hidden complexities that you wouldn&#x27;t have thought of.<p>I find trying to explain in a comment <i>why</i> the code I&#x27;ve written is correct is pretty good in wheedling out all the ways in which it&#x27;s not actually correct.<p>So when things are really complicated, you need both:  You need to have code that actually works, and you need to have text that attempts to prove that the code actually works.')
