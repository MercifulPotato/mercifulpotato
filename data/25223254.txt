Item(by='dtwhitney', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606422182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222281, text='Haskell simply makes you do a thing you should do: check that the thing you expect to be there is actually there. You can think of it simply as the compiler acting as a testing framework.<p>On the other side there are things like TypeScript where selecting the &#x27;n&#x27; index of an array does not give you a type representing the fact that the item may not exist, and thus does not force you the check if it does. You may call this &quot;getting out of your way&quot;, but I don&#x27;t see how this makes software less complex - it makes bugs more difficult to track down and necessitates more tests, which could simply be removed by an adjustment in types.<p>TyoeScript&#x2F;JavaScript is easier to learn, but dear God does it offer so many ways for your to shoot yourself in then foot.')
