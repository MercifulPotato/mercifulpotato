Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605823054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151773, text='1MB seems to be a bit much...<p>A few years ago I wrote a little blog software which is based completely on JS functionality (including i18n and page transition animations) and doesn&#x27;t work without it. So much so that no search engine ever finds the posts (my mistake, if you would do it right, that should not be a problem nowadays).<p>And yet, loading a page is less than 1 MB. In fact, loading the HTML and JS only, the page would fit in 100kb. The Webfonts are responsible for most of the traffic.')
