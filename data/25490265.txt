Playing the game felt like I was just going through the motions in a story that I was completely bored by.<p>The game doesn&#x27;t have any of the whimsical charm that Witcher 3 had (like Gwent mini-games). It was just a boring snoozefest of a story with lots of dialogue and pressing buttons to go to the next pseudo decision.<p>Combat is ridiculously broken. Just get a tech sniper rifler and you can clear out entire enemy camps by one-shot headshotting them through walls. Not to mention the countless bugs and crashes. It was annoying having to save the game constantly every single time I did anything, because if I didn&#x27;t, boom it crashes, and I just lost another 10 minutes of my life. I think the game crashed over 50 times during my playthrough.<p>And the elevators... I hate hate hate waiting in elevators! It&#x27;s such a cheap and boring way to hide a loading screen. I don&#x27;t want loading screens at all! I&#x27;m playing on a PS5, not an xbox 360 damn it.<p>I suffered through the game and finished the main quest line and was like, &quot;That was it?&quot;. My character was barely even leveled up! My character was only level 15 and done with the main quest. They clearly wanted me to spend more time grinding repetitive side quests along the way (even though I did do a ton of them).<p>Needless to say, I uninstalled the game and requested a refund from Sony. Maybe I will come back to the game next year after they release the PS5 enhanced version and have addressed the complaints.')
