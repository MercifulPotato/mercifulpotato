Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610687628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787090, text='As I remember, my FitBit HR holds less than 10 days&#x27; worth of heartbeat data, and can&#x27;t be uploaded to the phone without the phone having connectivity to FitBit&#x27;s servers.  Also, extracting large amounts of data from the FitBit tends to time out and require a full retry.  On more than one occasion, I was on vacation with my wife in a foreign country and only got a local SIM card for her.  This resulted in me turning off automatic sync (to avoid battery drain from all the failed attempts).  This resulted in me relying on manually sync&#x27;ing my FitBit data when I had WiFi, which resulted in my forgetting.  This resulted in data loss.<p>Also, I seem to remember long syncs timing out so many times in a row that I just had to factor-reset my FitBit HR to clear its data buffer.  This happened more than once.  It really needs an incremental sync.<p>When I got my FitBit HR, my wife was interested in using my original FitBit.  I proceeded to update its firmware right before I gave it to her, but the firmware update seems to have timed out and broken the FitBit.  I recovered once with a factory reset, but a second firmware update attempt bricked it.<p>Honestly, IoT devices need minimal firmware in non-brickable ROM that checksum the firmware in flash before jumping to the firmware in flash.  If the checksum fails, then make a light blink and go into a recovery mode that implements a minimal Bluetooth or HTTP firmware update, preferably incremental, requiring minimal state, and recoverable&#x2F;restartable if that minimal state gets corrupted.  Back in the day, I bricked a WRT54G router by using Firefox to upload the firmware instead of Safari or I.E. (It was a known non-deterministic issue, apparently. I&#x27;m guessing a corner-case in the router&#x27;s handling of chunked HTTP encoding.)  Not even the trick of shorting two adjacent pins using an x-acto knife could get the recovery TFTP server to come up.<p>Also, during the first year warranty period, my FitBit HR died twice, presumably due to being splashed so much with salt water during dragon boat race practice.  I know it says not to go swimming with it, but you should really avoid excessively splashing it with seawater.  When my FitBit HR died a third time shortly after the warranty period, I gave up on FitBit for a while.')
