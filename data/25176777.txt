No way!! \\s<p>Some websites rely on images, they could never really be under 250kb. And in my experience the download size doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is the usability of the website. Something Google tries to capture with their new metrics for pagespeed. If the website is optimized nicely (e.g. lazyloading) I can use the website in under a second while it will continues to load stuff as I use it.')
