This seems to be a much deeper battle about much more serious potential issues with AI.  It&#x27;s not just about language choice.  One of the examples cited in the linked article is how facial recognition wasn&#x27;t trained on as many examples of lower-albedo people and thus gave more false matches for them, thus potentially leading to false arrests for crimes they didn&#x27;t commit.  This is about a lot more than just language.')
