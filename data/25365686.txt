Do you typically &quot;stand out&quot; as in being overtly gay, or wearing anti-relgious clothing?</i><p>My own (black) experience in West Texas (Ft. Bliss), &quot;Careful&quot; meant driving across state to see family in Houston and absolutely <i>not</i> stopping in certain counties, not even to piss or stretch my legs.<p>After getting stopped, pulled over and ordered out of my vehicle while an officer stood back at his car several times and interrogated about &quot;where are you going&quot; &quot;where are you supposed to be&quot; &quot;who do you know in this town&quot; and &quot;where did you steal the car from&quot; (all separate experiences) while doing nothing but trying to take holiday leave.<p>So... <i>that</i> kind of careful for some of us.<p>edit, before anyone even makes the attempt:<p>- I was not driving erratically<p>- I had no bumper stickers on my car signaling political viewpoints<p>- I was not wearing any &#x27;curious&#x27; clothing other than a shirt and jeans<p>- I had functioning turn signals and brake lights<p>- I was driving a legally purchased, registered and insured vehicle at the speed limit (or +5mph) consistent with how I drive literally every day')
