They do miss out on VC firms, but they would anyways: VCs don&#x27;t want your money, because you, as a cohort, are a galactic-scale hassle. In the Majors, funds sell themselves to investments as much as investments sell themselves to funds.<p>So in addition to all the fraud problems, you also have a huge adverse selection problem: the private investments that are available to retail investors are going to be of starkly lower quality than what&#x27;s available to Bessemer and Index.')
