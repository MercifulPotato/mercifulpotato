It&#x27;s also not possible to define the natural numbers using any first order theory. There is no way to extend a first order theory so that it defines the natural numbers and only the natural numbers and furthermore there is no way to define a first order theory that defines the reals and only the reals.<p>Having said that, you were originally right that no theory of the reals can be satisfied by the rationals, but that&#x27;s for a fairly unrelated reason.')
