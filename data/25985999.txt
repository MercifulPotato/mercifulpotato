Do many people invest in Hedge Funds with their 401ks? Aren&#x27;t the vast majority of regular people&#x27;s 401ks tied up in Index Funds?<p>My understanding was that hedge funds started mostly as a way to be more protective of wealth - i.e. you were sacrificing some potential gains to be more certain you wouldn&#x27;t lose more than x%.
