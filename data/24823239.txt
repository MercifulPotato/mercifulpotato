I didn&#x27;t have the same problem with it because it doesn&#x27;t overstep the boundaries of styling.\nIt did remove valuable structure of the code for the sake of formatting standardization, so again it&#x27;s actually doing damage, but at least it doesn&#x27;t force you to write code that is more cryptic to a human for the purpose of pleasing a machine.')
