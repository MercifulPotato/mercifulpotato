The reason I purchased one wasn&#x27;t for &quot;lifestyle&quot; but because even my Dell XPS or Toshiba X1 for work, which work about as good as you can expect of any laptop running Linux, are fucking annoying day to day because of tiny nits. With the System76 laptop, I literally never fuck around with stuff, it just works with everything I have on my desk.<p>I do admit that in today&#x27;s world a laptop is almost useless (I have nowhere to go!), and I plan to transition to a real desktop sometime soon, since it&#x27;s just so much more powerful and useful overall.')
