I wonder if those trademark rules were visible at the time?<p>Doesn&#x27;t really matter from a legal standpoint though in terms of how you view RPi&#x27;s conduct here I think it&#x27;d be very different if the trademark rules page popped up yesterday vs available to read when the creator of raspberrypi-spy.co.uk started the website.<p>Though it&#x27;s not a good look to happily leave them to it for so long before enforcing anything. I wonder if there was an initial informal approach that hasn&#x27;t been tweeted about or if this letter was the first they heard of it?<p>Edit: Minor typo fixes and tweaks to text.')
