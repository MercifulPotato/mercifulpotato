It seems from my personal experience, the longer the warranty the more questionable the quality, and the harder to get the warranty honored. And of course if the product is terrible, the company will go out of business leaving you high and dry anyway.<p>I mean, fwiw, I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience in many cases. And I&#x27;d hate for the outcome to be that companies are actually incentivized to offer shorter warranties so that customers believe they&#x27;re real.')
