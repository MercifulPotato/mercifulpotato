No corporation or lawmaker will grant you rights over corporate property, even if that property was obtained through questionable means and&#x2F;or your consent was never actually received. That&#x27;s why these data snooping agreements corporations force into their products reserve the right to do whatever they want with <i>your</i> data.<p>The obvious response to this is, &quot;Then don&#x27;t patron those companies,&quot; which is just as naive and oversimplified of a solution as the one above suggesting everyone everywhere should just use encryption (but for very different reasons).<p>There is just simply no logical reason to believe consumers would ever get data rights over corporations under capitalism with major reforms putting corporations back under our boots where they belong.')
