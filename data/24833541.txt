The standard password hashing methods and workflows are all well known and implemented.<p>Even if the local auth system was poor, an email&#x2F;password combo is simpler and faster without leaking data to social providers. There&#x27;s no reason to remember which provider you used, or login to them first, or worry about loose permissions especially with future changes. It also limits the blast radius in case your social account ever gets compromised, and it&#x27;s useful for completely anonymous and disposable accounts.')
