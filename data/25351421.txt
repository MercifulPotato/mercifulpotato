But really - this is just as nonsensical from the other side.<p>I wrote a ~200 page (digital) textbook on 3d Modeling using Word.<p>Word is incredibly customizable, I had hotkeys setup to do everything I wanted, figures and diagrams manages themselves rather well, and I was easily able to get into a state of flow using Word.<p>Now it took several days to get Word that customized, but having seen what it can do, I will not call it mediocre.<p>However hot Word tip of the century is, and has always been, put all images inside a text box, they&#x27;ll behave the way you expect then, and behave bizarrely otherwise.<p>Should be noted I wasn&#x27;t doing any typesetting or any such thing, just writing the document, I understand that beyond just writing, LaTeX is a far superior tool.')
