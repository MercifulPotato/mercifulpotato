I haven&#x27;t tried it out but Apple&#x27;s real-time head tracking plausibly provides the necessary DSP inputs to produce a spatial model that tracks as good or better than external speakers.<p>Apple&#x27;s spatial audio head tracking is unreliable at best. I can fool the system easily by rotating my head at a speed that is slower than a snap rotation, side to side.<p>Even when the tracking is working properly, it sounds like simulated surround sound from home theater receivers of 20 yr sago.')
