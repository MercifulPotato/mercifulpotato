Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605848833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157226, text='&gt; And for every developer who took the time to update their apps to modern libraries (and would not have done if not forced), how many just moved to a non-native framework like Electron instead?<p>Like the poster you&#x27;re replying to, I&#x27;ve been through all of Apple&#x27;s transitions from the 68K days to now. And in this context? I can&#x27;t honestly think of any apps like that. The Electron-based apps I know of <i>started</i> as Electron-based apps. Adobe and Microsoft have their own proprietary cross-platform toolkits, but they&#x27;re still ultimately building actual Windows or macOS apps; the Affinity apps are likewise native to their operating systems; many of the productivity programs I&#x27;m often in (Ulysses, Acorn, Drafts, Scrivener, BBEdit, Nova, MindNode, Safari) are actual genuine Mac apps.<p>I think the things here are that (a) it may be easier to port an &quot;old&quot; native Mac app to &quot;new&quot; native Mac frameworks than to completely rewrite the app; (b) Electron is relatively new compared even to the &quot;new&quot; Mac frameworks (Cocoa is nearly two decades old, older if you count NextStep!); (c) while Electron might be high-performance enough now to write a full-blown desktop publishing program in like the one the article poster (who is my former college roommate, it turns out, hi Franklin), it definitely didn&#x27;t start out that way; (d) a lot of folks are still not super thrilled with most Electron apps compared to native ones anyway. Yes, Visual Studio Code rocks, but it&#x27;s kind of the exception to the rule.<p>Personally, I also think Apple being more ruthless than Microsoft in deprecating old APIs is probably a good thing for the Mac platform in the long run. one of the programs I used to use more often, Dramatica Story Expert, has been tenaciously clinging to the trailing edge of technology for years: like me, it started on the Mac in the 68K days, and it has stubbornly missed every single transition, its developers doing the absolute bare minimum after the fact to get it quasi-working. This is an app which, in 2020, is not only still 32-bit, but <i>does not run at retina resolution</i> because they have been hacking their old codebase rather than moving to &quot;new&quot; -- i.e., from this century -- APIs for shit as basic as text rendering. Its text boxes don&#x27;t respond to OS X key shortcuts, it doesn&#x27;t support services, its fuzzy UI is in Lucida Grande. I look at its sorry ass and shudder to think what the state of Mac software would be like if Apple had gone out of their way to make it easy for developers to behave that way.')
