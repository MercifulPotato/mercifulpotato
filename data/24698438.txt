Asian Americans are 8cm shorter than White Americans, despite being about equally wealthy.<p>This means that Asians are, on average, genetically disadvantaged when it comes to performance in, for example, basketball - meaning they are less likely to produce a star basketball player, all else equal, because there are less extremely tall Asians as a percentage of the population.<p>If we can&#x27;t agree on this central claim then our differences are irreconcilable.<p>I understand that culture, nutrition, etc, makes a difference, and I don&#x27;t dispute that, my only claim is that the genetics of race is playing a causal role here.')
