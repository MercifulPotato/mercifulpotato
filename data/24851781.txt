YouTube isn&#x27;t free to run.  All that bandwidth, engineering work, and creator compensation don&#x27;t pay for themselves.  You either pay with ad views or you pay with cash.  YouTube doesn&#x27;t owe anyone a free experience.  They could lock the entire site behind a paywall to paid subscribers only tomorrow, and thus be exactly like Netflix, Disney+, HBO, etc., and they&#x27;d be entirely within their rights to do so.')
