Also, serverless and redis don&#x27;t really make sense together - these things I&#x27;m supposed to &quot;not care&quot; about are things that directly affect the design of the system. Redundancy, eviction strategy, etc. - things I need to plan for.<p>Redis shouldn&#x27;t grow infinitely. It should be memory bounded. Your code should expect evictions - in fact, almost every key in your redis cache should have an expiry.<p>Redis shouldn&#x27;t be used over the internet like this anyway - you want colocated (in-datacenter) instances for sub-millisecond latency, otherwise what&#x27;s the point?<p>RedisLabs IIRC also only offers encryption as an enterprise feature, which is something that has always left a bad taste in my mouth.')
