Crazy that Facebook would ban their personal accounts as well. I wonder if they have decided that the concept of &quot;sharing&quot; something is redundant with Facebook&#x27;s own features, so they decided to wipe it out. Shame on FB.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t know of many &quot;small businesses&quot; that can pull $52m in ad spend, even if it&#x27;s over 20 years ;)')
