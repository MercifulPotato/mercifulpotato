Often a mild common cold or a diarrhea will ameliorate within a few days.<p>It still feels stupid every time you get past that threshold and still aren&#x27;t quite healthy enough for work because the cold is just taking a bit longer this time, and you have to go see a doctor just to get the note.<p>Usually employers are paying for basic healthcare, so you wouldn&#x27;t be paying for the doctor&#x27;s visit yourself. But of course somebody&#x27;s still paying, and it is a bit of a waste in cases where medical attention would not be actually needed. But it&#x27;s not like you have to do that every time; you can compromise by trusting people for a couple of days before requiring that. It&#x27;s all about compromise.')
