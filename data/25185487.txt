Let&#x27;s say I have one BTC. You offer me 15k USD to buy it, I say no. You say, ok, what about 18k USDT (that you just printed)? I reconsider and say, yeah, ok. So you inflated the price ok, but <i>then</i> <i>what</i>?<p>I now have 18k USDT, but I can&#x27;t spend them on blackjack and hookers. In fact, I can buy nothing with the 18k USDT <i>except</i> crypto!<p>So I have two options:<p>* I keep the 18k USDT. But why should I do that?<p>* I buy back my BTC. But then somebody else has the problem of spending the 18k USDT! Where do they eventually end up? I dont get that part.')
