I live in EU and the bureaucracy in here, especially when it comes to international trade, is INSANE. Brussels is full of clerks and red tape and that&#x27;s what the entire continent looks like.<p>So I am looking at ways to setup shop outside of EU and avoid the trouble that EU brings. But I am not looking to move out just yet. So I wonder if there is a way to setup shop &quot;online&quot; somewhere outside of EU and be able to use payment gateways to legally receive payments form my users.<p>For example I know Bulgaria has 10% tax which would be nice. Gibraltar should have 0% but cost of setting up a business there is quite high per annum.')
