The whole thing was over in 10 minutes, the actual endoscopy was about 2 minutes of serious discomfort. I gagged a couple time, the rest of the time I held steady, but the nurses also complimented me for powering through so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s expected to be easy. It was a weird and humbling experience.<p>If you feel like you&#x27;re relaxed enough to be calm when someone does something to you that your body will tell you is going to kill you, then it&#x27;s not so bad. They sedate your throat to kill the gag reflex, but it doesn&#x27;t work 100%.<p>The upside for me was that it was over so quickly, and I could go on with my day, was allowed to drive, etc.')
