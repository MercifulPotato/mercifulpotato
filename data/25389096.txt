I remember seeing one Quadra in real life.  It was at my friend&#x27;s house -- his dad was composer for TV, and the Quadra was his main computer for that work.  He ended up getting a couple of Emmy nods.<p>We weren&#x27;t allowed to touch the computer or even get near it, and at the time that really pissed me off, but as an adult I totally get it now.')
