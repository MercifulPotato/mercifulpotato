E.g. IMO the NYT is the gold standard of journalism but a lot of their opinion pieces are not even fit to print.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s all of them, no matter what side they&#x27;re on or what point of view they&#x27;re advancing.<p>The premise to your statement is rather telling... why should a media outlet take a side or advance a point of view? It&#x27;s just not necessary or (IMO) acceptable for the main sources of information to do so. Here in New Zealand we&#x27;re blessed to still have trustworthy minimally biased media. Australian media sadly seems heavily Americanised.')
