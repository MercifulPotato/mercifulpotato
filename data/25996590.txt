Just silly stuff that has no real importance - and is orders of magnitudes less important than what you need to focus on.<p>Now imagine that your brain and body is fighting all it can, for you to continue with the trivial task, and blocking the important stuff. You almost go into a trance.<p>You might be able to detach from some trivial task for a minute or two, only to get sucked back in.<p>Because it&#x27;s such an invisible condition, it&#x27;s hard to really know how bad it is.
