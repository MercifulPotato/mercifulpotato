Photons hit particles, get absorbed, and re-emitted, which causes an effective slowdown at a larger scale. A gas is just vacuum with particles floating around in it. When photons travel between those particles, they are traveling at c. The effective slowdown is determined by the lattice&#x2F;gas, and we denote this slowdown with the refractive index...<p>This is wrong.
