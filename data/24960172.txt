Item(by='krick', descendants=None, kids=[24960304], score=None, time=1604245295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960082, text='Not sure about &quot;legal battles&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think it will be quite as it was. It was always wise to keep existence of youtube-dl sort of public secret, since our, ehm, data sources were never keen of it in the first place. Even promoting it on a large platforms like HN or reddit was pretty sketchy. But now basically everyone knows about it, user base is going to grow even more, which will be even more of a problem for sites like youtube. And, consequentially, there will be more pushback.<p>And, yeah, by the way: let&#x27;s not forget that it&#x27;s youtube and the likes of it who are actually the enemy of youtube-dl. All these RIAA notices and stuff are just tools.')
