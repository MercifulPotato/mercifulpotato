I do have facebook but on a computer no messenger app hate that one and no fb app. Same thing is with my friends and relatives.\nAs I know people now are back to live video calls. And they use not a messenger app to make a call.<p>This happend because of lockdown. Users cant meet new people and add them in a Friends list. No new friends no life. Facebook users cant fake a bit more &quot;happier&quot; &quot;better&quot; what they are doing to hang on Likes. Everyone doing the same &quot;nothing special&quot; and if selfie photo is good you sit or you stand near the tree. There are better places to post it and gather your Likes.\nBecause there is nothing about even to talk in comments about what who is doing in their photos :D everything is closed outside nothing to share so important or special. So Facebook users are moving to tiktok, instagram etc just to show the video or photos with a bunch of effects.<p>Effects are compensation in the brain of real life expressions. Facebook Likes and comments in the deep past worked the same.<p>What Facebook can improve to keep popularity atleast for a few months. Create more emojis. I cant find a snow emojis only snowflakes and it&#x27;s winter now outside. Sun emoji can be more improved someone has to redrow it. Coast emoji is missing. What else I can advice like a user of Facebook from 2007 - no new emojis on Facebook and I am moving elswhere.<p>The End of Facebook, mean&#x27;s The End of US Inteligence and marketing. For now all FB Users data are used from all around The World for intel, tracking peole and pushing marketing from US.<p>Bye Bye and good luck may god bless you.\nThere is a new movement World Wide - Facebook End Matter')
