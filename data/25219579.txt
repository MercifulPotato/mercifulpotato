It&#x27;s still ~$4K, for what sounds like stitches and local anesthesia (unsure, as the link does not seem to open the article for me, only gives a list of other NPR articles).  That&#x27;s over one month of pre-tax salary (edit: for the median US worker), which does not equate with the length, complexity or risk of the treatment.<p>So, what I am saying is that I fail to see what attempts at limiting the price has to do with the price being too high in the first place.')
