I like that you looked at how everyone else did something (i.e. ordering by time) and asked &quot;why?&quot;. Why not plot it in a more meaningful space? I have one idea -- what if node color was a function of time, and the x-axis was changed to effort? You start the node at one color, and progressively change it to another color using linear interpolation. When creating a TODO item:<p><pre><code>  1. Specify title.\n  2. Specify dueDate.\n  3. Capture startDate = now().\n</code></pre>\nThen<p><pre><code>  currentColor = lerp(now(), startDate, dueDate, initColorVector, finalColorVector)\n</code></pre>\nThis would add a third dimension of information. I&#x27;d be able to see impact&#x2F;effort as well as urgency visually. Another idea is to specify the shape (square, circle, triangle) to add some categorization capability. I&#x27;m not sure how much is too much. But the visual cortex is a beast.')
