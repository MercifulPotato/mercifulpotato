That&#x27;s wrong. The stimulant medication should be used as an adjunct to therapy, self-habit, and developing good self-control techniques. The initial motivational boost of a new stimulant prescription won&#x27;t last forever (concentration-enhancing effects do persist, though). However, good self-control habits will last a lifetime.<p>A (rather iffy) analogy is like a man trying to lift weights with very low testosterone. Going to the gym still helps, but it&#x27;s an uphill battle to put on muscle until the underlying issues are corrected. However, fixing testosterone alone won&#x27;t get you into great physical shape. You still need to put in the work to make the most of the corrected physiological condition.')
