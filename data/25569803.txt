They were already pretty well off (since they are the ones who can pay for this treatment in the first place.<p>2. Now they suddenly also have all the time they want and need.<p>3. They will now have generations to build alliances etc.<p>Within three generations no normal person has a chance anymore.<p>Also for many of those persons I guess it will become nightmarish after a while: the though of dying from a car crash at age 100 probably feels much worse if you are planning to live forever than if you know your lifespan is lifespan.')
