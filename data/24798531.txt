Have there been hiccups? Sure there have, sometimes I needed to go hunt for some odd driver or even go so far as to use ndiswrapper to use Windows drivers because the native drivers either sucked or did not exist. This is a long time ago though, nowadays Linux tends to have an edge over Windows when it comes to supporting a wide range of hardware out of the box. This might also be related to my tendency to use older hardware - I&#x27;m typing this on a Thinkpad T42p from 2004 - which would be close to useless with current Windows versions. The odd thing is that my ancient T42p is a more agile desktop machine than my wife&#x27;s 1yo Dell running Windows 10. The reason for this is... the Linux desktop. Let&#x27;s rephrase that, the reason for this is that Linux is very malleable when it comes to &#x27;the desktop&#x27;, you can mix and match parts from left and right to end up with something that works <i>for you</i>. In my case that turns out to be no desktop at all, relying on a keyboard-driven window manager (Xmonad) with a few utilities (dzen2, dmenu, conky and trayer), for others it might be Gnome-with-all-the-bells or some glitzy KDE incarnation or whatever Ubuntu pushes this year.<p>The Linux desktop is what you make it. The tools are there to make it work, choose wisely. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, try something else.')
