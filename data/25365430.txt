SCOTUS is not the venue for election disputes; state courts are. No one has ever before argued that state legislators can appoint electors in lieu of popular vote, and as some briefs have pointed out, several state statutes (including some of the states involved here!) <i>expressly forbid that</i>. No state has ever before tried to challenge the election procedures of another state. And the legal basis for doing all of this is itself without precedent.<p><i>This is not normal.</i>')
