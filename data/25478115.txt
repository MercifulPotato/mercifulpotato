I think GitHub and the proliferation of open source projects may have had something to do with that.<p>My memory is a bit fuzzy, but back in the late 1980s and most of 1990s, the README file was useful,and it was the first thing that I opened when I downloaded a software package. Then sometime in the 2000s, the corporate lawyers took over the README file and it just became a wall of CAPITALIZED legal text that contained zero useful information. I stopped opening the README files. Then sometime in the 2010s, the README files became useful again, and I started to read them again. Not exactly sure when that happened.')
