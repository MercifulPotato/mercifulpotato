For example, my dad was a pharma salesman -- salaried full-benefits position. He raised our entire family on that. He drove a lot. He never worked in an office. There was no &#x27;designated&#x27; spot to pee. The times I would go on the road with him, we always went to gas stations, or restaurants. It would be better to have an app honestly.<p>Certainly it is difficult to find public bathrooms in American cities. That is not a problem with gig work though. It affects a lot of occupations, many of them white collar.')
