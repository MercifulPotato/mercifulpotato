In the past year, I have managed a few things in Wordpress, wrote my own PHP, Flask and node sites; and after all that I would 100 % choose Flask or node over PHP.<p>Node has the advantage of same language back and front, &quot;asynchronous&quot; execution and having both dynamic typing and static typing with TypeScript. And huge ecosystem obviously helps as well.<p>Python also has pretty sizeable community and Django is probably a huge reason why a lot of people choose python over anything else. And the syntax, at least to me, feels much less cumbersome than PHP. But I have not tried PHP 8 at all.')
