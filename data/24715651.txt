My job is secure and my skills are in high demand. On the other hand, I have friends who are highly skilled artists (musicians and dancers) who are going through the worst depression in a lifetime. Many trained intensively since early childhood, managed to succeed in a career where very few make it, but now are considering leaving that career, because they need to eat. It&#x27;s beyond heartbreaking, and because of our general isolation right now I don&#x27;t see us doing much (us as both a society and through government) to support these people right now. Yes, things will <i>eventually</i> improve, but in the meantime we are going to lose a generation of talent.')
