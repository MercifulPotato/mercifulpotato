Just let the vulnerable die, they have it coming anyway? These are people, from all walks of life, not all of them &quot;vulnerable&quot;, and they might include yourself. If you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll walk away with a permanent heart condition. Or hey, maybe you need some other medical procedure, but guess what, doctors are busy treating the dying, also there&#x27;s no spare oxygen bottles for you. Geez. Time to stop reading the internet for today, I suppose.')
