They want people to not lose any living standard over something &quot;they can&#x27;t help&quot; like a divorce, and of course all animals are equal but some are more equal (kids and women). This money is not allowed to come from the state or justice system so it must come from the only source it can come from: whoever actually earns money.<p>So if you divorce, you should immediately become a total deadbeat, be broke and unemployed, ideally well on the way to homeless, by the time the trial happens. In contact with social services. Because men ALSO can&#x27;t lose living standard. You won&#x27;t get as much, because of course the justice system is sexist, but they&#x27;re forced to give you something. Obviously the justice system cannot prevent this from happening. They may respond by placing the kid in foster care.<p>The net result of these laws: whoever is willing to most seriously damage the kid will have a decisive advantage.')
