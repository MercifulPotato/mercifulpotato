But I don&#x27;t have to invoke QFT and EM to explain why:<p>1) He&#x27;s saying the light moves the electrons and the electrons set up a 2nd wave that interferes with the original to produce a lower frequency.  That&#x27;s simple enough.  But then he says the lower frequency wave travels slower.  Eh, what?  We are try to explain is why light travels slower?  Ergo, you can use &quot;because it travels slower&quot; in your explanation.<p>2) That said, the lower frequency does travel slower because light gets split into a spectrum by the glass prism.  To me it seems a satisfying answer would not only explain why it got slower, but why slowdown depends on frequency.')
