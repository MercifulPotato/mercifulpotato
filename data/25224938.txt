Love it.<p>It’s connected via Apple TV 4K, which I can easily upgrade whenever I want.<p>I have Lutron Caséta in-wall smart switches which communicate with their hub. Not a single delay or bug in 8 years. And they are intuitive for non-techies to use. It’s just a light switch.<p>I also have some Philips Hue for accent lighting. It frequently fails to respond.<p>I think HomeKit is better because it at least has to pass Apple’s certification process for some minimum bar of quality.<p>It’s also nice that all HomeKit stuff works through the ControlCentre app. You can 100% avoid ALL manufacturer-specific apps for daily use.')
