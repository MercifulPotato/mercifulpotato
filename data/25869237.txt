Item(by='rendaw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611299281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862451, text='Unsafe seems like Rust&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;checked exceptions&quot; - annoying and misdirected red tape. Pretty much all graphics code (ex: vulkan) is nearly 100% unsafe too.  The official docs for these libraries just say &quot;wrap everything in an unsafe block&quot;.<p>Is marking the apis unsafe going to make people choose an alternative? No. Does it prevent something bad from happening? No. Do users even know what unsafe means, other than that it sounds scary? No. If they did know, would it have imparted useful knowledge to them (that documentation wouldn&#x27;t have provided more specifically)? I don&#x27;t think so, for most users.')
