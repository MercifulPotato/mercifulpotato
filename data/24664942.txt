Item(by='hacknat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601660155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664556, text='&gt; The IRS is no longer receiving enough budget from Congress...<p>Why do you think that is? Probably because capital controls Congress pretty effectively (the Senate did vote for this past leveraged corporate bail out 96-4 after all). Anyway, I don&#x27;t disagree with you that the situation could be remedied, I was pointing to it as evidence that capital is very, very powerful right now.<p>&gt; Nonsense. We already have laws on the books that would allow an enthusiastic regulator to break up the power of capital. What you are describing is a continuation of the liberal surrender to big money, with the hope that some kind of socialism takes form to offset it.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that capital&#x27;s effects on the politics of this country cannot be dampened or curtailed to some degree, I&#x27;m arguing against the specific point made in the article that we can find meaningful ways to stop the <i></i>flow<i></i> of capital around the world.<p>&gt; Following the beaten path is much more likely to succeed.<p>What beaten path? If you&#x27;re referring to the post-War Great Compression[1], I would argue that that is a historical aberration and certainly not a well-beaten path. I don&#x27;t see either major political party in this country jumping at the chance to organize a political movement around labour right now, so what political coalition is fighting capital in this country right now? None, as far as I can tell.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Compression" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Compression</a>')
