And even if we could observe it, it&#x27;s possible that the effect is so tiny that we can still largely justify our single trip or shoe purchase in a way that we can&#x27;t justify raising an animal to adulthood in squalor just to feast on its muscles during a 20 minute meal.<p>There&#x27;s always a spectrum of trade-offs at play when it comes to ethics. Ants are my favorite animal but knowing I&#x27;m going to step on 20 of them on my way to enjoy a single beer at the bar doesn&#x27;t keep me home bound.<p>The question of ethics is surely to maximize the wellbeing of sentience and minimize suffering, so it&#x27;s inherently a curve of trade-offs in a finite universe. It&#x27;s hard to find a nihilist who really thinks that the optimal point on the curve is the elimination of all life.<p>So, barring that, we&#x27;re left with the impossible task of balancing impossible equations like whether a lifetime of flying home from Christmas produces more wellbeing in the world than suffering. However, some questions are much, much easier than others.')
