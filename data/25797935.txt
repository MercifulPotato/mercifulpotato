Item(by='beerandt', descendants=None, kids=[25798477], score=None, time=1610752789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797439, text='The NRA has expected it would be targeted (whether justly or not) for years.<p>Which is why must fundraising hasn&#x27;t gone directly to the NRA in probably 20 years, but to other, financially separate entities, like &quot;Friends of the NRA.&quot; The segregation isn&#x27;t arbitrary for legal purposes of <i>piercing the corporate veil</i> because these entities have more specific and specialized purposes, like safety training programs and responsible ownership initiatives.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the strategy will end up working. In fact, I suspect it&#x27;s made the NRA&#x27;s finances look even more suspect, since it&#x27;s basically designed to absorb liability without accumulating donations.<p>But even if they aren&#x27;t able to &quot;move&quot; to Texas, I expect there&#x27;s little direct extractable value from NRA proper, other than the bad PR of the continued investigation. Which of course, will also be used as a reason to send more donations and support.')
