They inflated their numbers with the &quot;3&#x2F;5 compromise&quot;. Even with that method of inflating their representation, 11 states with 66 House Representatives seceded, while 23 states with 173 House Representatives did not secede. It wasn&#x27;t <i>close</i> to half.<p>On top of which, the decision process for secession was (shockingly, I know!) not democratic in the least. The Union didn&#x27;t need a &quot;Home Guard&quot; to enforce conscription, but the South did.')
