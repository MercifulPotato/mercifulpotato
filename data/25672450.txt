However, a few quick takeaways:<p>* The microcopy matters, a lot. We had a button stating &quot;I&#x27;ve got a notification: read what you should do after getting a notification&quot; (from the top of my head and freely translated from Dutch, we didn&#x27;t have an English translation back then). This was part of a bunch of buttons on the main screen that all gave information. Some screen reader users got confused and thought that they had a notification. If you don&#x27;t see the visual layout, it is not obvious that this is just a plain button and not a bold text in red that is giving you a warning.\n* In the same category: the app has a status text that says &quot;The app is working fine&quot; or &quot;The app is <i>not</i> working fine&quot;. Visually, the error state is signified by an exclamation mark and styling that makes clear that this is a serious issue. However, in text there is just one word, not, to signify that there is a serious issue. Following WCAG, the info signified by the exclamation mark icon was available in text, so no text alternative was required. However, we gave it a text alternative anyway to ensure screen reader users were also clearly alerted that something is wrong. Same goes for the &quot;all is ok&quot; icon, we gave that one a text alternative as well to ensure users all is fine.')
