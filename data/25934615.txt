Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611784815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933027, text='&gt; Firefox exposes this stuff just fine: its context menu on videos has “View Video”, “Copy Video Location” and “Save Video As…”. (I thought that Chrome did too, but maybe my memory is faulty or maybe they removed it at some point.)<p>You&#x27;re right, I never noticed that. Although I just tried on youtube and the option are there... but greyed out. Not sure why.<p>As for the various formats, if the web wasn&#x27;t a javascript shitfest that would be exposed to the browser and it would decide what format it wants to use. That would help with all these websites with a crappy streaming implementation. That would also make downloading very easy, you could just select which format and bitrate you want.')
