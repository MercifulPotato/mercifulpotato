Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603231832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840678, text='&gt; Now put yourself in the Apple&#x27;s position where &quot;an iOS app&quot; or a &quot;mac App&quot; is about as trusted as a random website.<p>The mistake is in creating a category called &quot;iOS app&quot; or &quot;mac app&quot; and trying to fit every piece of third party code in the universe into that category.<p>What there should be is different categories of apps with different levels of trust. Then 95% of apps can go in the totally untrusted category because they don&#x27;t actually need any special privileges. Which then makes asking for a trusted privilege a red flag rather than something the user clicks through because they see it for every app they install.<p>&gt; Can you imagine if websites could control your firewall?<p>Realize that this has already happened. You wanted to block DNS to untrusted servers so everything would have to use your Pi-hole? Say hello to DoH. You could block AOL Instant Messenger by blocking port 5190, good luck doing that with Facebook.<p>The web made every protocol run over HTTPS to bypass your firewall, even if it has nothing to do with transferring hypertext.<p>Because that&#x27;s what happens when you do security wrong. It has to be usable or it gets routed around. People started blocking unknown ports by default, or blocking&#x2F;mangling protocols both of the endpoints didn&#x27;t want blocked or mangled, so firewalls got displaced.<p>You don&#x27;t actually want that to happen (again). You don&#x27;t want the only options to be living in a cage or rooting your device with some unaudited 0-day code you got from some Russian hackers. There is value in the existence of the middle ground.')
