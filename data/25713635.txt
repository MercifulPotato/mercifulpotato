On the last example (find max element in array) the following solution was generated:<p><pre><code>    function run(input) {\n        let output = []\n        for (let i0 in input) {\n            &#x2F;&#x2F; block\n            let n2 = input[i0];\n            let n1 = n2 - i0;\n            if(n1 &gt; i0) {\n                &#x2F;&#x2F; block\n                output[0] = n2;\n            }\n        }\n        return output\n    }\n\n    console.log(run([4,3,8,2,5,1]))\n    console.log(run([1,1,1,1,1,20,0,0]))\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; my counter example:\n    console.log(run([10, 9]))\n</code></pre>\nIt seems you still need to inspect the program to check if the program actually does what you expect it to do. This seems much harder to do with the generated code in the article.')
