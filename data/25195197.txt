When you plug the cable in, it doesn&#x27;t make a firm, snug fit, and jiggles around in place. If you press down on it it can even torque the connector right off the PCB.<p>I often have to design 3D printed housing to go around the USB plug housing to hold and lock the plug snugly in place, because the designers of both the USB ports and plugs are incompetent at designing something industrial grade that locks down firmly.<p>SCSI cables were fine, their ports were secured to the housing and they had nice screw locks so the cables wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere. Any cantilever forces were absorbed by metal casing, not PCB. Super reliable.')
