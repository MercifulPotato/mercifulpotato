Most C++ compilers _do_ compile headers if you tell them to.<p>C and C++ compilers will pre-compile <i>one</i> header if you ask nicely, the first one you include. Compiling multiple independent headers is very hard, though.<p>C and C++&#x27;s header time complexity hell is not an  “implementation detail”, every compiler has to suffer with it. The C preprocessor is a fundamental design problem.')
