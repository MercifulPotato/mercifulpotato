Item(by='muro', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1612113828, title='How to optimize a windows 10 install?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I was recently thinking about upgrading my workstation (xeon E5-1680v3, 32GB of RAM, 970 Evo), as it started to be somewhat slow under Windows 10. I&#x27;m happy with its performance under Linux, so before upgrading, I&#x27;d like to try and optimize its performance - maybe it&#x27;s a configuration issue, rather than slow hardware.\nI searched online for how to do that, but the advice I found is strange (e.g. microsoft says to use a USB drive for ready boost). I think i only start what I need to - Adobe creative suite and a bunch of drivers are all that&#x27;s listed in Startup Items. Yet when I run userbenchark, it tells me my hardware is way below median for my particular HW, e.g. my SSD is 8 percentile, so something seems very off (I have about 150GB&#x2F;2TB free and dual boot from the same drive)<p>How can I find the cause for the slower performance? Any tools or guides I can use?')
