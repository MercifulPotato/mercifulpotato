Between social distancing and masks, it&#x27;s obviously going to spread a lot less, there some risk to going to a clinic to get the shot, and we normally use data from the southern hemisphere to predict which strains will be dominant this season, but with significantly reduced travel and social restrictions in the southern hemisphere, the data&#x27;s going to be bad, so this year&#x27;s flu shot won&#x27;t be as effective.')
