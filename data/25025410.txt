Item(by='dTal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604839156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017824, text='1) Saying that police don&#x27;t kill blacks as often as blacks kill each other misleadingly overlooks the frequency of interactions, and sheer outnumbering of police by regular folk.<p>2) Police are in a profound position of power and responsibility which makes crime committed <i>by</i> them a <i>much</i> more serious problem.<p>By analogy - if children are having punch-ups in the schoolyard, that&#x27;s a problem. If the principal stops by occasionally and swings a punch or two, that&#x27;s a <i>real</i> problem, and probably the one that should be fixed first.')
