Item(by='inops', descendants=None, kids=[24818215], score=None, time=1603021794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24817106, text='I&#x27;ve not heard &quot;denial&quot;, a la Trump, from Johnson.<p>That&#x27;s the trade off every country is making: dangers of the virus Vs long term effects of response to the virus. It&#x27;s a balancing act. What would you prefer, wanton destruction of everyone&#x27;s livelihoods in overreaction? Not everyone is lucky enough to have a job that can be done from home, such as us on this site (typically). Every country is trying to avoid shuttering everything.<p>The quote from Johnson isn&#x27;t talking about what you&#x27;re inferring. It was a broad statement of what was going to happen (and it has, across the world): people will still die, in spite of the lockdown. It was a public address, not a policy statement.<p>It isn&#x27;t purely the economics: I&#x27;ve had friends and relatives that have had significant effects to their health (including a death) because of being locked in their houses for months.')
