I know in many office-based work environments, there is a strong preference for all <i>regular</i> (non-contract) employees to be full-time employees, but thatâ€™s not true in lots of industries, and there is nothing in AB5 that requires people working in conditions which it defines as employees rather than contractors to be full-time.')
