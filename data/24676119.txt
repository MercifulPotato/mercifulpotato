I should have been more specific with my original comment, I did intend cross validation and hyper parameter tuning as inclusing to the automatic feature I was describing.<p>These operations certainly are computationally expensive, a recent hyperparameter tuning operation locked up my laptop for 3 days but this seems to be the case for any similar operation. The only approaches I&#x27;ve come across so far to overcome it are things like converting the data to smaller sizes (which seems outside the scope of this tool) and some way to batch the data so that it can be &quot;paused&quot; and resumed as needed. Thank you again for creating Igel.')
