Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605571350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113164, text='&gt; There is zero need for a multinational between hungry people and food delivery. Inserting them raises costs, lowers service quality, and lowers revenue to restaurants.<p>Nonsense.<p>Everyone I live with went from not ordering any food to using UberEats weekly because it&#x27;s so much more pleasant than interfacing with every restaurant directly, having to carry cash to pay and tip, having on easy way to answer &quot;what&#x27;s open right now?&quot;, etc.<p>All these restaurants are getting money they would have never received from me had the app never existed. And everyone I know uses UberEats and will sheepishly admit they use it way too often.<p>You should talk to people who use UberEats before you assume it provides zero value to anyone, not sure what else to say. Maybe you can do the same for Uber as well.')
