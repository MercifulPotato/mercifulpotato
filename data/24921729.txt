For example, flexing a muscle and correlating the different skin&#x2F;motion&#x2F;stress sensors as feedback to the initial motion. Flexing a different muscle and experiencing the tactile sensations from your fingers. Making sense of the myriad of nervous system signals that travel through the spine at any given second.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of different inputs and outputs to organize and understand before the brain can even begin to make sense of the world outside the body. In that sense, yes, the brain needs sensory inputs to assert itself, but our traditional &quot;five senses&quot; are but a small subset of the sensory input the brain receives and must process.')
