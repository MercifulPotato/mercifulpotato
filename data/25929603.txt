As in, 95%+. So the bias, if there is any, at that EDU level, would be resting on such personnel, and the people that manage such notification systems. Thus, taken to its simplest premise, this article would become &quot;Busy men &amp; women complaining about other women who only wish to talk to women&quot;.<p>In my experiences with K and preK, i have not had this problem. What I did see was largely tech-driven:  The notifications sent to parent had 1 default, which was mom.  Once we requested to have me in the loop, it happened as requested, but mom missed all the updates (and i had to fwd). We requested both to be updated, but this could not be done.<p>System only had space for 1 phone number.<p>I suspect with COVID, a lot of these preconceived notions have been brought down. However, we should recognize that giving tech to people that never had to manage it, its going to lead to problems. Let&#x27;s be more patient and not assume bias to something that could very well lack of skill &#x2F; training.')
