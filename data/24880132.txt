This kind of weird to argue against, basically anything disagreeable in the Bible could be controverted then. It&#x27;s like saying there COULD be an 11th commandment or something of that nature. It makes the Bible not necessarily wrong but difficult to take seriously.</i><p>In traditional Christianity (not protestantism) the Bible is not the be all end all. Oral tradition, lived experience of the church community, the so-called prominent figures (&quot;fathers of the church&quot;), etc, mattered as much if not more.<p>It was protestantism (a kind of crude fundamentalist &quot;back to the basics&quot; movement not that different to muslim fundamendalism of today, which is in fact a distortion of the actual tradition which was never just about the Bible and only about what&#x27;s in the Bible&#x2F;NT) that makes the Bible&#x2F;New Testament the be-all&#x2F;end-all.')
