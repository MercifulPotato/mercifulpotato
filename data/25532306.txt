A lot of people make wide strokes for example or are unable to get the large head of the toothbrush in the corners of their teeth or use too much pressure...<p>That&#x27;s why I went with the reciprocating electric toothbrush over the vibrating kind. The reciprocating type has a smaller head that can reach more places, and it&#x27;s less dependent on correct usage than the vibrating kind.<p>Mine vibrates to let me know roughly how long to spend in each quadrant of my mouth and lights up red if I&#x27;m pushing too hard')
