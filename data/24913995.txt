Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[24922335], score=None, time=1603848355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910263, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re getting 5% back, then the item was almost certainly marked up more than 5%.<p>How though? The 5% back is not a rebate coming from the merchant, it&#x27;s coming from the card issuer. Don&#x27;t they (generally -- barring special agreements for specific cards) get the same amount of money regardless of what cards people use?')
