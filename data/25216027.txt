But I don&#x27;t trust most companies to securely hold my data, even if they don&#x27;t use it at all.<p>And besides, by the time a company uses the data in a privacy-destroying way, it&#x27;s too late.  The cat is out of the bag.  Sure, the law against use could serve as a deterrent, but companies will push the law past the breaking point all the time.  If you make possession trigger legal action, you can mop these things up before they get to use your data.  Sure, you still have the problem of finding out about that possession.  But also consider that if you have laws against possession <i>and</i> &quot;bad&quot; use, and a company does something, you can charge them for both things and hurt them more.  That&#x27;s a larger deterrent.')
