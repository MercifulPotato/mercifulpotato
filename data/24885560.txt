Input is broken and inconsistent, screenshots don&#x27;t work, remoting is broken, every WM has to be rewritten or abandoned, trivialities like c&amp;p handling are not yet there. Wayland is still in the early phase of catching up to X11, for any progress it will take another decade or maybe even a Wayland replacement. We should face it, Wayland is a dead end.')
