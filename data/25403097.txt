To read all the haters and cynicism here that he gets in response - a lesser man like myself would just say screw it and walk away.<p>Like his critics here are terribly accomplished people. Paul Graham is a expert with a proven track record and some multiple of billions of &quot;market votes&quot; behind him. But the armchair critics on HN know better. I expect that on YouTube comments, I have higher expectations here.<p>Whatever his motivations, I enjoy his essays and find them thought provoking. I just hope the peanut gallery here and elsewhere doesn&#x27;t discourage him.')
