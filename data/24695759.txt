For example, could we adjust our sampling pattern based on depth information?</i><p>If we had access to the internals, we could determine the visual salience of every object[1] and move the sampling pattern closer to the most salient one. Since that object is more likely to attract the viewer&#x27;s attention, it would focus the rendering on those parts of the scene that the viewer actually cares about.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doras.dcu.ie&#x2F;16232&#x2F;1&#x2F;A_False_Colouring_Real_Time_Visual_Saliency_Algorithm_for_Reference_Resolution_in_Simulated_3-D_Environments.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doras.dcu.ie&#x2F;16232&#x2F;1&#x2F;A_False_Colouring_Real_Time_Visu...</a>')
