It should be completely reasonable to expect a single person to be able to manage the hosts, including the networking for the hosts, the backups of the guest images by the hosts, etc. The services themselves may be arbitrarily complicated and require a large number of people to configure and manage, but that&#x27;s the same as it is with cloud providers.<p>There is also a simple way to handle guest OS updates in most cases. Turn on automatic updates, and keep automated VM snapshots in case one goes bad.')
