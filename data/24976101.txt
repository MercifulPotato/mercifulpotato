When I filtered for &quot;yellow&quot; most of the belts were, indeed bright yellow. (Seriously, Walmart sells a <i>lot</i> of bright yellow men&#x27;s belts.) Except, of course, for the ones that were black or brown.<p>And if you search for &quot;t-shirts&quot; and filter by fabrics, Walmart thinks reasonable t-shirt fabrics include acrylic, canvas, chiffon, corduroy, down and vinyl.<p>So, retailers don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s in their inventory, because they don&#x27;t know what &quot;yellow&quot; means or what a t-shirt is made of.<p>3. they have too much data<p>You point out, &quot;they act on assumption that a person is fixed and cannot change or want to change.&quot; I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re studying the data longitudinally.<p>The trouble is that they&#x27;re hoping that magic algorithms can somehow purify petabytes of raw sewage into a clear description of consumer behavior. That&#x27;s led them to invest in these big data money sinks.<p>And it&#x27;s not just a sunk cost fallacy at work, I think they do get some apparent financial returns from the weird and inexplicable inferences those algorithms generate.<p>So they keep going down this rabbit hole while consumers, regulators and advertisers are steadily getting fed up with them.')
