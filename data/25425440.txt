Item(by='tinco', descendants=None, kids=[25427989], score=None, time=1607992307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419549, text='&gt; Then they donâ€™t sell them because they know other people will want them in the future.<p>This artificially inflating demand for the item, with a very long delay or even obfuscated feedback.<p>I agree that the value store is a (the only) viable use case for BTC.
