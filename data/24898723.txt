Identify it from a combination of the car&#x27;s Bluetooth MAC address and a machine learning model trained on the audio spectrum of the engine noise). Look at where all cars of different types are able to travel, where they make U-turns and turn around, and at what GPS locations they make calls to roadside assistance numbers. Incorporate weather data as well, e.g. what season, and whether it has rained lately. Between all of that data you should be able to advise whether a given vehicle should be able to traverse a given road on a given day of the year.')
