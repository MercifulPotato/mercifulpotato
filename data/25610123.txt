It serves no useful purpose to society to subject most criminals to prison<p>The purpose of prison is not reform. It&#x27;s not even punishment or deterrence. The purpose of prison in the US is:<p>1) First and foremost it is a profit center. Caging human beings is a multi billion dollar business in the US.<p>2) A storage facility for political dissidents and out groups. We just make up laws to target certain groups we don&#x27;t like, and use that as pretext to lock them away (you know, that pesky first amendment always getting in the way).<p>3) To reify the carve out in the 13th Amendment which states:<p>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, <i>except as a punishment for crime</i> whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.<p>Gotta keep slavery alive and well in the USA.')
