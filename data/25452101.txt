Lots of simulation, lots of practical prototyping, lots of test rig time. We spent so, so many hours in test chambers observing how a particular engine type behaved with incremental changes to its design, changes which were backed up by simulation. The resulting data was used to strengthen the simulation and we repeated this loop many times. The challenge with this is that there are seemingly infinite different parameters to observe and control in each loop in both the physical and simulated engines, which must be done with high fidelity to learn things.<p>My understanding of thermodynamics was routinely humbled by my coworkers. I remember one time rolling into the office in the morning to find my coworker twirling with excitement and saying something like &quot;I had a realization at 3AM and came to the office and figured out my enthalpy problem!&quot;<p>Working with your buddies to create a working engine from scratch that is unlike any engine that has ever been created before it is a real rush. I recommend it for anyone.<p>Here&#x27;s a slo-mo video of combustion inside an LP engine. We bolted a thick piece of quartz onto the engine instead of one of the side pieces. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;111796558" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;111796558</a>')
