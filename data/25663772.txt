The market settled on an equilibrium of baseline operational knowledge + filtering through standardized testing, and then advanced operational knowledge acquired through voluntary higher education and on the job. And it continued to optimize accordingly. The only thing that makes people try to teach beyond this minimum is humanistic values, belief in importance of education. <i>Against it works the entire economy</i>, forcing individual teachers and schools alike to find savings, &quot;cut out fat&quot;, make lean.<p>Free market is enough to explain the disaster education is becoming worldwide (because it&#x27;s not just an US phenomenon; we start to see the same problems over here in Europe).')
