It was one guy saying &quot;A bunch of us have had enough&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;ve just about had it&quot; and basically pretending that the community was against RMS. And there wasn&#x27;t anything hateful about what RMS said, neither was he expressing pro-pedo sentiments, which was implied by Wingo.<p>I am upset that someone tried to ruin RMS&#x27; character with false rumors. Expressing my own &quot;hateful ideology&quot; is a little far fetched, given that I don&#x27;t approve of trying to tarnish RMS&#x27; reputation for something he didn&#x27;t do, and I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s hateful about that.
