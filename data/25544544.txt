Very often, these error messages can be traced to a generic error message if you look in the MSDN docs. Helped me solve quite some annoying Windows issues back in the day.<p>Since Microsoft went the UWP route, these nice error codes have been starting to vanish. Probably because when end users see an error they don&#x27;t understand, their mind goes blank and their instinct is to click whatever button that makes the error go away, leading to confusion. A simple &quot;try again later&quot; will be a much more enjoyable experience for non-technical people than &quot;Could not update your computer. The foobar failed to parse the widget tree (0xc0000005). Try again later.&quot;<p>When I did customer service, this trend had always irked me about Apple devices. I&#x27;ve had to tell a lot of people to contact Apple (which they never did of course, silently blaming us for their device not working) because all Apple&#x27;s software said was &quot;try again later&quot;.<p>And now it&#x27;s spreading to other devices as well. Even if error codes are available, the error messages have been simplified and most error codes aren&#x27;t documented. I wish there was some kind of generic standard shortcut or gesture that copied the stack trace of any fancy exception to your clipboard so people with technical know-how can actually solve the problem instead of getting told to &quot;try to reboot my router&quot; by a vague, generic help page when Netflix can&#x27;t find a video stream that matches my video decoding hardware.')
