To be honest, there&#x27;s enough people beating on the right that I&#x27;m sure they will end up abandoning what&#x27;s made them unpopular. They may even split, who knows.<p>I end up focusing on the left because right now, no one is paying attention to the fact that there&#x27;s a back and forth war going on here between <i>extremists</i> that is cultural in nature. I happen to be closer to the left in politics, though I don&#x27;t ascribe to the culture. Who fights this war online is the idealogues, who fights it in the streets are normal people. It&#x27;s disconcerting.<p>It&#x27;s tiring to see, hence I even bother to say anything about it. That said, my energy is just about up. If this country wants to tear each other apart, have at it.')
