Even now on 18.04 the package version of thunderbird is version 68.<p>18.04 is a LTS release and it only contains ESR releases of Firefox and Thunderbird. Like Debian Stable.<p>Even Debian has Firefox 82 and Thunderbird 78 nowadays. They&#x27;re intentionally kept at the unstable channel because they&#x27;re updated a lot. Stable gets the ESR releases but, unstable gets the latest releases in 48 hours max.<p>&gt; The version of Firefox provided by apt lags behind for security releases.<p>Firefox has a <i>Debian Exception</i> which allows Debian to merge its well-tested security patches &amp; hardening, and still publish it as Firefox with the original version number. This causes the 24-48 hour delays unless a patch breaks something. Even if it breaks something, you get the latest version at most a week later.<p>I won&#x27;t even argue about the harms&#x2F;disadvantages of Snaps and the forcing of them upon users by Canonical...<p>This comment is submitted with Firefox 82.0.2-1 obtained via official Debian repositories.')
