But me? Nope. It&#x27;s a chore every single time. Never gets easier; I just get better at dealing with the physical stress of it. Same pain and same exhaustion every time; none of that reported &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot; or &quot;feeling of euphoria&quot; other people seem to experience, and no particular change in mood week-to-week. The pain curve is flatter the more I do it (so I can go for longer periods of time before will gives out and I give a hearty &quot;fuuuuuck THIS&quot; to further running that day), but I still feel like crap every time I finish. I keep telling myself &quot;It&#x27;s not about feeling good; it&#x27;s about being better.&quot;<p>The pain won&#x27;t stop me, but it means it doesn&#x27;t come for free.')
