Which avoids the need for a separate syscall that needs to copy memory into the userspace buffers. That can be noticable.<p>It should also, at some point, allow for nice zero copy network receive paths under the right circumstances (i.e. the network card DMAing directly into the userspace buffers, without very weird setup&#x2F;high op overhead).')
