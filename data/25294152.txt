Moreover, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that while markets don&#x27;t conform to any form of EMH, they often trend towards efficiency over time.<p>This is easy to see in the massive consolidation in the market making space in traditional finance over the last decade and also you can watch it in real-time right now in the crypto space. Even two years ago, it was pretty trivial to be successful as a market maker using quite naive models and a system glued together in Python in a couple days. Today, things have gotten <i>significantly</i> more competitive: many single man operations have become uncompetitive and even larger (3-10 man) and more sophisticated firms are feeling the heat from behemoths like Susquehanna, Jane St, and Jump Trading.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how you can feel the crypto market getting more efficient in front or your eyes. It&#x27;s like running on a treadmill, and you&#x27;re always terrified it will start going faster than you and your team can run.')
