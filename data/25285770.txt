LeCunn calmly and rationally explained that a particular model produced biased results, and that that this was due to the bias in its training data. He was then excoriated as a racist by this woman and the Twitter mobs she incited, to the point where this Turing Award winner is no longer willing to engage with the public via that medium.<p>LeCunn made repeated attempts to explain his position, only to be virtually shouted over about he wasnâ€™t listening to people of color because he pointed out that a model trained on White people learned to produce images of White people, and that if it had been trained on Black people it would produce images of Black people. It was a research paper, not a production system, and Gebru and her acolytes were much more interested in scoring cheap points than in having a serious conversation about either ML fairness or the merits of this particular paper.<p>Seriously, the primary sources can be read by anyone.')
