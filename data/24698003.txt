It&#x27;s fundamentally different from MD5 in structure, so you shouldn&#x27;t extrapolate a few years&#x27; worth of minor weaknesses to forecast major weaknesses in the near future.<p>The website you&#x27;ve linked is citing legitimate cryptanalytic papers, but it loses credibility by interpreting systems with minor weaknesses as &quot;not considered strong.&quot; Minor weaknesses are exhibited in all cryptosystems older than a few years. Can you find me a professional cryptographer who will say SHA-2 is not strong? Because I can&#x27;t think of any. The authors of these cryptanalytic papers would probably choose it for new projects without being nervous.<p>It&#x27;s an attractive idea that cryptographic algorithms will trend towards insecurity over time. But that&#x27;s a very oversimplified look at how they work, and it&#x27;s not a reliable prediction over a period &lt;20 years. We are almost certainly <i>several</i> deep research breakthroughs away from a meaningful break in SHA-2.<p>But I&#x27;m just some guy on the internet. If you don&#x27;t trust my opinion on this, here is the opinion of one of the BLAKE authors, a finalist in the SHA-3 competition: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;veorq&#x2F;status&#x2F;834872988445065218" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;veorq&#x2F;status&#x2F;834872988445065218</a>')
