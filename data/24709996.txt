Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602088837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707994, text='&gt;  Itâ€™s flattering to receive a direct message from a co-founder, it also gives the impression of commitment from the very roots of the company.<p>Really? Most people don&#x27;t realize that the email can be configured to appear to be from anyone and the co-founder was not actually personally involved in sending it to you? Or is the suggestion it has a psychological effect despite knowing it&#x27;s kind of artificial? Could be. Always just strikes me as kind of fake and manipulative, but i may not be typical.<p>Now, if I replied, and got a personalized response from the co-founder, that might see like flattering commitment. Until&#x2F;unless I found out it wasn&#x27;t from the cofounder at all , just someone signing their name.')
