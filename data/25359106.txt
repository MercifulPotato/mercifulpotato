Certainly most extended memory DOS games and early Windows programs could be argued to lie in this range, but I&#x27;m asking what would we build in this scale using modern tools for contemporary applications?<p>For example a GUI program in the 50Kb - 500Kb scale would probably be written in C&#x2F;C++ and use #defines for Windows message constants.  A program in the 10Mb - 100Mb scale might be written in Java or C# and include a 10&#x27;s to 100&#x27;s of megabyte runtime framework.  (I&#x27;m including the framework, not just the user code, in the scale here.)  What about the scale from 500Kb - 10Mb?  I could imagine a program, still written in C&#x2F;C++, using Sqlite (which didn&#x27;t exist 21 years ago) to define its Windows message constants.')
