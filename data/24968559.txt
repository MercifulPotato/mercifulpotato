Which, if it had been true, would have been really bad news, although I suppose it would also have meant there was no reason to wait for a vaccine, because if even the actual virus itself doesn&#x27;t teach your immune system to look out for it, then there&#x27;s no way a vaccine could.<p>But, it&#x27;s good scientific&#x2F;medical work to verify that it works like most other viruses, and people who have recovered, are at least almost always going to be resistant thereafter (for at least six months, because that&#x27;s all the time that has passed yet, although evidence from SARS suggests 10 years or more).')
