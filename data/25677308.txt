GPLv3 adds the requirement that code for derived works not only be released, but that someone should be able to build their own modifications on that platform for free, won&#x27;t work with the way the the iOS developer agreement works ($99 a year.)<p>And it wasn&#x27;t worth the complexity of having different software for each of their OS&#x27;s, so they just banned all GPLv3 software from the OS.<p>Apple&#x27;s use of open source could have totally worked with &quot;copyleft&quot;, but only the GPLv2 usage of the word.  GPLv3, not so much.')
