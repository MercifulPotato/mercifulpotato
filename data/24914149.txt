If I think &quot;functional&quot; I want to think more abstractly in terms of categories, functors, functions.<p>The Lisp code in this book is truly not doing anything for me. Seems like a kind of direct numerical computation&#x2F;translation. I actually think it would be better to do it in Haskell which seems like it would at least let you identify some more generic structures (oh we can actually implement this idea x as a functor&#x2F;monad blah blah).')
