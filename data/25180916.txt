So the main source  Ayurvedic texts that were centuries old didn’t address that particular combination of symptoms. Or have a name for it.<p>But we had to start somewhere. So we did a codification of the known symptoms and worked <i>backwards</i>. The goal is to eliminate suffering and take the whole person. That was one of my favorite sessions because we could hack our way to a cure and in a systematic way that was replicable.<p>Otoh, homeopathy had a protocol for CF mostly because it treats the symptoms one by one and considers the patient as a whole..and not a carrier of one particular disease symptom. Also Homeopathy is relatively new and was discovered by a German physician, Samuel Hahnemann. Personally, I prefer reading homeopathy to Ayurveda because I kept stumbling due to my lack of proficiency w&#x2F;Sanskrit language. And so I started studying Sanskrit and never did go back to studying Ayurveda in a legit way. But I never forgot the CF discussions. Thanks for your posts and esp the ones educating re CF.')
