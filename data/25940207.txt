Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611829287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914251, text='My biggest bugbear with these multi-modals is that much of the time the buttons that turn consent on or off <i>are not labelled</i>. You&#x27;re supposed to guess from their colour and default position what is on and what is off, so when I make a choice I never know for sure how the website interpreted my choice.<p>Some have an &quot;accept all&quot; button that could perhaps reveal which is &quot;on&quot; and which is &quot;off&quot;, since when you press it all the buttons go to &quot;on&quot;. But this happens so quickly and the modal is closed immediately afterwards, that there&#x27;s no time to tell. And of course by then you&#x27;ve already accepted so it doesn&#x27;t matter.')
