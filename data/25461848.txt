You can call or email them (which is now my preference).<p>In addition to some obvious things like finding a hotel or calling a car rental agency on my behalf (being able to send a quick email is significantly more convenient than waiting on hold for an hour) they&#x27;ve...<p>1. Helped me find an air conditioner along my driving route in CA when they were mostly all sold out. This took place over 48 hours. They would give me updates every 6 hours either via email, phone, or both.<p>2. Called several bike repair shops with information that was important to me â€” turnaround time, walking distance, price, etc...<p>3. Researched comparative information on model years of a car I was thinking about buying. E.g. 2017 adds these features, 2018 has these changes from 2017, etc...<p>4. I&#x27;ve called them to see if there are any road closures or issues with my route while driving.<p>As mentioned below, the card is really $250 a year or roughly $20&#x2F;month and is it worth it for this benefit alone. I&#x27;ve used Magic ($35&#x2F;hr...) and Fancy Hands and I&#x27;ve actually found the service to be superior. And I don&#x27;t have to worry about the amount of time they spend.<p>From what I can tell they have what seems to be employed professionals who answer the phone (and maybe the initial emails) who are very personable and knowledgeable and then farm out a lot of the actual grunt work to different researchers. While the quality I&#x27;ve gotten from Fancy Hands &#x2F; Magic has been much lower in terms of actually understanding what I&#x27;m asking for. Seems to be more college students &#x2F; gig workers.<p>That&#x27;s separate from the very good car rental insurance... DashPass (no delivery fees, reduced fees), 10X Lyft points. And things like extended purchase and warranty protection which I haven&#x27;t used yet.')
