The entire body is poisoned, and the cancer cells are more susceptible, for various reasons (weakness during cell division, which they do far more frequently than healthy cells, among other reasons). Hair loss, skin&#x2F;nail problems, digestive tract problems, etc. These are all fast-growing cells. It&#x27;s almost impossible to target cancer cells and not affect normal cells, because cancer cells aren&#x27;t all that special.')
