Literally every tx is on the chain. Sure, they can obfuscate and make tracing more difficult, but the data is still there to be analyzed. At some point the user will likely try to receive the crptyo and cash out at an exchange, or purchase goods and services through a regulated entity like paypal. That&#x27;s where the gov can scrutinize and take action, which is why KYC is in place at Coinbase and other US exchanges.<p>To curb nefarious use across borders, seems like the problem may be that more exchanges need KYC laws across the globe, not just in USA, and there would need to be some interpol-like oversight.<p>A globally public ledger seems like a tool, not a hindrance, against &quot;Black Money&quot;. We just need more global cooperation and oversight between governments tracking the exchanges.')
