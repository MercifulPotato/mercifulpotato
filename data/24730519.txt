Such burgers <i>do</i> exist, and I thought you were talking about those.<p>For sure, efficiency is part of &quot;working&quot;.

But I think when taking a step back to answer the binary question &quot;does government work?&quot; our baseline has to be against <i>governments which dont</i> (rather than some minor local inefficiency).<p>Governments which don&#x27;t work produce civil wars, mafias, mob patronage structures, impoverished citizens, etc.<p>It is those governments we shouldn&#x27;t trust, rather than a somewhat incompetent western bureaucracy which should mostly get the benefit of the doubt towards &quot;working&quot;.')
