The standard debugging built into firefox and chromium is amazing compared to what you had with QBasic or the Spectrum 48k.<p>You&#x27;ve also got a realm of information on the internet available on how to start. If you do want to download something like Atom or VSCode it&#x27;s three clicks away (literally you type &quot;vscode&quot; into ddg, click the first link, then click the deb)<p>If you want to program something even simpler from entirely in your browser you can pop over to Scratch or Purple Mash and build a game from the browser.')
