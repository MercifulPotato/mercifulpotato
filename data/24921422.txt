This might not be realized but there&#x27;s no good argument that proves it to be impossible.<p>There are fields where physical limits were already reached, for example rocket engines specific impulse has barely improved since the 60s because of fundamental chemistry, but this is not the case for tunnels.<p>Provided enough funding it should be possible to dig faster, and cheaper per km.')
