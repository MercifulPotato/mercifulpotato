Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=[25634788, 25632061], score=None, time=1609771113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631464, text='The argument against is that HTML <i>qua</i> HTML is not a programming language, and that it is reasonable in English to say that &quot;0 lines of code&quot; implies the use of something that <i>could</i> have code in it, not something that degenerately contains no code because it is incapable of having any code at all. A text file with &quot;Hello World&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be a solution either, nor the minimal CSV document with &quot;Hello World&quot;, nor a PNG showing &quot;Hello World&quot;, etc. These may also have &quot;zero lines of code&quot; in that strict, pedantic sense, but that makes them uninteresting.<p>The argument for including it even so is that if you think of the underlying challenge as &quot;fooling sloc&quot; and that the original challenge phrased it in terms of &quot;code&quot; simply because sloc <i>mostly</i> deals with code, but as it happens, it also tries to count HTML even though it isn&#x27;t (necessarily) code, then it&#x27;s reasonable to include.<p>I have to qualify HTML <i>qua</i> HTML because once you include Javascript, it goes from trivially not code to trivially being code, or at least capable of carrying code.<p>But it is important not to blur the lines between a document format and code. There are real and important differences. HTML <i>qua</i> HTML is not a programming language.<p>Edit: Oh, the solution to the other debate going on is that programming languages <i>ALWAYS</i> execute in the context of a virtual machine of some sort, or in the case of assembly, a real machine (at least in potential). The distinguishing characteristics of a programming language is something along the lines of being at least one of &quot;Turing complete&quot; and &quot;able to read input, change behavior based on it, and write output&quot;, although I&#x27;m not getting too far down the weeds on that one on purpose. You can&#x27;t use &quot;whether or not they need a specialized execution environment to function&quot; as a distinction for whether or not something is a programming language, because they all do.')
