No internet or app is needed. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;callsredirect.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;callsredirect.com</a> )<p>The challenges I faced while trying to reach my goal pushed me to wear many hats. I went from network engineer to web developer, from cloud engineer to devops engineer. I even had to do marketing and everything else you can imagine (in the context of IT of course).<p>I didn&#x27;t have to go expert mode into each field as my goal was just to learn what I needed to build my service. However, I learned so much more than what I anticipated when starting this project.<p>I still have a long way to go to take my service where I would love it to be, but I already feel like I gained so much just by starting it.<p>Some stuffs I learned:<p>The best documentation is the source code\nTo go far, go together (yeah I need a team)\nThe customer doesn&#x27;t care about nothing but the actual service')
