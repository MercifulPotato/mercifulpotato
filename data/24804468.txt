And although people think that their brains are different and have some special type of rationalism supporting their belief systems, that&#x27;s not the case.<p>I think that the reality is that worldviews are necessarily reductionist at some point.  Think about just literally looking down a road far into the distance.  If you can see far enough the stuff at the end of that road just looks like a tiny dot which you can&#x27;t make out.<p>No one can actually predict the future.  Some people like me think that technology will probably shortly change things dramatically.<p>I would be interested to hear your worldview and predictions for 2029 and the 2030s.  But just a warning, I am going to classify those predictions as beliefs.')
