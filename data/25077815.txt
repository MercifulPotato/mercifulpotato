Sit in front of their computers all day.  Know their processes inside-out.<p>B - Perhaps not formally trained, but working with data, Bloomberg extracts, a self-taught sense in normalising data.<p>C - If there&#x27;s an Excel function that saves time, they know it.  This also leads to trader-as-a-developer with personal VBA scripts as that&#x27;s good enough and there&#x27;s an IDE in Excel that doesn&#x27;t need layers of approval to use (which is obviously a disaster) - this also means thinking &quot;If I can do this in Excel in a day, why does it need a development team of 5 to do in a month?&quot;<p>D - Fast turn-around.  That means keeping on top of messages, dates, calendar.  And a sense of prioritising this without needing a system to do it.  And messages pumped through mail, phone, BBM, conversations all tied together.<p>E - Don&#x27;t want to be Nick Leeson and have a grudging acceptance that compliance and audit is a thing.<p>F - Except when they don&#x27;t.<p>Contrast that to typical clerical roles where these things are somewhat &#x27;slower paced&#x27; and doing things with Excel&#x2F;following-up emails becomes a disaster - not in all cases, but in many.<p>All BAs I know in banking&#x2F;finance are exceptional communicators that get through points A-F above.')
