How do you go about finding a good server? How do you know if you picked a good one? Which app do you use? Matrix would be more popular if the getting started flow was more clear on these sorts of questions. The decentralization is a major benefit, but some sort of “pick these if you don’t know what’s going on” flow would get peoples foot in the door; then a user could change things up later when they got their footing (add a pop up every 6 months reminding users that they can use different apps or servers, etc)')
