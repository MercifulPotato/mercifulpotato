(To continue the parallel from &#x2F;u&#x2F;hinkleys comment, lights-out management is useful even though the server still can&#x27;t swap a broken disk itself)<p>Seeing that now with Covid at customer sites: only 1-2 people from a larger group in the office, who if needed can go poke devices, while the majority works remotely (which often includes contractors that otherwise would be in hotels etc). Generally not optimal, since many don&#x27;t have the amount of automation one would prefer, but workable and with room for improvement.')
