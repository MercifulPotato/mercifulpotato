Obviously if you can achieve that things would probably improve quickly but getting there is the entire challenge, if it is even possible without an adequate surplus. It&#x27;s tautologically the case that in a society primed to implement technology well that technology will be implemented well.<p>It is more likely that you can get to such a world through the haphazard implementation of tech giving way to rights than the reverse that is outlined here. We&#x27;ve only started to get to democratic systems because the surplus became so large it could no longer be effectively captured in its entirety. We have some data on tech giving rise to higher living standards by accident, and a healthy dose of examples of revolutions just churning out new exploiters that take the place of the old ones.')
