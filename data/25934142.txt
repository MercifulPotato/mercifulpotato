I imagine I have a bit of an edge when it comes to UI and UX design, and knowing the fundamentals of various languages also adds a lot of value at work when it comes to collaborating with technical staff.<p>I&#x27;d recommend branching out a bit at home and finding something that tests you (mentally or physically) in a completely different way to your day-to-day responsibilities. If you&#x27;re lucky you might find a hobby that is different enough to your day job to be engaging and fun but also have just enough overlap to benefit you professionally.')
