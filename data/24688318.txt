RT-PCR tests do not tell, in absence of symptoms, if you are infectious. If you have symptoms, the presence of a positive test correlates with actual, infectious virus in your throat until 7 days with milder symptoms and 15 days with more severe symptoms.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cebm.net&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;infectious-positive-pcr-test-result-covid-19&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cebm.net&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;infectious-positive-pcr-test-r...</a><p>Also bear in mind, in particular for your daughter, that viral RNA takes <i>a lot</i> to clear, even when her immune system has already defeated the virus (IOW: you&#x27;re seeing the &quot;debris after the battle&quot; and not the virus): the milder the symptoms, the longer it takes to clear.<p>tl;dr: Your daughter should be fine at this point, in general terms.<p>Of course, as an obligatory disclaimer, IAAS (I am a scientist), IANAMD, this is not medical advice, etc etc.')
