I can pick a number of examples of languages that have no international standard and a single implementation and are used in systems that might be in use for decades. Let&#x27;s take go. A single implementation, it does have a spec, but I&#x27;m not aware of an ISO standard. ADA, while having an ISO standard, isn&#x27;t exactly blessed with many implementations either. Java, while having multiple implementations, is not an ISO standard.<p>The point is: neither of those two datapoints is a particularly useful metric on how &quot;serious&quot; a programming language is and much less even a useful metric on how well it is suited to any given task. Even how mainstream programming languages are is not a useful signal for that. Javascript is very much mainstream, but I hope no one ever will want to program a cars ECU in a JS dialect. Specialized applications are almost by definition the realm of specialized languages.')
