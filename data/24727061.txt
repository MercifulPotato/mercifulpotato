It was an interesting idea but way too difficult to use for anything that would justify the cost. In practice, the FPGAs seemed to mostly be used to run crypto algorithms and codecs, which seems kind of disappointing. I vaguely recall some attempts at building ticker plants with them but I donâ€™t know that it was ever actually used for that.')
