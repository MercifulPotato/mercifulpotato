Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24684649], score=None, time=1601865159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683731, text='The problem with blanket figures like this is that you&#x27;re not dealing with a homogeneous landscape. Are we only doing this for the people who actually need the assistance? Aren&#x27;t you then punishing landlords who rent to lower income people and financially vulnerable populations? What are the long-term effects of that policy expectation going to be?<p>Suppose there are two people, one who pays $1000&#x2F;month in rent and $1000&#x2F;month in utilities, another who pays $2000&#x2F;month in rent for an equivalent unit with utilities included. Does it make sense for one of them to get 25% of $1000 and the other to get 25% of $2000? What about someone who rents a less expensive apartment which is further away, and so has lower rent but higher commuting expenses and no less need for assistance. Is there some justifiable reason they should receive less?<p>What happens to someone who isn&#x27;t paying rent? It&#x27;s common for a part time superintendent to not get paid but to get a free apartment. If they lose their primary job they&#x27;re still in trouble -- they get free rent, not free food -- but a discount on rent doesn&#x27;t get them anything because they don&#x27;t pay it.<p>What is this going to do to people who need to move? Isn&#x27;t the new landlord just going to raise the asking price by 25%?<p>The amount of rent someone pays has only a tenuous relationship with the amount of assistance they need, so it makes no sense to tie them together.')
