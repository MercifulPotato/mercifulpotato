If you&#x27;re modifying a buffer in place, you&#x27;ll still be stuck copying data to replace (longer) escape sequences with their (shorter) final values.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the line you&#x27;ve quoted from the article regarding why this code is slower than csv2. The csv2 code seemingly does copy from the original buffer rather than manipulating in place. Indeed, the csv2 parser copies data from a buffer into a C++ STL container object, which I would expect to be quite an expensive operation. Something does not add up here, either in my understanding or in the mechanics&#x2F;description of the benchmark.')
