I&#x27;m sure most native Mac apps will be compiled to ARM, but a lot of existing apps won&#x27;t.<p>Plus there&#x27;s the brouhaha about Electron apps.<p>I for one really wouldn&#x27;t mind if Apple would build a native app to replace Electron apps, e.g. a chat app that works as a good client for (what I have open right now in Rambox) Discord, FB Messenger, Whatsapp and multiple Slack channels. Or their own Spotify client. Or a big update to XCode so it can use language servers for VS Code and it&#x27;s viable to use for (what I do right now) Typescript, PHP and Go development.<p>They have more than enough money to invest in dozens of development teams or startups to push out new native apps.<p>One day I&#x27;ll switch away from Chrome in favor of Safari as well. Maybe.<p>(I am taking recommendations for native alternatives to apps)')
