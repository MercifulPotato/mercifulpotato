In the US, all sports teams emphasize one word: mileage. That is, one is expected to prep hard. You practice free throw 10K times in the summer, and you’ll be a role model for your fellow team members and basketball fans. You work your ass off to squat with 300 pounds and now you can  vertical jump 120 cm, again you&#x27;re the role model of your fellow sportsmen. Now how is it different from I spending my entire fucking summer finishing 1,000 AOPS math problems and completing Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics and get ahead in all the tests? If story of the month is that James LeBron spends 1.5 million dollars a year to keep him fit, why is it wrong for me to spend 10K a year to find a private tutor so that I can learn abstract algebra in grade 7 while other kids are still confused about fractions? Or put it another way, it’s American spirit if a middle-class mom quits her job so she can take her kid to all kinds of tournaments, but it’s disgusting elitism if a mom in Chinatown takes three jobs so her daughter could prep for AIME? Why is practicing really hard on STEM is &quot;gaming the system&quot;, while practicing like crazy in sports is hailed as heroism?<p>I see some serious hypocrisy here.<p>Oh, as for SAT. Come on, that&#x27;s bottom line. If you get perfect scores, it does not mean you&#x27;ll excel in college, but if you get really low score, you&#x27;re just not that good academically, at least statistically speaking. Why is it so hard to understand the some tests are designed to be a filter with low false negatives? If anything, SAT is too simple for it has only standard questions.')
