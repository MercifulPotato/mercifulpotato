Bitcoin is fully transparent, so government can track every transaction and if you&#x27;re doing transaction to some non-verified wallet, you have to explain it to your government.<p>I would argue that bitcoins are even easier to track than bank accounts.<p>What government can&#x27;t do is to steal your money or block your access to your money.')
