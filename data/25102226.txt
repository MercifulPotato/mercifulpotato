First off there is plenty of <i>$adjective left-wing</i> media to go around so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to specifically target <i>right-wing</i> media. The more important factor here is the fact that the majority of the main stream media have a left slant and have been slinging mud towards those with a different opinion for years now, especially since Trump announced his candidacy. It has become close to impossible to find an unopinionated discussion of right-wing thought in main stream media, it mostly just devolves into posturing, labelling and adjectives. Where should people who are fed up with this go to? Even after this constant barrage of accusations of being anything from <i>deplorables</i> to <i>racists</i> and <i>bigots</i> or <i>homophobes</i> or <i>transphobes</i> or any of those other spurious accusations the <i>orange man</i> still got close to half of the votes. While a number of those votes will have been cast by people who truly like Trump I suspect that a sizeable portion of them came from people who were just fed up being called those things and hoped 4 more years of Trump was preferable over the alternative of having a government supportive of such labelling. This realisation probably has come to parts of the DNC as well given the bad outcome of the election for anyone but Biden&#x2F;Harris.<p>It should be clear to anyone but those blinded by their own ideology that having a less politically biased media would be a good thing. Since the majority of the media leans left and is unlikely to move to the right this currently means there is a need for right-wing main stream media to even out the field. The big question is whether Trump is the one who can successfully fill that void, given the polarising nature of his personality.')
