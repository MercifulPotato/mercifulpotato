There are many reasons, probably, which is why there are different measures. I do think most of these measures (incorrectly) presume that having a job means you have a living wage, or at least at some level, that if you have a job you generally don&#x27;t need so much assistance.<p>Maybe that was true at some point in history, but it is not today. Most minimum wages across the US are not a living wage. Many necessary benefits are tied to full time employment only. Unemployment rates with no context attached don&#x27;t have such a strong meaning.')
