Hadn&#x27;t read them for a while but enjoyed them as always.<p>Heaven&#x27;s River by Dennis Taylor is the forth in the Bobiverse series.<p>Three Laws Lethal by David Walton.<p>The House of Styx by Derek KÃ¼nsken took me a while to get into, but then enjoyed it.<p>The Oppenheimer Alternative by Robert Sawyer. Don&#x27;t usually like historical fiction but will make an exception for this one.<p>And for something different, if you want to try rural Australian fiction find anything by Jane Harper, but in particular The Dry and The Lost Man.')
