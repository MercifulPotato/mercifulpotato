Academic computer science was quite small in those days, and it was almost all DoD-funded. The big CS schools had PDP-10 machines, and the lesser ones had DEC VAXen.<p>In the 1980s, the commercial market in electronics and computers passed the DoD market, first in volume and then in technology. This was a real shock to some communities. There were complaints of &quot;premature VHSIC (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit) insertion&quot; from DoD, by which they meant the commercial market using stuff DoD didn&#x27;t have yet. DoD thought they were in charge of the IC industry in 1980.[1] DoD had been the big buyer in electronics since WWII, after all. By 1990, DoD was a minor player in ICs and computing.<p>Symbolics was really a minicomputer manufacturer, building up CPUs from smaller parts.\nThey went down with the other mini makers - DEC, Prime, Data General, Interdata, Tandem, and the rest of that crowd.  That technology was obsoleted by single-chip CPUs.  Many of the others hung on longer, since they had established customer bases. But they were all on the way down by the late 1980s.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.dtic.mil&#x2F;dtic&#x2F;tr&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;u2&#x2F;a230012.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.dtic.mil&#x2F;dtic&#x2F;tr&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;u2&#x2F;a230012.pdf</a>')
