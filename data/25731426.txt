Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610383278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730436, text='&gt; It&#x27;s a system that the author put together while intoxicated to poke fun at Twitter.<p>The HN title is &quot;a microblogging platform&quot;, the landing page has a section titled &quot;But what&#x27;s wrong with Twitter?&quot;, and the documentation has a &quot;Design&quot; [1] section. If the author intended to poke fun at Twitter as a stand-in for all microblogging platforms then leave out the engineering aspects and if the author intended to poke fun at Twitter engineering then land some technical blows. If the point of the exercise is to demonstrate how much code and documentation can be pumped out during a drinking binge then the author should state that upfront; that context is useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blerg.cc&#x2F;doc&#x2F;#design" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blerg.cc&#x2F;doc&#x2F;#design</a>')
