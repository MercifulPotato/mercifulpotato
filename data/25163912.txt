Our platform[0] may suit you:<p>- Collaborative no-setup notebooks: different images with the most popular libraries pre-installed. See each other&#x27;s cursors, very useful for troubleshooting, pair programming.<p>- Long-running notebooks: GPU ready. You can schedule notebooks right from the notebook view so you don&#x27;t context switch. You can close your browser, disconnect from the internet, or shut your laptop and still see the notebook&#x27;s execution.<p>- Automatic params&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;model tracking: no boilerplate.<p>- One click deployment: clicking a button deploys a model and gives you a nice &quot;REST&quot; API endpoint you can invoke.<p>If you&#x27;re doing anything related to ML and use notebooks, you probably had the above problems. We&#x27;re building around Jupyter notebooks because in our experience, our machine learning projects were not held back for lack of slick stylesheets.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>')
