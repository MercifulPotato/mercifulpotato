For the longest time everyone believed at a subconscious level that x86 was a prerequisite due to compatibility.  Apple provided an existence proof that this is false.  There is no longer a real need to hold onto the obsolete x86 design.<p>The only way for Intel and AMD to thrive in this new world is to throw away their key asset: expertise in x86 arcana.  They will not do this (see Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma for reasons why).  As a result they will face a slow decline and eventual death.')
