If you have a ton of things to do and you are having trouble keeping track of them, then you might have use for a tool.<p>Separate your work and your life and your ambitions. I&#x27;m lucky enough that I can track my work stuff in my head. If it ever gets to where it&#x27;s too hectic, I escalate to a written task list.<p>My home life is similar. All of my life context is kept physically. I can see that the dishes aren&#x27;t done. I can see when I need to take out the trash.<p>My ambitions, on the other hand, well, I&#x27;ve spent man-years of effort on hacking away at solutions to manifest them faster. I don&#x27;t consider the time I&#x27;ve spent writing scripts and stuff wasted because I love doing this stuff, it&#x27;s what I naturally start doing once everything else is sorted. I don&#x27;t take a &#x27;ship it&#x27; strategy to them because to me the point is enjoying the journey, not to get to the end as fast as I can.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to build a colocated kubernetes cluster in order to host a blog, but I want to. It appeals to my sensibilities to not pay hundreds of dollars for compute when I have a perfectly good desktop machine with lots of its own compute.<p>I&#x27;ve spent more time on keyboard macros than I&#x27;ll ever save. But the feeling of power I get from having my world accessible with just a few keystrokes is great. And learning about how evdev and xbindkeys and the like work is interesting as well.<p>The hole isn&#x27;t filled when I get to the end. The end is when the hole <i>stops</i> being filled. This is what organization will do to you if you&#x27;re not careful.')
