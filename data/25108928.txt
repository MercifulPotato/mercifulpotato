You can travel for miles and miles through remote forest, then pass through a main street that looks like the center of any other large town. You can get lost following the meandering pavement, or get in trouble following a dirt track too far. Dirt bikes share the roads with sport car rallies (and logging trucks). Expansive overlooks appear out of nowhere, and you can find backpacking trails by looking for cairns along the roads. There are equestrian camp sites. It&#x27;s not really possible to describe in a short text comment.')
