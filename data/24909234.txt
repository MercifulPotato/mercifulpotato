I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the slowness alone that has people reject uber pool, it&#x27;s the slowness + having to share with yet another stranger. Robotaxis promise cheaper rides AND no social awkwardness.<p>However, I think you&#x27;re right about the capital intensiveness of Waymo&#x27;s approach. Not only do they have to spring for the capex (vs Tesla where they have conned^H^H^Hvinced their customers to front the capital for the fleet) but they have to operate a continuous remapping fleet to keep their hi-def maps up to date. Possible they could incorporate that part into the taxis, but it&#x27;s still something Tesla doesn&#x27;t have to do.  In my mind, there are two possibilities: Waymo works  and Tesla just never quite gets there, and thus Waymo has the time to gradually map and roll out to cities all over the world, or Tesla works too, and has much more attractive economics, and thus can deploy faster and owns the market, even if it takes it longer to achieve &quot;true&quot; FSD.  Only time will tell.')
