It doesn&#x27;t work like that in real life.<p>Example: McDonald&#x27;s. They have all the competition in the world. Restaurants are one of the closest markets to idealized perfect competition there is. But McDonald&#x27;s still makes plenty of money. Because as close as restaurants are to the ideal, the ideal doesn&#x27;t actually happen in real life.<p>Coca Cola, Nike, Toyota, Starbucks. These are all multi-billion dollar companies with nothing even resembling a monopoly.')
