It was clunky and heavy on all platforms, could not distinguish completely different artists from each other because they thought band names are unique and music range was poor compared to competition. When google launched GM, Deezer was already way better option.<p>Ability to store your own music was an attempt to create a killer feature they needed to keep that service running at all.<p>Google is teaching us the same thing over and over:\n- Scale over user comfort, general usability and features.\n- What you see is what you get. No evolution for next decade.\n- Service may be closed sooner and it will be pain in the ass to transfer to &quot;the next new thing&quot;.\n- The &quot;next new thing&quot; might not be around when the previous one is shut down already.')
