There are things I would be comfortable saying openly with my team Vs the wider team. \nNot that I have much of a filter anyway...<p>We tried doing a bimonthly quiz across our wider team but attendance waned and it was a lot of work for people to pull together content and manage etc.<p>In our smaller team, you are right and not everyone is into the idea every week, but they are vocal about it and the reasons (deadline&#x2F;family etc). They are not penalised in any way shape or form for being honest.\nWe also had themed stand-ups for a while (it was good to cheer us up from time to time but a lot of work).<p>We also have to acknowledge that it&#x27;s different for everyone, we all have different circumstances.<p>I have a daughter, two of my colleagues have two kids, one is single, one is in a relationship.\nHalf the team are from different countries, and have had visits home cancelled, they have been upset on calls I&#x27;ve been depressed about things too at times, but you have to be honest with your team, now more than ever you need to be supportive of eachother.<p>The most simple thing I&#x27;ve found is to have a variety of MS Teams backgrounds that are not your standard ones. It&#x27;s a simple thing but can get a smile every now and then, especially when someone&#x27;s kid appears!')
