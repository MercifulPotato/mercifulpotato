Also, owners are not able to sell their spot, as this is also prescribed and further codified into the seller&#x27;s contract.<p>Do note that I just describe the current situation. I do agree with the fact that the amount of cars&#x2F;parking spots needs to go down, to make a city more liveable.<p>I don&#x27;t own a car. I need one, to regularly visit clients and visit family. Thus, I have joined a car sharing initiative. However, it&#x27;s about equally as expensive as leasing a new family car. I can afford this, but I recognize not everyone can. And I find this recognition is sometimes missing from the discussion.')
