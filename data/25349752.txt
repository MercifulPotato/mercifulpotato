There is also the &quot;bug&quot; found by the end user or by the tester or the code,  not to mind the &quot;feature request&quot;.<p>People see those as different but when quality counts the coder is going to do the same thing no matter what a change request is called.  A change request can also be scoped to subsystems,  such as a web front end vs a back end.  There are many reasons to keep separate paperwork for those systems (maybe different people do the work!) but when the tester fails it,  the tester has no idea if it is a front end problem or a back end problem so it is 50-50% they will fail the right ticket,  etc.')
