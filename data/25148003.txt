Managed to get it ranking #1 for &quot;biology&quot; and a number of relevant terms, mainly because an eminent Harvard page was linking to it.<p>At that time I could put ads on the page to effectively make it a full time job developing the site, which I did. It was massively rewarding knowing that 5000 people a day were reading something I wrote. I&#x27;d like to think someone managed to get their degree&#x2F;job based on stuff they learned on there.<p>My personal belief is that biodiversity and preserving it should be one of our top priorities this century, nature has inspired a lot of our ideas and there&#x27;s going to be many more. For all our advancements, we&#x27;re just part of a larger tapestry. Great subject.')
