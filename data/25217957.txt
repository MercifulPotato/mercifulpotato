We apologise for any confusion.&quot;<p>all in all:\nThe apology has been an article on the BBC via spokeswoman. Not an email to my inbox (yet), where the mistake occurred. so, while yes, they have apologised, it&#x27;s not in the format you&#x27;d expect someone who sent out a mass email incorrectly.')
