The argument is that guaranteeing access to healthcare <i>itself</i> is attainable without price controls.<p>&gt; SNAP and ag subsidies are also just price controls with extra steps<p>They&#x27;re really not. The closest analog would be to institute a basic income that&#x27;s earmarked for health insurance premiums. We don&#x27;t have that today, at least in a uniform way (ACA subsidies come close).')
