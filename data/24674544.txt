It’s not just a prodrug – it has a rather clever molecular time-release mechanism</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how much truth there is to this claim. As you mentioned, Lisdexamfetamine is just Dextroamphetamine bound to the amino acid, l-Lysine.<p>Once your stomach cleaves the l-Lysine, it yields free-floating D-Amp.<p>This mechanism of action isn&#x27;t any different than most formulations of extended-release Dextroamphetamine, like Dexedrine ER spansules.<p>Additionally, Adderall and other standard mixed-isomer amphetamine salt formulations are a 75&#x2F;25 mix of D-Amp&#x2F;L-Amp, and the peripheral nervous system stimulation that L-Amp produces at that kind of dose (5mg for a 20mg pill) I would think to most wouldn&#x27;t feel very noticeable at all.<p>Having gone through Adderall IR, Adderall ER, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine IR over the years, to me they all felt more or less the same (besides IR vs ER).<p>If for whatever reason Vyvanse happens to work better for some people, that&#x27;s fantastic and more power to you, but the hype behind this is all marketing IMO. And, it&#x27;s absurdly expensive without insurance.<p>It was the difference between $250&#x2F;mo and $20&#x2F;mo using Good Rx between generic Adderall&#x2F;Dexedrine and Vyvanse.')
