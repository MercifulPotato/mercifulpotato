Which then, by becoming yet another person memeing that idea on, encourages more people to hold and repeat the same opinion, which then encourages more people to hold and repeat the same opinion, and so on. It&#x27;s a viral idea, there&#x27;s no stopping it at this point.<p>The people repeating the same lines rarely have any actual reason to repeat them other than the fact that they think they&#x27;re true since they&#x27;ve seen so many other people repeat them. They&#x27;ll just come in and assert that &quot;C++ is an anti-pattern&quot;, with no rationale, no facts, no arguments, it&#x27;s more political than technical, it&#x27;s a mantra they&#x27;ve been brainwashed into repeating since everyone else in their echo chamber is repeating it. Of course this same pattern of a viral idea&#x2F;meme extends much further into politics and all other areas of our life, enabled by the internet &#x2F; mass media.<p>Maybe objectively C++ is pretty horrible and Rust is great, I&#x27;m not even saying anything about the objective reality of the situation. It&#x27;s just so easy to spot the patterns at this point, across all areas of conversation, that I now just by default ignore and assume false anything that shows the same viral pattern, because I know the viral pattern is usually backed by nothing but itself. Maybe in the past if enough people believed something to be true it&#x27;d be easier to assume there&#x27;s some reason for them to believe that, but in the era of the internet &#x2F; mass media that&#x27;s pretty much gone.')
