Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, Haskell etc.<p>2) the platform you&#x27;re writing for is partially if not largely written in C or C++, the most popular of which are Windows, MacOS, Linux etc. So the toolchain&#x2F;runtimes used to build the systems are already supported, extremely mature and well tested.<p>3) the platform you&#x27;re writing for is especially space constrained (eg. embedded Linux), also fits the criteria for (2) above, and where performance may also be a factor due to reduced CPU&#x2F;bus speed, availability of RAM and storage. For every interpreter or JIT compiler you want to add to those kind of systems for a higher level language, you can normally fit a larger number of C or C++ programs to implement your device&#x27;s required functionality.')
