They can’t really adjust density for specific areas very well, but total bandwidth is highly variable over time.  Publicly they have stated <i>10% of local Internet traffic, in high-density cities</i> as their benchmark, that’s likely an economic not technical limitation based on the percentage of time a satellite spends over dense cities vs rural areas etc.<p>Anyway, it’s really not a question of total bandwidth so much as any meaningful competition stopping the most egregious abuses.   Assuming they can reach even 1&#x2F;2 that it’s still plenty to provide stiff competition in midsized cities, suburbs, and rural areas which are generally the most problematic areas.')
