If so, what&#x27;s the policy - I&#x27;d truly like to read it.<p>Because plenty of American politicians have said extremely hateful, despicable things about Iran too - is this cause for their censorship?<p>If we are to measure things by populist slogans, America should have been glass parking lot&#x27;ed by the countries it has slandered and heaped hatred on, decades ago.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a moral conundrum that American&#x27;s are ill-equipped to respond to...<p>Or is it the same old &quot;might makes right&quot; argument that keeps being proffered in these stupid agitprop articles?<p>So this situation provides quite clear evidence of the lengths that very real war-mongers will go to in order to provide justification for their heinous acts.  Not only is censorship occurring, but downright lies too.<p>EDIT2: No, war-mongers.  YOU give it a rest.')
