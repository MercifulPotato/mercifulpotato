If this is not inflation then what is?<p>Because inflation&#x2F;cpi is measured using a basket of goods. pc parts being inflated by 25% doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s 25% inflation overall. That said, the the money printing&#x2F;ZIRP did cause inflation, it&#x27;s just that it was mostly in assets, rather than in consumer goods hence why the cpi hasn&#x27;t budged much.')
