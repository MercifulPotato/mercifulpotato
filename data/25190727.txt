Item(by='hadlock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606160168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189782, text='$100&#x2F;hour is for engine time, to which you can roughly estimate maintenance for other parts of the device.<p>You can expect to get 10,000 hours on a diesel engine before it needs at least a partial rebuild. The article talks about getting 40,000 hours out of a tractor, so that would probably be partial rebuilds at 10,000 and 30,000 hours, and a full rebuild at 20,000 hours.<p>Included in that $100&#x2F;hr is fuel and insurance and replacement parts etc. for a device designed to haul around 20 tons of equipment offroad as part of it&#x27;s daily tasks.<p>Compare that to the federal milage rate for passenger cars that are designed to move around 0.25 tons of equipment at $0.58&#x2F;hr, you come up with ~$50&#x2F;hr (@ 20 tons) for something designed to drive on paved interstate highways. It&#x27;s not especially unreasonable.')
