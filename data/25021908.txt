I wish I remembered the year or his name or could find some video of the talk, but this was at the height of Napster where it seemed like no one was paying for music. This guy compared music piracy to the prohibition. He said people didn&#x27;t want to break the law. People just wanted to drink. I haven&#x27;t looked at piracy the same way since.<p>Fast forward to seeing this, and I realize this doesn&#x27;t have the same draw as it would have 20 years ago. People can get the music they want at a price they&#x27;re willing to accept.')
