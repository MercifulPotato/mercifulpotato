Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611039203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830061, text='I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of these for UT CNC systems; definitely good bang for your buck, but that&#x27;s if you need to drive a 1200 lb bridge at 6 in&#x2F;s, and have $600 per motor to spend.<p>I ended up not using them because I found it was simpler, cheaper, and fit the mounts better to buy a pack of NEMA34 steppers and a few $15 dollar encoders. Seriously, spent maybe $800 on decent quality steppers&#x2F;encoders&#x2F;amps for 3 axes, where the ClearPath servos would have been $1600 for the same 3 axes, but wouldn&#x27;t have provided position feedback nor allowed position localisation to be decoupled from the motors (which is the best way to do things in most cases).<p>I think it&#x27;s hard to justify the costs of these types of motors unless you have some very specific torque&#x2F;speed&#x2F;spacial requirements that require them. If you&#x27;re building a machine that is worth &gt;$4000 per axis, then maybe, but if not, simple steppers are the way to go.')
