I always thought that I&#x27;m unable to focus for the whole working day because of the many interruptions. However, I figured out that 4-5 hours of highly focused programming is the most I can do for work. But I&#x27;m also able to do private work before&#x2F;after that, but for work-related projects, I&#x27;m done much earlier.')
