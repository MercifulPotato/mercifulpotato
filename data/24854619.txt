Its lineup of star-studded programming included a court show featuring Chrissy Teigen, a romantic comedy with Anna Kendrick ...</i><p>Sounds like top shelf content, let&#x27;s try a review:<p><i>&quot;My most recent pick was Dummy, a show where Anna Kendrick becomes friends with her boyfriend’s sex doll. When I turned my phone horizontally, suddenly I could see a widescreen version of the same series: The sex doll’s legs splayed further along the floor, and in the background I could now see Donal Logue, the actor who plays the boyfriend. ... The episode of Dummy lasted six minutes, just long enough for me to think, What is this?, when I realized that the boyfriend was a barely fictionalized version of Emmy-winning TV writer Dan Harmon. Then it ended.&quot;</i><p>-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vulture.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-bites-are-quick-and-bad.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vulture.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-bites-are-quick-and-bad....</a><p>Okay, bad roulette spin.  Here&#x27;s another view:<p><i>&quot;“Dummy” is a semi-autobiographical comedy from Cody Heller, whom Kendrick plays, with Donal Logue portraying her real-life partner Dan Harmon, the Emmy-winning showrunner of “Community” and “Rick &amp; Morty.” The 10-episode series sees Cody imagining that her boyfriend’s sex doll is sentient and high jinks ensue. It is breezy viewing at an average of seven minutes apiece, but the show deserves Emmy recognition for how its frames are so deliberately composed in service of advancing the art form. Relatively few shows contend for Best Short Form Comedy&#x2F;Drama Series; that the category exists is a testament to the academy’s continual acknowledgement of the evolution of television, which “Dummy” embodies.&quot;</i><p>-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goldderby.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;anna-kendrick-dummy-quibi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goldderby.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;anna-kendrick-dummy-q...</a>')
