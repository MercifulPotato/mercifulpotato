The entire system is corrupt. Trump supporters, and many progressives have the same issue. The wealth gap.<p>We have a system where CEO&#x27;s are rewarded with stock, not a salary. That stock is then taxed at capital gains rates. If we raise taxes, they can just give the CEO more stock.<p>Democrats want to raise taxes, which doesn&#x27;t do anything. Why? Because they can just give more stock.
