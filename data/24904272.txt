As a native of the south (Charlotte) who lived in Seattle for a while, I would have used your first point to describe west coast people. Almost nobody in Seattle would make conversation with strangers. When I went back to Charlotte after a few years in Seattle, I was sort of blown away by the fact that I had an entire 5 minute conversation with a homeless person on the bench next to me while I was waiting for an uber - and not once did he ask for money. It was just him asking if I needed directions and then we talked about the weather and the city. (I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the norm, but that does not happen ever Seattle). I used to hate random small talk when I was growing up, but I now understand that it&#x27;s a sign of an overtly friendly culture, which is not a bad thing in my book.<p>I haven&#x27;t spent much time in DC myself but, I had wondered about it. Your description definitely doesn&#x27;t make it sound like a good time for me either. I&#x27;ve glad you got out and are (hopefully) happier elsewhere!')
