They are the only one allowed to touch A and B, and worse may be the only one&#x27;s capable of touching A and B.  You can end up with a bunch of these little fiefdoms and getting anything done quickly becomes an issue of appeasing a few petty despots.<p>That&#x27;s a little bit extreme for example but there&#x27;s definitely benefits to standardizing things across projects.')
