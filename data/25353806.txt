Also, nurses are often women. Are they light pattern people getting exploited? Why won&#x27;t society raise their salaries, so more people will work as nurses or at least not resign -- so they won&#x27;t need to work 12 h shifts<p>&gt; it does make them feel great and that&#x27;s the temporary payoff.<p>I think in the cases of nurses it can be the opposite: that they&#x27;d feel guilt if they quit')
