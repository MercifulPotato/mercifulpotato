Scientists anywhere can define and (reproducibly!) run experiments over the internet on-demand and without investing up-front in a lab facility.<p>The Strateos Common Lab Environment (SCLE) takes Autoprotocol (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;autoprotocol.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;autoprotocol.org&#x2F;</a>), a high-level JSON description of a biological protocol, and executes it on our custom-built robotic workcells. The protocols we handle routinely involve solving constraint programming models with thousands of variables and constraints in order to find the best plan that fulfills the scientist&#x27;s biological intent.<p>Scientists manage their experiments through our web application or via our API. We provide a single platform that controls scientific devices from many vendors in a unified way, and an interface to control our automated labs.<p>Tech stack includes: Linux, Scala, RabbitMQ, Rails, Typescript, React, Ansible, Postgres<p>Benefits include: medical&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision insurance; catered lunch and dinner when in office, and a fully stocked kitchen; flexible vacation policy; 401(k) with matching; gym and commuter reimbursement; and education reimbursement up to $3,000&#x2F;year.')
