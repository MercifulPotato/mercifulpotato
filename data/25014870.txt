We have a presence in Paris, France (a few members live there). Our clients are in Europe. We&#x27;ve been building custom, turn-key, machine learning products for large enterprise clients for around seven years.<p>We started pushing for remote about two years ago experimenting with different schemes to stress test our processes. Inefficiencies become clear when you&#x27;re not all at in the office. We used that to expose these weaknesses and address them because we figured we&#x27;d hire people in different countries sooner or later, and we&#x27;d experiment and learn before we had to.<p>We&#x27;ve had a couple of people in Paris so we were not completely strager to that. One reason we pushed for remote as well was because public transportation isn&#x27;t good here for our work schedules.<p>We didn&#x27;t need VC as we&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to be profitable from the get go.<p>&gt;<i>What are some benefits you’ve noticed that might be unique to your city&#x2F;area?</i><p>Offices in piano nobile of 170m² (~1700 sq-ft) with ~3.2m (11ft) ceilings in a Haussmannian building facing the marina (Bay of Algiers) with a great view for $400 a month. The offices in downtown Algiers. Subway a few metres away. Facing a train station. You could swim almost through the whole year (I mean, it&#x27;s november but it&#x27;s 24°C and the water is warm).<p>Again, our clients are in Europe, so I&#x27;m not talking about doing business here. But for companies who have a runway, they can live really well here on $500 (eating out daily, fresh food, drinks, etc).')
