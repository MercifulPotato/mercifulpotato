The written language is more uniform but that&#x27;s also a bit contested.  I&#x27;m not a linguist but I&#x27;d guess the differences are at least as strong as in different parts of the UK.<p>For example in Berlin you would have the advantage that a native speaker of any form of German can pretty much understand the natives when they talk amongst themselves.  You would not have that luxury in Swabia.<p>Second, the idea that this presumed standard crosses borders is... well sorry but it&#x27;s absurd.  Ask any Austrian or Swiss-German.  Or even read their newspapers.<p>And finally, English is rapidly creeping into unofficial-but-official German. For example they routinely say &quot;Vaccine&quot; in the news instead of &quot;Impfstoff&quot; now. I could go on but I guess it&#x27;s off topic.<p>German is a living language, and an international one, and as much as Duden might have been a guiding light to my generation it&#x27;s not that for the kids at all.<p>[0]: (in German) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reform_der_deutschen_Rechtschreibung_von_1996" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reform_der_deutschen_Rechtschr...</a>')
