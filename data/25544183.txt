So it would be a lot more expensive to run.<p>Also, unrelated to that argument but I think the most expensive part in a CA is not issuance but rather OCSP since an OCSP query could happen with every TLS connection (although stapling exists to solve that). OCSP would not be affected by a shortening of validity periods.')
