Someone shorting a stock has an incentive to see a company fail. Sometimes people will put out rumors or even go on fiance shows talking about how poorly run some company is.<p>“ Tesla CEO Elon Musk had a number of things to talk about during Wednesday&#x27;s quarterly earnings call, but spent a lot of time discussing the company&#x27;s Full Self-Driving system. According to Musk, the FSD will be capable of Level 5 autonomy by the end of 2021.”<p>How is Elon Musk claiming (lying) that level 5 FSD will be available for Tesla vehicles in 2021 any different from short sellers making similar claims about the potential downsides of a stock?<p>FWIW, Elon Mysk said they’ll have a million robotaxis operating before the end of 2020. I believe there are 0 currently operating. [1]<p>I will bet anyone 10,000 dollars that Tesla will not have level 5 FSD by EOY.
