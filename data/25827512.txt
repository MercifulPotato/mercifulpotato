Consumers wanted it, doctors wanted it, I wanted it. Where did I go wrong?<p>A lot of people in this thread are talking about the woes of ethical doctoring, the problems of healthcare, and so on. The reality here is that <i>no one wanted it</i> -- at least no one that he was selling to. I can relate. I&#x27;ve been there -- building something for months and then hearing crickets. The Y Combinator motto -- &quot;Make something people want&quot; -- is actually pretty tough to get right. In fact, it&#x27;s the crux of any viable business.
