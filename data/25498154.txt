When the negotiation is &quot;pay up or die&quot; then it&#x27;s de facto not a free market [1] and the government has a responsibility to step in and address it.<p>The minimum viable remediation is a two-tier system in which the government takes the &quot;or die&quot; out of the conversation. The best approach IMO is single-payer where the government takes the &quot;pay up&quot; part out too, as it allows the system to be globally optimized.<p>At the end of the day health insurance isn&#x27;t insurance, it&#x27;s at best a structured payments plan. You buy insurance against things that may or may not happen. You <i>will</i> get sick and you <i>will</i> die. That&#x27;s not insurance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corporatefinanceinstitute.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;economics&#x2F;free-market&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corporatefinanceinstitute.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;ec...</a>')
