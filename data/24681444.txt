Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[24682900], score=None, time=1601838213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680853, text='There&#x27;s an assumption there that its not possible to design and build things that can be adapative and function across a much longer timespan than a modern big box store&#x27;s typical lifetime.<p>There&#x27;s also an assumption that the cost of have an imperfectly adapated building is higher than the cost of multiple building efforts over time. Since both costs are rather variable, it&#x27;s hard to assess if that is true.<p>Claiming that private entities are immune (or at least, less susceptible) to the same problems of temporal discounting that clearly affects both individuals and many north American governments seems without foundation to me. There are many incentives in play for private entities to favor short term gain over long term gain, and significant evidence that this affects their behavior just as much as it affects individuals and governments.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s straightforward to compare &quot;net present value&quot;. Go and visit the WPA constructions at many national parks. Nobody would agree to them being built today, so even if you could establish the cost to rebuild them, the fact that there&#x27;s no way we would ever end up replacing them makes it extremely hard to establish their value to us as a society.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to defend those old energy inefficient, hard-to-maintain structures to much. I&#x27;m thinking more about what their construction actually represented in terms of a society&#x27;s willingess to invest (inefficiently!) in the future, and in a more-than-barebones aesthetic.')
