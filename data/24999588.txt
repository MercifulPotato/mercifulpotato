But data from the first week isn&#x27;t very telling. I&#x27;d be more interested in how its going a month from now.<p>I do a number of things the OP does to try to curb &quot;wasted&quot; time. I would add the following:<p>I have no social media on my phone and the only game is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chiark.greenend.org.uk&#x2F;~sgtatham&#x2F;puzzles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chiark.greenend.org.uk&#x2F;~sgtatham&#x2F;puzzles&#x2F;</a><p>Really hard to get addicted to but enjoyable enough if I actually want to spend a few minutes playing a game.<p>I use this on my desktop: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;intention&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;intention&#x2F;</a> \nAnytime I notice a website that I habitually load (mindless) I add it to the list. Then I get a pop up asking me how much time I want to spend and showing how much I&#x27;ve already spent.  Surprisingly effective.<p>I would also challenge the assumption that screen time is automatically &quot;wasted&quot;. A lot of the time I spent on the phone yesterday was reading wikipedia or a book. This time was enriching. I also spent a lot of time refreshing politico. That was not enriching. Oh well.<p>I&#x27;m trying to recognize when I&#x27;m feeling the <i>need</i> to waste time and choose a healthier activity. Stepping away from the computer to stretch, take the dogs out, etc. Usually if I&#x27;m procrastinating there is a physical or emotional need that I should be addressing. Mindlessly reading HN (or whatever) is just a distraction from what my body is trying to tell me.')
