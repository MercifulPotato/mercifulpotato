I have all the time to open videos (and think about it!) in private tab so that my recommendations don&#x27;t get messed up. And then of course on phone you don&#x27;t have that luxury so you have to go clean history manually. And now they added <i>two</i> interstitials before you can actually view video in private.<p>Shining example indeed')
