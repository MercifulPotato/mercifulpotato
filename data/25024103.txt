Don&#x27;t pretend like Trump is the first to do this, or the first to insinuate that fraud has influenced the result. It&#x27;s pretty run-of-the-mill politicking. Here&#x27;s Hillary doing the same thing, except she&#x27;s blaming nefarious foreign actors instead of the local machine:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;hillary-clinton-trump-challenge-2016-election-legitimacy-242848" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;hillary-clinton-tr...</a><p>The simple fact is that Hillary simply couldn&#x27;t believe she was defeated, and did as much or more disputing of results. That doesn&#x27;t make her an enemy of democracy, and neither does Donald Trump&#x27;s caterwauling.
