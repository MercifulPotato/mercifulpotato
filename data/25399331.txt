Generally speaking, a professional software company has some kind of &quot;style&quot;, &quot;guideline&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; that guides developers.<p>It&#x27;s like building a house. Before you even start, you know you are going to need windows, walls, a roof... being a professional means having built so many houses that you know the order, the required components, how much time it should take and a hint of the cost.<p>So if you have models like orders, bills, partners, contacts, you probably have a class for each and it&#x27;s going to be mapped to the database tables somehow. √ùou will need to display the data and make it editable. You carefully plan and then you make space for refactoring, maybe use methodologies like Agile to decide priorities.<p>Translate this into: authentication, authorization, data storage, algorithms, performance, user experience, import&#x2F;export and ETL, documentation, tests, customer support, analytics.<p>If you also are into product, add to that product design, marketing, hiring, supervision...<p>If you are an expert, you may want to optimize, to make extensible components, to write a DSL, an API, to make collatersl services.<p>&quot;Clean architecture&quot; is a classic go-to book. You can have a look at the QT framework docs which are very good. This is a good starting link also.\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;queirozf.com&#x2F;entries&#x2F;how-to-structure-software-projects-python-example" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;queirozf.com&#x2F;entries&#x2F;how-to-structure-software-proje...</a>')
