Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=[25499876], score=None, time=1608582767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494779, text='&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t it be a more appropriate comparison to look at someone with an &quot;average&quot; pension<p>We&#x27;re discussing salary of software engineers, firstly because this is HN, and secondly because software engineer salaries in the US are an outlier. Also as I mentioned in my original comment, the figures I gave don&#x27;t include our pensions at all (as an aside, 55 is the earliest you can currently take anything from private penions in the UK), so I think the comparison is valid enough.<p>If my wife also had a job as a salaried software engineer, instead of working on our business, our combined income would likely be around â‚¬105k, which is still more than enough to be able to live very well and save a lot of money at the same time, as long as you are financially savvy.')
