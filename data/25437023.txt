Notice how all of the positive anecdotes are coming from PC players?<p>IGN went so far as to split their Cyberpunk 2077 review into two separate reviews: One for consoles, and one for PC. Quote from the console review:<p>&gt; The Xbox One&#x2F;PS4 version is nearly unrecognizable compared to the PC version.<p>The PC version scored 9&#x2F;10 and the console version scored 4&#x2F;10.<p>They also concluded that console gamers should request a refund from CDPR as soon as possible. I suspect console gamers are requesting refunds in droves due to the issues, which is surely going to impact their long-term sales projections.')
