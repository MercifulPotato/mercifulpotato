Especially when there are no complaints to use as a base because all contenders for the contract were similarly shady. And sometimes some <i>$RANDOM</i> gets the contract because nobody serious will take it, thanks to anti-corruption&#x2F;anti-loss measures that the populous voted in that made the contract impossible. So <i>Honest John Federal</i> takes the contract and finds a suitably desperate student&#x2F;outsources it to cheapest vendor possible.<p>Meanwhile auditors (unless burned out) would <i>love</i> to get the contractors and buyer staked in court, but <i>technically</i> all checkboxes on the checklist are checked (pun intended) and there&#x27;s no obvious better candidate to use as counter example.')
