I don&#x27;t use it myself but there definitely are erlang programmers, and I sometimes wish I had chosen a less mainstream tech stack than typescript for my own company as it makes filtering for engineers a bit easier. Erlang is surely quite stable given that it was initially designed for telecoms, and projects like rabbitmq are based upon it?')
