The tax breaks for &quot;leasing&quot; instead of owning, are a cheap way of an exec looking good to a board (plus it&#x27;s easier to do creative accounting). I promise you, this accounts for easily 70% of equipment leasing&#x2F;renting agreements, no matter the industry. Construction, printing, food industry, etc. They get a full tax break on the lease and on the service agreement tied into it. This looks good in the short term, but is obviously shit in the long term. I&#x27;ve been apart of too many arguments with clients about this. The person who signs the cheques always mentions the tax incentives and the lower initial yearly costs. But then they lose their ass 5 years down the line. You can argue tech reasons all you want, but it&#x27;s ego driven money that drives the cloud industry.<p>Wile I agree mostly with the author... wtf is all the hate with C# I see from people? lol &quot;whatever the heck people use C# for&quot;. This pops up so often. C# is the F-350, Catipillar, Kubota of the tech world. Yea, it ain&#x27;t sexy, but it&#x27;s meant to just get work done. When it works, no one notices. But when people screw with it, yea, it&#x27;s easy to laugh at like the videos of crane construction fails (mostly operator error is to blame). While other tech might be the Bentley and Ferrari, they&#x27;re either all looks and no muscle or catch on fire when something minor goes wrong (looking at you MongoDB :P).')
