They said - &quot;There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit&quot;<p>&quot;In the community, we do not recommend the use of wearing masks unless you yourself are sick and as a measure to prevent onward spread from you if you are ill&quot;<p>&quot;The masks that we recommend are for people who are at home and who are sick and for those individuals who are caring for those people who are home that are sick,&quot;<p>These are completely normal statements.<p>&gt;2. Don’t close borders<p>False. The said &quot;There is a “huge reason to keep official border crossings open” to avoid people entering irregularly and going unchecked for symptoms, &quot;<p>&quot;Certain containment measures will be appropriate, but widely banning travel, closing down cities, and hoarding resources are not realistic solutions for an outbreak that lasts years.&quot;<p>&gt;3. COVID is not airborne<p>Please understand that airborne has a scientific meaning, and that is the terminology that scientists use. There is no actual clinical evidence of the airborne transmission of COVID.It is spread through large droplets. If it was airborne, those cloth and surgical masks that people wear would be useless, so you might as well not wear them.<p>--<p>&gt;But it’s not clear to me that the WHO has any credibility left.<p>Maybe that is true for you, but ironically your wild accusations have let me wondering about your agenda here. :)')
