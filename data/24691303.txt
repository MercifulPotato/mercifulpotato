But unless insurance companies can actually go to work on <i>predicting</i> how accident-prone a person is based on this kind of data, and raising premiums accordingly, I don&#x27;t know if it will make much difference in terms of actually changing behaviour.<p>Like, there should already be a lot of this kind of data out there to nail drivers to the wall post-crash, and you just don&#x27;t really see it happening. Even when someone is killed, everyone involved basically shrugs, says it was a fluke, and tells the family they should get over it and move on (watch for the phrase &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; as a sign that everyone involved has checked out of a particular case).<p>And how much will consumers accept a car that tattles on them about their bad behaviour? People already lose their minds over provably-effective external automated enforcement measures which rely on plate reading like red light cams and average speed cams.')
