I think everyone should do what works for them.<p>Using a tool &quot;just because&quot; it worked for others, seems to be what often drives many decisions in this industry. For example, would you go for the 2,200+ microservice architecture from Uber[1] just because they say it solved all their problems? They probably have their reasons, and they are unlikely to be the same as everyone else.<p>I know my stack as a solo founder is unconventional, but it&#x27;s what has worked best for me. And I&#x27;m happy with my choice.<p>If serverless does the trick for you, then focus on that, and keep building the features that your customers actually care about.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eng.uber.com&#x2F;microservice-architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eng.uber.com&#x2F;microservice-architecture</a>')
