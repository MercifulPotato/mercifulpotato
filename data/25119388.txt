Even hard cheeses may have a significant amount of lactose left particularly if they haven&#x27;t aged for a very long time. Some hard cheeses are made in a special manner that purposely removes the lactose from their curd before forming, for example gouda (these are called washed-curd cheeses). The point of removing lactose in this way is to stop the LAB from fermenting it any further and giving the cheese an acidic, tangy taste; this is why such cheeses taste &quot;sweet&quot; (compared to e.g. gruyere or parmesan).<p>As to the lactose being &quot;primarily&quot; in the whey, how &quot;primarily&quot; it is, is a matter of perspective. If sufficient lactose was not left in the curds, cheese would never be able to mature. Cheese matures because of the enzymes released by LAB while the cheese ripens (LAB also release enzymes as they die and their cells rupture, but the cause of death is desiccation because of the salt added to cheese and it takes a long time). This is for example why whey cheeses like ricotta, which are made by boiling whey to a high temperature (80C or 176F) do not mature: their LAB flora is boiled to death.<p>Bottom line: lactic acid fermentation is not a sufficient explanation for the ability of people with &quot;lactose maldigestion&quot; to eat cheese, particularly so fresh cheese.')
