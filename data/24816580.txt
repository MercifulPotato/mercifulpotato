Usually sticks which I prefer also but also &quot;two stick&quot;ish and &quot;four stick&quot;ish slabs. I also see logs of rolled butter, which are about three sticks worth or so rolled into a cylinder. I also see square slabs, maybe the mass of a stick or so, and sometimes tubs. The tubs are convenient for spreading but not as much for baking.<p>I usually prefer the sticks, as you don&#x27;t have to cut the larger slabs.')
