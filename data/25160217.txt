My point isn&#x27;t that you must include diverse characters, but that you cannot say &quot;I really wanted to included more diverse characters in my werewolf samurai game, but couldn&#x27;t because of historical accuracy&quot;.  You should be honest and say something like &quot;I didn&#x27;t add South American warriors to my samurai werewolf game because it honestly never crossed my mind to do so, and even if it had I wouldn&#x27;t do it because it goes against the feel and aesthetic I was going for.&quot;')
