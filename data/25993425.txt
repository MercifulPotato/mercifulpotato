I just want to take a second to thank these companies for trying to turn my profession (data science + analytics)  into the living hell of your every day enterprise and tech culture cluster-fuck (pun not intended).<p>I&#x27;m still coming to terms with the fact that there&#x27;s actually a technology called Kafka...<p>&#x2F;sorry, I&#x27;m just particularly bitter after having to do some databricks training yesterday... it was basically 80% trying to rote the sales literature about why they&#x27;re so great&#x2F;enterprisy and parroting company and platform specific jargon.  I don&#x27;t like seeing my profession turn into an obsession with tech and platforms when 99.9% of companies and people can&#x27;t reason properly or operate their current tools&#x2F;resources efficiently. obviously just my own opinion.')
