If we consider it as a knowledge bank which has everything from learning a new recipe to something as specific as operating a drill to empowering content like lecture videos on coursework. Recently I saw professional quality BBC like nature documentaries on YT.<p>The importance of it is far more and that&#x27;s why I think the subscription revenue potential is also far more.<p>Whether they can convince people to go ad free and pay for it is a different matter. My friend who pays for Apple Music, Netflix, Disney+, iCloud and a bunch of other subscriptions was complaining about YT ads. It boggled my mind that considering his usage, he didn&#x27;t pay for the premium plan.')
