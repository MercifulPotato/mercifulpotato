I don&#x27;t think there is any coordination or plot in this to &quot;erase females&quot;.<p>(I feel like this concept is different across English speaking countries, in America the movement has landed on the concept that we have separated sex and gender, so there are two sexes which remains binary: male and female, and there are non-binary genders which includes but it not limited to man and woman designations, and they don&#x27;t have to match the sex.
