Now who pays people to write software?<p>Proprietary software, which I agree often contains user hostile elements, also tends to have vastly superior polish and user experience. UI&#x2F;UX is often the majority of the work required to make good software. Making the software function usually takes a lot less time and effort than making it usable.<p>UI&#x2F;UX and other aspects of software usability are also often the more boring and grinding aspects of software development. This stuff is not fun, so people have to be paid to do it.<p>But “you can sell free software.” That is true. But by this philosophy software cannot restrict the rights of others to sell it too or it is nonfree. In practice that means third parties who did not write the software but have more money or more time to invest in polish and marketing (because they are not writing the software!) are the ones to profit and they usually give nothing back to the original authors.<p>GitHub didn’t write git. AWS didn’t write Postgres. But they are the ones to profit. They took someone else’s work and marketed it well, or SaaSified it. The original authors get nothing.<p>The original idea of free software was a mutual gift culture where everyone builds and everyone uses. Today it’s a take culture where a few people build, others polish and monetize and give nothing back, and most people use the monetized version because time is more expensive than money and nobody has time to DIY.')
