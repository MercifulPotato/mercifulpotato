They tested knowledge rather than hard work, and how many times you&#x27;ve drilled past exam papers. Generally these courses made the students feel out of control of their fate, stressed&#x2F;anxious, and they hated the course. If I&#x27;m being honest I was one of those students.<p>Ultimately, the kind of &quot;smart&quot; you&#x27;re talking about is not useful or valued. There are a small percentage of students, who are not only smart, but also good at &quot;gaming&quot; the system. A small percentage of this subset might end up in research and development, and the students who would be good at R&amp;D don&#x27;t get the chance to prove themselves.<p>For most students, being good at &quot;gaming&quot; the system, following instructions, and learning by rote is good enough. To be a doctor or a lawyer, you need to know by rote the basic fundamental knowledge. Thereafter it&#x27;s constant practice and experience in actually practising medicine&#x2F;law, and the associated accumulation of knowledge of all the &quot;little tricks&quot; and intricacies, that makes you a good professional.')
