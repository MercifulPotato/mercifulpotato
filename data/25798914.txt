I don&#x27;t want to sound judgy, but feel free to do some reading on the topic.<p>Also, you seem to dismiss my central point that nuclear doesn&#x27;t work without considerable amounts of fossil fuel. Even if that were the case, what is it powering? Almost all these electric devices use lithium which also takes a lot of fossil fuel to extract and refine.<p>It would be interesting to read a full study on the requirements on fossil fuel to produce an electric car and feed it over its lifetime (accounting for the short life of electric batteries), depending on how energy is produced. I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but it may be just as bad as a combustion car. For hybrids, it&#x27;s not even a debate as they get the environmental downsides of both worlds.')
