On the remaining devices Apple doesn&#x27;t let you run software Apple has blacklisted.<p>Apple won&#x27;t approve software that uses non-apple-approved services, like payment providers.  Apple won&#x27;t approve software that dares to inform users of these limitations. Apple won&#x27;t approve third party browsers. Apple demands payment in order for them to approve software. Etc.<p>Apple apparently has been silently and without permission or an off switch sending the name of the developer of literally every app you launch to Apple. This is far more invasive than anything I&#x27;ve heard of Google or Microsoft doing - not that I&#x27;m a fan of their telemetry either. Microsoft in particular also gives you tools to examine what they&#x27;re sending in detail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;348699&#x2F;how-to-see-what-data-windows-10-is-sending-to-microsoft&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;348699&#x2F;how-to-see-what-data-window...</a><p>On Apple devices which allow power user options (the minority of devices), they are still limited. For example Apple was (is?) making their own traffic bypass Little Snitch.<p>Apple generally seems to remove functionality in the name of &quot;design&quot; and &quot;safety&quot; as far as I can see... I&#x27;m not sure how you think they&#x27;re generally adding functionality.')
