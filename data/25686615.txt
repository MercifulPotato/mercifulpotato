A typical wolf pack is formed of a couple and their offsprings. Adult wolves leave the pack to form their own.<p>The idea that wolf pack have complex fixed hierarchical structure is mostly a myth produced by inadequate research from Rudolph Schenkel on captive wolves and popularized by even more inadequate research and a book by L. David Mech. Mech then went on to do very good work on wild wolf.<p>Wolves are however both social and used to complex interactions involving social dominance.')
