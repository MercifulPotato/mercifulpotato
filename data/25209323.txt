Item(by='spideymans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606313204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206129, text='&gt; I am going to speculate now, but maybe, just maybe, if some of the silicon that apple has used on the M1 is used for compression&#x2F;decompression they could be transparently compressing all ram in hardware. Since this offloaded from the CPUs and allows a compressed stream of data from memory, they achieve greater ram bandwidth, less latency and less usage for a given amount of memory.<p>Are you aware of any x86 chips that utilize this method?')
