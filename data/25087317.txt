In a capitalist system, companies hold the responsibility: if they are wrong too often, they go bankrupt.<p>In a socialist system, the responsibility is diluted, resulting in a cumulative overall inefficiency, with both shortage (ex: food in the USSR) and surpluses (ex: cotton in the USSR again).<p>I used &quot;new things&quot; to simplify the reasoning, but the same logic apply to existing things: do you want more or less say phones compared to last year?<p>You can&#x27;t say &quot;just as much&quot;, because the optimal amount will be impacted by a lot of things that change every year.')
