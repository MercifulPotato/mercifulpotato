Item(by='benlivengood', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612200135, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986123, text='&gt; Tax revenue is not &#x27;profit&#x27; by the state. That&#x27;s not how tax nor money issuing works. But to the topic at hand: There are countries that put money into investment funds that will invest into infrastructure and safe long-term assets. But usually not for UBI, but for retirements (e.g. Denmark).<p>Then ignore taxes and make the ultimate trade on margin; issue T-bills to directly invest the cash.  Same effect.  Does the imagined collateral backing T-bills even change?  It&#x27;s just based on the assumption that the fed keeps money working properly and has some source of income, right?  The threat of inflation rises but only for the same causes as general inflation; recessions and depressions.  The ability to directly dump treasury proceeds into index funds would probably have more of a stabilizing effect on inflation than anything.<p>&gt; Generally the idea of not having to work at all is still heavily controversial within science. Some believe in UBI, some in job-guarantees and others just in relatively high minimum wage and very strong retirement plans.<p>10% growth long term with an inflation target of 2% is exactly the promise of not having to work at some point in the future.  The aim is obstensibly retirement but it&#x27;s pretty clear that if you keep working a little longer the return on investment keeps growing and will be enough to cover not only ones-self but any kids and their kids, etc.<p>Basically I&#x27;m calling bullshit on the advice that long term investments are a good use for most individuals&#x27; money by contradiction.<p>An assumption of long-term growth is not realistic because either:\n  * The economy needs a working class that can never invest enough money to live off interest and will enforce this with rent seeking, glass ceilings, rampant consumerism, outsourcing, inflation, etc.\n  * The economy will periodically crash and wipe out enough wealth that people have to work again.<p>Full automation is a possibility in my lifetime, but unlikely.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t expected anytime before ~1950 when the advice was still &quot;invest long term&quot;.')
