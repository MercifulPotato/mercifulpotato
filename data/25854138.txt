In my town, massive subdivisions went in next to a garbage dump. Now people are complaining about the garbage dump. It was all &#x27;zoned.&#x27; Look at industrial areas on a google map. They will often have housing near&#x2F;around them. Without zoning, the people that don&#x27;t want to be near those things will not be near them, just as now. Anarchy means an absence of order.
