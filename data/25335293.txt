Both my wife and I work in tech, and are not fans of remote work. So for both of us this is the best place career-wise. We own a modest house, with a nice yard, so no complaints there. We love the food, nature, weather, and theatre scene. We&#x27;re in San Mateo, walking distance from downtown, which means we have access to some of the best ramen outside of Japan.<p>To be perfectly honest, the only thing missing is our friends and family in Canada. It wasn&#x27;t so bad when we could visit 2-3 times a year, but the pandemic has put a stop to that.')
