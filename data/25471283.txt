It would have the same effect.<p>With a random variable (the coin flip), that is hidden until revealed, we achieve the same results as quantum mechanics.<p>Scientist call them &quot;hidden values&quot; and Einstein hopped we could explain the &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; with such hidden variables. But we can&#x27;t, Bell proposed an experiment with entangle state which measurement could not be explained by such hidden variables, and Aspect did the experiment and obtained the predicted results.<p>So there exist situation where we can use entanglement to achieve better results, for example in &quot;non-local games&quot;, where players sharing entangled state can win with probability 1, when &quot;classical player&quot; with probability &lt; 1')
