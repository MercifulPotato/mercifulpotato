None of them have given me this sense of joy while learning vocabulary or practising as its really just a matter of &#x27;recognising&#x27; a word - usually from your own native language and sometimes from others.<p>I&#x27;d dare to say this is the key feature of Esperanto: its incredibly pleasant and beginner friendly.<p>As to Lojban, I was incredibly motivated but just had to give up after a few weeks. Its like Latin or Sanskrit, a mostly theoretical written language with overly stingent rules. Lojban words can be used as verbs or nouns, but when used as verbs they have a strict fixed order where subject and objects go that you simply have to learn by heart. All words are &#x27;averaged&#x27; from the most common languages and follow a common scheme - so pretty much none of them are recognisable to anyone. As such just a horror to learn.<p>That said I still admire the effort. Learning different languages opens wide horizons and completely new conceptual worlds and anyone who doesn&#x27;t try at least to learn a second language really misses out even on understanding their own language better.')
