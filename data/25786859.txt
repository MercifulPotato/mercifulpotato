It optimizes for high signal to noise ratio, where what is signal and what is noise if up to you to decide with your upvotes. We don&#x27;t have to all agree on what is globally &quot;upvoteworthy&quot;.<p>There is no global reputation system (which can be gamed). Instead, there is a peer-to-peer trust system.<p>If you are interested in a system like that, then I would like to invite you to my hobby project that works exactly this way. Register with a temporary account (no email required) at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linklonk.com&#x2F;register" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linklonk.com&#x2F;register</a> and use code &#x27;hn&#x27;.<p>It is early days and we don&#x27;t have many users yet. To supplement real users LinkLonk supports RSS feeds as sources of information. Each feed behaves much like a user - the more you upvote content from it, the higher ranked its other entries will be for you. I hope you will find it useful and I&#x27;m looking to hear your feedback.')
