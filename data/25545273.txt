Your conclusion is nowhere near anything I asserted.<p>I asserted a generalization that women tend to like men who are more fit and I asserted that generalizations apply to the universe. Something along the lines of: Not all women are shorter than men, but in general they are.<p>Then I used science to establish that generality. That&#x27;s it. The conclusion of those papers never claimed women are easily understood and I never claimed it either.<p>The crazy thing is, you claimed to agree with me as &quot;bisexual&quot; man then proceeded to debate a point with an imaginary claim that was never made.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re not delusional and your arguments are tactics and lies used to manipulate a conversation in a direction of your choosing. If that is the case my conclusion is that you&#x27;re a liar.<p>Tldr: You are arguing against claims that were never made.')
