My ex boss is starting up an office here, hopefully her company will allow her to expand and hire me.<p>For me, I’m a bit stuck in a niche field in a niche region (don’t want to disclose too much in the rare case my boss reads), so it’s quite difficult to move around. Also as I’m no longer young, my salary is a bit higher than for young 20s so it’s not that easy to move into other adjacent fields. But the expenses are higher - with a partner and bills to support. Now I know what it feels like to get older!')
