Yes, I think the whole course of events satisfies the definition of a coup.<p>Not a competent one, of course. A competent coup would have called in National Guard or military forces to suppress the rioters and at the same time sequester the members of the House and Senate in an undisclosed location for their own protection. Then declare a national emergency, place National Guard or military forces in state capitols and large cities---at that point violence becomes inevitable and the coup self-sustaining. (This isn&#x27;t exactly a genius mastermind plan; it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done all over the world.)<p>That does require the cooperation of the military, which Mr. Trump never really had, though.<p>Some of us are still wondering, though, why there were only Capitol Police at the Capitol. It seems likely that had the protest been another group, significant riot control forces would have been in place.')
