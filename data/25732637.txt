While the language of quantum mechanics is written using fairly advanced math, I donâ€™t believe one has to read Japanese before you can appreciate Japanese art. Our journey will focus on the beauty of the quantum world.<p>If only Quantum Mechanics was like visual art. One will have to learn Japanese if they really want to understand the literature, say Japanese poetry. Sure, one can understand the dumbed down versions of the core concepts, but one cannot truely grasp the beauty or intricacy of QM without understanding the mathematical language. This is true for many other topics of physics as well.')
