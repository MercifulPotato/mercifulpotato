For example...<p>If the brand is good, the item is expensive, but it&#x27;s made in China and sold on Amazon, I try to avoid.  There&#x27;s some risk it will be money wasted on something that will last just 3-6 months.<p>Conversely if all of the above are true but the item is cheap, I&#x27;ll buy it from Amazon, enjoy their fast delivery, and simply build into my expectations and budget that it will need to be replaced in 3-6months.  This is what I&#x27;ve come to with headphones, for example.<p>On the other hand, if the item is made in (not just designed in, but made in) the US, Japan, Korea, Germany, or some other Western European countries, then it matters less what the brand or retail venue is.  For example, buying a room fan, power tool, or similar, I&#x27;ll look for one with a motor made in US&#x2F;Japan&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;etc.<p>These are the best signals I&#x27;ve found to be available atm.')
