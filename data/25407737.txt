I have yet to see anything that can touch my approach, especially under mixed read&#x2F;write workloads. I am able to write (small, &lt;4k) business entities to disk at a rate higher than the drives themselves are able to write blocks. This is not something that is feasible in <i>any</i> multithreaded storage architecture.<p>A secondary requirement is extreme simplicity and safety. My entire implementation is written in managed code and can be understood by a junior developer in one weekend. There is not a single line of code in support of a database feature that we aren&#x27;t actually going to use.<p>The final requirement is zero external cost to employ this code. If I own my database implementation, Oracle cannot bill me.<p>The nice-to-have is being able to follow a breakpoint all the way from user tapping a button down into the b-tree rotation condition logic in the database engine. It also makes profiling performance issues a trivial affair. I like being able to see the actual code in my database engine that is causing a hotpath. This visibility is where additional innovation is possible over time.')
