Every once in a while I pop in to get an idea of what’s happening in the world of BitCoin but it’s not something I really pay much attention to so I’ve definitely missed out on quite a lot of “big” news stories.<p>If anyone knows of good books or podcasts about the history of BitCoin and the various characters&#x2F;motivations involved I would be most interested in recommendations. Especially from the governance or legal perspective.')
