If I had to break it down, when I say &quot;habits don&#x27;t work&quot;, I mean &quot;habits that you consciously put effort into and construct will end up doing more harm to you if you are trying to make real change&quot;. When I say &quot;habits work if they&#x27;re not constructed&quot;, I mean that what people repeatedly do every day naturally, what those observing might call habits, are actually just natural extensions of the property of their minds, not necessarily consciously decided things.<p>People when talking about things they do on a repeated basis are not so explicit on whether they consciously chose and constructed it, or whether it&#x27;s something that they came to naturally. So habits are not just &quot;things that I decided to one day and spend effort into&quot;. Like most words, habit refers to both this definition and things that I found myself doing and ended up abstracting away. When someone says, &quot;fix your bad habits&quot;, they don&#x27;t mean habits in the constructed way.<p>What I mean by introspection isn&#x27;t deciding to form a habit. It&#x27;s kinda orienting yourself in the direction of understanding why you might perhaps do that habit. And this is not a simple question, nor does it have a simple answer. It might take years for a habit to naturally dissolve. But at least that is what I am getting at.<p>&quot;It would be amazing if habits magically emerged from comprehensive introspection&quot;<p>This is literally why I introspect. I have reasons to believe it works, but it sounds too good so whatever. From memory reconsolidation perspective and understanding of the mind as a system, there shouldn&#x27;t be any reason why you can&#x27;t form effortless good habits (and do effortless dissolving of bad habits). Note that, from my experience, this takes &gt; 3 years of moderate focus.')
