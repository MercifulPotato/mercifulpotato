I&#x27;m a high performer and am compensated super well. I&#x27;ve been told by others to &quot;shut up and do your job, your pay is fantastic&quot; but there is an inner yearning to help others be the best they can be and also compound the skills of a group to accomplish greater business goals, many of which I&#x27;m suffering to complete now under the tremendous stresses that seem unfair for one person.<p>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve been in this or seen this situation play out. Businesses stacking an impossible list of responsibilities on one person until they burn out and leave, then get replaced by a manager and 2-3 others.<p>So I ask, for those of you who have intentionally made the move, how did you do it? I feel like I can&#x27;t be any more transparent with the business that it&#x27;s the direction I&#x27;m looking for and that I will leave soon if it doesn&#x27;t happen. But then what, do I keep playing this game into perpetuity until my luck changes?')
