Item(by='GauntletWizard', descendants=None, kids=[24786133], score=None, time=1602748374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24785031, text='I’ve been pondering writing a kernel module that basically exposes the Golang TLS API (with hooks for things like CertPool and VerifyConnection) - so that rather than opening TCP sockets, you can open a TLS socket directly. There’s a lot of complication involved here, but having the TLS state inaccessible from userspace has a lot of desirable attributes.<p>Further on this line of thinking, it’s an entirely reasonable extension of the “secure bastion” on modern processors to allow for a temporary private key store - You load your private key into the bastion and get back a key handle, which can then be used to do TLS handshakes but only through the bastion. Once that’s done, recovery of the private key is impossible, only abuse of it by the kernel (by passing that handle to other processes)')
