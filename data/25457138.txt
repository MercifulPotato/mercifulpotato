Item(by='Kranar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608222926, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457019, text='I disagree that your sentence fragment is all the press release says. I believe the press release says a lot more, such as Robinhood making substantial amounts of money from pay for order flow and Robinhood executing orders at prices that are not only worse than what is available on the market, but also worse than competing brokers, and this in spite of the fact that Robinhood advertises this to the contrary.<p>These facts taken together can not be used to &quot;mean pretty much anything&quot;. These facts, along with the additional fact that the SEC is charging Robinhood of engaging in illegal activity, strongly suggest illegal activity involving pay for order flow that resulted in worse price execution to the customer.<p>If you think that means &quot;pretty much anything&quot; then we can simply agree to disagree on this matter.')
