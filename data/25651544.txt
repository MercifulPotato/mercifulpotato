Meaning even Syrian refugees who fled the country cannot find a proper job.<p>My understand is that &quot;a refugee&quot; and having residency (permanent or not) are two separate and unrelated things.<p>Refugee = outside your country for a specific set of reasons you can find on Wikipedia.<p>What I meant was that being a refugee doesn&#x27;t prevent EU companies from hiring you. I&#x27;m well aware of how terrible sanctions are, but not all EU countries have the exact same set of blockade&#x2F;embargo as American ones. In general, work laws and authorization between any two countries that don&#x27;t have explicit agreement tend to be difficult.')
