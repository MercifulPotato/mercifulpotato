In the 2000s, we were told that architects would design a system in UML, and thr machine would generate the code for it from the UML.<p>It fails every time with much wasted effort and gnashing of teeth. The reason is because once you&#x27;ve specified your requirements in enough detail for a machine to understand and reasonably act on, your spec -- or diagram, flowchart, whatever -- is isomorphic to constructs in some programming language. So you haven&#x27;t made code go away, only transformed it -- into something that is, all things considered, vastly more cumbersome than text to work with.')
