Teams should be working to improve their infrastructure so that on-call is less painful, not lobbying for additional pay because someone built a hard-to-maintain system.<p>Sometimes this is an &quot;up the chain&quot; type problem, but if the other engineers on the team don&#x27;t agree with you that the on-call rotation is too painful, it&#x27;s going to be hard to convince management that your judgment is correct.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to simply switch teams, my suggestion is to think of what engineering work you can do in order to improve the on-call experience. Then propose that you work on these projects, to your manager. Quantify the amount of engineering time and increased reliability your projects will save. In my experience it is far easier to get management to agree to a specific plan to improve the situation than to get management to find someone else to solve a problem for you.<p>Another idea - since you work at a large company, there are probably teams who handle this very well at your company. Infrastructure teams who have scaled components that in the past have been overloaded and now are widely used within the company, that sort of thing. Try asking for advice in a &quot;horizontal&quot; way, finding experts on other teams and asking how they have solved these issues in their teams. These &quot;horizontal&quot; experts will be able to give advice that&#x27;s specific to your company. This is especially true if your team is working on a product area and your coworkers are not specialists in making reliable systems, but your company has infrastructure specialists on other teams.')
