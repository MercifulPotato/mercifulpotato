However, WhatsApp constantly prompts every user to back up to the cloud, which is much less well secured.<p>Thus, it&#x27;s pretty trivial for the authorities to get to it there, I&#x27;m sure they can get into iCloud and Google Drive if they want to. It only takes one person in the conversation to have this option switched on. I think this is why WhatsApp doesn&#x27;t get so much flak from the authorities for having good E2E encryption.')
