Better memory bandwidth, AES-NI...for about the same wattage.<p>Seriously, go look at the benchmarks. For compression, a Ryzen 3600 is TWENTY times faster than a Pi4, just to give one example.<p>On top of performance you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with hardware consoles, slow disk IO, the network config would be virtual and have a fraction of the latency with much greater bandwidth...and 8x8GB of ram is far less flexible than 1x64GB of ram.<p>You could put the whole thing into sleep&#x2F;suspend mode when you aren&#x27;t using it, too.<p>Pi4s are cool but I&#x27;m so sick of people using Pi&#x27;s because they&#x27;re trendy and will get them attention, instead of them actually making sense for the application.')
