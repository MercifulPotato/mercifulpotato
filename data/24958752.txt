Presumably there is a significant threshold for spending 100’s of billions of dollars on a significantly improved nuclear stockpile.<p>Justifying it to the American taxpayer is meaningless when it’s hidden from them.  But, justifying it to Congress was just a question of pork spending which is really what the excessive nuclear stockpile was.
