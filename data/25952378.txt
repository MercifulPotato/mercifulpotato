Item(by='bscphil', descendants=None, kids=[25952450], score=None, time=1611883604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950751, text='&gt; a New York Times article on how difficult it is to cancel your Amazon Prime subscription without any mention of how difficult the New York Times makes it so cancel a subscription to their own service<p>Well, not only that, but things have gotten so bad that Amazon Prime is really not the best example. I actually just went through this process: I accepted a 30 day Amazon Prime free trial just before Christmas because I was going to be doing a lot of ordering. Of course I forgot to cancel it until a few days after the trial was up. So I went to go cancel it <i>and</i> try to get any money they had charged me back.<p>And... it wasn&#x27;t really that bad? From the main page, you click one link to manage your account &#x2F; Prime subscription. Another one link takes you to cancel the subscription. There are like three or so pages that explain the benefits you&#x27;ll be losing and allow you to back out, or choose options like &quot;cancel my subscription at the end of the month&quot;, or &quot;cancel it now and refund the money&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t describe any of this as dark-patterns because even if it&#x27;s manipulative it was at least very clear how to do what I wanted to do.<p>That the other thing, too. I was able to get $14 of the $15 monthly fee back when canceling - they didn&#x27;t try to pull any bullshit with that.<p>A couple of qualifiers: (a) yes, it could (and should) be better, and (b) I&#x27;m a California resident, so it&#x27;s possible they presented a different flow to me than to most other people.')
