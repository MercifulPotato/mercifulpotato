Working from home is definitely more difficult for some people&#x27;s work style than others, plus a ton of other factors like how well one&#x27;s home is suited to working in, how much skill a person has working in that environment, etc.<p>Time theft is a bummer, especially on the team-level where you just want to get things done. I wonder what causes it? Off the top of my head I can think of:<p>- People are naturally lazy (I really disagree with this, but it feels like the default &quot;robber baron&quot; answer)<p>- People are having trouble adjusting to different and various work environments (probably a good amount of this)<p>- The nature of how we work in America is fundamentally unnatural for many people, and the lack of supervision allows people to assume a better work&#x2F;life balance<p>#3 is maybe just my experience in the workplace, but it feels pretty true â€” I wonder how widespread that experience is.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m glad the pandemic forced many people to reevaluate what &quot;going to work&quot; looks like, and hopefully we settle on something closer to how we&#x27;d each like to work.')
