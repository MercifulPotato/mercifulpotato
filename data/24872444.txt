It&#x27;s cited to be part of a 1988 graduation speech at Bristol University, and appears to be more correctly &quot;live modestly and do serious things&quot;. As far as I can tell, no printed copy of that speech exists, so it&#x27;s all hearsay.<p>The closest I can get to an authentic citation is a quote of it by a colleague in an obituary published by the Royal Society[1]. It rings authentic, in that it seems like something that would be said in the context of a graduation speech, and as such it may not have left a written record.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vdocuments.site&#x2F;dorothy-mary-crowfoot-hodgkin-om-12-may-1910-29-july-1994.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vdocuments.site&#x2F;dorothy-mary-crowfoot-hodgkin-om-12-...</a>')
