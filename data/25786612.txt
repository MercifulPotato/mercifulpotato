What side projects are you developing? What are you applying to HN with?<p>A music composition mobile app designed to be a combination midi reel &#x2F; chart creator. Think ultimate guitar or iRealPro but you can also dictate how the chords should be voiced and which tones on which beats (so a midi reel with context aware highlighting). Beta in ~3 months, I&#x27;d love to connect with any interested testers! Trying to think if I should do paid, free with ads, or free with something like patreon<p>Tons of features working, just need to refine UI. Multiple voices and instruments, modal interchange, secondary dominant, and tritone substitution functionality. Android only atm because I don&#x27;t own an iPhone or mac and developing for that platform doesn&#x27;t sound fun.')
