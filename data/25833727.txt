For example, I search for tomato and I get #DC9385 which is a light rust color(?).  Maybe this is just what I think as the color tomato should be is different.  I would think a vibrant red. I know tomatoes come in different colors, but to me that is the color that immediately jumps to mind.  Cool idea though.')
