The idea that Bengal is historically a nation of low-caste Indians is 100% not the case. Bengal&#x27;s distinct identity goes back to the Vedic period of 1500BC - 500BC.<p>Its historic wealth predates Mughal era Bengal when Islam was introduced, and relates back to its historically rich breadbasket&#x2F;river delta land and strategic placement as a thalossocracy very well placed along the maritime section of the Silk Road.  Secondly, caste has always been somewhat complicated, and has a long history of systematically resistance in the Dharmic tradition in Bengal. That pertains to the historical development of Buddhism in the Maurya and Pala empires. To say it was &quot;low-caste Indians&quot; who converted to Islam to get out of the caste system that created the identity of &quot;Bangladeshi&quot; rather than competing ideological traditions (pro-Brahminical Old Vedic religion vs anti-Brahminical Buddhism) is really white-washing things. Islam&#x27;s interaction with greater South Asian religion and philosophy was a lot more syncretic than that. By the time it had gotten there, there were already existing religios traditions that had begun to explore an idea of a religion without caste against religion through caste.')
