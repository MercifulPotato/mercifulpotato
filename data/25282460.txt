Instead of my computer talking to yours, my computer logs into Facebook&#x27;s server and we communicate through Facebook controlled accounts. These big corporations control our accounts and identities and often our data too. They can censor us at their whims, serve us ads, and data mine us<p>* The decentralized vision failed because decentralized software is much harder to build than centralized software and servers are much harder for everyday people to operate than regular client operating systems<p>* It seems unlikely that these problems can be solved from within the current ageing technology stack, so what if we built a new tech stack - designed from scratch to make decentralized networked computing easier - where running your own server is no harder than running your own web browser or smartphone<p>* That&#x27;s urbit')
