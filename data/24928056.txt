Why is the military using training aids (that are theoretical and never supposed to be implemented remember) based on targetting their <i>own</i> civilian general population.<p>This should not be the role of the military, it should not even be in the list of aids. If you have to have stuff like that then at least make the training aids focus on psyops against populations of probable adversaries.')
