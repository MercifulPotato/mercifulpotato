Why should they emulate x86 ? Isn&#x27;t it easier to emulate arm64 linux instead ?<p>(I mean that arm64 binaries can run on arm64 devices. For example, consider wine which runs windows programs on linux&#x2F;macos. Only x64 windows apps can run on x64 wine and only arm64 windows apps can run on arm64 devices. To run x64 windows apps on arm64 devices,you need qemu&#x2F;other virtualization software)')
