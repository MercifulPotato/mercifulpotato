Item(by='JCharante', descendants=None, kids=[25898704], score=None, time=1611539930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25897746, text='&gt; One thing I dislike about language group classes is that you learn with other non-native speakers (and, in general, with the same experiences that you have).<p>&gt; In other words, you learn and re-enforce each others&#x27; common mistakes, misconceptions, mistranslated idioms, and ambiguities in the language that native speakers find instantly jarring. This worsens if the teacher is non-native: I wouldn&#x27;t place much value in such a class.<p>I absolutely second this as someone who has taken 3&#x2F;5 semesters of Chinese. Some classmate&#x27;s pronounciation is so objectively wrong that I have to pay attention for when they&#x27;re called on just to mute my volume output. Obviously I can&#x27;t do this in-person.<p>I&#x27;ve taken one-on-one courses in another language and it&#x27;s (believable I suppose) how much faster I&#x27;ve progressed.<p>Another fault is that some classes are structured so that nobody fails or falls behind (whether they&#x27;re night classes, at a school, or in a corporate environment). The fault with that is that many other subjects simply don&#x27;t care if 1&#x2F;3 of the class fails, but language group classes tend to go at the speed of the lowest individuals.')
