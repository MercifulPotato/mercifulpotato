I always drink water first thing in the morning in order to restore fluids after sleep.  I am also drinking coffee with milk, but no sugar.  Lastly, I am drinking some psyllium husk powder that I blend into a couple of mugs of water.<p>I take the psyllium husk at about 10am.  Then I have another coffee or two, but no meals until dinner time, about 6pm.<p>I started doing this just this week because my father had an angiogram which lead to the discovery that some of his coronary arteries where quite block with plaque.  This is disturbing for me as he has looked after himself pretty well for his whole life.  He&#x27;s not a smoker or heavy drinker, eats well, doesn&#x27;t snack, isn&#x27;t a sweet tooth.  And he has exercised consistently for his whole life.   And yet, his arteries are in shit state.<p>So I have to wonder if it&#x27;s genetic.  So I figure I&#x27;ll try to increase the soluble and insoluble fibre intake as it is said to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol.  I also want to drop a couple of kilos I&#x27;ve put on during lockdown.')
