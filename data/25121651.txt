Arriving at the time is optimistic, so I arrive 5 minutes later. I find staff juggling half a dozen (often more) devices, one per app, and converting them to whatever their internal order system is. Frequently they have entirely missed my order and who can blame them because they&#x27;ve gone from phone &amp; counter &quot;inboxes&quot; to more than you can count on one hand. You can ask staff which app tends to be most reliable and they&#x27;ll tell you which one they pay the most attention to and that has a hope of reaching parity with phone orders.<p>Delivery&#x27;s a little different of a beast, apps have made the market for that kind of service more &quot;liquid&quot; and responsive, but it remains to be seen exactly what the models look like without growth capital subsidies.<p>&gt; But like music, it won&#x27;t just go away, it&#x27;ll be a new business structure that perhaps dominates the industry.<p>If this is the comparison, then be afraid, because streaming has both destroyed a huge amount of value in recordings and redirected a significant portion of remaining value towards new middlemen.')
