I don&#x27;t even use social media outside of imgur and HN.  Its really getting annoying listening to whining about how so and so can&#x27;t use their favorite echo chamber any more.<p>What happened to the conservative stronghold position that companies can refuse service as they see fit?  Hell, isn&#x27;t jack a buddhist?  Maybe he&#x27;s just started banning stuff that offends his religious beliefs? (As far as I know, he&#x27;s still the majority owner of twitter, so he can basically call the shots.)<p>In short, there is no &#x27;right to be on XXX&#x27; (FB, twitter, whatever) and private companies can and will de-platform you for a variety of reasons.<p>ps - thanks for the link.
