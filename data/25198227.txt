The train actually makes sense to go in and out on a work day if I need to for some reason given how bad rush hour traffic is. But it&#x27;s a non-starter for an evening event. I just wouldn&#x27;t go in if you made it too hard for me to drive and park. (Which the city can absolutely do of course.)')
