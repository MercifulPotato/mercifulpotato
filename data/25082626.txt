How strong is the encryption? When Truecrypt when dark, that was a a sad day in the community.<p>But this just goes to show the sheer scale of Apple, and how much reach they have, that, even they, with all of their resources, talent, intelligence could not have foreseen their systems breaking up like this, over hash checking and providing a OSX update.<p>It really makes the whole scale of iphones, ipads and other apple devices out there really, scary.<p>It also highlights what you&#x2F;I don&#x27;t know about apple and the hardware I run.<p>Scary times in the world of tech, each advance we make, it seems ten steps backwards. All this discussion about human rights, but no discussion about keeping, securing and ensuring privacy.<p>Makes me wonder if it&#x27;s all a distraction.')
