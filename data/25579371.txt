The government was claiming that people with lactose intolerance cannot have a complete diet.</i><p>Keep in mind that lactose intolerance isn&#x27;t evenly distributed across the globe. People of Northern European extraction have the lowest rates, so the Standard American Diet overlooking or ignoring other extant USAian groups&#x27; dietary needs and constraints from consideration (however numerous they may be among the US&#x27; population) shouldn&#x27;t be too startling.')
