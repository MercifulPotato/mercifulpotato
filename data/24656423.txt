On top of that, the divide on the non user side about someone being a &quot;lawbreaker&quot;.<p>Just seems to cause a lot of division. On top of the illegality of harder drugs leading to the rise of cartels and gangs.<p>Just thinking out loud. What if the US said &#x27;screw it&#x27;, try making everything legal for 5-10 years, produce what it can locally, and just see what happens. The hope with this idea is that one could starve out the cartels while perhaps providing a path to rehabilitation.<p>All of that said, I am still a believer in the Rat Park experiment. If we solved some of our more real problems people perhaps wouldn&#x27;t need to turn to such substances, as examples by the reports of drug use increasing under lockdown conditions. Reality seems to match the experiment. The thing about that experiment, they found if the rat&#x27;s other needs were met (food, shelter, socialization) they actually would start to prefer normal water to drugged water again.<p>Hmmmmm')
