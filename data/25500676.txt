Item(by='marricks', descendants=None, kids=[25510435], score=None, time=1608591243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500386, text='&gt; And if people are so lazy that they drive around the parking lot instead of using the sidewalk, that reflects on them, not the sidewalk.<p>I think this reflects a lot of comments, &quot;American&#x27;s are lazy&quot; and &quot;Look at this german punks walking and respecting traffic laws!&quot; Is the argument US is just inherently lazy? Could there be something else at play? I think it&#x27;s just that when a use case isn&#x27;t a main focus of design those users will be stuck trying to hack the system or having a poor experience. USA isn&#x27;t designed for walkers most places, those people will behave &quot;badly&quot; because of it.<p>Also, yes there are strip malls that bad, I can show one but then we&#x27;ll be having pedantic arguments over &quot;hey if you walk an extra 600 feet you have a sidewalk!&quot; or something. Like, even the idea of a strip mall inherently is car centric, with most square footage devoted to parking and who wants to walk (or even drive!) through a parking lot.')
