Item(by='sethhochberg', descendants=None, kids=[25310623], score=None, time=1607110024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304561, text='With any online community the group who consumes is far larger than the group who contributes, and I suspect with Reddit the people who are looking for community (especially those participating in mostly text-based subs) are few and far between compared to the huge number of users who browse big subs &#x2F; the front page casually for memes, entertainment news, and cat pics.<p>The things which drive me nuts about the redesign are mostly things that drive me nuts because I comment far more than I post, and participate in a lot of discussion-heavy subs. Navigating comment trees is more difficult, lots more is hidden by default. Far fewer topics fit on a screen with the card-style layout that has huge previews. The old layout is information-dense, readable with minimal clicking to expand things, and fast.<p>But those are exactly the kind of changes that someone just browsing would be indifferent to, or even appreciate. The images&#x2F;videos they&#x27;re scrolling through are now big, front, and center. Many probably don&#x27;t ever venture into the comments to begin with, of if they do, they&#x27;re just seeing if the top comment is a good joke or not.<p>Wildly different use cases.')
