For example, if translating C, does the program rely on two globals sitting next to each other in memory? (Yes, this happens, I did it myself earlier in my career.)<p>I&#x27;ve done many translations of large programs from one language to another. This includes two large assembler programs that I didn&#x27;t write into nice, clean C. I don&#x27;t see any way a machine could determine what effects were important and what weren&#x27;t.')
