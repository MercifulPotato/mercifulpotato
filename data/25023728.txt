It absolutely depends that p and q are chosen at random, but besides that, should be basically uncrackable.<p>Please let me know if I am wrong (outside of a quantum computing breakthrough).<p>edit: I understand that p and q need to be large primes. But there are a gargantuan number of large primes. AFAIK, if 52 cards in a deck shuffled randomly outnumbers in possibilities than the number of atoms in the universe, than surely RSA beats that by many many orders of magnitude in terms of computational complexity even at 1024 key length?')
