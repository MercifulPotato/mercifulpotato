That didn&#x27;t work as well (But worked surprisingly well, especially compared to Win3.1 which came 5-6 years later and needed much more memory to be usable).<p>I suspect if Commodore&#x2F;Amiga had done a cheaper version and did not suck so badly at planning and management, we would have been much farther along on software and hardware by now. The Amiga had 4 channel 8-bit DMA stereo sound in 1985 (which with some effort could become 13-bit 2 channel DMA stereo sound), a working multitasking system, 12-bit color high resolution graphics, and more. I think the PC had these specs as &quot;standard&quot; only in 1993 or so, and by &quot;standard&quot; I mean &quot;you could assume there was hardware to support them, but your software needed to include specific support for at least two or three different vendors, such as Creative Labs SoundBlaster and Gravis UltraSound for sound).')
