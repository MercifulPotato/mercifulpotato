And I think the base ipad and&#x2F;or the ipad air are perfectly and totally fine for the kind of work that most people would do there (reading, annotating, some video watching). iPad Pros were useful once (when the basic ipad was a bit underpowered or had a worse screen, or no pencil support), but now their existence doesn&#x27;t seem so necessary to me (of course, it&#x27;s the usual Pro thing: maybe a lot of people don&#x27;t feel the need for a Mac Pro, and yet some people scream they TOTALLY want such a thing).<p>I think the iPad and the iPad Air are here to stay. I couldn&#x27;t swear about the iPad Pro. I&#x27;d really like to hear from iPad Pro power-users - what&#x27;s something that you can only get in a Pro?')
