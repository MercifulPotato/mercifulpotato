Item(by='RobIII', descendants=None, kids=[24676487], score=None, time=1601769417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24675016, text='&gt; You know what I want? Schemas.<p>I can see this work perfectly fine in typed languages like C#: `NestedText.Deserialize&lt;T&gt;(&quot;nestedtext&quot;)` where the deserialize method handles the actual mapping of nested text objects to `T` by providing the deserializer a class &#x2F; classes that handles the string -&gt; scalar(s) mapping for the given T. That would, sort of, function as a Schema.<p>I think the only thing, from glancing over the project, that would need to be supported to make this really useful is nested lists&#x2F;dictionaries. I don&#x27;t see how this can be done but maybe I&#x27;m missing it.')
