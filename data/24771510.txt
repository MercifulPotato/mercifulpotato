Inflation is a broad concept (well, actually, a set of different and interrelated broad concepts) with a number of <i>different</i> official government measures. The <i>most common</i> US government measure of <i>price</i> inflation, the most common kind people talk about, is the all items CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.) But there are <i>lots</i> of other inflation measures, including official government ones used for important purposes, like the CPI-W (Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) which is used as the basis for Social Security COLAs. And also frequently cited is the CPI-U for all items <i>excluding</i> food and energy.
