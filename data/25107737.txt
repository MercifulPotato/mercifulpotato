Item(by='3PS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605498438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107445, text='WSL2 has lots of benefits over a typical VM. It&#x27;s a lot faster than your average type 2 VM (e.g. VirtualBox), it cold boots quickly, and you can run servers on localhost out of the box and access them through a regular Windows browser. I enjoy using it for Jupyter notebooks.<p>Plus WSL2 has way better tooling integration than most VMs - Windows Terminal, VSCode, etc. work well. I&#x27;ve found the experience compelling enough that I don&#x27;t see much reason to dual boot Linux outside of CUDA applications (which are also supported now on Insiders.)')
