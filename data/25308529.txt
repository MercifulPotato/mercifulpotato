Mea culpa.<p>I do imagine that a high rise is going to be more dense than a Parisian 5-story. I understand that Parisian apartments are smaller and they aren&#x27;t going to have parking or on-site greenspace like a US high rise, but I would be surprised if they are still less dense. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t validate my original claim that Paris is sparser than US cities.')
