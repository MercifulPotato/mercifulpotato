They got to be the largest by providing a space for everyone.<p>So the ask here is &quot;please enforce the rules fairly the way you have always promised you would.&quot; Asking a business to deliver on the promises they&#x27;ve made and continue to make is not an entitled attitude.<p>After all, all these businesses are in complete control of what they promise. If they don&#x27;t like the old promise, they have a first amendment right to make a new promise that suits them better.')
