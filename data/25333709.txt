They are the ones relying on effectively free labor to protect the innocent.  In such a case blaming the free labor instead of blaming the ones relying on free labor seems to create some very bad incentives.<p>Personally I would prefer just having all new vulnerabilities immediately disclosed once found.  No selling, but letting people decide for themselves if they want to continue to use a product after someone has found a vulnerability.  I also think the incentives this creates would mean that Microsoft and similar shops would put more effort into testing their own software because they would no longer have the safety net of a grace period when someone finds a problem.')
