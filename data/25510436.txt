From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx, &quot;Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist societyâ€”positive humanism, socialism, Communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;Communism&quot; are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death&quot;.[36]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marxism#Communism,_revolution_and_socialism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marxism#Communism,_revolution_...</a><p>Within that framework, it sounds like surveillance capitalism is infinitely worse than surveillance communism, because the framework of surveillance capitalism exists only to exploit and commodify people, in order to sell them things.  Or worse, commoditize them in order to sell &quot;them,&quot; <i>i.e.</i> their data, to others whom the subjects of said surveillance never consented to share with.<p>OTOH, the hypothetical framework of surveillance communism would at least be intended to benefit society as a whole. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any contemporary thought on the matter, but Marx probably couldn&#x27;t have conceived of the type of mass surveillance we have today, which means he probably wouldn&#x27;t have understood the question straight away.')
