The posts I answered virtually said that the reason extremists still hold their extreme position is due to &quot;the left&quot; being too combative and being unable to create arguments to debate with the extremists. Note I&#x27;m not saying &quot;the right&quot; to refer to them.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;the right&quot; here. The right is too varied (as is the left). I&#x27;m talking about extremists.<p>I pointed out that some extremists are not even willing to listen to people on the right itself. Pence and Fox News are <i>definitely</i> not calling people &quot;idiot trumpsters&quot; and are still being attacked by them.<p>It&#x27;s not even a matter of the left trying to engage in discussion. People have screamed at me and called me &quot;sheeple&quot; for wearing a mask in the supermarket. How do you engage? I just left. Am I the cause of the problem for not speaking a word before or after the engagement?<p>The left can&#x27;t improve the situation by trying to debate with people that&#x27;s unwilling to debate in the first place, period.')
