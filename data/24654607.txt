The person who paid their dues to the prison system doesn&#x27;t have any options if they become unhireable solely due to people&#x27;s prejudices about their past. And at that point, what other option do they have other than turn their head towards crime again? Rent and bills aren&#x27;t gonna pay themselves.<p>Not the best solution, but I don&#x27;t think that denying someone a job based on your discomfort about their distant past is reasonable at all. Of course, as long as they weren&#x27;t in-and-out of jail multiple times for the same crimes, because that&#x27;s an indication that they are likely to re-commit.')
