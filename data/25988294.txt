Null characters in strings wreak all kinds of havoc on applications. Smuggling data in and out of somewhere because the validation only looks at the start of the string? Padding for fake checksums and signatures because half the string isn&#x27;t shown and is free game? Length screwups because strlen tells something different from the actual size? Of course one could disregard that as problems with legacy code, but it ain&#x27;t. Syscalls in most OSes only handle nullterminated strings. Same for a lot of network protocols where a null character is a terminator or separator.<p>And for what benefit? The only argument I&#x27;ve seen is &quot;UTF8 doesn&#x27;t forbid it&quot;. But that is quite weak, UTF8 doesn&#x27;t prescribe it either, and for the enduser the null character has no meaning or representation that is any use, beyond end-of-string. UTF8 absolutely works fine without null characters.<p>And if you really want arbitrary binary data, use a blob, that&#x27;s what thats for.')
