Two examples jump to mind.<p>I remember reading about early childhood education investments. When the program was completed they saw no measurable results so the program was cut. Researchers picked up the study years later and did follow-up and found dramatic improvements in the children that were a part of the program. \nNow if the measurement endpoint was set to the 2nd point, the program would have been viewed as a success, but we have, as a country, an incredibly short term view. It would be extremely challenging to find anyone in the US government that would have invested in the program if they were told the results wouldn&#x27;t be known for 40 years (positive or negative).<p>The second example is military spending. This spend is done to keep us &quot;safe&quot; (others would argue it has other purposes e.g. to fund the military industrial complex or as a tool for stimulus). But if we take it at face value that military spend is supposed to keep us safe, what would be the measurable goal?<p>I get the need for goals, but I think you need to understand the limitations. And I think we also need to focus on long term planning in this country.')
