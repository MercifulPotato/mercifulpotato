Nice to meet you!)<p>I am Paul, live in Russia, have 20+ years of programming and a balalaika under my belt.  My passion is to discover the world, in practical ways by creating value, and sharing best of what I&#x27;ve found.<p>Well, here is what I see coming for 2021, from my experience and current research.<p>1. The rise of indie hackers. It is already a reported trend in 2020, and in coming year or two will only strenghten, due to unfortunate but highly likely global recession. Millions of people will be urged to make a living by new ways, after demolition of what was known as &quot;jobs&quot;.<p>2. The rise of Telegram platform. +100,000,000 users just in January 2021, and Durov has already released import tools to make migration even easier. Also they is known to seek funding at the moment â€” and one may bring a hell crowd of new users if able to PAY for acquisition. Also Telegram announced more business-specific features, like those in Slack, which makes it more and more useful for work stuff. Besides, I am personally amazed at how well-thought and capable Telegram platform is, having a couple of years buliding chatbots, and seeing companies like WhatsApp or VK chasing to copycat its features.<p>I plan to start small, build in public, eagerly seek for feeback and share my findings. Everything is a hypothesis unless proven by the world out there.<p>My first practical hypothesis is a simple chatbot service that would help businesses of any size to communicate to their customers in Telegram. It allows an owner (indie hacker?) to set up a single, branded point-of-contact in Telegram for their audience, by few clicks, needing no coding skills (I&#x27;ll cover your back on these).<p>If you are interested in what&#x27;s next, feel free to follow me at the links I leave there below in first comment, and leave your feedback!<p>I wish you a great 2021!')
