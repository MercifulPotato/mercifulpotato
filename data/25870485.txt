The original social networks (BBS and chat channels, Usenet, etc) _were_ distributed, but it turns out that this made them easy prey for parasitic and toxic actors and all of the available tools to prevent this imposed asymmetric costs on the recipients and did not scale at all.<p>Distributed systems are easy, but making distributed communication systems not suck is incredibly hard.  The Internet is a distributed system that was a lot better before all of you showed up and cast us into the hell of eternal September.')
