I&#x27;m tired of fixing leaking pipes in mediocre code bases by people who aren&#x27;t passionate about what they do. I also find app development to be plain uninspiring and am constantly biting my tongue.<p>That&#x27;s called software engineering (programming + time + money + people + constraints)<p>&gt; I  want to develop a JS interpreter, a simple game engine, or even an app of my own interests.<p>That&#x27;s called programming (plain programming).<p>Obviously, programming is more fun that software engineering (in general). The classic story is: boy receives his first computer, discovers BASIC programming and fells in love with it. That&#x27;s what he wants to do for the rest of his life. Then boy becomes adult and needs money. So adult does software engineering (instead of programming) for a living.<p>Software engineering could be as you have described (very meaningless), but it can be the other way around. Like in many other aspects in life: Keep searching. This means: search for a better job&#x2F;company, start your own company, get into better projects, learn how to like more software engineering, do freelancing, etc.')
