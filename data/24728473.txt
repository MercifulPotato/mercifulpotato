Rather the extreme left are just hyper-aggressive in ways other parts of the spectrum aren&#x27;t, especially libertarians are not aggressive and they were traditionally a big bloc inside tech firms.<p>As for the belief that the left are intellectually superior, that&#x27;s not specific to tech firms. You get empty slogans about being &quot;reality-based&quot; from the left in all walks of life. It&#x27;s why the left are struggling so much with COVID and lockdown: it&#x27;s been chaos and incoherence from scientists&#x2F;academics from day one so people who define themselves as superior due to their higher faith in &quot;the science&quot; have been taking a self-image beating. Or simply have gone into denial about it.')
