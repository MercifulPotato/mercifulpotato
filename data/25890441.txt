Instead of Y working on a similar problem as X in another month, why not make X an expert in the thing so that everybody knows about him being an expert and consults with him on a regular basis.<p>Is it really better to have everybody a shallow experience with everything rather than have a few individuals with a deep expertise with a particular thing?<p>And to have a meeting every day to &quot;solve&quot; this non-problem (somebody not knowing who the expert is, or supposed to be) seems really inefficient.')
