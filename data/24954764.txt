Item(by='unabst', descendants=None, kids=[24955052, 24955269], score=None, time=1604174803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953866, text='&gt; Itâ€™s obviously a quick PR filler piece<p>Now that you&#x27;ve made up your mind, anything to the contrary is a conspiracy.<p>Did you actually listen to what Sean said? He starts by saying it&#x27;s wrong to hit women. He knows it&#x27;s wrong. What he&#x27;s saying is if a woman doesn&#x27;t know when to shut up, they could get themselves <i>slapped</i> and it wasn&#x27;t beneath him either. He&#x27;s justifying physical retaliation to verbal abuse. That&#x27;s very different from straight DV. In fact, maybe he doesn&#x27;t want any women to be slapped. Maybe they <i>do it to themselves</i> just as <i>he made you</i> publicly shame him?<p>Which brings us to another nuanced topic. Is public shaming non-violent?<p>Of course, maybe he hit first or just uses that as an excuse, who knows. His first wife&#x27;s autobiography has some dirt, but then again, was it PR filler to sell her book? Or maybe he never hit anyone in his life, but just said something he believed which just happened to no longer be in fashion.<p>My only point is, demonizing or idolizing is all absurd. It&#x27;s an act that only gets easier when nuance is removed and positions are deemed absolute. Because ultimately that&#x27;s what it is. Removal of all nuance.<p>Today it&#x27;s still okay by most for a woman to hit a man. Tomorrow will men get the justice they deserve? Also my 2yo hits me and I have video evidence. Should I hold on to it?<p>If someone needs help, let&#x27;s help them. Public shaming helps no one.<p>&gt; supposedly enlightened and fair minded Hacker News<p>I almost spilled my coffee.')
