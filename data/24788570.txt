I&#x27;d like a computer that doesn&#x27;t have a glowing screen and a tortured simulation of a space that doesn&#x27;t exist. Instead I would prefer that I could simply write on a sheet of paper under a calm lamp and move to the white board when I feel like it. I could use my voice if I needed to or gestures as my abilities allow.
