Most admit that they arenâ€™t selling and buying at higher and higher levels. That translates to very little cash to buy more. There is absolutely no way that these moves can be attributed to retail traders or short squeezes. The narrative that these are retailers causing every significant move higher and with every move the shorts are losing more and more is actually causing this bubble.')
