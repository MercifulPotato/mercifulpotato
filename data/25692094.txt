Nor did they arrive with zip ties to take hostages—didn&#x27;t you see the footage of those armed thugs sweeping the Senate chamber looking for potential hostages? Nor did they rampage through the building, with the intent of targeting specific politicians for violence.<p>They didn&#x27;t damage property, either. Nor did they impede the democratic process which we all put so much stock in. There&#x27;s just absolutely no equivalence between these two events. I don&#x27;t know if that was your intent or not, but there&#x27;s absolutely no comparison.')
