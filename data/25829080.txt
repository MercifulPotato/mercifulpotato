Because of the manufacturer program, I was still able to get it for $25. I dont know if that would be possible in the UK if the programs arent offered there.<p>Also, no waiting period other than the medicine had to be shipped from a specialty pharmacy that could deal with the temperature storage and handling requirements. There is a bit of a wait to see a specialist to actually prescribe it, but that varies by geographic region and specialty.')
