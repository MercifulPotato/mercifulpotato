If you search for the exact title of the article today, it&#x27;s invisible in Google. That wouldn&#x27;t particularly bother me, but there are low-quality ripoff pages that seem to have just auto-translated the text into a different (worse) version of English, and <i>these</i> show up. Is there any explanation of this?')
