But I wanted to at least drop a reply to express that while we and others may agree and disagree, discussions like this that are level headed and illuminating on both sides (I hope) are a treasure.  These are the kinds of threads I&#x27;d like to see more of on political submissions.  It seems most political threads are just people shouting past each other in some weird internet catharsis; neither side coming away with a better understanding of the other&#x27;s worldview.  Even a short 1 minute clip can be viewed so drastically differently by different people.')
