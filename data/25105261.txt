I&#x27;ve tried it, and I really struggle to make any progress. I also make art and usually that&#x27;s where my productive free time goes. And switching off the artistic side is bad for me, mentally. Side projects and art draw from the same pool of mental energy as my day job and they both get the back seat, unfortunately.<p>That&#x27;s part of why I would really like to make a clean break... I just can&#x27;t do the weekend warrior thing')
