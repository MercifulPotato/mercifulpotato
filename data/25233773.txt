The culture is rotting up on both sides of the fence. Companies can&#x27;t force people to give a shit because they surely know how to fake it if required to and companies can&#x27;t change their principles because the sole principle, profit making cannot be changed. What sort of works is propaganda. There are always young people who are gullible to give their heart and souls for companies who don&#x27;t really give a shit. \nSome companies give a shit at the beginning but after becoming profitable they end up not giving a shit')
