It is complex, will take plenty of time and effort but you can. And that is what open means.<p>Now if you complain about complexity that&#x27;s another thing. Yes it is complex a lot. But it did evolve this way for some reason. Our communities, desires, tools, problems, they are all complex and that&#x27;s why web is also complex. But if you don&#x27;t like the complexity you can use only subset of the technologies. You can read only plain HTML blogs on web and don&#x27;t use any eshops for example. Or not use technology or even web at all.')
