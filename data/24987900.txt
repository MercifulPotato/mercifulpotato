But I think some basic automatic systems to at least add the new releases from major labels is needed for such database.<p>I personally have a better experience on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musicbrainz.org&#x2F;</a>. It suffers the similar problem mentioned above, but much better. At least most of &quot;mainstream&quot; artists I checked, it has complete or close to complete discography. It is also a more &quot;ambitious&quot; database, which has data for each track, recording (my fav part), etc.')
