Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=[25301530], score=None, time=1607082190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300696, text='The description of S15 gives a plausible explanation of why the effect is much less for some of these city than for Jena. Of course this is speculation but this doesn’t mean that fig S15 disproves the paper’s finding. And for Jena the effect is extraordinarily strong, and well controlled for. I’m not aware of any alternative explanation (to mask-wearing) which could explain this effect, and until I hear such an explanation I consider this strong evidence for the effect of mask-wearing on COVID-19 transmission. This study isn’t the <i>only</i> evidence for the effectiveness of mask-wearing but it’s certainly <i>part</i> of the overall evidence, and I’d like to hear better arguments for calling it “bad”.')
