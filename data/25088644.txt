How are you doing that? Also, do you version control your notes?<p>&gt; What does not work great is on the phone<p>I maintain an open source project called Dnote (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dnote&#x2F;dnote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dnote&#x2F;dnote</a>) which solves this problem for you. It&#x27;s basically a command line notebook using SQLite + a mobile friendly web interface to which you can sync your notes.<p>Agree with you that we should avoid being locked into a proprietary formats or platforms. Businesses and platforms come and go, but our notes should stay as readily accessible as possible.')
