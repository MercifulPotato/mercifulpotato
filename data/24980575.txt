Item(by='slantyyz', descendants=None, kids=[24980963], score=None, time=1604417889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980285, text='&gt; It tells you if the person can&#x27;t communicate beyond bullet points in a resume.<p>I guess it depends a lot on the industry. Most of the cover letters I&#x27;ve seen when hiring are following a template or pattern gleaned from a website or book telling you how to write a cover letter.<p>Also, you&#x27;re never 100% sure that a job seeker didn&#x27;t get someone to help them write the cover letter or if it&#x27;s copypasta.<p>Admittedly, if I was looking for a job, I&#x27;d provide a cover letter just to satisfy arbitrary expectations, but I hate writing them. All I do these days is regurgitate the list of the advertised requirements and for each item, indicate if I meet, have comparables or don&#x27;t meet it. It beats having to come up with a bunch of made up platitudes about why they should hire me.<p>In the same vein as cover letters though, I don&#x27;t put much weight on post-interview thank-you letters.')
