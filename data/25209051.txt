People already know, love, and have installed these tools. It adds significant friction to expect everyone to use the tools you want, especially if they don&#x27;t share certain values around technology, or if they&#x27;re slow to adapt to new user interfaces.<p>I wish for a videoconferencing tool that:<p>- Built on open standards and runs fine on browers<p>- Is licensed Apache 2.0, MIT, or 3-Clause BSD<p>- Has slick native apps across GNU&#x2F;Linux, MacOS, and Windows<p>- &quot;Host yourself&quot; server that scales horizontally, allowing \nme to throw more servers at this<p>- Supports screen sharing, recording, and transcription or integration with a 3rd party service<p>- Has an open chat API that allows you to hook up custom bots during meetings (Zoom is lacking this feature, but it&#x27;s very important to me)<p>- Has other APIs build into the core workflows of conferencing, not implemented as an afterthought<p>- Supports an operating mode up to 100 simultaneous connections of HD video and audio<p>I would pay $30&#x2F;mo per &quot;host seat&quot; for a SaaS implementation of the above.')
