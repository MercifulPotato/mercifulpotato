It’s only become an issue now, and attracted a nice term for it.<p>I’ll skip the issue that one side isn’t really there for a conversation in the first place.<p>Instead I’ll demonstrate that the cable news era already built its own filter bubbles and significantly reduced the ability for one side (the left) to Influence the other (the right).<p>I clearly remember that climate frauds were given air time on Fox. When that air time resulted in politicians pushing anti climate views, actual climate scientists came to FOX to make their case. Instead they were faced with ridicule, in the same way that throwing people to lions was a fun spectacle for the audience.<p>This ability to divide reality kept evolving till America showed the world that its possible to undo science. Remember Creationism? An anti science argument, designed to confuse children and adults with the goal of disproving evolution!<p>“Teach the debate”, that most fraudulent of arguments, implying that scientific debates on evolution meant that evolution itself was not a solid idea.<p>And it worked!<p>When the right filter bubble avoids reporting things in a manner that allow for a fair middle ground to be reached, then what?<p>I’ll tell you now, you need to remove money from the news, which even to me sounds like an insane idea.<p>I would heartily recommend that people stop worrying about deplatforming. It’s worked great for the American Right. While people here may decry Trump, he managed to snag 2 SC seats, unknown numbers of other judges, defunded everything, fought China, and even today has a 42% approval rating!<p>MORE people came out to vote for Trump this election than they did when he ran against Hillary.<p>Worry instead that deplatforming <i>works</i>.<p>And then realize that while this will go on to be a massive comment thread, there are entire countries under the thumbs of despots or regions ruled by local leaders who never get heard about, and who will never get deplatformed, because it will never get the attention of the people running Twitter&#x2F;FB.')
