As in, I can&#x27;t simply download the backup file and access the messages and media?<p>My understanding is that in order to restore&#x2F;access said messages and media, you would need the SIM&#x2F;phone number that created the backup file and would have to register again with WhatsApp to receive a decryption key from WhatsApp servers. So doesn&#x27;t this mean in effect that even though it&#x27;s not super secure, the backup file stored on iCloud&#x2F;GDrive is also protected from Apple and Google&#x27;s prying eyes?<p>EDIT: For anyone interested, the backups are indeed encrypted.
