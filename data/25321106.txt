I&#x27;m seeing R$50&#x2F;kg on an ecommerce site, that&#x27;s like like $5&#x2F;lb. I&#x27;ll try to get a better price quote tomorrow. You can&#x27;t have too many of them anyway, it can cause quite a movement of the bowels.<p>Caju nuts I&#x27;m assuming are expensive because they are mostly exported. It&#x27;s probably the same as arabica coffee in Colombia, it&#x27;s too good to consume domestically.<p>Caju fruit you&#x27;re probably right, does not travel well. Same as açaí, that won&#x27;t go far without refrigeration or freezing.')
