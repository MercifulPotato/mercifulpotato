We&#x27;ve seen the exact same dynamic play out with Amazon and its products. It&#x27;s only this year that Apple has allowed third party apps to serve as replacements for its default web browser and other apps on iOS. This particular kind of anticompetitive behavior definitely meets the standard of negatively affecting consumers because of the extent to which it intentionally limits the end-user&#x27;s ability to choose the competition.')
