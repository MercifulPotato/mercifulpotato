Granted, Polish winters are not as bad as Siberian (-32Â°C is the lowest I experienced).<p>My friends and colleagues from the south (or even US) always ask me, why I dislike winter -- &quot;I should already be used to it&quot;.<p>I doubt you can ever get used to it, but we&#x27;ve insulated our houses well and have good heating system (especially in dense cities). And you&#x27;d usually try to escape the cold as often as possible, mostly spending winter inside.<p>On the other hand, an additional negative of winters (or late autumn) is the heating makes the indoor air &quot;thick&quot; and unpleasant. You need to ventilate the room every hour or so. It&#x27;s really tedious. During summer, you&#x27;d just leave your windows open whole day and have a nice air exchange.')
