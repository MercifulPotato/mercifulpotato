I recall some analysis that the froth in the market is being driven by (1) reduced spending -&gt; increased investing, at least for those who kept their jobs (2) cancellation of sports, leading to more speculation as a substitute form of entertainment.<p>If that&#x27;s correct, then yeah, we could potentially see a slide. I suspect it won&#x27;t be massive, and it could be counterbalanced by economic growth that happens at the same time due to the reopening. Don&#x27;t forget that the stimulus&#x2F;bailout&#x2F;money-printing is also driving the market up too.')
