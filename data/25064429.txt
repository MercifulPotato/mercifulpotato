What you look at is round trip latency required for a threshold of underruns&#x2F;missed deadlines. Threading requires additional latency, and process synchronization even more. While I&#x27;m sure you report fewer underruns when splitting off into sandboxed plugins I&#x27;m suspicious if it&#x27;s hitting the same performance as doubling or tripling the buffer size in terms of latency in the first place.')
