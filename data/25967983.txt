They will be pitched in order to get users to sign up in whatever way they can drive taps through consent screens.<p>So unfortunately to remain a user choice, there needs to be a strong disincentive for parties to force a customer into a third party store, but not so strong that it looks like antitrust.<p>Google Play for instance has tons of &quot;Play Services&quot; which are not available to apps from alt-stores.<p>The Mac has certain security settings which can only be disabled through a process requiring a reboot and command-line action as a way to limit vendors from driving customers through disabling essential security features without proper education.<p>Mac applications are also notarized, so whether they are downloaded through the official app store or a third party channel they can be scanned for static issues and revoked after the fact as malware in the case of dynamic issues.')
