When I was renovating my 100 year old house I discovered that behind the weatherboards&#x2F;clapboards was a layer of old, mostly broken asbestos panelling. I called a specialist disposal firm and they quoted two prices - one for internal removal (I was only renovating the inside) and the other for external. External is a lot cheaper - for internal removals they have to seal off the rest of the house and place air quality monitors and check them for some time after the removal to make sure that there are no loose particles floating around. So it was cheaper to finish redoing the plasterboard inside the house, then remove all of the external weatherboards, have them come and do an external removal, and then rebuild with new weatherboards. The price difference made it worth it, even including buying all new weatherboards!')
