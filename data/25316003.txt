What would an educational program for this look like?  What would it look like for all ages, and cultures and how could we make it universal?  Is it even possible?<p>I feel the best way to harness the power and control the outcome in the longest run is to evolve our understanding with intent.<p>Because absolute freedom means without restriction and can tend towards chaos, how do we train humanity???<p>Maybe I&#x27;m on a tangent but I am not sure how to answer this question myself.<p>One thing that came to mind was secular ethics but that is far too complicated to teach directly.  And I am not sure if there is any cultural bias in that idea as well.<p>I guess I&#x27;m thinking.. teach, learn and evolve while trying not to force control.  I realize even writing it how impossible that sounds, but should we put our energy into cracking this problem?')
