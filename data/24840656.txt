Item(by='bichiliad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603217933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838348, text='I think punishing one person (or even a group of people) is an ineffective tool. If someone gets fired for this, maybe we&#x27;ll feel better, but I&#x27;m sure the cumulative tracking data would be worth it, and it wouldn&#x27;t change their motivations for doing these sorts of things. It&#x27;s similar to punishing an engineer for pushing a commit that causes an outage. They didn&#x27;t come to work planning on an outage, and they probably didn&#x27;t think they were going to cause an outage up and until the outage happened. If you fire them, you&#x27;re doing nothing to prevent that outage from just happening again with someone else later.')
