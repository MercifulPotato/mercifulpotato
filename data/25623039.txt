Backups take care of that as well as other threats like theft, fire, accidental deletion.<p>This is similar to my reasoning around the recent side channel attacks on intel CPUs. If I had a choice I’d like to run with max performance without the security fixes even though it would be less secure. Not because I don’t care about security but because 1% or 5% perf is a lot and I’d rather simply avoid doing anything security critical on the machine entirely than take that hit.')
