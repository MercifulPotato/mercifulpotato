Ideas are worthless.  What you want are opportunities.<p>Here’s the difference:<p>“I think people would buy a screwdriver with a built-in hammer”<p>“I just spoke to company XYZ and they would buy 1,000 screwdrivers with integrated hammers if we made them”<p>The difference is obvious to anyone.  You can execute like a star on the idea and make it if you get lucky and a market exists.  The opportunity only requires “minimum viable execution” to capture it.<p>One is a push, the other a pull.')
