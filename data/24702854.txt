Adding touchpad gestures needs changes in every GUI toolkit library except GTK and every application we would like to support. So I trusted my own experience of seeing the amount of effort needed to contribute an improvement for niche use cases. To make matters worse, an initial OK from a maintainer often does not really mean a lot. What matters is the actual time commitment to discuss design and review patches. Issues that increase the amount of effort needed for long-term maintenance and end-user support tend to decrease maintainer engagement a lot. Wayland-only touchpad gestures splits the user-base long term and thus fits this criteria very well.<p>At this moment I&#x27;m not really sure if I would go the same path had I knew all the information I know now. Having said that, we&#x27;ve only spent around a single man-month of effort working on this. In the grand scheme of things this detour is tiny.')
