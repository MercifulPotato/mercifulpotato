This anecdote will sound a bit insane out of context, but my dad would sometimes walk up to the door and lock it when guests wanted to leave, begging them to stay and eat more food.<p>You are correct that it is indeed rooted in politeness and hospitality, but I think what sets taroof apart is how much further it can go.')
