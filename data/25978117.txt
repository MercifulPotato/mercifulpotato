If you&#x27;re rendering a PDF everything starts out in vector space and there&#x27;s nothing special about 1x and 2x. It may very well be that 1.5x is the scale at which the PDF line becomes pixel aligned. You just don&#x27;t know. But the app might know, and that&#x27;s the point. Asking it to do 2x and then scaling by a factor it&#x27;s not aware of is strictly worse than giving it all the information to make good decisions.<p>&gt; If you get a 133px box, you are cutting off pixels at the bottom.<p>No you&#x27;re not. You&#x27;re just sizing the window to integer pixel sizes. Just like every X WM and Wayland compositor does. Just like sway doesn&#x27;t let you do a 133.333px window in 1x it shouldn&#x27;t let you do one in 1.5x. But it does, so the whole desktop is not pixel aligned, not even the start of the windows.<p>&gt; Edit: What you are asking is possible, right now. Just leave your primary display at 1x scale, change the secondary to 11&#x2F;15 scale, and then turn up the sizing in your applications. It&#x27;s actually better that nothing is needed in the Wayland protocol to do that.<p>This is precisely what I do. Increase the font scale in GTK and the interface scale in Firefox. That this gives me better results than the current solution is evidence that it can be done better. Unfortunately it breaks down in mixed-DPI situations.')
