Think about what a massive transfer of wealth that would be, compounded over the century and a half since.<p>It enriched a relatively small but very wealthy planter class, but there&#x27;s a very strong argument to be made that it prevented economic development in the South. At the very least, something has to explain why the northern states economically developed so much more rapidly than the South during the first half of the 19th Century, and slavery is a very likely explanation.')
