Keep in mind that sfp+ transceivers are &quot;branded&quot; - in that you have to buy the right sfp+ transceiver to match the brand of switch or interface you&#x27;re using.  For instance, intel NIC&#x27;s generally require intel &quot;marked&quot; transceivers etc.  They last a damn long time though.  Those small MikroTik switches are also awesome!')
