I often run both my home Win10 PC and corporate Win10 laptop for weeks and they never force reboot. But rebooting to update at least once a month or so is just a sane thing to do. On laptops especially, they start to overheat a bit after prolonged heavy usage and it is good to spin them down sometimes. Sure, it would be nice to have in service updates on Win10, but that is a minor annoyance compared to breaking issues on Linux desktops.')
