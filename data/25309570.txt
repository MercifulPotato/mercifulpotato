Item(by='jstgord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607123471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302527, text='no.<p>A better first-order approximation to reality, is &quot;Billionaires Exploit&quot;.<p>A second order approximation is that Billionaires exploit a) the political system by funding politicians indirectly so they will implement policies that enhance profits, b) poor employees by paying them a wage they cannot live on without government subsidies while keeping them in precarious arrangements to avoid union benefits and c) natural resources by avoiding costs which should be inherent [ eg. defer cost of redressing carbon pollution and recycling ].<p>Paul meets the best kind of proto-billionaire - innovators who aspire to _make_ something useful, or at least something that people want - and perhaps doesn&#x27;t get to interview the appalling idle-rich dynasty billionaires who inherit obscene wealth, and cannot spend money faster than it grows.<p>We should not be congratulating Gates on investing money in Vaccines - we should have taxed him properly and used that money to fund vaccines&#x2F;healthcare and climate initiatives.  Then perhaps the 15 copies of windows &#x27;tax&#x27; - which I paid for but never used because I installed linux - would be distributed democratically.<p>Look around.. what part of the world is not on fire ?  Startups are not the solution to our current evils.  I would suggest that we have abandoned the fair rules that governed our economy, and our democracies, weakening our systems and institutions - and this has put us in peril.<p>Covid is merely a kick-the-tyres test before the real game of climate change, and we have failed that test.  The pandemic has exposed dire systemic weaknesses.  If one 9&#x2F;11 per day of aunties dying is not enough to wake us up, will the permanent melting of the ice caps even be noticed ?<p>Printing digital cash to prop up stock prices is a great way to get us through a pandemic induced economic shock, but we need to learn from this quickly, and rebuild our institutions - a free market works only if people can trust that the rules of the market are fair.  We must rapidly align the engine of enterprise to our global survival : tax the uber-rich brutally, spend it wisely in the war on climate change.')
