Replacing classism, racism, etc with an -apparent- meritocracy helped the middle class to swallow continuing inequality: instead of keeping the poor folks out - we kept the uneducated out - forgetting the two groups overlap heavily. The number of people my age who speak of their high-end expensive education as if it was entirely merit based (“you have no idea how hard we were worked to get our Degrees!”) always irks me. The worlds best philosophers probably never had a chance to learn to write, the worlds best leaders enough to eat, etc.<p>As a non-college graduate who’s career is going fairly well, I can only hurry to gather as much capital as I can before a real meritocracy emerges: I am not a genius, and there are enough poor geniuses with less opportunities than me to eclipse me many times over.')
