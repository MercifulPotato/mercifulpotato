Can&#x27;t see this getting very far if it isn&#x27;t open source, but it seems like something similar could scratch an itch I&#x27;ve had for a while (detailed below).<p>-----<p>I love using my iPad to consume content, but damn do I sometimes wish I could just use a real desktop on it. With some caveats, of course:<p>- Without needing an internet connection&#x2F;AP\n- At least some kind touch support* (clicking, scrolling, gestures, etc.)\n- Consistent, dependable graphical fidelity&#x2F;performance\n- Easily portable\n- Quick to instantiate\n- Clean-yet-functional UI*<p>I&#x27;ve tried some wireless AP&#x2F;bridge setups on a Pi4 and VNCing into it via my iPad, but they&#x27;ve been not-so-satisfactory for a few of the reasons listed above. Haven&#x27;t given up on it -still researching&#x2F;fiddling around - but definitely the biggest hurdle is going to be the UI. Gotta find that balance between functionality, simplicity, and aesthetic - preferably out of the box. Not something Linux is particularly known for.<p>*i.e. simplified desktop&#x2F;application UI so that I can do most everything using the touchscreen (in addition to the keyboard&#x2F;mouse), but can still access the advanced functions, even if those specifically are only optimized for mouse&#x2F;keyboard. Ideally I&#x27;d be able to show&#x2F;hide functions arbitrarily in the simple mode based on if I do&#x2F;don&#x27;t use them. Tiled WM or similar for single-app or split-pane view mode.')
