Eg voyager appear to travel now at less than  0.00006 <i>c</i> (16 km&#x2F;s). Than turns 100k light years into ballpark 150 M year journey (no it doesn&#x27;t its 1.8 bn years as mentioned in reply) . Still possible to cross 10.000 times - but that would be a straight line. I suspect the distances will grow somewhat fractally if you want to swing by any stars? (ed: so, not really very likely at all)')
