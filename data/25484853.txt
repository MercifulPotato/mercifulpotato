Thus, RISC-V was designed in a way to accommodate such co-processors, with limited instruction sets that make its CPU design simpler.<p>The Apple ARM processor is also similar - the ARM system-on-chip they have designed is highly customised with many co-processors all optimised for the macos &#x2F; ios platform.<p>Apple&#x27;s SoC contains a GPU, an image processing unit, a digital signal processing unit, Neural processing unit, video encoder &#x2F; decoder, a &quot;secure enclave&quot; for encryption &#x2F; decryption and unified memory (RAM integrated) etc. (Note that this is not a unique innovation - many ARM SoCs like these already exist in different variations. In fact, it&#x27;s what made ARM popular.) Obviously, when a system software or application uses these specific units of an SoC to process specific data, they may be faster than a processor that doesn&#x27;t have these units. And Intel and AMD processors currently don&#x27;t have these specific units integrated with their CPU.<p>Anyway, the point the article is making that the RISC-V architects recognized that such co-processors will be the norm in the future, and thus the author is predicting that RISC-V will become more popular, now that the M1 acts a showpiece for the architectural idea the RISC-V wants to popularise.')
