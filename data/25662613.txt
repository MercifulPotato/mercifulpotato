To me, there&#x27;s a point that you can build products from assumptions. You&#x27;d be trading risk (less validation) for speed and perhaps focus, which isn&#x27;t inherently wrong.  But most importantly you shouldn&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s unbiased, user-driven, or that there aren&#x27;t blindspots. And you shouldn&#x27;t use personas as the tool of choice in that case. The distinction is rarely made though and problematic.')
