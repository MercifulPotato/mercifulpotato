You have the most important choice of all: Just don&#x27;t buy Apple.<p>For everyone else, assume they&#x27;ve already made that choice and are very comfortable with Apple&#x27;s strategy of curating everything on the machine, not because they are evil or control-freaks, but because they do genuinely want the platform as safe and high-quality as they can make it. Whether it works or not is perhaps a matter of opinion, but if it&#x27;s not your opinion, move along. No need to spend the days fussing about things you don&#x27;t own.')
