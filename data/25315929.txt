It&#x27;s a complete tutorial compared to most you&#x27;ll find online that either quickly go from &quot;here&#x27;s how to start&quot; to &quot;now here&#x27;s us generating lisp functions from specifications&quot; or never move past the &quot;here&#x27;s how to start&quot; portion.<p>And like all the Schemer books, it&#x27;s a pretty pleasant and easy read. You can go through a chapter sans computer and then revisit it with the computer (I read it while traveling so half the time I was reading, my computer wasn&#x27;t readily available).')
