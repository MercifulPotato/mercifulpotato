In my case, I&#x27;ve lost all my savings and much more, but I&#x27;ll not compare my situation to yours, that would definitely not help you. Only you know your own situation and what you&#x27;re feeling.<p>People will say that you might not have what it takes to be a successful startup owner. That may be true, but people often forget that there are other kinds of companies than startups, and you can perform really well even if you don&#x27;t meet Paul Grahamer criteria for successful founders.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a regular job and planning to come back within a year or so. But I&#x27;m not taking that as a hard requirement -- I&#x27;ll assess the situation by then and decide if it&#x27;s really a good idea.<p>I&#x27;ve come to realize that myself and my weaknesses are really big competitors of mine, and I&#x27;ll try to manage them properly. I&#x27;ll separate some money that I won&#x27;t care too much if I loose -- I believe that that will help me to manage my own anxiety and the truckload of poor decisions I make after months of anxiety and stress.<p>And I&#x27;ll hire a salesperson to help me on this. Many say this is bad idea, that you yourself have to sell your product and so and so, and I thank you all for the advice but I&#x27;m not following it this time and OK.<p>I&#x27;ll work on presenting myself a bit stronger to people. It&#x27;s interesting how condescending people become when they see that you are performing bad. They start to patronize you and feel overconfident to give terrible ideas. I don&#x27;t blame them too much but, even to be fair to myself, some pieces of bad advice contributed to make my situation a bit worse.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning to do, see if it helps.')
