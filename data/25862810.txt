In biology, something that’s expensive has to translate to fitness advantage. Human mind gave humans an ultimate advantage when it comes to survival. All doom and gloom aside, we’re the only species that could potentially survive total annihilation of the planet. It’s not inconceivable that people could design the technology to sustain a civilization in space.<p>That’s why I think any intelligent species use their mind to build things and expand their knowledge about the universe.
