Are you trying to say that Stripe is violating their own policies by offering a clearing-house API to facilitate their customers getting loans from banks?&quot;<p>I think your parent is expressing (among other things) frustration about the fact that Stripe is presenting this product as a very modern, very Internet-based, very progressive product that we expect will be governed by the same kind of opaque, sometimes capricious enforcement of ToS&#x2F;AUP that google uses to unexpectedly lock people out of their gmail accounts or &quot;de-monetize&quot; their youtube accounts for no discernible reasons ...<p>... but at the same time, this isn&#x27;t a free email account and it isn&#x27;t a video service - it&#x27;s serious, grownup business involving real money.<p>So the question becomes, what kind of people are manning the back end infrastructure and how much of it is driven by algorithms ?  As your parent describes, he can go to an <i>actual bank</i> and sit down with a <i>real employee</i> and have a substantive conversation with nuance and understanding ... which you can&#x27;t have with an algorithm.')
