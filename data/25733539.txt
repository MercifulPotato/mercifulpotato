The post below is an answer to &quot;Parler is refusing to moderate&quot;.<p>This is false. Parler has also been banning accounts explicitly calling for violence. I encourage you all to read the complaint:<p>&gt; AWS knew its allegations contained in the letter it leaked to the press\nthat Parler was not able to find and remove content that encouraged violence was\nfalseâ€”because over the last few days Parler had removed everything AWS had\nbrought to its attention and more.<p>I know my word probably doesn&#x27;t mean much to you, but I verified this personally - almost all of the &quot;example&quot; violent post I could find on the news were all deleted and the accounts were banned before Parler was taken down.')
