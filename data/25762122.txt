Crippling it is stupid. And that is exactly why people are very pissed at Apple for doing so.<p>&gt; Apple did not “deliberately cripple” the firewall.<p>Yes, they did - they crippled all APPLICATION firewalls. An application firewall controls what apps can access the internet. By deliberately creating a new API with a BACKDOOR to allow some Apple apps to connect to the internet, and forcing all firewalls to use only that API, Apple is intentionally crippling them.<p>&gt; they made the decision to exempt core services which are either unsafe to disable or only have effect when you voluntarily opt-in<p>There are many who have been using such Application firewalls for years together, on previous versions of macOS, blocking such &quot;core&quot; services that they don&#x27;t care about ... they are &quot;core&quot; only to Apple, not for users who don&#x27;t use it.<p>&gt; The question you should be asking is how often that would stop an attacker because they wouldn’t have permission to disable your local firewall rules.<p>This is just a diversionary argument from the fact that crippling firewalls and giving default internet access to some apps actually weakens the overall security of a system.<p>&gt; This kind of local firewall is appealing for giving the illusion of security<p>There is no illusion - if you don&#x27;t use iCloud, Maps, App Store etc., they don&#x27;t need to unnecessarily connect to the internet and waste our bandwidth, or worse access and transfer our personal data. The same applies to any app on your system. Their job is to block internet access to specified apps and modern application firewalls do this in a user-friendly.<p>It is gross abuse by Apple to cripple this ability in their OS.')
