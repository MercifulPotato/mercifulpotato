Why that didn&#x27;t happen today will be interesting to investigate. We all probably have a theory, but what comes out of the inevitable hearings on this will be interesting to see.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;us-capitol-violence-history-trnd&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;us-capitol-violence-histor...</a>')
