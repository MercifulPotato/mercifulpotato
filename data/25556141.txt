[0]<p>I was 17 years old and a member of the Paisley Rocketeer&#x27;s Society [1] - one of the oldest model rocket clubs in the world, led by the late John Stewart.<p>Gyroc 1&#x27;s vectoring was accomplished by controlling a model rocket engine by way of 2 axes controlled by a gyroscope. Subsequent Gyrocs have been made and flown.
