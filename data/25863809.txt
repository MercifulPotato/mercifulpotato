When that begins to creep towards 40,000 you will have a failed drive sooner than later.<p>As for the rest of the counter, raw read error rate, relocated sector count and friends are also good indications that your drive might not be in the best shape. They don’t say anything about when it will fail though. I’ve had a drive rack up 20 relocated sectors in a couple of weeks, only to stay at 20 for 4 years after that.<p>And load cycle count is only good for telling if you’re within manufacturer parameters. I frequently see old drives with Load Cycle Count 10-25 times the rated value, and they work just “fine”.')
