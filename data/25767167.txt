The antidepressants didn’t help, they just numbed me to my own emotional pain enough that I could keep functioning.<p>The holidays are a depressing time for a lot of people, and to a limited extent, I can see the harm reduction in working through them. But for me, finding a reason to live involved spending time outside of work to make new friends, revive old friendships, and improve my family life. I truly believe that work is no replacement for friends and family, the only things that I have found worth living for.<p>I hope things start looking up for you, friend.')
