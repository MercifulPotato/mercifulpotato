Were they prepared to fix the lectern in case it slips from their hands? Or more likely they were prepared to take hostages? The crowd was chanting their wish to hang the vice president.<p>You are right. It was a disgrace and a very unserious attempt, but the aim was clearly a coup.<p>Winds don’t have aims and goals.
