Though one of my parents is living a quiet life on a small piece of land and I entertained that idea myself, I personally find the sacrifice worth it. However, some difficulties would have to be addressed first:<p>1. Lack of trust in each other, authorities and institutionsâ€”in some cases, deserved (rogue actors). Who has to leave first, who gets a better view from their new home in a futuristic skyscraper, entry permit fairness and enforcement (there will be long perimeters to protect, albeit it could be a good source of jobs), etc.<p>2. Ensuring healthy human habitat in dense urban environments (pollution, clean energy, as well as psychology).<p>Many of those hurdles are societal&#x2F;organizational&#x2F;psychological, and are not liable to be solved by accelerated technical progress alone. Frustratingly, since the best time to do this is probably ASAP.')
