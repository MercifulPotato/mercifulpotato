I guess the answer is that Americans have decided different groups are entitled to different things based on historical events and inequalities. I tend to think quite individualistically so treating someone differently based on their ancestral background doesn&#x27;t come naturally to me.<p>&gt; Re your Europe question: I believe the thinking goes that natives there are rich, so why should they have more even more land rights? The political poles are flipped, the political left sees no injustice to be fixed by empowering the privileged.<p>I will say that in my experience isn&#x27;t true, at least if you&#x27;re looking on an individual level. Part of the reason I asked the question is because I&#x27;ve asked the reverse to people here in the UK. I&#x27;m from a working class background and I know a lot of Brits from working class backgrounds who are unhappy with being &quot;minorities&quot; and feeling culturally alienated because of immigration into their communities. I know one elderly man who due to the effects of migration now lives in a majority Muslim area of my city and often expresses his sadness with no longer being able to enjoy Christmas with his neighbours or not being able to read the posters put up in his council flat, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve found here in Britain people rarely take these complaints seriously. When I ask people here if we should feel some sympathy for those who feel they&#x27;re losing &quot;their culture&quot; as &quot;their group&quot; becomes the minority the answer is typically that they need to get with times and adapt to the change, but I&#x27;m aware that this is different from the American perspective, which does take the concerns of native groups becoming minorities due to immigration seriously. Funnily enough the only time I&#x27;ve heard anyone give a different answer was from a Muslim immigrant and I wonder if that was because of their sympathy for the struggles of being a minority.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there is a right answer to this though. If we want to become are more globalised world these changes are inevitable, but at the same time time I do seem to feel some sympathy knowing that not everyone is asking to live in a globalised world and that many would like to continue living in a nation that resembles the one of their ancestors. I&#x27;m just rambling now, but I think about this a lot because I know it&#x27;s the cause of many problems in the West today (Trump, Brexit, nationalism) and it seems we have quite poor, or at least highly contradictory answers â€“ some cultures deserve to be preserved, some need to get with the times; some natives have rights to their ancestral lands, others are racist for wanting the same; some groups concerns over being a minorities is valid, some groups need to just accept their new minority status. These answers, at least to me, don&#x27;t seem to be satisfactory. I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, and I doubt there is a perfect one, but at the very least our answers to these questions shouldn&#x27;t be contradictory.')
