Agreements between people are definitely enforced by legal means, but agreements between people are also a moral question about honesty -- will you do what you said you&#x27;d do?<p>But what I hear you saying is that society should not allow people to enter into agreements that would be conditional on what they use that service for, is that right?<p>If so, I <i>strongly</i> disagree.<p>I should be allowed to enter into agreements based on how I behave, and I expect people I enter into agreements with to abide by what they claimed they&#x27;d do, including if they agreed ahead of time that it was up to me to evaluate their behavior and judge for myself when to stop allowing them access to my service.<p>To deny me this right would be a violation of the concept of ownership, which I believe is a critical aspect of modern society.<p>This is a different discussion if you don&#x27;t think people can own things (which is a fair argument, though I would have disagreements as well).')
