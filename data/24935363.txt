E.g. Mental models, decision hygiene, etc.  I keep looking but end up with bad or janky patch work of options.  Feels like I have to do all the work myself and put into Notion or something.  I understand it&#x27;s a bit of a ridiculous question but thought I would see if something exists and I recognize that y comb has a lot of the logistical content.')
