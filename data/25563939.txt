I completely agree, which is why I attempted to differentiate between a general-purpose tax on all wealth in any form and a tax on real property. Please accept my humble apologies for my failures to be less clear than I could have been - my communication skills are a work in progress.<p>With that said, I have been under the impression that countries that have attempted to levy general-purposes taxes on all forms of wealth have in many cases run into practical difficulties. This requires things like finding a fair way to value and re-value an art collection or shares in a company not traded or liquid. In several cases - like France - these difficulties and others have led to dropping general-purpose wealth taxes.<p>Have I been laboring under a misapprehension? Can you help me understand what I&#x27;ve missed?')
