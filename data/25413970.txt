Advertising and affiliate fees almost certainly don&#x27;t create a large enough opportunity (interested if you have counterexamples!), <i>and</i> put them on that crash course with Amazon.  As the obvious route to the size of business that merits VC is to attempt to cannibalize AAmazon&#x27;s business.  Probably by being the recommendation engine that starts sales, then starting to sell books themselves instead of being leadgen.<p>Had they instead chosen not to take VC: they had 35 headcount at the time of acquisition.  That load probably requires $7m to $10m&#x2F;year of revenue, particularly when they have to start doing data deals for all that book data &#x2F; cover photos.  I suspect they couldn&#x27;t make the business work w&#x2F;o VC given they ran two years on that $750k angel round.  And even if they could, having a near-monopsony relationship with their affiliate fees partner makes them not a real business because they are highly vulnerable to Amazon predation.  The same as Mozilla -- when there&#x27;s just one buyer, that buyer names the price.<p>edit: put more succinctly: a business that either ran and grew on earned dollars (ie no vc), or a VC-backed business that didn&#x27;t rely on the company you were attempting to cannibalize to play nice with you.')
