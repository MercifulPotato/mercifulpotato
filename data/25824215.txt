Python really gained steam when it was 15+ years old. Julia has two years since its 1.0 release.\nBut it will eventually take over Python, unless something third comes and takes the cake before it. Julia is simply much better: More consistent, better designed, faster, more flexible, more extendable and with better tooling.<p>But is say most people can just wait. If Python is working fine for you, and it&#x27;s not going anywhere the next 10 years, why not just wait? At that point Julia will be more mature with better learning resources and a better ecosystem. You can always just pick it up then.')
