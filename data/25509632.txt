I’ve only ever had dayjobs with large orgs and ticket walls have been a useful defense against folks who insist on sending low-quality help emails or DMs the moment they encounter a problem. Sometimes I consider taking a massive paycut to work in a smaller company specifically to lessen the probability of needing to work with those sorts of people. If there’s some alternative model for dealing with these people I’m excited to hear about it.')
