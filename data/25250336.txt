But around 4 years ago, I took a college &#x27;composition&#x27; course...for the fourth time. I failed it three times previously. I <i>had</i> to pass the class this time because I had a mission to get my degree. This class stood in my way. I was fortunate enough to have a great teacher for both level 1 and level 2, I passed both with an A&amp;B respectively. Surprisingly enough, I learned that I already had good habits (journaling, rereading old entries, lack of judgment when writing, comfortable with numerous edits spread overtime). I discovered this through anon blogging and my personal journal after I dropped out of college after my third failing. So, I fell into the good habits but they are practical. They just take time and continuous practice.<p>So, I said all this, in a rambling way, to say that you can do this without paying others. Just be disciplined about it. Maybe take the 100 day challenge to blogging. Post it anon, if you&#x27;re worried about criticism.<p>Good luck. I also second nondeveloper&#x27;s two book recommends (Elements of Style and On Writing Well), if you need a lot of helpful advice.')
