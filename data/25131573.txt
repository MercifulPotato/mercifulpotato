The clock speed of the 4800U is <i>already</i> 50% higher than the M1 when running a single-thread task. And despite that, it is 25-50% <i>slower</i>. And it&#x27;s significantly less energy efficient.<p>So put that to 5nm. Either you&#x27;ve partly closed the large efficiency gap, or you&#x27;ve closed the significant performance gap, but in neither case will you come close to closing it entirely. So you&#x27;re either a little less slower, but still a lot less efficient, or a lot slower, but a little less efficient.<p>Yeah, maybe they&#x27;ll do some amazing things on the core that&#x27;ll overcome all of this. But right now the Firestorm core has a massive advantage. AMD can go to Zen4 and 5nm and maybe they&#x27;ll close the gap, but Apple won&#x27;t be sitting still.<p>Apple entered the desktop space and brought the most efficient core (by _far_), hilariously offering the best per core performance without going to magnitudes higher thermal profiles. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. So now we&#x27;re into comparing it to hypothetic, mythical alternatives from competitors in the future.<p>Sidenote: Apple has had blazing cores for a few years now, and every denier will claim it&#x27;s just some big cache or some other absurd simplification. If that were the case, everyone would just copy them.')
