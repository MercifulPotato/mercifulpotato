Just within the last year firsthand I&#x27;ve seen people in undergraduate classes, in graduate classes, and at work try Python the first time, and the default install of Anaconda worked for them in every case. The classes were taught by different professors, and they all suggested Anaconda independently and were not Python programmers.<p>It is overkill&#x2F;brute force to install all the Anaconda default packages when a beginner is not going to use over maybe 5-10 libraries, but it&#x27;s a solution that has worked flawlessly for beginners from my experience watching non-software engineers and &quot;non-technical&quot; people using Linux, Windows, and MacOS try Python for the first time in math and data science classes.')
