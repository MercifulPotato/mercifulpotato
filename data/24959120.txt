Advice about green building materials?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi everyone,<p>I&#x27;m in the process of researching house building to study the feasibility of my future house project in Western Europe.\nBeing a software developer, I&#x27;m of course looking to &quot;optimize&quot; things, especially around cost.<p>One of the most interesting topics I found was building materials, more specifically, green building materials like:<p>- compressed earth bricks<p>- rammed earth walls<p>- straw bale insulation inside wooden panels<p>- seashell crawl space insulation<p>These are all ecological, originate from renewable sources, recyclable and very cheap.\nThis would seem like a nice &quot;hack&quot; to lower building costs?<p>The second interesting topic is building time.\nSome building materials are expensive but are much faster to install which means that in the end they could be more cost effective than their cheaper counter parts.\nFor example: windows or precast concrete.<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to find sources with specific examples of this concept though.<p>I wondered if any of you have house building experience or had gone through a similar process?<p>- This being Hacker News, what were the &quot;hacks&quot; that you discovered?<p>- Any tips I should know about?<p>I&#x27;m interested in lowering costs but not at the price of quality and durability of course.\nI know that there is no free lunch but reading about some of these building materials, it&#x27;s not immediately clear to me why a regular brick costs 40€ while a compressed earth brick costs 4€ (x10 less !) while being larger.\nMy sense of a building material is &quot;worth&quot; or not is terrible since it&#x27;s not my field of expertise and so I sometimes I have difficulties accepting the prices of certain things and evaluating if they are fair price.<p>Thanks a lot in advance!')
