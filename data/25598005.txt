It&#x27;s certainly a <i>cause celebre</i> for the conservative press, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s materialized in my locale, a mid sized city in the US Midwest. I run a small business, and have literally never had to interact with the city or county government. Here in the US, local governments are responsible for managing their own schools, police, and so forth. So they face a larger attack surface for suspicions of micro-management and bureaucracy.<p>The prosperity of any smaller city in the US Midwest depends to a large extent on what industries it&#x27;s lucky enough to attract, most importantly hospitals and universities. Mine also happens to be the seat of state government.<p>The government of the county that I live in has been exemplary in managing the public health response to the COVID in the face of a total leadership vacuum at both the state and federal level.<p>We&#x27;re one of the most prosperous counties in the state, yet we are <i>believed</i> to be the county that is suffering the most under activist government.')
