I&#x27;m a lot more in favour of that. Personally, I think the patent system discourages innovation and encourages rent-seeking.<p><i>Andrew Yang also suggested making government rewards for technology development, so instead of a patent for some type of technology you get say $10,000,000 - or maybe even $1 billion if your tech meets whatever benchmarks spec&#x27;d.</i><p>I like this idea at an instinctual level but I worry that it would be open to abuse. Perhaps the abuse of a system like that would be less bad than the patent system we have right now but that remains to be seen. I do know that a lot of people would be generally opposed to it on principle. They would see it as an undeserved handout.')
