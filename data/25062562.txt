But yes some of the iOS architecture is a bit weird, in terms of apps&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;files silos.<p>You can use AUv3 plugins with many iOS DAWs but they are all separate apps you download and install from the app store, and render a bit weird inside the DAW (no floating windows). And not even sure how Kontakt or a sampler plugin that streams samples from an external SSD would work with iOS right now.<p>And you really need lots of customisable keyboard shortcuts for most pro work, most iOS apps are extremely lacking in this department.')
