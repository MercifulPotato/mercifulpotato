Contribute what? And to whose community?<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve written a library and published it under GPL and it gets used in a cellphone or an automobile. The &quot;community&quot; of users for that paid product is not the same as the users for your dev library. In fact, most commercial software innards don&#x27;t have a &quot;community&quot; at all. I think that&#x27;s a complete fiction. What they have is customers who pay.<p>When the automaker changes that code, do you really want it back? Are you really going to publish their automobile version or cellphone version of your library back into your &quot;community?&quot; If its a simple bug fix, you might, but again this big company isn&#x27;t republishing your software just to fix your bugs. They&#x27;ve <i>modified</i> it for their application. Do you want or need their mods? Are their devs in the same &quot;community&quot; as yours? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>GPL tries to reach into the surrounding and supporting code that the commercial entity writes and somehow force that company to &quot;contribute&quot; that code back to a non-existent community of people. What right does the first developer have over <i>any</i> code that the second dev wrote? That idea that the first author could reach into my code or my product and have anything to say about it is antithetical to the values of open source software right from the start.<p>Non-permissive licenses use the tools of the enemy to try to do something that sounds good on the surface but in practice is immoral and largely unenforceable. I would argue that, far from encouraging liberal software use and development, restrictive FOSS licenses like GPL and its cousins <i>prevent</i> a great deal of software from ever being commercialized and also prevent great products from reaching users because no one bothers to commercialize them.<p>If you love our industry, please help your fellow devs by giving them the maximum ability to use your work in their own work so that they can create businesses, pay the bills, hire other devs, and so on and so forth.')
