The satellites themselves send their position data but on a very low data rate (I think its just a couple bits per second) so if the device doesn&#x27;t have the data it does take 15 or so minutes. Maybe the &quot;cold-start&quot; you are referring to wasn&#x27;t so cold, it may have the almanac data saved from a previous utilization.')
