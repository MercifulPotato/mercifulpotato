It doesn&#x27;t have to be starving orphans. Sometimes just give a tip to the food delivery guy, especially when it rains.

Education might be a little too expensive in the US, but here, you can also sponsor someone for a semester for a little money. If you want more fun, there are several events which give out a shoutout to donors for only about $50, and you can go in with an anonymous troll name.<p>These numbers are all third world and that&#x27;s part of the fun - look at poorer countries and see how much impact you can do with a little money.')
