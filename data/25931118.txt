GP forgot &quot;you need to be a member of our petrol club to fill up&quot; as an added issue.<p>Some of this is due to the slow speed.  If it took 45 minutes to fill-up your car, then you might want to get a notification of some sort if the pump shut off only 5 minutes into filling.  Really that could be solved by punching in a phone number and getting an SMS though.')
