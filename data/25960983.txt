Arguing that he is being accused of EU production issues on sites that have not had the 3 month lead time that the UK sites had to resolve any production issues.<p>You can argue that the UK production output could potentially be distributed proportionally for worldwide demand but to me the real question is why isn&#x27;t anyone in the media or in the European Commission asking questions on why did it take 3 months to draft such a bland generic urgent supply contract?<p>I am sure the truth is probably somewhere in between but to me it seems the EC is playing the media game and trying to through AstraZeneca under a bus to cover for their own ineptitude in such a clutch time.')
