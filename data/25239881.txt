I now purchase durable goods from the retailer&#x27;s website rather than through amazon. My recent amazon purchase history is mostly consumables like snack foods and rice. Clothing, electronics, cookware, and almost everything else valuable gets purchased from somewhere else. This is also because the experience of shopping on amazon is extremely frustrating - they keep trying to force lower quality products on me instead of the things I want. It feels more and more like a digital walmart with fake brand names, sketchy products, and even sketchier fake reviews.<p>For example, a search for &quot;snow pants&quot; turns up products by Arctix and Outdoor Ventures. Outdoor Ventures is presumably a knockoff of Outdoor Research, a reputable cold-weather clothing brand. Outdoor Ventures seller page says their actual company name is &quot;FUJIANSHENG SHANGFEI ZHIYI YOUXIANGONGSI&quot;. And Arctix is presumably a knockoff of Arcteryx, and seems to be owned by a very small financial services company in NY.<p>I rarely feel like I&#x27;m being presented with accurate or meaningful information when I look for things on amazon.')
