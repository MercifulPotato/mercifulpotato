Each of these conditions have long term consequences and complications. The hygiene hypothesis link to the microbiome and &quot;training&quot; of the immune system link is plausible and more and more research is backing it up. Moreover, given that the immune system and inflammation continue to be found to have a role in virtually every long term disease, the hygiene hypothesis should not be taken lightly. There are a variety of sources backing up my points, you can look around; just note i am NOT saying that any of the links are certain, just that the amount of evidence that does exist far surpasses the point where the hygiene hypothesis is dubious IMO, IANAD.')
