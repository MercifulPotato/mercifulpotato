This phenomena is well known, and the disruption of having a scheduled event mid-workday is significantly larger than the time of the disruption. Everyone is going to fade out of their work long before and won&#x27;t re-engage for sometimes after.<p>As to scrum exposing cultural problems, maybe that&#x27;s true, but in some cases scrums are a clumsy attempt to <i>solve</i> cultural problems (as I said in another comment, agile was the failure mode for orgs stumbling with &quot;waterfall&quot;).<p>Terrible progress visibility? Let&#x27;s have a scrum! No team member communications? Scrum will fix it! People sandbagging or not doing their work? Don&#x27;t worry, Scrum will save the day!<p>On good teams we all <i>know</i> what each other is working on. We&#x27;re all aware of the codebase. We see the commits. We are available when someone has a problem (and people know who is a good person to asynchronously ping when they have a problem in specific domains), and are open to the reality that everyone is imperfect and doesn&#x27;t know everything. On good teams scrums serve absolutely no value, and are a redundant waste of time. On bad teams they are an attempt to bandage over all of the lack of those factors.')
