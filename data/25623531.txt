This is an amazing feat, and one that I personally did not really give proper thought.<p>Basically what I’m arguing is that any modern office building is so much more impressive than the colliseum was, maybe even at inception. More specifically, to answer your question directed at OP, I’m hard pressed not to find anything modern that’s less impressive than the Colosseum.<p>I’m interested in what you find so special about the bunch of rubble that warrants lack of intervention?<p>Edit: really I had no idea this would bring me to negative points. Would love someone explaining what I’m missing in these downvotes.')
