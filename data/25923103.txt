Who ever said the main point of a CDN is to make things easier? It&#x27;s <i>always</i> been in order to provide a faster end-user experience.<p>&gt; <i>...but it&#x27;s also not easy to say you&#x27;re really improving the performance of something if there is any possibility you&#x27;ll need to do an additional DNS lookup -- one of the greatest &quot;long tails&quot; in performance.</i><p>But common CDN&#x27;s will virtually already have their IP address cached while you&#x27;re browsing anyways.<p>Caching certainly has nuance to it as you say, but I think you&#x27;re being particularly ungenerous in claiming that CDN&#x27;s are a scam and that you&#x27;re representing &quot;reality&quot;.<p>Businesses measure these things in reality with analytics, and they also almost always analyze the worst 5% or 1% of requests as well, not just the &quot;median&quot;.<p>CDN&#x27;s are a big boost to performance in many cases. Or at least, until now (for shared files). You shouldn&#x27;t be so dismissive.')
