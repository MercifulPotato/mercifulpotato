What I meant was that these are the thought processes that spring to <i>my</i> mind when I hear someone using these phrases. I also explained a little bit of the underlying thinking on my side. This was my attempt of showing you my side of how I think about this.<p>Also: just because these thoughts spring to my mind doesn&#x27;t mean I deterministically from now on think that person is stupid etc. I had my best friends use these words in an unreflected way.')
