This was a much easier position to take when the web did not just have a few social media giants with network effects, but still: if youtube becomes to dranicon, start a new website. The tools to stream video (albeit not at scale) are just an apt-get away.<p>I agree. I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with YouTube doing anything if YouTube wasn&#x27;t <i>the</i> video website. We need decentralization.<p>But at the same time more and more often I also see these same concerns raised with decentralized networks (going beyond standard practices like blocking and preventing federation with instances), and that gets me worried.')
