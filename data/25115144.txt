But with chess you can get so many games per day, it&#x27;s much easier than other games with the same ELO ranking system. It&#x27;s the sheer number of valid games which are possible online. You can also easily cheat online.<p>An analogy: I started with 52 as regional table tennis player. In Saxony. I started with 1150 or so, and am now at 1300. We cannot play that many games, around 4 per month, so we cannot raise our points that much as in chess. But other countries do have a trick, and therefore have much higher ELO points. They added their self organized games in so-called &quot;&lt;sponsor&gt;-pokal&quot; leagues, which can be played daily around the district. You can easily organize your oi√≠wn tournament with the Swiss system, which guarantees time-bounded end times. You are sure that the tournament is finished by 10pm. And most countries honor these tournaments points, so you can easily raise up your ranking.<p>But my country saxony doesn&#x27;t like this idea because there are folks who would cheat the system. They would loose on purpose in such tournaments to be able to stay in the official lower ranked leagues, where they will win more easily against lower ranked players. They would abuse the system. I&#x27;m pretty sure professional chess players in the lower ranks would also like to play for his club in much lower leagues, so that wins are easier. Only to get into international tournaments or the highest leagues you need the points. Many are also loosing on purpose at the end of the season to be able stay in the lower ranks, if the remaining games are not important anymore.<p>Eg when I played in the US I would beat the 1600 players. In Saxony no chance at all.')
