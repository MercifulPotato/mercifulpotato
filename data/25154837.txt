Probably of my setup, I can&#x27;t tell yet.<p>In java with a good IDE, you can ^Space yourself through a lot of problems without knowing the libraries too much. And even if you don&#x27;t just pick the first thing sounding right, scrolling through the documentation of the auto suggested  methods is very convenient.<p>On the other hand, my dev-laptop currently has about 20 different rust-doc pages open at the moment to keep track of ... the methods Iter&lt;T&gt; has, the methods IterTools has, Vec has, Slices have, what package FromStr was in again, what methods a str::fmt::Formatter has to implement Display to implement Error (that needs to be imported), where HashMap is, what methods those have...<p>I&#x27;ve been there multiple times over the last decade or two with multiple languages and rust is compelling enough to work through that.<p>But if you compare the ergonomics of modern java, go or python IDEs with my current vscode+rust-analyze state, rust isn&#x27;t winning on IDE ergonomics. At least in my setup.<p>And that&#x27;s very much a part of language choice.')
