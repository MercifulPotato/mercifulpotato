Some really interesting history from Ali Partovi, cofounder of Tony&#x27;s first startup, LinkExchange: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;bubble-blinders-the-untold-story-of-the-search-business-model&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;bubble-blinders-the-untold...</a><p>It&#x27;s worth reading the whole thing but the summary is: Scott Banister, then founder of a startup called Submit-It, seems to have been the first person to have conceived of an AdWords-like business model...<p>&gt; In 1996, he brilliantly conceived an idea he called “Keywords”: to sell search listings based on pay-for-placement bidding – more or less the same as today’s AdWords. Banister began pitching the idea to anybody who would listen to him, including, among others, Bill Gross of IdeaLab, and the principals of LinkExchange: Tony Hsieh, Sanjay Madan, and me.[...] Tony, Sanjay, and I also loved the idea, because we had the benefit of the right context. [...] LinkExchange proceeded to acquire Submit-it; and I became obsessed with the idea of realizing Banister’s vision via deals with the world’s top search drivers [...] In late 1998, Microsoft bought LinkExchange for $265 million, telling us they liked the “Keywords” vision. As Microsoft employees, we continued pitching the Keywords deal not only to Yahoo, but also to the up-and-coming Google. I wasn’t surprised to find that these companies were wary of partnering with Microsoft.')
