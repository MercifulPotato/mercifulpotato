Yes it&#x27;s at a very early stage of pregnancy but it may have a profound impact on the future of all human societies. The morality of such actions should be examined thoroughly. This is far from a cure to genetic diseases it is removal of diseased individuals from the population. Any selective removal can be dangerous. If you look at China&#x27;s sex selective abortions and the social pressures that is putting on their society as one example. If you look at the Nazi eugenics campaigns to see how bad it can get. I really think people need to think long and hard before they take a side on opening the Pandora&#x27;s box.')
