If shares are purchased as they vest and held for over a year, the gains will be subject to much more favorable long term tax treatment when sold.<p>Larger companies will typically switch to RSUs, which get taxed like income, and isn&#x27;t great for a non-liquid asset. Thats what double-trigger RSUs solve, by not having the employee own the shares until a liquidity event, they won&#x27;t need to pay taxes on them until it happens. The catch is that now the employee needs to hold onto the shares for a year to get a more favorable tax treatment.<p>Taxes will really only take close to half if employees insist on selling their shares in less than a year.')
