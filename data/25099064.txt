From my limited technical understanding, it makes no sense. Never mind the privacy promises.<p>The only explanation I can currently imagine is this:<p>On population level, enough people following the app’s recommendations produces a net gain for the spread statistics, even if most recommendations are wrong or over-protective (“self-quarantine now!”).<p>Which would mean that it’s irrelevant whether the app “works” or is supported by scientific data because it’s just a device for political purposes and its surrounding narrative is, well, propaganda.')
