Item(by='davidf560', descendants=None, kids=[25478859], score=None, time=1608397176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478678, text='&gt; It is ridiculous there aren&#x27;t much more clear&#x2F;specific guidelines, and in some cases enforceable policies&#x2F;regulations, from the federal government. It&#x27;s like nobody&#x27;s driving the bus here.<p>Why is this not California&#x27;s fault? States were each permitted to establish their own procedures, which somewhat makes sense given the challenging distribution requirements of the Pfizer vaccine. Montana has significantly different challenges than Rhode Island in that sense. Most states that I know of have established clear guidelines saying who gets it and when - I assume California is the same.<p>Seems like California is the governmental entity that failed to exercise proper oversight and&#x2F;or requirements specification here.')
