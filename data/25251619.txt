The first version was more or less usable and took just a couple of evenings to put together... I then wanted more and more small features to do basic things like add a ToC, loop through arrays&#x2F;other pages, add code highlighting to markdown code blocks, then the nitty gritty of fixing bugs when including html in markdown or vice-versa etc... it&#x27;s been a couple of years now and I use the project in several websites I made, including my personal one... but it&#x27;s still not in a state I would consider useful for others :D.')
