And has tons of problems with it. That and Ricardos version is probably the basis of the Marx version. They we&#x27;re the popular interpretations at the time and he was probably inspired by them.<p>The marginal revolution happened in economics and a lot of those problems disappeared. A lot the things they couldn&#x27;t explain suddenly could be using marginal economics and subjective preferences.<p>Marx simply didn&#x27;t have the modern tools we have now. In fact if he was around afterwords it is likely he would never came up with Marxian LTV.<p>Frankly the only reason for it&#x27;s popularity now, is because of it&#x27;s association with communism. It provides the moral basis for it. As a result you&#x27;ve had a lot of people desperately trying to get it work in modern economic models as well without much luck.<p>But you can critique market economics using marginal theory of value. It just means markets have failures, not they are morally wrong at the core.')
