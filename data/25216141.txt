As a result you could have Unix on fairly cheap hardware. There was a Linux &quot;kernel personality&quot; you could install on SCO Unixware (IIRC), that would run linux binaries, if you cared for that.<p>By that time it was on the way out though. You have to remember it was a transitional time - Linux was on the rise but in many people&#x27;s view it hadn&#x27;t yet proven itself. IBM, HP and Sun were still ruling the roost for servers, but their stuff was expensive. SCO gave people a way to make commodity x86 hardware into something server-like.<p>Honestly it wasn&#x27;t a terrible system, it just got superseded quickly and then went down in flames.')
