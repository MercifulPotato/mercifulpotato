Item(by='ppf', descendants=None, kids=[25135267, 25135145], score=None, time=1605693970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135011, text='Some simple back-of-the-envelope maths shows that, due to the massively increased amount of energy needed to manufacture an EV, it takes somwhere near half the life of the car (assuming 100k miles) to pay back that &quot;CO2 debt&quot;. And even then, you are still limited by the net CO2 emissions of your electricity source.<p>This is why I claim that the CO2 benefits are <i>minimal</i> (not none, or negative). The abstract of the article you linked only claims that the net CO2 of EVs <i>and</i> heat pumps is <i>less</i>, but does not indicate by how much. I would also love to see the assumptions made, especially if manufacturing energy cost is considered. Do you have a non-paywalled version of the article body?')
