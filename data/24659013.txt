If you do something with good intentions and something bad happens as a result, it&#x27;s not necessarily on you (and indeed, I would hesitate to assign blame in all but the most extreme &quot;what did you think was going to happen!?&quot; cases). But if you do something with good intentions after being repeatedly told by multiple independent parties on multiple occasions that it&#x27;s going to cause a problem, then you get to be responsible when that problem actually arises from the actions that you knowingly took while ignoring warnings.')
