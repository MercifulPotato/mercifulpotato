Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[24667733], score=None, time=1601677700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667654, text='<i>But it leads to the question of why it matters - should it?</i><p>In theory, it shouldn&#x27;t. In practice, it does.<p>People who think I am male speak to me differently than when they know I am a woman. Since I am trying to establish an adequate income, my experience is that if people have an issue with me being a woman, it&#x27;s better for that to be sorted <i>before</i> they interact with me, not <i>after.</i><p>If someone is willing to meet me in person, thinks I&#x27;m male and then meets me and sees I&#x27;m a woman, that&#x27;s likely to go badly. I don&#x27;t want to waste my time on that, much less risk facing potential drama because of it.<p>The reality is it ends up mattering whether I want it to matter or not. So I try to make it the least drama I can arrange given the tools available to me. I find that a quiet heads up is better than trying to hide my gender and is also better than putting people on the spot and correcting them in &quot;public&quot; and in a way that will make them feel attacked for simply not knowing.')
