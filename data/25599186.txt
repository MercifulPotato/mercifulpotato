That works in overcrowded coastal cities, but for the vast majority of the country, a different approach is likely optimal.<p>Bentonville, AR I think has cracked the puzzle. They built mountain bike trails... literally everywhere. You&#x27;re hanging out with your buddies north of town and want to grab a pizza for lunch? Awesome, hit this rad piece of singeltrack and shred your way to to za and beer. They even replaced a bunch of sidewalks with singletrack. This is not only better for the environment (it&#x27;s literally just tamped dirt), but easier to maintain (a tamping machine and water truck vs a fossil fuel burning asphalt paver).<p>Another success that&#x27;s been less explosive, but worthy mention is streamway buffer trails. Rather than tossing bikes into traffic, which intimidates casual riders, and probably isn&#x27;t safe where bike culture isn&#x27;t a thing... municipalities put asphalt trails next to watersheds that need erosion control. The benefit is two fold, a shorcut throughway that&#x27;s dedicated for pedestrian and bike traffic, plus civil engineers can use the bike pathway itself as a durable flood zone.')
