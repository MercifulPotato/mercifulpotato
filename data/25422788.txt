It seems social media has had limited substantive success for anyone and has really created more problems than it&#x27;s worth.<p>Historically I&#x27;ve avoided expressing my views on abolishment but now people are trying to develop fear-mongering strategies around decentralization, so here I am back at abolition. I&#x27;d love to find a happy medium but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible. Social media companies, search companies, national news (who is dependent on social media for income), politicians (who are dependent on social media for likes and shares), and law enforcement working in coordination to do an arbitrarily good thing (disrupt the flow of misinformation) was both eye opening and terrifying. These tools can be used for good but they&#x27;re also the keystone tools of autocracy and are used largely for reasons that require interpretation and narrative following.<p>My point is that we don&#x27;t need these kind of problems. We have space exploration ahead of us, major advancements in technology are still needed, and we need a continuum of people who are <i>willing</i> to work together despite whatever differences they may have ideologically and otherwise. I don&#x27;t think limiting scope or killing virility will achieve these ends.')
