OTOH, the people who develop GCC are incredibly competent at what they do because the compiler does insanely complicated things the vast majority of the human race would struggle to comprehend and, yet, its surprisingly correct, with the occasional bug and confusion here and there.<p>We all work at the limits of our wits. Right now I&#x27;m waiting for a timeout so I can continue to test a hypothesis. If I am lucky, I&#x27;ll be right and the system will malfunction in the way I expect it to. I&#x27;d say my chances at this point are 50&#x2F;50.')
