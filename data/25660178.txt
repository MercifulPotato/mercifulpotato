But it offers an explanation of the appearance of collapse without having a collapse.<p>Namely if a quantum mechanical observer observes a quantum mechanical system in a superposition of states, we get a superposition of quantum mechanical observers who can no longer meaningfully interact, each of which observed a different state of the quantum mechanical system.  This is exactly what the Schr√∂dinger equation predicts MUST happen.<p>As a side note, this is the most popular interpretation of quantum mechanics among cosmologists.  It turns out that if you&#x27;re using quantum mechanics to explain things like the birth of galaxies, taking seriously what quantum mechanics says for human sized quantum mechanical systems becomes very easy.')
