HBO Nordic, Viaplay and YouTube movies have pretty bad UI&#x2F;UX problems and their streams become borderline unwatchable with subpar internet connections, whereas Netflix has in my experience still been able to push through video in those conditions with good enough quality that I can still enjoy it.')
