We are entering 2021 and still there is sea-ice in the Arctic (granted, it&#x27;s thinner and the covering area has diminished, but still there is sea-ice in the Arctic!).<p>I am not a climate change denialist but because of these  over-alarming claims the climatic scientists have lost credibility with lots of people. And no, having Jane Fonda arrested is not helping in the credibility department.')
