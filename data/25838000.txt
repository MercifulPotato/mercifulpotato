That was reassuring when we were living paycheck to paycheck.<p>I do agree on urban planning being a part of it as well. It&#x27;s a 15min drive to my closest grocery store, and 10 minutes of that is driving out of my neighborhood. Walking to the store is nearly impractical, and generally not safe due to the lack of sidewalks for a fair stretch of the main road.')
