Most productivity apps don&#x27;t end up &quot;working&quot; because they vastly underestimate the complexity of the problem they are trying to solve.<p>We need to do a far better job of addressing the psychology of self-improvement, one of the most important aspects being how to deal with the inevitable &quot;falling off the wagon&quot;.<p>As you describe well, a naive approach to productivity tends to work at first, but then, as soon as you disengage for a time, they actively work _against_ re-engagement.<p>I think there is a lot to be figured out in this area.<p>One other related point is that although an app can&#x27;t &quot;solve the problem of self-discipline&quot; it _can_ reduce the amount of energy required to &quot;do the right thing&quot; (e.g. by providing a easy to follow system). Since willpower requires energy which is a limited resource, this leaves more of it to apply towards continuing to work towards a goal instead of figuring out how to configure a goal achievement system.')
