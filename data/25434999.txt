But this is extremely expected - high infection rate is what prompts areas to mandate mask usage.<p>If I feel at risk (maybe because I observe people getting ill and dying), I comply. If I don&#x27;t feel at risk, I don&#x27;t care about complying.<p>Also, why no Asian countries on the international charts? That would be inconvenient for the point, hm?')
