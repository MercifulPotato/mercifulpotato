And it needs to moderate in certain issues to regain majority support. One way would be by eschewing hard-line right wing economics. Tax cuts for corporations and wealthy elites arent going to make a dent in the left’s cultural hegemony. Why not tax the wealthy elite and pour that tax money into the hands of every day Americans through better infrastructure, schooling, and healthcare? Then use that as political leverage to stop things you don’t like.<p>It sounds a lot like one side is too attached to corporate hegemony.')
