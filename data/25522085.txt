However, BAM is zlib-compressed (even if you asked samtools not to compress it).  Each block therefore contains an actual checksum, and corruption will show up during decompression.  Therefore, if you can decompress BAM, but the CIGAR doesn&#x27;t make sense, you&#x27;ve got a software problem, not a hardware problem.<p>From my experience in beerinformatics, you got some software that... uhhh... interprets the BAM specification differently than you do.  It&#x27;s depressingly common.')
