While the percentage of Asians in the population overall is 6-7%, the percentage of Asians in the 60+ cohort is only 4-5%. Also, Asians are a rapidly growing group that mostly comprises immigrants not born in the US. It’s not necessarily a sign of discrimination that there is a lag between when Asians arrive in the US, when they reach economic parity, and when they achieve leadership positions that might require a higher level of being established, US citizenship, many years of company service, etc. As a result of the fact that the Asian population is growing rapidly, you’re looking at statistics that may not be in equilibrium.<p>Asians account for about 3.7% of Fortune 500 Board seats, which isn’t that far off from the 4-5% of the age cohort you’d expect to have a high level position like that.
