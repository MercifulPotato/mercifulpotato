UI is on the surface, UX is everything else.<p>I am genuinely hoping for more pen &amp; touch-screen focused accomodations too. The keyboard&#x2F;mouse experience for windows is already decent enough, but these new input devices need help. This is especially true with the ipad pro becoming more of a general purpose computing device.<p>Lastly, I hope windows puts more care into revamping curation of various app&#x2F;program stores&#x2F;managers. Chocolatey is great, but is a pain to use and isn&#x27;t as widely supported. The windows store has a few gems in what is a sea f spam apps.<p>Lastly Lastly, better native tiling, search and workspace management please. (I know powertoys exists, but why not integrate it directly)')
