Whitewater was a New York Times created scandal.  It was the New York Times that ran cover for the Bush administration in invading Iraq.  It was the New York Times that a week before the 2016 election ran dueling stories that played up the Clinton e-mail story and simultaneously absolved Trump of any links to Russia.  All of these stories got widespread media attention by the so-called left-leaning media.  The Whitewater story never amounted to anything, the  grounds for invading Iraq were all lies, and the Clinton e-mail story lead to nothing while Trump&#x27;s ties led to a long-running investigation that led to jail time for several members of Trump&#x27;s campaign.<p>If Biden wins, then by spring, the leading story in the &quot;left-leaning&quot; media will be that we need to cut social spending to combat the deficit.  The deficit miraculously stops being a story whenever a Republican is in the White House, and becomes a major priority whenever a Democrat is in the White House.  Just because people in the media think that racism is bad doesn&#x27;t make the media left-leaning.')
