When watching the Elton John movie, I could see all the artificial image enhancements made to the picture to make it look better, but burning the sincerity out of it in the process. Same for sound, which made characters mouth completely out of sync with the music (the first scene, the voices are singing intensely, but you can see the faces not breaking a sweat, uncanny valley ensued).<p>This week, I started (and gave up) to watch &quot;the witches&quot;, which has clearly been designed by committee. All the ingredients are nice, but there is this feeling that they are put in there because people though they should be, not because they felt it should. It was not story telling, it was product manufacturing. We were being sold concepts: this is a lovable character, here is a tragedy to bound, here is the bad guy, she is scary, oh, look at the grandma you wish you had, and so on.<p>The problem is, they do that because it works. Star wars remakes made banks. Disney live actions as well.<p>If I discuss this with my friends, they don&#x27;t seem to mind, they enjoy it.<p>Now I ate at Mc Donalds for year, enjoying it, so I get that you can very well enjoy scientifically crafted quick and satisfying experiences.<p>But at least for movies, it&#x27;s becoming hard for me. Maybe I have rose glasses about movies in the past, but I watched Groundhog Day last week, and it felt nothing like this. Pure creative and fun experience.<p>I guess it&#x27; a blessing: it will save me time and money.<p>On the other hand, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m bitter about this, cause it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s an important thing, but I react strongly to it.')
