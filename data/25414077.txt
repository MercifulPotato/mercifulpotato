Our grandparents grew up with their grandparents who would have been firmly planted in Terra-cognito or at least been hearing stores of it. But our parents, once removed, had nothing &quot;real&quot; to pass on to us, just stories at best. The baby-boomers specificlly sought to cut ties to their &quot;stiff&quot; parental figures and mostly were successful in reshaping the world as individualistic, something that NEVER would have worked as a survival strategy for any previous generation.<p>My take, the baby-boomers consciously severed our ties to the past as their children we have now lost all connections to the natural world. We get what we deserve which is utter destruction of the climate and mental suffering and disease until the day we die.')
