Salt&#x2F;pepper is all about server storage&#x2F;verification. The &quot;path&quot; is plain, hash, salted hash, peppered hash.<p>Plain:server stores the password, client sends the password - matching is simple. When server is breached, all passwords are known.<p>Hash:server stores a hash of the password, the type of hash. Client sends the plain password, server hashes and compares. When server is breached, most passwords are known, by way of rainbowtables&#x2F;brute force.<p>Salted hash: same as hash, servers additionally stores random salt pr account. Hash is over plain password and hash. When server is compromised, weak&#x2F;dictionary passwords are compromised via brute force.<p>Pepered passwords: an additional secret is used for salting. The stored hash now depends on plaintext password, plain salt, &quot;secret&quot; pepper. When server is compromised, most likely pepper is compromised too. If not (eg: only database&#x2F;backups are exposed), pepper needs to be recovered before brute force of passwords is viable. If the attacker has an account (know a password) it&#x27;s straightforward to attempt to brute force the pepper, but unless it&#x27;s weak (eg not a 128 bit random number) - it should not be feasible.<p>Finally, horcruxing - has nothing to do with server side. Has nothing to do with hashing. Is a simple suffix appended to any given password stored in a password manager, in a INMHO misguided attempt at improved security.<p>Server sees full password on account creation and login. Seems to suggested to share &quot;horcqrux&quot; cross accounts.<p>An attacker compromising the passwords stored in the password manager, only gets ~half the password. Need to get the other half via brute force, through compromising another account sharing the same suffix&#x2F;horcrux, via keyboard logger etc.<p>A physical compromise of a device with a password manager seem to likely open up for a lot of these attacks.<p>Note that bitwarden uses 2fa to authenticate a client - but AFAIK if you have a copy of the data&#x2F;vault - the passphrase is sufficient to get the decryption key.<p>Horcruxing defends against some odd threats, and otherwise adds more complexity than security IMNHO.')
