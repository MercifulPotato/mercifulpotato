With this in place, when you want to make a change, you notify the registrar, who notifies the registry, who carries out the authentication procedure and, if successful, allows the domain to be changed, then relocks.<p>Note that the registry may only be available to do unlock procedures for limited hours, usually business hours in their locale; that might be inconvenient if it&#x27;s not your locale.<p>My understanding is Cloudflare can do registry locks, but does not offer registrar services standalone. Corporate oriented registrars like CSC and MarkMonitor offer it. I don&#x27;t have experience eith CSC, but MarkMonitor had a pretty high minimum spend (I think 10k&#x2F;year) to get on their platform circa 2013; that may have changed, also they&#x27;re now owner by a VC firm, just FYI.<p>NetworkSolutions (boo hiss), rolled out a registry lock feature after a high profile hijacking which was why my employer had me work with MarkMonitor.')
