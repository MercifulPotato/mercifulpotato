Nowadays, graphics information doesn&#x27;t tend to be packed in bitmaps, either manually or otherwise. It&#x27;s pretty inconvenient for processing to have everything bitmapped (compositing, collision detection, etc.) and they probably wouldn&#x27;t do it if it weren&#x27;t for the space savings')
