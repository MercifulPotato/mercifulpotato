In fact, we don&#x27;t even have a <i>theory</i> on how DNA was originally developed, or how non-functional DNA&#x2F;proteins self-replicate, or really anything at all. We only have the end product (which does—as you point out—work). The question is <i>how did it get there</i>, and previous hand waving about a huge, old Universe and random chance isn&#x27;t sufficient.<p>It&#x27;s going to have to be something similar to what you (and other commenters) describe: mechanisms that <i>preferentially</i> and <i>relatively quickly</i> produce valid, self-replicating DNA&#x2F;protein chains. To date, no one has found anything even close to that.')
