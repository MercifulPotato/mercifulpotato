Racers, we left in a gale but we were going downwind and it was easy living. The skipper had bought a $100 genoa which eventually fully delaminated and shredded.<p>It was blowing 30+ which didn&#x27;t seem that bad since, again, we were going downwind. But we needed to gybe to stay on course. Gybing was not going to be fun but I suggested that we just chicken gybe, a dinghy school maneuver, to make life just a little safer. We did and got it over with.<p>Still 30-40 knots had us racing down the coast and Point Conception was in our future. Translate Point Conception from Spanish to English and you get the idea. So we decided to radio in to Morro Bay. Channel 16 had been broadcasting <i>Morro Bay is closed. Do not approach Morro Bay. That includes you.</i><p>In fact, Morro Bay did not even pick up but eventually Long Beach did. They said Morro Bay would radio back which they did.<p>Morro Bay was very professional. How many souls on board? Are you wearing life jackets? What is your sailing experience? Have you been in to Morro Bay before? ...<p>A note about Morro Bay. In normal conditions, it&#x27;s easy peasy. But in a blow, the waves are rolling south directly into the breakwater, the rocks. You cannot go in normally.<p>They sent <i>two</i> cutters out. One was put in front of us and one behind us. We surfed down the waves. They timed it and said that when the boat in front turns left, you turn left. We did.<p>After that, motored up the channel, tied up at the YC and went to sleep. Pancakes the next day in Morro Bay and then Point Conception (I&#x27;ve been turned back by Point Conception going north several times) was easy + beautiful.<p>The Coasties? They do this every day.')
