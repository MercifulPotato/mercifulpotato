Almost everything I do is the result of by moment to moment decisions. I flit from project to project as needed, and have hundreds of things going on all the time.<p>This inability to form habits is extreme. If something&#x27;s not right in front of me I forget that it exists. I&#x27;ve tried to start smoking, but as soon as the pack is gone I forget to buy another. I don&#x27;t shower until it starts to effect me. I don&#x27;t sleep until I can&#x27;t keep my eyes open. I forget to eat until my stomach hurts. I truly don&#x27;t believe I can become addicted to anything. I&#x27;ve been tempted to try crack because I&#x27;ve heard that everybody gets addicted to it and I might be able to use it to create artificial motivation in myself. I tried chewing nicotine gum every time I took a shower, but I just couldn&#x27;t remember to do it, and it wasn&#x27;t helping enough with forming habits.<p>I also have memory problems and basically have to re-invent everything from scratch all the time. I&#x27;m really good at solving problems so I&#x27;ve been able to cover up most of my failings. One story that highlights this happened when I was taking the ACT. There was one question at the end that I had to invent calculus to solve. I had a feeling that I hadn&#x27;t solved a problem like it before, but I went ahead and solved it anyway and got every question on the math section correct. My verbal skills on the other hand were just barely acceptable.<p>Another anecdote about lack of schedule and routine also comes from my highschool time. Between classes I&#x27;d routinely forget that I had another class to go to. I&#x27;d see someone in the hall and start talking until the bell rang. In my highschool being late 3 times was equivalent to an absence, and 7 absences was an automatic fail. Needless to say I had probably the worst GPA in history. I also did very well on tests, but could never ever remember to read my book or do my homework.<p>Basically, a consistent theme is I&#x27;m totally worthless until I stumble into a magical sprint where I get 2 months worth of work done overnight.<p>I just spent from 1:30am to about 5:00am in my car with my laptop and was able to make 6 much needed git commits as well as taking care of a bunch of other issues with my main project. The last commits were the end of August with 14 commits over just a few days.<p>Wow, that was a ramble, but I&#x27;ve been up for about 30 hours now so that&#x27;s not surprising.')
