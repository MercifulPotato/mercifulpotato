OTOH most of the far-eastern brands manage to provide those options and they work. That is because the core parts are provided by intel&#x2F;amd. How is it that msi&#x2F;asus&#x2F;supermicro&#x2F;etc manage to afford all those options on devices that cost 1&#x2F;2 of what the average HP device does?<p>HP&#x2F;etc can&#x27;t even get windows working correctly on a device that ships with windows. That is fundamentally what the article is about (the OS pref requests not being honored properly).<p>Its because HP&#x2F;Dell&#x2F;etc aren&#x27;t really providing any real validation above the underlying ODM anymore. So whether the S3&#x2F;whatever mode actually works is more a function of whether intel&#x2F;amd and their bios provider insyde&#x2F;ami&#x2F;etc managed to get the option hooked up at all. So if you happen to enable S3 with some funny device and it doesn&#x27;t come out of standby properly, then sure its a bug, you have to disable that device or disable S3.<p>But what really happens with the HP&#x2F;etc laptops is you don&#x27;t have the choice. Which is why you see endless complaints about modern standby issues on their &quot;windows&quot; devices despite running the supported OS. If the end user could just go and ignore the MS recommendations and disable modern standby on a laptop class device they likely would be much happier. Having the machine work reliably vs download email when the lid is closed is an easy choice.<p>In summary, the &quot;value add&quot; the big OEM&#x27;s are adding is product segmentation by removing options the underlying technology providers ship by default.')
