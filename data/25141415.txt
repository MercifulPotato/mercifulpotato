I was a native app &#x2F; web app and application backend engineer who was also growing career wise through getting into product management and people management. But I wanted to dig my fingers back into the soil again so studied stats and ML over a period of 6 months. This lead to a lower paying research engineering job at a university for 1.5 years and finally a higher paying than previous management job as an individual contributor in robotics. So part of the cost was the opportunity cost of a lower paying job. But being able to live below your means and save up for time off affords this kind of flexibility if it&#x27;s at all doable.<p>Short of that I recommend buying lots of books. I peruse them before bed all the time - even if I don&#x27;t read them cover to cover I have a sense of what&#x27;s out there and can reference them when they become relevant.')
