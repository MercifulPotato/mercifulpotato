Is it more likely to make you answer in favor of your candidate, answer in favor of the other candidate, or go out of your way to participate in polls to &quot;fight back&quot; against the bias?<p>You can invent a narrative that supports pretty much any activity. Only some of these narratives have any data behind them.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware the best-supported theory by data isn&#x27;t that people intentionally lie, but that they simply don&#x27;t participate in polls because they narrative pushed by republican campaigns is that the polls are always wrong. This is, we&#x27;ll say, half true.<p>What I&#x27;m interested in, now that the republican talking point is that the <i>actual</i> polls don&#x27;t matter, since Democrats are stealing the election anyway, is if Republican turnout will similarly decrease.')
