They still seem to be loosing 100&#x27;s of millions of dollars every year even when not including marketing costs. Having talked to some restaurant owners on these platforms as well as delivery agents - everyone seems to be unhappy with the commissions that these platforms take(too high) and delivery charges they pay to agents(too low). How do these companies expect to become profitable? Especially as they still are not profitable even in a duopoly like situation in a massive country like India.')
