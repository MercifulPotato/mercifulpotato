He&#x27;s not alone, many if not most of the top players in the industry feel that way. A personal story: my girlfriend&#x27;s parents lived and worked for the MPAA in Washington, D.C. as part of their legal team. Throughout the 80s and 90s, they banned VCRs altogether in the house because in their opinion, <i>despite</i> the Betamax ruling, recording a show was still copyright infringement, and VCRs were illegal piracy devices.<p>Strictly speaking, they&#x27;re right: the Betamax decision did not allow all recording of personal copies, nor did it make &quot;time-shifting&quot; fair use. All it said was that in this one specific instance: time-shifting in order to gain access to a program you otherwise would have no access to at all, allowances may be made under the fair-use doctrine and thus the VCR has <i>a</i> non-infringing use and is only <i>mostly</i> an illegal piracy device. Fun fact: this is why the DMCA <i>also</i> requires all VCRs sold in the USA to come with Macrovision.<p>Another story: Recently, Tom Cruise was recorded berating the crew on the set of <i>Mission: Impossible 6</i> in a swear-filled rant because he caught two crew members standing closer than social-distancing orders permitted. Cruise was afraid that if word got out that they were lax on social distancing, the government would shut the production down and shut other film productions down, putting cast and crew members out of work and rendering (some of) them unable to feed their families. He displayed startling and commendable (especially given his Scientology training) awareness and empathy for people on the set who weren&#x27;t millionaire celebrities and might be living paycheck to paycheck as a gaffer, make-up artist, caterer, or something -- even as he shrieked at his own people.<p>To people in the movie business, piracy is like that. It threatens to shut down the entire industry and put hundreds of thousands of good honest people out of work. There is no greater evil than a movie pirate, who steals food from the mouths of hardworking film crew members and their children, in order to avoid paying the fifteen bucks or whatever it is now to see a movie during its theatrical run, or waiting a bit to pay an <i>even smaller</i> amount to see it on DVD or streaming. Therefore, you can&#x27;t give a pirate an inch of quarter, lest they consign the entire glorious film industry to the dustbin of history.<p>This isn&#x27;t just cigar-chomping studio executives crafting a good lie to lobby to legislators and government officials so they protect their vast fortunes. This is what they actually believe. This is how they actually think.<p>So to them, Section 1201 is not an awful law. It is part of the great American tradition of protecting the little guy and allowing them to prosper in the land of the free -- and it is <i>absolutely necessary</i>. When weighing the very livelihoods of hardworking film-crew members against the complaints of a few whiny nerds who could otherwise get cushy jobs elsewhere, which would you -- as a lawmaker or judge -- side with?')
