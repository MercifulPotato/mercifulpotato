Hayden (former DIRCIA&#x2F;DIRNSA) testified that, &quot;<i>We kill people based on metadata</i>&quot;.<p>--<p>[0]: Additionally, any &quot;missing pieces&quot; of their profile of you can probably be &quot;filled in&quot;, thanks to their access to your (Internet) data that also travels across their network. Of course, I&#x27;m sure they would <i>NEVER</i> do anything like that -- nor anything they might ever need &quot;retroactive immunity&quot; for!')
