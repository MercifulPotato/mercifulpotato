I don’t think people starve and vivisect mice for fun. And I agree that there being money in it is much of the moment to moment motivation for the moment by moment steps that are necessary for it to happen. Putting a happy p-hacked face on the process is how ordinary people rationalize what they are doing as something other than what it is.<p>The business of cutting apart animals and looking at the insides claim revealed knowledge isn’t new. The Romans called it “haruspicy” and also built wealthy bureaucratic institutions in service of narratives useful to the powerful.<p>Contemporary interest in fasting research is helpful to those who find advantage in moralizing upon obesity. Intermittent fasting is a virtue reserved for those with food security. It’s attractive to people whose socio-economic status insures that going hungry is a choice and a display of will power. Not weakness. The conclusion that it makes such people smarter is self serving.<p>The preponderance of health evidence is that starvation is detrimental to human health and creates long term cognitive problems.
