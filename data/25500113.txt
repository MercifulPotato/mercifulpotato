I also had the pleasure of working for several years with a &quot;10x&quot; developer where &quot;x&quot; roughly describes &quot;meaningful work done&quot;.<p>He was brilliant, probably slightly autistic, spoke multiple  (human) languages fluently (that he had taught himself, not grown up speaking or learned in school), and easily wrote 500-1000 lines of great code per day (not that that&#x27;s the metric, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d see when running `git pull`), implementing feature requirements in a front-end web application. His work truly had a &quot;wow&quot; factor. Give him a <i>very</i> big job that would take the average 4-person team more than 6 months, and it would be done in less than a month.<p>As a senior developer on that team, I quickly learned that the best use of my time was to remove roadblocks and streamline his workflow.<p>I worked across from him in an office for a couple of weeks one time, and was impressed at how focused and disciplined he was -- more than anyone else I ever saw. Every moment of the work day he was scrolling and typing into his editor. A quick break every few hours, and then back to work.')
