And it&#x27;s not random in a sense that you closed your eyes when putting them into envelope. They actually both don&#x27;t have a &quot;selected&quot; color. They &quot;snap into one of two colors&quot; when you measure (look at) one. And the &quot;unbelievable&quot; thing is that when you measure one, the other one immediately snaps into opposite color, no matter how far it is.')
