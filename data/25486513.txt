Those women? And how are they being recruited? By demonstrating the value of their service and being an attractive alternative to McDonald&#x27;s minimum wage burger flipping? Is McDonalds in the burger-work pimping business?<p>- Connecting them with clients: So basically any communication network is a pimping network?<p>- Taking a cut of the profit: They are a popular platform like any other, a place where users know to go to find sex-workers, and they are using that platform as a business. Film festivals also act as middle-men in this regard, but does anyone say film festivals are in the &quot;film pimping&quot; business?<p>- While keeping control of the whole business: I think I need a source on this, are they shutting down OnlyFan creators because they are linking to an external website? I couldn&#x27;t find anything in their terms: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlyfans.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;user-content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlyfans.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;user-content</a>')
