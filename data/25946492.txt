RH kept demanding I &quot;explain what happened&quot; and wouldn&#x27;t unlock my account for moving my money out. Exchanged about 3 emails with revolving support staff, all obviously canned responses, each taking about 2 (BUSINESS) days to get a reply.<p>Got fed up with this and told them I was going to small claims (fortunately it was less than $2,500) if they didn&#x27;t get me my money by next day&#x27;s end. Exchanged 3 or 4 more emails which *miraculously began flowing in about an hour apart and I was &#x27;allowed&#x27; to withdraw my $.<p>Left Robinhood early this month after that. Fuck Robinhood.')
