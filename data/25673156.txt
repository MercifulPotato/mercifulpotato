Itâ€™s an eyesore and not even that functional. I also installed whole-house audio in 2009.<p>Both have been entirely superseded by a bunch of Amazon Echo&#x2F;related devices, which work quite well for that purpose and background music (some rooms I was able to interface with the whole house audio, but overall I wish I had that money and time back).<p>As we do painting around the house, I remove the intercom panels and patch over the plaster.')
