Mostly their financial powers means they can speak self-fulfilling prophecies, I think. &quot;Advice&quot; stock holders. But they also can &quot;attack&quot; stocks directly teaming up, like the <i>short ladder attack</i> we&#x27;ve seen the last few days. Bad press and media manipulation do the rest. Crashing a stock probably means influencing the companies liquidity and if they don&#x27;t make profit at the moment, that may be the end. Or one of their friends buys then the majority of the company&#x27;s shares. You know, mafia shit, but with numbers.<p>Overall you can ask yourself: Is it a good idea to allow anybody speculating on someone&#x27;s loss, when they got enough financial power to make everyone jump?<p>Respective bankruptcy hugely increases the win on betting against a stock, since they don&#x27;t have to buy back the shares they borrowed. They arrogantly went all in on GME, business as usual... or so they thought :)<p>Just to make this clear, I don&#x27;t buy into the narrative of wealth redistribution as those profiting are probably in the top 1-2% anyway. But I like to see some of these assholes losing a lot, maybe someone going to prison over this. And well Gamestop and AMC just got a second life in this game. If they get their shit together, they will have a more epic &quot;almost bankrupt&quot; story than Apple.<p>And who know, maybe this will unite people under the clear view who their real enemies are, that it&#x27;s neither ethnicity, culture or religion dividing them; all their struggles are caused by billionaires playing God.')
