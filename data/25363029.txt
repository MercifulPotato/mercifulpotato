But vesting shares should not qualify as income. What should qualify as income is me selling those shares.\nIn other words, If I am awarded 1B$ in shares that I have no plan on selling short term, I still have to liquidate 20-30% of those shares just to pay taxes, which may have a pretty high negative impact in term of voting rights.<p>Why could the taxation not occur when I am selling instead?')
