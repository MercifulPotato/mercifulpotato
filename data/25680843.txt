I think I got it. 3217-2187 = 1030 anthropogenic in the atmosphere, and 55% will get reabsorbed, so that put us at the 2289 total that won&#x27;t get reabsorbed. And since we emit 37.1 per year (figure probably out of date), and 45% of that sticks around, we have about 36 years before we go past 2900 (at this rate). Although I&#x27;m not sure if that reabsorption is already figured in to the 37.1 figure.')
