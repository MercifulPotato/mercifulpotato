I stopped doing that when I got into college, but dreams never stopped and I never stopped analysing and trying to remember the dreams.<p>Fast forward to present time (10 years from school), whenever I want to wake up i.e. after 6-7 hours of sleep I can&#x27;t stop myself from thinking about the dream. It&#x27;s like I am in a half-awake and half-sleepy state and I can&#x27;t control myself to get fully awake, I know for sure I am not lucid dreaming.<p>I wake up to turn off the alarm, but my mind rushes back to thinking about the dream (because 99.9% of time it is very interesting and it seems like I need to dive into it further to understand&#x2F;remember it). This cycle keeps on continuing, I drift to sleep while thinking about the dream, and then when I wake up there is a brand new dream in my head, and I get back to thinking about it. This cycle keeps on going for 2-3 hours, so my total sleep time from an outsider perspective is 10+ hours.<p>No matter how much I think before going to sleep to not think about the dreams in the morning no matter how interesting they are, I am not able to control myself in thinking about the dream in the morning and then just falling back to sleep eventually.')
