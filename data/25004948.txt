The Shkval basically can only travel in a straight line, and given its speed and short range the launching sub won&#x27;t be able to do much evasion.<p>The supercavitating torpedo is also traveling at high speed in a bubble of fizzing seawater, it must make a tremendous racket while approaching, there really isn&#x27;t anything covert about it.')
