The 12 demands as per your article are:<p>&gt; Declare to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear programme and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.<p>&gt; Stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing, including closing its heavy water reactor.<p>&gt; Provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.<p>&gt; End its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.<p>&gt; Release all US citizens as well as citizens of US partners and allies.<p>&gt; End support to Middle East “terrorist” groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.<p>&gt; Respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming, demobilisation and reintegration of Shia militias.<p>&gt; End its military support for the Houthi rebels and work towards a peaceful, political settlement in Yemen.<p>&gt; Withdraw all forces under Iran’s command throughout the entirety of Syria.<p>&gt; End support for the Taliban and other “terrorists” in Afghanistan and the region and cease harbouring senior al-Qaeda leaders.<p>&gt; End the Islamic Revolutionary Guard corps-linked Quds Force’s support for “terrorists” and “militant” partners around the world.<p>&gt; End its threatening behaviour against its neighbours, many of whom are US allies, including its threats to destroy Israel and its firing of missiles at Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and threats to international shipping and destructive cyberattacks.<p>This really amounts to 3 things:<p>1. Stop pursuing nuclear weapons development, and actually give inspectors the ability to verify that Iran is staying true to it&#x27;s word.<p>2. Stop supporting terrorist organizations, and other proxy wars.<p>3. Stop threatening to destroy Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other countries.<p>Sure, demanding the release of US citizens is superfluous and unnecessary. But how does this amount to telling Iran to &quot;shoot itself in the head&quot;? How would fulfilling these 12 points kill Iran? How does Iran somehow end up dying if it stops fighting proxy wars in Yemen and Iraq?')
