The open source communities back then were indeed caustic. #python was an exception. #python used to be very nice to beginners. #c was perhaps the worst.<p>The attitude of these communities has changed a lot since then. It has been 14 years since then! Right now, #lisp and #emacs and their Reddit counterparts r&#x2F;lisp and r&#x2F;emacs are a very pleasant, friendly, and supportive community. For those looking to becoming a part of the Lisp or Emacs community, I strongly recommend giving #lisp, #emacs, r&#x2F;lisp, and r&#x2F;emacs a chance.')
