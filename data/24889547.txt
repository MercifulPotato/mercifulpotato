The test is whether the tool is <i>designed</i> and&#x2F;or <i>offered</i> for the purpose of circumventing copyright. If it&#x27;s designed for other purposes but can <i>incidentally</i> circumvent copyright, that&#x27;s fine. (For example: calibre is designed to organize ebook libraries, and offers itself for that purpose. They make no mention of the separate plugins that can be used to crack Amazon DRM.)')
