We&#x27;re doing a bit better than Feynman&#x27;s description of then Brasil, with grad students having memorized an encyclopedia of science factoids, but utterly unable to reason with them.  But even now, ask first-tier astronomy grad students &quot;a 5-year old asks, What color is the Sun ball?&quot; and &quot;What color is sunlight?&quot;, and it&#x27;s usual to get a wrong answer to the first, and not uncommon to get a correct answer to the second, sometimes followed a &quot;&lt;pause&gt; that doesn&#x27;t make sense, does it?&quot;, as two incompatible factoids seemingly collide for the first time since Kindergarten.  And first-tier physical-sciences grad students&#x27; grasp of color can get really wonky.  And then there&#x27;s everyone else.  So we&#x27;re maybe doing better than Feynman&#x27;s Brasil, but the available room for improvement is not small.<p>Anyway, interdisciplinary richly-interconnected sandbox&#x2F;playground play seems it might help?<p>And I&#x27;ve seen little like that.  Years ago, there was a computer game (name escapes me), loaded with a <i>big</i> database of objects.  So users, IIRC, could request almost arbitrary &quot;I want to wield a &lt;thing&gt;, while riding a &lt;thing&gt;&quot;.  IIRC, riding dinosaurs was popular.  So imagine using that to informally teach about the world.  &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, your giant ant collapsed upon creation, unable to support it&#x27;s L^3-scaled body on L^2-scaled leg thickness.  Give it elephant legs instead?&quot;<p>&gt; A virtual learning environment<p>And it needn&#x27;t be entirely virtual.  Witness projective sandboxes.[1]  I recently saw a talk by Cynthia Breazeal, where a furry robot, mounted on a desk next to a tablet with integrated apps, provides peer mentoring and emotional support.  So even if developing visual systems constrain the use of AR glasses to &quot;a shallow-3D virtual screen&quot;, we might still leverage mixed reality.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arsandbox.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arsandbox.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;</a>')
