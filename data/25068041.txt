(Especially when you can use a single server w&#x2F;o geodns to serve the whole world with a really low latency!)<p>I use it on my pet project website, and it allows for a remarkable first page load time.<p>And I don&#x27;t have to make all these old-school tricks, like inlining CSS &amp; JS.<p>HTTP&#x2F;2 Push allows for such a pleasant website development. You can have hundreds of images on the page, and normally, you&#x27;d be latency-bound to load it in a reasonable amount of time. And the way to solve it old-school is to merge them all into a one big image, and use CSS to use parts of the image instead of separate image URLs.  This is an ugly solution for a latency problem. Push is so much better!<p>The fact that 99% of people are too lazy to learn a new trick shouldn&#x27;t really hamstring people into using 30-year old tricks to get to a decent latency!')
