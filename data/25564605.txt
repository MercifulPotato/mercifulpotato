Interesting, but I found it was not practical despite the price and decided against it. First, an 800 GB LTO-4 tape is no longer high density by today&#x27;s standard, it couldn&#x27;t even hold a 1 TB HDD image, also, I still had to pay for the necessary SAS peripherals to get it working, finally, the mechanical assembly inside a 10-year-old tape drive was not something that inspires confidence for data backup... Last time I&#x27;ve looked up, the cheapest decommissioned LTO-5 drive still costs $1000.')
