Prediction that were key was a long war in the early 2000s and significant unrest in the 2020-2030 timeline.<p>His rationale was that the fall of the Soviets would take about 10-15 years to have a real impact on US policy and the 2020-30 timeframe was when the ruined farmers (caused by the policies of the 80s and 90s) passed the torch to the next generation in full and the broader ex-urban economy would be dead beyond redemption.<p>He was a brilliant kid, who unfortunately passed away too young in an accident.')
