The Platform group is building a global platform to drive logistics for emerging markets and far beyond. I&#x27;m the hiring manager and I&#x27;m looking for 3-4 folks to own and drive the vision and development of a large chunk of this platform. We&#x27;re pursuing a service mesh on top of kubernetes on the infrastructure side and are therefore (relatively) agnostic to the choice of language used for development. That said, experience with node.js, java, kotlin and golang are our preferred languages. Any experience with event sourcing or logistics, in particular, is highly desired.\nCome for the technology, stay for the chance to revolutionize global distribution of food, medicine and other critical resources.<p>Email me (james dot chainey at delhivery dot com) for more info.')
