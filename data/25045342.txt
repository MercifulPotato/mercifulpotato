I haven&#x27;t tweaked this yet to find the best possible value so it&#x27;s still quite high. In the future I want to observe the network quality (packets loss mainly, latency on the local network is not an issue in most cases) to use a custom latency for each network. As I use Opus for the audio encoding, I&#x27;ve enabled the packet loss concealer which is already helping in case of package loss.')
