But the correlation with how these implementations perform in general could be very loose. Maybe these services have a specific bottleneck that cripples OpenVPN or can offload crypto for wireguard, or are using very different combinations of algorithms, or are sending less popular protocols to specific and therefore idle pools..<p>While I would suspect wireguard performance is quite a bit better than a similar OpenVPN configuration, I would want to see analysis of specific setups and what resources they actually use on both sides.')
