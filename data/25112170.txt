Better for you and your family not to take the vaccine in the short term, and benefit from people around you taking it. I understand that is anti-social, but the logic cannot be denied if you&#x27;re interested in optimising risk for you and yours.<p>Taking a vaccine that no trial volunteers have lived with for more than a year is a _substantial_ risk whichever way you slice it.')
