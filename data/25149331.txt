The issues with them are:<p>- they are binary rather than decimal, so rounding behavior doesn’t match what humans expect<p>- some floating point <i>operations</i> have rounding&#x2F;error accumulation<p>You can multiply and divide a float by 2 all day long and every result will be exact, with no error accumulation. However, adding floats together is a different story :-)<p>That said, decimal types are still much preferable for anything that needs to be “exact” for human usage. It’s very easy to make a mistake with floats, even if they <i>could</i> support your use case.')
