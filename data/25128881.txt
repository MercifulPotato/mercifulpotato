We already know Zen 3 is +20% IPC over Zen 2 on the same process at the same power. So add 20% to the 4800U without changing anything else as a starting point.<p>Then toss in the process improvements from 5nm (which TSMC says is either 15% faster or 30% less power) as well as any further architectural improvements that AMD is doing in Zen 4 and there&#x27;s going to be a very significant gap between the 4800U and AMD&#x27;s 5nm 6800U or whatever they end up calling it.')
