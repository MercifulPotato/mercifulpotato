Item(by='bitminer', descendants=None, kids=[25484235, 25483899], score=None, time=1608436929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480829, text='There is a lot marketing bullshit in the Capella articles.<p>For example, the Singapore image of buildings and other detections by the SAR is clearly overlaid on an optical image with trees and bushes and respective shadows.  Trees and bushes are invisible to X-band (10GHz) SAR.  It has to be an optical image underlaying the radar data.<p>Look at it.  The detections by SAR are bright white.  Most of the image is grey-scale showing background items.<p>It is not advertised as such.   As an interpretable image, perhaps this is an improvement over notoriously hard-to-understand monochrome SAR imagery.  BUT! It is not described as such.  Hence my subjective evaluation as &quot;bullshit&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ichef.bbci.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;976&#x2F;cpsprodpb&#x2F;C172&#x2F;production&#x2F;_116122594_capella-space-spot-image_exxonmobil_petrochemical_complex_jurong_island_singapore-nc.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ichef.bbci.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;976&#x2F;cpsprodpb&#x2F;C172&#x2F;production&#x2F;...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-55326441" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;science-environment-55326441</a>')
