The problem seems to lie within the Prime Minister who essentially replaced the king. It&#x27;s no longer hereditary, but the position seems to have very absolute powers and just a few checks&#x2F;balances. That level of power is impossible to gather in European republics, they don&#x27;t view the prime minister as a ruler, it&#x27;s merely a manager of ministers who are each focused on managing one aspect of the state, also with very limited power, and each minister has a non-political counterpart who&#x27;s actually in charge of running the ministry itself <i>according to law</i>.')
