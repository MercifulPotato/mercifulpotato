For a trivial example, Rust lacks reflection but the following works just fine:<p><pre><code>    mod ModA {\n        pub struct A {\n            ref_to_b: Option&lt;Box&lt;crate::ModB::B&gt;&gt;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    mod ModB {\n        pub struct B {\n            ref_to_a: Option&lt;Box&lt;crate::ModA::A&gt;&gt;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAm I missing something?')
