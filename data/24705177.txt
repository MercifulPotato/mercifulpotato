Those who choose and insist on unsound tech risk going bust.<p>Governmental agencies act differently. Sometimes they seem to have the right structure and the right people at helm, like DARPA used to, and they provide great results. Sometimes this is not the case, and we e.g. end up with B-2, F-35, or Zumwalt.<p>With all that, I do support the idea that research done on tax money should be free to use for any US company, without patent restrictions and so on, even if not made public domain.')
