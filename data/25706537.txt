Trump didn&#x27;t literally say &quot;hey guys, go wreck up the Capitol&quot;, so his hands are clean.  But... the real world is not a computer program.  People can read between the lines.  In this case, Trump planned a rally on the exact day of the congressional certification of the election results.  He spent the previous two months telling his supporters the election was a fraud, and that they needed to &quot;stop the steal&quot;.   Then at the conveniently scheduled (and located) rally, he riled up the crowd and asked them to march to the Capitol.  They were able to read between the line and follow his orders.<p>It&#x27;s true that he didn&#x27;t write a line of code like &quot;minions.wreckUpTheCapitol()&quot; but in the non-programmer world, things need not be as certain.')
