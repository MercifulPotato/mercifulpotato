Itâ€™s just an extra added dead weight.<p>One technique is to reinforce the rocket base with more metal padding, and then on landing, the ground-based robotic clamps would magnetically lock on to the reinforced metal padding.<p>Or they can do it this way, and have a magnetic picker lock onto the top of the rocket. Then it would gently lower it to its final resting position.<p>But I think they would have to hover the rocket for a few extra seconds, while the robotic arm moves itself into place to perform the final catch.  This would require more fuel, which reduces payload capability.')
