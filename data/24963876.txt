Many many things in the sphere of alt-right hate speech, attacks on so-called “snowflake SJWs,” dismissal of the metoo movement, tacit endorsement of misogyny, dehumanization of immigrants and more are very widely understood now. Being “one step away” from MRA or Proud Boys hate speech or “one step away” from transphobic or homophobic hate speech is really not a widely debated subjective matter. These kinds of attempts to slowly legitimize hate speech are directly recognizable and ought to be called out and rejected.<p>It is wrong to hide behind vague claims that because “it’s subjective” we should allow the Overton window to be dragged toward endorsement of hate speech.<p>&gt; “ So do you see how you have identified discourse that you associate with a community as the same as that community? What if your association is the part that&#x27;s incorrect?”<p>No, I do not think you’ve succeeded in making a case for this point. I am not substituting <i>my association</i> of speech in as an unfair characteristic of a group. <i>That group</i> is doing the association all on their own.<p>This is exactly the kind of extenuating excuse-making that should not be treated as reasonable or civil inquiry.<p>To me, your comment would be like saying, “Can’t you see how <i>you</i> are defining the KKK as a cross-burning anti-black group? <i>You</i> are letting <i>your association</i> of cross-burning as ‘bad’ lead you to ‘subjective’ judgment that the group is bad. Maybe it’s just an unusual social group and we should all be more open-minded.”<p>To me, that is identical to what you are saying in your comment.<p>Sometimes the answer is just no. The group defines itself with horrific practices or words, nobody else applies that association for them.<p>When hate speech is slightly watered down and dressed up as legit inquiry it is even worse. It attempts to legitimize it like a Trojan Horse to establish unequivocally unacceptable beliefs as if they deserve equal footing in some “let’s all be above the fray and act like more evolved rational agents” disingenuous claptrap.')
