Founded by two teachers in 1998, the company helps teachers prepare more than two million students annually for subject area end-of-grade, end-of-course, and college entrance assessments. The platform delivers standards-aligned content with daily tools for the creation of formative and summative assessments, progress monitoring, and customized remediation. Teachers using USATestprep are able to quickly identify student strengths and weakness for high-stakes testing in ELA, math, science and social studies.<p>Our small R&amp;D team is looking for a mid-level to senior full-stack developer who is passionate about technology making a meaningful impact in students’ lives and eager to find new ways to better serve our customers and make our platform excellent for the long-term. We are in need of someone who can work across the stack, with bonus points if you have extensive experience rearchitecting legacy applications.<p>Our current platform is a well-travelled PHP&#x2F;MySQL application, so much of the initial work will be focused on building out new features and maintaining the system. Looking ahead to Q4 2020 and 2021, we plan to introduce micro-services and fundamentally rework our application and user experiences.<p>We’re a fun team that very much embodies the “For Teachers, By Teachers” spirit of our founders, and we care deeply, now more than ever, about providing the best resources for teachers and students.<p>Sound interesting?
