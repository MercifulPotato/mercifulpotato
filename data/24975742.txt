Using mine feels like a glimpse 10 years into the future of computing. Unlike the Hololens 1 where you had to move your head and hands counterintuitively to &quot;air click&quot; on things, with the Hololens 2 you just reach out and touch the UI and holograms in front of you (or if they&#x27;re far away, you can point a finger and a sci-fi laser shoots out of it so you can click from afar). My overwhelming sense is that this is obviously the next wave of computing.')
