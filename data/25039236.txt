The one exception to that is my primary phone. There&#x27;s a set of functions I expect it to perform, and that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t see it as a general purpose computer, nor do I want to be responsible for it&#x27;s administration. The way I see it, I am paying apple to administer it for me. If it was my only device, I would not be able to use it, but I have so many computers that I&#x27;m ok with not being root on my phone if I never have to spend a thought on maintaining it.')
