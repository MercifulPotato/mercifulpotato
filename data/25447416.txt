Even getting the OSM tileset in is a pain - not even just from the filesize.<p>Should add that I wanted to self host mostly for privacy. This project I&#x27;m working on I&#x27;m trying really hard to have no external requests and everything privacy respecting. Unfortunately I really need maps on it and none of the providers I&#x27;ve seen are either in budget or have a compatible privacy policy.')
