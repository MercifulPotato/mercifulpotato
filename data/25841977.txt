Null is just an extra state that can be useful, but sometimes it is so uncommon that we pretend that state is not there.<p>Back when C programming was more prevalent I don&#x27;t think null was that big an issue because most programmers were aware of it and would check for it.<p>On second thought, the other big issue with null is that in many languages it just crashes the program which is a rather severe consequence you don&#x27;t see for most mistakes.')
