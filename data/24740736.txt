The overall length and with of the shoe as well as the height of the foot fits well, but the heel counter shape can cause a lot of trouble. I tend to buy another pair in the same model and size when I find a decent shoe, but obviously this doesn&#x27;t work across models and brands. Last month I did 3 returns until I found an acceptable model.')
