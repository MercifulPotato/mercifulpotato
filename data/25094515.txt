Item(by='Xophmeister', descendants=None, kids=[25095103], score=None, time=1605379574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25091705, text='That was a great talk :)<p>The last example of an extension that increases expressive power of a language — adding truthy&#x2F;falsey conditionals, over pure Boolean conditionals — is messing with my intuition! The talk obviously showed an example to prove this, and I follow the logic, but I still find it a surprising result. Maybe it chimes with one of the questions that was asked; the context required to show the distinction is engineered and quite “unnatural” (at the risk of being “hand-wavy”), which is at odds with the human meaning of expressiveness.')
