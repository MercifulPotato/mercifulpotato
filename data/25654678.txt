For example, a pizza place that serves $5 pies from 3-6pm, a chicken place that does BOGO on Tuesdays, a sushi bar with 30% off after 10pm.<p>I created <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fullprice.no" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fullprice.no</a> (as in, &quot;wanna pay full price? No!&quot;), my goal from Day 1 was to make it the easiest way to find some restaurant deals nearby, right now, with as little distraction as possible.<p>Like many sites, there&#x27;s a chicken&#x2F;egg problem... getting people to visit without fresh deals, and getting restaurants to add deals without a huge audience. I did all the deal inputs by hand for a while, one-by-one, but it got to be too much. As far as audience, I got very frustrated after adding a whole lot of specific, Google-recommended structured data and then seeing no results.<p>I&#x27;d love to work alongside an enthusiastic marketing, social media, &quot;let&#x27;s rally&quot; type of person who can develop an audience and generate excitement -- that&#x27;s just not me.<p>just some technical notes: I&#x27;ve already enhanced the base concept with direct links to Doordash, Grubhub, etc, and maps and Yelp. Also already built the infrastructure for restaurants to manage their own listings and to be honest, that is some of the coolest tech.<p>any and all comments are appreciated... fp@ or info@ the domain above<p>best of luck to everyone reading or posting in this thread!')
