No one trusts the opposing parties with cheating, so every single vote is watched by six parties simultaneously during the count:<p>1. There are paper ballots thrown in the cases<p>2. After the election ends, the votes are counted openly. It is a constitutional right to be there and watch while votes are counted.<p>3. After the count ends, the tally is written down and posted for anyone to see. People take pictures of the tally in order to upload into a central database - be it a party&#x27;s or an unaffiliated third party&#x27;s<p>4. The cases are then shipped to the election committee, which aggregate the results. They also post the results of each case, so that anyone can check against the database and contest of there are mistakes.<p>The whole process is open to be checked by everyone and since trust is so low these days, everyone keeps track very closely. Even in Turkey&#x27;s conditions, this gives some kind of peace of mind.')
