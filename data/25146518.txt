Item(by='Hamuko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605763658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25141832, text='&gt;<i>The internal storage is fine if you&#x27;re buying physical copies of games</i><p>Well, sure, if you&#x27;re only buying physical. However, that&#x27;s not really something you can expect in these days. The Switch has 26 GB of usable storage. That&#x27;s not a lot considering Breath of the Wild is over 13 GB.<p>The Xbox One and PS4 come with at least 500 GB. Even if you account for the fact that the download sizes there are larger, there&#x27;s still much more space proportionally, so you&#x27;re going to be spending more money to get the full experience on a Switch.<p>&gt;<i>I also think the JoyCon grips are fine for TV play</i><p>It&#x27;s pretty much the worst controller out there. Not only is it incredibly uncomfortable, it&#x27;s rather unreliable. The drift issue on the Joy-cons is pretty noted. And once again coming to the controller price issue, the Pro Controller is $70, Joy-cons are $80, where as the Xbox and PlayStation ones are $60, and there&#x27;s much less of a need to get one since there&#x27;s one in the box for you already.<p>&gt;<i>while I&#x27;d also recommend a screen protector, I don&#x27;t know anyone else who has one IRL</i><p>I don&#x27;t know if there are any people who haven&#x27;t actually gotten screen protectors, especially since it was reported that sliding the device in and out of the dock may incur scratches on the screen. When one of the basic features of the devices can result in scratches, you really want one.<p>&gt;<i>whatever the proper cost of games should be, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s healthy for games as a medium that they loose a third of their value in a few months</i><p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it&#x27;s healthy for old games to retain their value better than stocks. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for consumers if they&#x27;re still going to be paying brand new game price for BotW couple of years later when it&#x27;s a five-year-old game.<p>Really, speaking from experience, I have a PS4 and a Switch. For the PS4, the only accessory that I&#x27;ve had to buy was a charging dock, and I don&#x27;t really consider it an essential one. I could charge with a cable just fine, but the dock is just a bit nicer and looks a bit better. For the Switch however, I&#x27;ve had to buy an SD card, case, screen protector and a Pro Controller, all of which I consider pretty necessary to get the full experience.')
