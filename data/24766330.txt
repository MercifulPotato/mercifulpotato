But the scientific computing community includes a lot of people who have no exposure to computing at all, so that vectors are copied when passed by value (as opposed to a fat pointer a la Go slices) is a performance foot gun for these new users. For that matter, a lot of people coming to C++ from any higher level language will likely be tripped on on this for a while.<p>&gt; Mastering C++ isn&#x27;t even required to be productive using it, since there&#x27;s no need to use all the language features simply because they exist.<p>Right, I was distinguishing between &quot;mastering&quot; and &quot;knowing enough to be productive&quot;. I&#x27;m asserting that you can master Go in far less time than is required to be merely productive in C++ (granted, I&#x27;m assuming &quot;productive&quot; means &quot;you&#x27;re not regularly introducing memory leaks, segfaults, etc&quot; i.e., &quot;you understand memory management best practices in C++&quot;). Specifically, I think it takes 1-2 months for a newbie programmer to become a master of Go and ~6 months to become merely &quot;productive&quot; in C++ (bear in mind that even figuring out how to build non-trivial C++ programs is itself a herculean feat).')
