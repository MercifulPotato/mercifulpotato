Just ordered some SS stud anchors from there today. Didn&#x27;t bother checking the hardware store for them.<p>Another distributor that is super strong on the fulfillment side is Digikey. I had a tour of their operation several years ago and it was amazing. I saw orders picked and moving to the UPS truck 10 minutes after payment. Web site not nearly as good as McMaster though.')
