What&#x27;s curious to me is why it&#x27;s not fixed.<p>It&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s impossible to make anime and pay a good wage I suppose but ... assuming it is possible you&#x27;d expect some animators to quit and start their own company and attract all the talent by paying well and not over-working their employees. So what&#x27;s preventing that from happening?<p>Same with games.<p>One idea (which I don&#x27;t like), the odds of making a game or anime that make it&#x27;s money back is extremely small. Either you make Minecraft (game) or One Piece (anime) or you more likely make &quot;Tower Miners&quot; or &quot;Comic Party&quot; (I just googled failed games and failed anime).<p>Just like saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to be a music Rock Star&#x2F;NYT best selling author&#x2F;Movie star&quot;, the odds that you will be the next hit star are extremely low. It&#x27;s no different for games. And if it&#x27;s not a hit you lose money which means you don&#x27;t make a living wage.<p>Is that the reason those industries pay so low? Because the odds of them making their money back are like 1000 to 1 against and so they have to keep budgets as small as possible just to survive until they hit the 1 out of the 1000?<p>Is there some other way to get a $$$$$$$ budget to pay 10-15 people a living wage while the odds of making back that money on sales are 1000 to 1?<p>PS: I know the story in anime is that prices that broadcasters &#x2F; publishers pay are low because of history but that seems irrelevant in 2020 when you can reach fans via the internet.')
