Item(by='aiisnotthis', descendants=None, kids=[24818818, 24818792], score=None, time=1603030027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24817249, text='This seems to be displaying a common disconnect between the perceptions of &quot;AI&quot; and what modern AI actually is.<p>There is no &quot;emergent&quot; phenomenon currently in AI. I am thinking that the closest concept to what the author is asking for is a generative model, but even this does not really come close to performing tasks like &quot;discovering&quot; a new programming language. And it certainly would not discover an &quot;emergent&quot; anything. If it did  &quot;discover&quot; anything it would be an object very statistically similar to the objects used to construct the model in the first place (e.g., deep fakes).<p>Everything in current AI is data first (read: data only). You can sometimes synthesize data and use that, but you always start with real-world data, and the models you end up with are parameterizations of the data you trained with. Always. So, while there is a future where a technical answer can be supplied to this question appropriately ... We are as of yet not in that future.<p>I consider this a technically valid answer and not a dismissal of the author&#x27;s question, btw.')
