With the minor exception of heavy element decay, there is no nuclei synthesis on Earth. So elements planet and we consist of were made before, some of them in stars and then spread out though supernovae explosions, and some of them in the Big Bang.<p>Since we have so much heavy elements, our elements are not even from the first generation of stars. AFAIR itâ€™s a third generation of supernovae explosions.')
