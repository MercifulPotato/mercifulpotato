I install synapse (a matrix server) on my own machine. I install Element on my own phone. I connect one to another, and via the server to other servers.<p>2. I install a client that connects to reddit. Same reddit as everyone else. Same reddit as the reddit website.<p>There is a rather significant difference, isn&#x27;t there?<p>EDIT addressing the &#x27;hate speech&#x27; part, you are correct. If one reddit client is banned, all should be banned. But that is not true for communication apps, like Element.')
