Saying a one line disclaimer &quot;That doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>trying</i> to help people is bad&quot; falls flat when you spend the entire article constructing a special category of <i>personal failure</i> for people who fail to effect change: &quot;moral incompetence&quot;.<p>This doesn&#x27;t help anyone learn anything except that apparently if you fail, it might be because you didn&#x27;t actually care about succeeding in the first place! Your failure likely involved concrete issues that can be learned from and changed, chalking it up to &quot;oh well it turns out I was the problem&quot; is an unproductive take-away and only serves to discourage people who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t have the right intentions as you define them. Let&#x27;s leave the mental purity tests aside, modern society works because people have the space &amp; incentive to do good regardless of their intention.')
