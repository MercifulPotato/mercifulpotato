Item(by='zapzupnz', descendants=None, kids=[25014990], score=None, time=1604752280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013735, text='&gt; maybe you should check what you think of other cultures, before getting offended for a software using the name GIMP<p>I have no idea what that has to do with my comment, I didn&#x27;t say anything about that.<p>But even so, how does one offensive stereotype mean that something else, also offensive, should be dismissed as non-stereotypical?<p>If you feel so strongly about &quot;mamma mia&quot;, then you should have no problem with other people feeling strongly about the implications of &#x27;GIMP&#x27;, regardless of its origin (which you haven&#x27;t mentioned once; it&#x27;s a film reference).<p>If you don&#x27;t feel that strongly about people saying &quot;mamma mia&quot; as an Italian stereotype, naturally you would have no particular interest in GIMP. So why the passion and derision for those who do care?<p>I know why.<p>To throw in a cheap shot at Americans.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not American.<p>&gt; Edit: but, as usual, judging from the immediate downvote Americans won&#x27;t accept that they are only 5% of the World population...<p>&gt; Americans can&#x27;t accept that their culture is meaningless globally and their puritans problems have no significance for 95% of the World population<p>Your vitriol against Americans, as though anybody expressing an opinion with which you don&#x27;t agree and speaks English must be American, speaks more to me about your position on this matter than anything else.<p>That&#x27;s one reason I downvoted your comment.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t Reddit, I known this is a circle jerk of people thinking they are better than redditors just because it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to think here.<p>Actually, no. The reason I mentioned that this isn&#x27;t reddit is because we have a set of community guidelines (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>).<p>Second guideline from the bottom: &quot;Please don&#x27;t comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.&quot;<p>Because yeah, people getting upset about downvotes is dull. Moreso when it includes a needless dig at our users and American friends.<p>That&#x27;s another reason I downvoted your comment.<p>&gt; On Reddit at least people don&#x27;t downvote you without commenting on why<p>Actually, they do. It&#x27;s a well-known problem that people don&#x27;t just downvote for content that they think is inappropriate or irrelevant, as per reddit&#x27;s guidelines, but rather downvote content or comments with which they don&#x27;t agree.<p>Heck, that was the motivation for hiding actual vote numbers a few years back. It&#x27;s a known problem.<p>Besides, people on HN do tend to comment because constructive argumentation is generally encouraged by the community guidelines. So long as it leads somewhere.')
