Economists today are just modern day Oracles&#x2F;Seers that use their equations&#x2F;models in a similar manner to how a Seer would throw chicken bones to foretell the future. Because of these Economists seem to break up into factions making it more similar to religious belief IMO. You even see many Economists ignore evidence that contradicts their pet theory.<p>I think it&#x27;s dangerous to take their ideas too seriously.')
