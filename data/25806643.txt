Same goes for the lack of cutscenes that take control of the player’s camera. You always feel like you’re looking from your own POV vs. being pulled out of the immersion.</i><p>Perhaps if one go about his daily life talking to walls and being completely disinterested in what a man might have to reflect back.<p>Whether you reply back to them or not, it always leads to an unnatural conversation where one party is talking to a wall that doesn&#x27;t respond.')
