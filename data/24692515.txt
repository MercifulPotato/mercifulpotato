(I&#x27;m not claiming practicality here, just possibility), perhaps desoldering &amp; resoldering the respective chips onto a new daughterboard or even a PCI card.<p>Does <i>that</i> make it a Mac still?  You could literally replace almost every component in a Mac except for the motherboard and have it still be a Mac, but shouldn&#x27;t the converse be true as well?  If I used the original case, hard drive&#x2F;SSD, video card, keyboard &amp; mouse, even the CPU, but replaced just the logic board (swapping the ROM&#x2F;EFI&#x2F;SMC somehow), it seems to me it would still be considered a Mac.  Particularly if in the process the original logic board was rendered inoperative to head off any claims of duplicate license use.')
