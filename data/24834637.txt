If I &quot;parrot&quot; (Accurately repeat) the original statement, it does not in any way demonstrate understanding, only memorization&#x2F;note-taking.<p>&gt;Restating, summarizing, or paraphrasing, shows that I understand sufficiently that I can describe it in my own words rather than memorization.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely correct. Restating the concept(s) presented definitely provides confirmation that they have been heard and understood[0].<p>I&#x27;d only add that doing so may also alert the other party to a <i>lack</i> of understanding, requiring further discussion, which is arguably as or <i>more</i> useful than just assuming you are understood.<p>[0] See what I did there? :)')
