I don&#x27;t mean to over-represent my credentials.<p>Farms operate on very slim margins, so small changes can make a big difference. Some trees require more babying when they graft (including time to be ready for market), and some require more fertilizer (of the various types) than others (and perform poorly with too much).<p>Some apples do bruise more readily than others, and the red varieties tend to show the brusing less. That doesn&#x27;t prevent some from being successful anyway; Granny Smiths are my favorite. But a small percent differential of loss can make the difference between a farmer&#x27;s choice to grow that or not.')
