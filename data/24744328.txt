Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602402310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736849, text='&gt; <i>When we observe this tendency in other (non-programming) contexts we may interpret it as laziness or short attention span. When we react this way to code we blame the code and the original programmer.</i><p>Strongly agreed. Particularly about a lot of examples of the so-called &quot;clever code&quot;.<p>Programming is a profession. You can&#x27;t expect to forever coast on what little knowledge landed you your first job. You&#x27;re supposed to learn and improve over time. That means learning to understand more complex code, architectures and programming paradigms.<p>I can&#x27;t read Haskell code at all. But I don&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;unreadable&quot;. I realize the code is probably fine, it&#x27;s me who needs to <i>pick up a book and learn the language</i>.<p>There&#x27;s rampant anti-intellectualism and (the bad kind of) laziness in programmer circles, thinly veiled as concern for efficiency (&quot;less clever code = easier to debug&quot;, or &quot;helps juniors contribute&quot;, as if the job of a junior wasn&#x27;t - in big part - to be <i>learning to become a senior</i>); I find it just being penny wise, pound foolish. Lambda expressions[0], regular expressions, pattern matching, Lisp macros - this is not clever code, these are tools that can greatly reduce complexity and improve readability. They just require spending a few hours or days with a book, every now and then.<p>--<p>[0] - Yes, really; few jobs back, just after we transitioned to Java 8, I was told by my boss to maybe refrain from using lambda expressions for the sake of &quot;more junior&quot; people. Right, because polluting code with anonymous classes is easier on juniors than (event) -&gt; { few lines; } in some GUI event handler.')
