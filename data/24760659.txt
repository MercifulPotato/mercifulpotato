Item(by='75dvtwin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602544890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756902, text='&gt;But the reason I wanna mainly talk about is that engineers, developers, whatever you want to call them\n...\n&gt; I think great UX designers just grew up naturally having much more empathy towards others and having a much better ability to place themselves in others shoes and see the world from their eyes.<p>Wow, ok.  So software developers (or whatever we call them...) grew up naturally to have less empathy for others, than UX designers...<p>It seem to hit multiple of logical fallacies [1]<p>I would like to ask the Arvand from Cakewalk Labs this:<p>May I also &#x27;extrapolate&#x27; that software developers (or whatever we call them..) are not as good parents, spouses, care takers, friends, siblings, when compared to UX practitioners?<p>Are software developers also closer to displaying symptoms of the illnesses listed here (again when compared to UX folks)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;antisocial-personality-disorder&#x2F;symptoms-causes&#x2F;syc-20353928" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;antisocial-pe...</a><p>?<p>While I am disappointed in authors conclusion and explanation, I think observations have merit.<p>In a typical project,  objectively grading (if possible), contribution to &#x27;good&#x27; UX of a final product, by somebody who has been  full-time software developer for a long time vs somebody who is product owner, or a UX designer -- we will find that the software developer contributed less to good UX.<p>This could be because, software developers, when working on complex software,  must be in the mode of optimizing and reducing, while maintain clarity, verifiable correctness (as it is, eventually,  the CPUs that interpret the work of software developers, not opinions of end users...)<p>That mind set, does not directly translate on to UX work.<p>In my experience, software developer has to &#x27;switch&#x27; the mind set so to speak. To value human interaction constraints, context in which software is used, guidelines and patterns for good UX. And this switch, usually, hard and expensive to do (in both time and effort).<p>It has nothing to do of how software developers &#x27;grew up&#x27; and the levels of their empathy.<p>I would also suggest that incentives for software developers are different than for UX consultants. So it is natural, and perhaps business-inspired, that software developer would resist software changes that do not expressly address written requirements or bug reports.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owl.purdue.edu&#x2F;owl&#x2F;general_writing&#x2F;academic_writing&#x2F;logic_in_argumentative_writing&#x2F;fallacies.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owl.purdue.edu&#x2F;owl&#x2F;general_writing&#x2F;academic_writing&#x2F;...</a>')
