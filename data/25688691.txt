Item(by='Diederich', descendants=None, kids=[25689222, 25689000], score=None, time=1610132859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687936, text='&gt; please don&#x27;t judge me<p>I&#x27;ll say it out loud: though I despise Trump and mourn the damage he and those enabling have caused, I spend more time online looking at pro-Trump, conservative and Republican focused material than anything else.  I downvote none of it, even the legit crazy&#x2F;scary stuff, and in the rare cases I comment, it&#x27;s carefully worded to be neutral or even sometimes conciliatory, though always honest.<p>It scares me that many people feel the need to apologize for openly admitting that they <i>looked</i> at material from &#x27;the other side&#x27;.<p>More often, people will refrain from posting their actual, perhaps nuanced views entirely, due to the fear of being judged&#x2F;attacked&#x2F;whatever.  Didn&#x27;t Paul Graham write an essay about that?<p>My wife was writing a research essay to present to our local Toastmasters group, which she is a relatively new member of.  She was going over the talk with one of the senior members, one on one, on zoom, and she mentioned, <i>in passing</i>, that our family is going to delay getting the Covid19 vaccine a couple of months, because we&#x27;ve been exercising (essentially) phase 0 (extreme) lockdown consistently since last March.  We can do that because we&#x27;re blessed with the ability to work and (for our son) go to school from home.<p>The person my wife mentioned this to just lost her shit, and went into a verbal rampage about how to delay getting the vaccine is akin to being an anti-vaxer, how it was immoral to not get it as soon as humanly possible.<p>To be clear: If any of me, my wife or son came into contact with other human beings with any frequency, we&#x27;d get the vaccine as soon as possible.  We&#x27;re not afraid of it.<p>But others need it before we do.<p>However, that &#x27;nuance&#x27; was entirely lost in an emotional, knee-jerk reaction which reminds me of so many other things we see today.<p>Was there voter fraud in the 2020 US presidential election?  I&#x27;d bet my life on it; that there was at least a single single incident of fraud.  Did that fraud in any way change the outcome of the election?  Of course not.<p>Apologies for the tangent.<p>I want to encourage <i>everyone</i> to consider looking carefully, deeply and compassionately at what &#x27;the other side&#x27; writes and says.  It&#x27;s not easy to do, but I believe it&#x27;s a necessary, critical work that all of us need to honestly engage in.')
