There&#x27;s no reason for Facebook or Twitter to let you hide content that wastes your time when they profit from wasting your time (a better word for &quot;engagement&quot;).<p>Remove the &quot;engagement&quot; revenue source (or make it unprofitable due to liability, regulation regarding privacy, etc) and most problems with centralized social media will go away (centralization isn&#x27;t actually that big of an issue - plenty of things we use on a daily basis are centralized and it&#x27;s not causing any issues as long as incentives are aligned).')
