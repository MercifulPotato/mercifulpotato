It&#x27;s just an area where they&#x27;re willing to compromise.<p>Without IBIS, the αN &lt; 6500s aren&#x27;t great for many video applications, they&#x27;re photo cameras which can also take some video. I suspect that Sony just didn&#x27;t realize the degree to which the YouTube generation would be using their entry-level mirrorless systems for extensive video. Consider that it took them a generation to make flip screens standard, and that they bumped the battery size and ability to record indefinitely on (only) the model which has IBIS: that&#x27;s a nudge, saying &quot;If you want to record a lot of video, the α6600 is the model you want&quot;.')
