It would have been much easier to build ISS if you had that capability.<p>Remove the Solid Boosters and make the Core Booster better to further reduce risk.<p>Once you are there you can just make the first stage land like SpaceX Falcon 9 does and have the Orbiter land like a plane.<p>Even better to put the Space plane on top of the booster, rather then the side to reduce risk.<p>And if your at that point, you realize you don&#x27;t need the massive cross range capability, you can remove the massive wings.<p>Then you are already pretty close to SpaceX Starship design.')
