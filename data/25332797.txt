The BTU per $ efficiency for those sources is unmatched by electric.  North-eastern and mid-western winters get <i>cold</i> and brutal.  It&#x27;s just not feasible to heat a home using electric in these areas without serious consideration put into insulation.<p>Rural homes, in my experience, use propane stored in tanks onsite, rather than natural gas piped in from a central source.  And older suburban homes use onsite &quot;heating oil&quot; stored in tanks, usually in the basement, though, these homes are often converted to use nat-gas piped in from a utility.')
