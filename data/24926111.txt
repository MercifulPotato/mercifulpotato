There&#x27;s a reason we do root-cause analysis and five-whys exercises. If the source of the problem is not corrected, the problem does not go away.<p>If your basement is flooding from a burst pipe, maybe you can &quot;reduce the associated downsides&quot; by bailing it out. This doesn&#x27;t fix the problem though, does it? You&#x27;re actually prolonging and exacerbating the issue by not turning off the water from the source.<p>Temporary band-aids that address the symptom rather than the disease are not effective in the long run. They also often come with secondary effects and unintended consequences that create additional problems.')
