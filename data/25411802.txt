Would you say they are on the public cloud which is inherently virtualized to begin with?<p>A lot of people that have not deployed unikernels might not be aware of how they are actually deployed. When we deploy our websites and database and such to something like Google or AWS we upload a disk image. That disk image is then converted into a machine image. On AWS that would be an AMI. Then we boot that AMI and that AMI <i>only</i> contains your program. There is no underlying linux that you deploy and then you ssh into and install some k8s substitute.<p>So, yes, in comparison to launching a linux instance on AWS or Google, then installing k8s or using nomad or something like that, that has to inherently duplicate networking, duplicate storage, duplicate security, and many other things - yes it reduces quite a lot. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the fact that many unikernels tend to run much faster for other reasons. We are just talking about not having to use things like underlay&#x2F;overlay networks or storage proxies.<p>Again, the images that are deployed get managed by the cloud of choice - so your networking, storage, security, etc. is all managed by that cloud.')
