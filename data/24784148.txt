Since yesterday and today are Amazon Prime days, I&#x27;ve been using to compare if the &quot;deals&quot; are really deals.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that for some of the items I&#x27;m looking for (like wireless chargers), the price of the items were slowly increased in the weeks leading up to Prime Day, so the deals are still more expensive than earlier in the summer. I think it&#x27;s a typical business practice, but it&#x27;s nice to see it verified in a chart.')
