Bind themselves and everybody else.<p>Have a constitution that enshrines the right to things like fair elections and free speech. Have an amendment process that requires two thirds of the Senate, in a Senate that only has one third of the seats up for election in any given year. And three quarters of the states, which rarely agree on anything. Things like that.<p>Then even if the populists get in once, they don&#x27;t have the power to end elections or free speech. And once the people see their true nature, they lose the next one.<p>Obviously you do have to be very careful not to allow any end runs around that process.')
