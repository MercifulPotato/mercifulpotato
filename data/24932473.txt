Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603990137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929399, text='&gt; You might want to read the EULA<p>And you might want to read EuGH Rs. C-128&#x2F;11.<p>Nowhere does it allow reselling used software that is still activated. It only concerns the right to make copies for personal use (well, duh), and reselling non-activated keys as well as software packages associated with it.<p>The license terms concerning the use (e.g. activation) are NOT subject of the ruling. Why is that so hard to understand? Copying software and the license to USE said software legally are two different issues.<p>It&#x27;s akin to the difference between property and possession. Being in possession of and selling a (digital) copy of a piece of software doesn&#x27;t imply <i>ownership</i> of said software and the license involved.<p>But please feel free to provide me with a ruling that says otherwise.')
