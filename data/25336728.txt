Item(by='com2kid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607371917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336285, text='&gt; I had this issue and ended up replacing my set of cheap and cheerfull, thin-ish and slightly warped pans with heavy, thick stainless steel ones that hopefully don&#x27;t have a tendency to warp. So far so good.<p>Gah, same, but now my triple clad stainless steel -&gt; copper -&gt; stainless steel pot takes forever to heat up because of how thick it is.<p>I bought an electric kettle for tea but that doesn&#x27;t help keep noodles from taking 16 minutes to make, the first 10 of which is boiling the water.<p>Now I am using gas, so my next purchase is going to be another cheap thin pot that heats up before the rest of dinner is done.')
