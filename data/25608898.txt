Especially in grade school, it doesn&#x27;t need to take more than 15-20 minutes to go from &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot; to &quot;I a really need to go&quot;. Especially when bathroom privileges are rationed out &amp; tightly controlled and you become hyper aware of your bladder state. I have my two young kids &quot;do a try&quot; in the bathroom before we leave the house for any car ride. That doesn&#x27;t stop the occasional &quot;I have to go!&quot; 20 minutes into the trip. And sure enough, at the rest stop it&#x27;s like my kid turned from a 6 year old into an elephant from the amount that comes out of their body.<p>When &amp; how quickly you develop the need to urinate depends on a lot of factors: Your specific metabolism, recent activity, what you drank <i>and</i> ate, body position, and probably more. And at some point mentally, you simply pass a threshold where one minute you feel no need to go to the bathroom, and the next minute you do. If that &quot;next minute&quot; occurs 10 minutes after lunch break, so what? What is gained by denying that need?')
