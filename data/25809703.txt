See California Champagne and Kraft Parmesan cheese. I don&#x27;t think anyone attending Singularity University thinks it is a real university; their paying audience generally already has a university degree.<p>Singularity University is basically an overpriced executive MBA program, mostly paid for by non Americans excited to visit Silicon Valley. For people with infinite money looking for a taste of Silicon Valley and wanting to invest in cutting edge stuff here, their actual educational materials are totally acceptable.<p>I used to work with their current law and blockchain lecturer.')
