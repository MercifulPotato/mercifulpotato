Sure, the horses would generally try to avoid obstacles, but horses pulling a heavy carriage at speed are not infinitely maneuverable. So, I doubt that cars would have ever seemed like a huge risk initially simply because it wasn&#x27;t significantly different from what came immediately before it.')
