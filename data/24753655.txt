You don&#x27;t have to become a lawyer, but knowing and understanding the difference between proprietorship (ownership) and possession is a good start. Same goes for renting vs. licensing vs. ownership.<p>TL;DR you do not have ownership of any software that came with any device you bought and it&#x27;s not hyperbole at all.')
