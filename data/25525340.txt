You’ll also find people who are there purely for the potential upside when&#x2F;if the company exists.<p>I think what you’re really trying to ask is: Are we all destined to end up jaded by the tech industry and in turn end up trying to maximize our salaries in order to get out as quickly as possible?<p>So far the only place where I have seen most of the employees give a damn are companies that hire mostly senior people, that pay above market and that are fully bootstrapped, so they don’t offer stock&#x2F;options.<p>Once you reach a “senior role”, you’re going to be getting compensated well enough that slaving to squeeze a little extra money every year is just not a great return on that investment. So you either show up and just do work that you’re happy with and find fulfilling or you leave and build your thing.')
