My anecdote for this was our teacher instantiated a &quot;hierarchy&quot; of readers in several &quot;colors&quot;. This was in 3rd grade. I was one of the poorer kids in class and she placed me in the lowest tier which of course made 3rd grade me pissed off. I knew I was one of the best readers and spellers (if not the best) in the class at the time and I was furious to the point of almost crying when I found out which &quot;color&quot; I was. The only thing I could figure at the time was that I was one of poorest brown kids in the class and she just didn&#x27;t like me. I promptly worked my way through all the &quot;exercises&quot; until I beat most of the rest of the class to the &quot;end&quot; time-wise, other than the ones who started out in the highest &quot;colors&quot; to begin with. She even accused me of cheating at one point and watched me as I completed one and got a perfect score on it like I had most of the others. Teachers are human just like the rest of us and can show bias for lots of reason based on race, gender, etc.')
