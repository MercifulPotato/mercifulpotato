I think I find value in the things I do because of characteristics inherent to them, not because I won&#x27;t be around forever. Or at least I think the latter view holds some merit because, at least for now, humans lives are finite - but I would like to imagine even with immortality that my interest in things wouldn&#x27;t change.')
