Mine score users daily, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about building an API.<p>Logging is pretty available in both (though better in Python to be fair).<p>I don&#x27;t really see how building my model in Python would make it easier to add this API functionality either, so it&#x27;s a bit irrelevant. Like my docker container (which appears to be almost essential in Python but nice in R) can call predict in any language, and then pass through to the API using the tools noted above.')
