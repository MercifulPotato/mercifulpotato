We&#x27;re pretty much on our own. Somehow, with less time we accomplish more.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s not a drastic change from my day-to-day (like learning a musical instrument, a dance, or a language), but it&#x27;s new to me, and something I want to do more of in the coming years.<p>The ways I incorporate it into family time are: designing pen&amp;paper games and playing them with the kids; designing levels&#x2F;characters, and drawing&#x2F;doodling with the kids; coming up with narratives&#x2F;stories and telling them to the kids.<p>I&#x27;m a gamer. When my wife and I first got together, we played a lot of games together (Resident Evil on the sofa, Scrabble&#x2F;Carcassonne at the pub). She works in TV and one of her first jobs was with Gamepad [1] (we&#x27;re still good friends with Violet and family). So, the games runs deep, and I would love to spend more of my time making them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gamepad_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gamepad_(TV_series)</a>')
