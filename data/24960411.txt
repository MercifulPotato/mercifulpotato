I would think HN would be the perfect place to discuss this &quot;new&quot; currency and all its implications but I get a lot of amorphous push back whenever I bring it up here. Complaints seems to be along the lines of it being &quot;not anonymous&quot; or no better than credit cards, arguments I would expect from my 70 year old father but not from the young techies I assume to inhabit this forum.<p>Some day Bitcoin &quot;failed to live up to its promise&quot;, another argument I can&#x27;t grasp. My take is that Bitcoin just seems to rub you guys the wrong way and I would love to know more about why.')
