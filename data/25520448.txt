YouTube&#x27;s primary function is <i>entertainment</i>. Many people also derive educational and informational value from  it, but that&#x27;s incidental. Wikipedia and Google News probably serve that purpose better.<p>2. The most straightforward way to measure how well YouTube serves as an entertainment channel is viewer minutes. There are drawbacks to measuring per-session or per-view minutes (short term outrage spikes can backfire later), so it&#x27;s better to maximize life-time viewer minutes. These can&#x27;t be measured directly, but need to be modeled&#x2F;predicted. But it&#x27;s a refinement of viewer-minutes, not a fundamentally different metric.<p>Contention:<p>Maximizing viewer lifetime minutes is the best practical way for YouTube to serve it&#x27;s primary function.')
