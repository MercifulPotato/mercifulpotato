Alyx was hands down one of, if not the best gaming experience I’ve ever had. I think the index controllers really take the experience to another level. Being able to pick up things by grabbing them is awesome. The headphones on the index are amazing too, and really help with immersion.<p>Support with other games is pretty good. I bought a bunch of games during the summer sale, and haven’t found anything unplayable for me. Not all games have full finger tracking, and not all games have the ability to pick things up like you can in Alyx. Some older games have been updated for Alyx style controls, but many control exactly how they did with the Vive.<p>I tried VR in Linux first, then tried on windows. Windows has better feature support and performance hands down. If you have a better GPU, you might be fine, but the advantages to booting into windows was worth it to me.')
