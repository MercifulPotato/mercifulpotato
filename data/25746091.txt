Its the reason one man with a shotgun can hold 26 people hostage. At best, if every person bum rushed him, he might get 2-4 shots off. That&#x27;s the absolute best case scenario. The logical thing to do is a coordinated attack, because then you ensure the safety of the group instead of your individual safety.<p>So it goes with this. If hundreds of people were willing to storm the Capitol, its because hundreds of thousands - possibly even millions - have the same sentiment, but for whatever reason - distance, fear of reprisal, etc. - couldn&#x27;t physically be there.<p>I think that incident was 1) just the start of many more riots &#x2F; clashes and 2) evidence of much larger, broader problem that we need to solve.')
