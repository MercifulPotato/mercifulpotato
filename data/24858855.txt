Item(by='knorker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603379443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851817, text='&gt; A script that calls a piece of software is not a derived work.<p>Probably not, but it is &quot;Corresponding source&quot; in the AGPL license.<p>&gt; Otherwise, all build systems that have ever been used with GCC would have to be GPL-licensed.<p>No, because:<p>1. AGPL is not GPL. GPL doesn&#x27;t have the concept of &quot;corresponding source&quot;. AGPL does.<p>2. Build systems were not built for the purpose of building software X, they were built for building <i>any</i> software. In other words, a completely freestanding source code that can ONLY link with the Linux kernel <i>IS</i> in scope for GPL, as derivative work. E.g. see legal status of out-of-tree binary kernel modules.<p>Or another comparison: Your LD_PRELOAD library that overloads write() will work with any software, and therefore is not derivative work. Your LD_PRELOAD that is made only for a GPL tool does in fact link with it, and probably (don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a court case on this yet) does mean it&#x27;s GPL.<p>Your script that can <i>only</i> be used to launch an AGPL software thingy <i>IS</i> &quot;corresponding source&quot; and&#x2F;or (could be both, a court has not tested this) &quot;derivative work&quot;. It&#x27;s certainly <i>not</i> neither, and therefore it falls under AGPL and must be published.')
