Your OS, your network stack, your graphical desktop, your browser, probably your favorite language’s interpreter, all depend on writing high performance code.  At any point you’re probably a single step away from some C.<p>Languages like Python made it much easier to program but didn’t put as much thought into performance. I think the future of computing will be in languages that manage to be pleasant to write like Python while still exploiting low level hardware features. Rust, which is like C++ that doesn’t suck, and Julia, which is like Python with cleaned up semantics to allow easier compilation, come to mind. The economics of a few people developing high performance languages that everyone can use just makes too much sense. More cloud computing may be cheaper than more devs, but it still isn’t cheap in the absolute sense.')
