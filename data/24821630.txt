You could have a paper backup and&#x2F;or a memorized secure phrase easily. Been a while, but Electrum could do both years ago, I&#x27;m sure many others can as well.<p>Also, more importantly, why are encryption and this amnesiac property mutually exclusive? Can&#x27;t you do both and use the strongest available guarantees that are applicable to a particular set of data? Seems like it&#x27;d at least make the job of an attacker more annoying at the least.')
