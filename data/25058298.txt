The answer is that it depends.<p>Let&#x27;s say I do a diligence on behalf of PE Firm A (and the deal falls through) and PE Firm B wants to use that diligence because they&#x27;re looking to buy the company now. Legally&#x2F;contractually I cannot let that PE Firm B see the diligence report I created, however I have seen situations where PE Firm B would purchase the report from PE Firm A, or the target would purchase it and give it to PE Firm B.')
