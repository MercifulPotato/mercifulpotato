If you normalize them (i.e. actually look at transistor density) you&#x27;ll find the difference is much smaller than you&#x27;d expect. TSMC 5nm is indeed the better process though but it alone isn&#x27;t the primary driver of what makes the M1 good. Flipping it around I&#x27;m not as sure the i9 would come out on top all other things being equal between the 2.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there are many engineers at Apple that truly understand what makes the M1 perform better. How people think they can just boil it down to just &lt;x&gt; is honestly confusing.')
