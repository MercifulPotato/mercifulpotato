I should have added a link out to it, I might do that.<p>I think most ideas do have necessary conditions to succeed, and perhaps network latency (especially in single VPC) has improved a lot since those days.<p>The original motivations weren&#x27;t just network based. The scenario where I wanted to use CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE to create append-only log files via EXT4 attr was a good example of where being able to decorate a function to say that it runs in a separate container potentially seemed like a reusable concept.<p>&gt; trying to abstract away the differences can be a bad scene<p>Agree, generally I&#x27;m against &quot;magic&quot; behavior in code. That&#x27;s why I quite like the protobuf philosophy of being able to see the generated code at compile time, as opposed to some runtime magic.<p>What I&#x27;m suggesting is just to abstract some of that boilerplate code, but it could still go badly if used without consideration.')
