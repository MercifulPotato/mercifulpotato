Changes that are not considered consistent with, and furthering the purpose of, Proposition 22 would need voter approval.<p>These ride sharing companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars and engaging in shady tactics targeted at both their drivers and customers so they can give their employees fewer benefits all while completely circumventing the state legislature.  This is a absolute perversion of democracy.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;California_Proposition_22,_App-Based...</a>')
