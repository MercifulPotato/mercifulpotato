They’re not going to just walk in.”<p>Since then I’ve not wanted to bet against Apple.<p>The reason people will buy these is because they are part of the Apple ecosystem. I have no knowledge of this, but I’m sure their out of the box pairing experience will be much like other Apple products. Hold your phone near it and it just connects. Far more seamless than most Bluetooth pairing.<p>Any audio controls are built into your phone.<p>And typically Apple has hardware and software designed to work together. They’ve done this with the iPhone camera to completely disrupt the digital camera industry.<p>It’s the ecosystem plus the benefits of hardware &#x2F; software integration.')
