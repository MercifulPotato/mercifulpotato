According to the comments, the poster realized they were wrong since they could either go to a different host, or could run their own instance, which would have a few additional benefits for them and their followers.<p>In the end, the account was deleted for not following the rules of that particular host. It seems that the they consider all advertising to be spam, which is their right. I assume they sent out a warning at least? That would be the &quot;right&quot; thing to do, but it&#x27;s really up to the owner of that instance how they enforce their own rules.<p>I can see what attracted them to Mastodon. I can&#x27;t see how they failed to realize what &quot;decentralized&quot; means.<p>Is that the reason it was posted to HN? The reader will certainly get the wrong impression if they don&#x27;t read the comment section to that post. And even that meanders around a bunch before you get the full picture.<p>After reading through it, I am left with the impression that the poster was hasty and didn&#x27;t read the rules when they signed up, didn&#x27;t bother to understand the network technology, wrote this bye-bye post to shame them, all then to be told that they should read and obey the host&#x27;s rules, or find a host that would allow them to do those posts, or host their own instance where the rules are their own.')
