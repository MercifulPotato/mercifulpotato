I&#x27;m a swede and have been following the Corona situation relatively closely (looking at facts and not media hysteria too much). My parents are retired health care professionals. My sister-in-law works at FHM. I&#x27;ve been in contact with hospitals and health services quite a bit the last year (my wife&#x27;s grandma died due to cancer, I had a child that was born at one of the largest hospitals in Sweden). At times, the situation has been hard for health workers, having to work more than normal (sadly, the personnel situation was a big problem even before COVID, it just tipped it across the border). But to say that the Swedish health system collapsed is a lie (or at least back it up with data&#x2F;some facts&#x2F;sources).<p>I do agree though it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what the cause for the relatively high amount of excessive deaths was (not bigger than many other western countries, such as Belgium or the US), but still. I&#x27;m not saying the Swedish approach was the best one (or even a good one), but let&#x27;s not spread misinformation. Sweden is so much misused in this debate (on both sides) and that scares the me the most.<p>On that note, several really bad&#x2F;horrible incidents in the spring where health care workers did strict prioritizations was due to media and mass hysteria - NOT because of health system collapse... Misinformation is really dangerous - life and death dangerous...')
