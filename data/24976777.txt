In that case, it is github who is allegedly making the repo impossible to host.  It is, thus, github who is acting in a childish way.  The repo author is only adding some silly hashes.<p>By the way, the real &quot;childish&quot; behavior is believing that speech can be censored by technical means alone.  This is impossible, there are always technical means to circumvent it.  Speech can only be effectively censored by means of armed police action.')
