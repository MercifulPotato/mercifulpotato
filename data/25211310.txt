Item(by='kaycebasques', descendants=None, kids=[25212772], score=None, time=1606323379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25210986, text='I don&#x27;t have a problem with someone who raises a chicken, uses the chicken&#x27;s natural existence to improve the local environment (fertilizer, etc.), lets that chicken have a life similar to its life in nature, and gives it a lifespan that isn&#x27;t dramatically shorter than what it experiences in nature. Eating that chicken and its eggs seems fine to me because that seems like a mutualistic relationship. Asking me to endorse factory farming is tough because it provides literally none of those things, all of which seem like pretty reasonable definitions of a decent life for a creature. If you can verify that the chicken&#x2F;eggs you bought came from that situation, I don&#x27;t have a problem with that. I know a lot of brands claim an image like this, but let&#x27;s be honest, no one is verifying that before purchasing because we know it&#x27;s probably not true.<p>In other words, I am a vegan, and I just suggested a situation of ethical meat&#x2F;egg consumption. As I said before, I think you&#x27;re prejudiced towards vegans and don&#x27;t really understand what we&#x27;re about. I suggest listening more to what vegans have to say about veganism rather than what meateaters have to say about it.')
