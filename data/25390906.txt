The Sussex scientists also claim that the Meadows et al. methods, data, and predictions are faulty, that their world models (and their Malthusian bias) do not accurately reflect reality&quot;<p>I gave a very simple example (combinatorial explosion) that shows how the whole thing is wrong, and why (here, attacking a key assumption) - but there are many many more holes.<p>It&#x27;s not really redeemable, after having been proved wrong more than wrong - just like Malthusianism actually.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s worth two minutes of reading<p>Indeed, in just 2 minutes you can notice even more holes -  I just pointed to the most glaring one for people used to algorithm.<p>Hopefully you will not fall prey to ideological arguments based on a castle of cards with such a flimsy base')
