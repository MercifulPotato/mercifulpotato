Item(by='jedgardyson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609358818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='Been working on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tryquilt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tryquilt.com</a>, a production service that creates a 1hr polished video interview about a loved ones&#x27; life, for about a year now. We did user research, figured out ops and how to tell the stories in a way that folks end up happy with-- with small launches on a few subreddits and a few partnership attempts. Total cost has been in the low $1,000s (mostly test production folks and interviewers + software) with no returns yet. Big sink timewise, on and off between breaks for the day-job. Might use a full CMS (probs Wordpress) from the get-go and maybe something like Webflow or Shopify for faster market testing next time. Also a lot to be done to make the production process leaner (it&#x27;s been good learning tho!).<p>Will probably push more, just after the holiday window, then expand to an adjacent market where there are more clear triggers for purchase.')
