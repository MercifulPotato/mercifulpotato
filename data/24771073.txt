Item(by='clairity', descendants=None, kids=[24780400], score=None, time=1602628362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24769718, text='&gt; &quot;...then you are a priori suggesting that we don&#x27;t, right?&quot;<p>no, because it was based on incorporating the wealth of (imperfect) information that we already have. your statement started with &quot;But we absolutely need restrictions&quot; and then essentially said &quot;not enough data&quot;, which makes that statement an <i>a priori</i> presumption. it could be that no restrictions are worth it, but your statement already ruled that out without rationale. mine didn&#x27;t rule out restrictions, but rather advocated limited and targeted (high bang-for-buck) measures.<p>as for the rest, a semantic argument over &quot;lockdown&quot; seems unlikely to be fruitful, for an overly-curt phrasing on my part (as in, losing essential nuance for the sake of expedience). i&#x27;d generally agree that an indoor social gathering of sufficient density can raise transmission risk, but an arbitrary cutoff is not so useful. 50 people in a house is different from 50 people in a performance hall. incidentally, that&#x27;s why distancing is a better general rule of thumb, because it concerns density directly (masks, for instance, don&#x27;t).<p>and it&#x27;s not about overreaction but rather precision and efficacy. once you institute a law with stiff penalties, you&#x27;re raising the spectre of use of force against the populace, which, in a democratic society, should be reserved for the most extraordinary of circumstances, like existentially-threatening insurrections (e.g., civil war, plotting against a governor, etc.), not, relatively-speaking, small parties (or low-risk businesses for that matter). when provided reliable information and not overwhelmed by distortionary narratives, people will generally make reasonable estimations of risk relative to their idiosyncratic risk tolerances, and act accordingly.<p>all the rest is rhetoric trying to ramp up tensions and fears so that power can be coalesced and exerted. we just don&#x27;t need to feed that beast in this case (or in most cases, 9&#x2F;11 being another prominent example).')
