You have to take a pretty all-encompassing view of &#x27;tech&#x27; for it to make sense. Apple success on the shoulders of a wide app developer ecosystem, not on the narrower set of other tech titans. Google, via Android, is in a similar spot. And AWS is even further afield.<p>Two names not included in the de-platforming accusations here are Facebook and Twitter. If anybody of the tech titans were to benefit from this cynical take on the actions against Parler, it was them.<p>SV is not one entity, and each of the five listed above has very different goals for themselves, so I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of this conspiratorial perspective.<p>I understand the sense that these things are monopolistic, but of course there are real alternatives. They are harder, and more expensive, but the cost is borne by the transgressor of pretty reasonable common norms (don&#x27;t tolerate promotion of violence).<p>Parler gets to join Stormfront and all the torrent sites on the lower decks not because Apple, Google and Amazon are knocking out nascent competition, but because those sites violate reasonable, privately set and moderated rules.')
