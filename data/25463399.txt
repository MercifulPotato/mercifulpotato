Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608261369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461276, text='In my opinion, the problem with &lt;$&gt; is actually a problem with Haskell, which is that there&#x27;s too damn many &quot;operators&quot; -- it&#x27;s hard to keep track of them all. This also makes them hard to search for. When I search for &quot;kotlin question mark colon&quot;, the first page of results is flooded with results about the Elvis operator (also a very memorable name for future searches, if I forgot). Searching for &quot;haskell dollar sign in angle brackets&quot; unearths nothing.<p>Something as common as option types (which is basically how nullable types are used in Kotlin) deserves special syntactic sugar, in my opinion. Granted many of Haskell&#x27;s operators are also common, but I wish they&#x27;d been able to limit the variety a bit.')
