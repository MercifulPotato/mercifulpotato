But that’s not what many apps use Core Data for.  Many apps use it to cache bits of data from the server and other local state.  You don’t need a full blown ORM &#x2F; database for this. Instead of wasting your time learning the obtuse Laws of Core Data, model your app state with some nice Codable structs, write it to disk, and then take the afternoon off.')
