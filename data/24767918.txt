SwiftUI relies heavily on observable objects and basically a shared-mutable-state architecture. I believe that adapting it into Rust would be a nightmare.<p>Jetpack Compose, on the other hand, lets the app logic build the UI with method calls that resemble immediate mode GUI (though there are of course important differences, as it is building a retained widget tree). These updates are mediated through a mutable context object (&quot;Composer&quot; in the Jetpack Compose world), which adapts quite nicely into the Rust world. In particular, it does not depend on shared mutable references.<p>I strongly believe that it is possible to express UI in Rust quite naturally and expressively. I&#x27;ve written a fair amount about this recently and have provided evidence in the form of the existing Druid work and the Crochet research prototype, which represents an evolution of its reactive architecture to better support dynamic reconfiguration (a current weak spot in Druid). Of course, we won&#x27;t know for sure til we get there, but in the meantime it would be nice if the naysayers at least made informed criticism.')
