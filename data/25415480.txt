Write, or ask the team that provide the external dependency to write, a small piece of code that behaves like your external dependency, but in-process. You&#x27;ll thank me after about the 47th time you&#x27;re guessing (inconsistently, possibly incorrectly, and definitely overly verbose) how the external dependency actually works. Ban mocking libraries.')
