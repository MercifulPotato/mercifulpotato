Unless your application joins the message broker&#x27;s topology as an active member -- some systems do work this way, like Zookeeper -- it can still suffer message loss.<p>But even if it <i>does</i> join, that&#x27;s still not sufficient, because these systems can become unavailable during partitions, and that is definitionally incompatible with &quot;exactly once&quot;.')
