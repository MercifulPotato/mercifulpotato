E.g., would results of Floyd Steinberg look better when error diffusion is done in Oklab vs. the other or the raw color spaces?<p>Another question:  When going back from Oklab to the device color space, some numbers may at times fall out of range (e.g., negative).  Is there a recommended way to bring those back into range to perceptually close colors?<p>Thanks.')
