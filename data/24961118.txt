I very rarely see that device manufactures are doing a major kernel upgrade when a new SDK with support for a new major kernel is available from the SoC vendor. This only happens when they need new features from the new major kernel which can not easily be backported and a very big customer is requesting this and normally they also need a good internal software engineering department.')
