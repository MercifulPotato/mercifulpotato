Extremism isn&#x27;t some new thing. Right now certain political viewpoints are allowed to be discussed and others are not. The Overton window is very small. That leads people who disagree to try to find each other and band together, form some kind of opposition. Because their opinions are repressed, they stay insulated in their bubbles (as do people with mainstream opinions). The isolation leads to extremism.<p>If you look at the polarization of politics in the united states, both sides hate each other and they won&#x27;t talk. Maybe if there was some kind of discourse, things wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. Right now the only words exchanged are insults, all republicans are alt-right, all democrats are communists. It wasn&#x27;t always like that. It used to be possible for people who vote differently to be friends, or even live in the same household.')
