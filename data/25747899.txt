Item(by='KaiserPro', descendants=None, kids=[25748182], score=None, time=1610464464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747698, text='&gt; Your first answer is ethically debatable in a way that entirely depends on what is perceived to be &quot;right&quot;<p>Indeed, I am not a moral absolutist. Its an abstract question, in which the answer tells more about the person rather than the state of morals as a whole. I must point out that I feel and know that I have compromised my morals by working at FB. That aside it is perfectly possible to work at $company and do good. There are plenty examples of resistors and rule benders that have helped people from the &quot;inside&quot; of terrible regimes.<p>I don&#x27;t want to belittle Facebook&#x27;s moral failings. But I am worried that shitting on facebook is being seen as fixing the problem. That was my intention, not to throw a dead cat on the table and run away.<p>Myanmar Is a special case. I don&#x27;t think facebook actively caused the issue, but their in-attention made it worse. My (limited) understanding is that Facebook was acting like the local radio stations in the Rwanda genocide. Again, if FB had placed resources when first alerted, they <i>might</i> have been able to temper the spread.<p>India is my area of concern. The leadership there all come from the same schools, know the same people and think the same negative things about their Muslim neighbours. (this is a simplification of course) Some changes have been made, not least because of internal pressure.<p>on point 3, yes. AR worries me, but not because Facebook are making it.<p>For it to work for facebook, they have to work 10 times harder than anyone else to prove that its safe. Which I think is valid, my only wish is that same level of scepticism is applied to _all_ players. AR _needs_ to be safe, because it is so invasive. The problem comes when AR manufactures start allowing Apps. At that point all hell breaks loose.')
