How do you even know which bugs are a priority? Are the designs complete for the next feature I&#x27;m building? How does QA know to review your changes? (Yes QA is still a thing in some places and for good reason)<p>When I was a solo dev, I would meet with the rest of the stakeholders weekly and establish what I was working on. But on a bigger team this quickly becomes impractical. Even with the 8 person team I work on now I&#x27;d have no idea who was working on what without having some kind of tracking system.')
