American voters put a checkmark next to their personal preference for president, UK voters do no such thing.<p>&gt; Regardless, does this even matter in terms of how politically powerful that single person is?<p>Yes, it makes a huge difference! The PM of the UK stays prime minister as long as they have the confidence of a majority of the House of Commons. The president of the US can only be prematurely removed if they are convicted of serious crime.')
