These cover a broad range of topics, not just philosophy; plus, you can approach each topic separately, without having to go through things that might not interest you.<p>Of course, these recommendations completely ignore non-western philosophical traditions. Hindu and Buddhist traditions might also be interesting to explore.<p>Personally I have approached philosophy strictly as an autodidact, hence quite haphazardly. After having explored a bunch of topics I however find most use and interest in those more modern and analytical parts of philosophy that touch on science, mathematics, cognitive science, logic.<p>Political and moral philosophy are also quite important because they allow you to get a grasp of the intellectual framework modern institutions are built on. A lot of the things that we take for granted (e.g. representative democracy, the ubiquity of nation-states, the central role of economic institutions in society) are actually not at all dictated by nature, but more by cultural norms and various philosophical ideas and systems.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_History_of_Western_Philosophy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_History_of_Western_Philosoph...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.oup.com&#x2F;academic&#x2F;content&#x2F;series&#x2F;v&#x2F;very-short-introductions-vsi&#x2F;?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.oup.com&#x2F;academic&#x2F;content&#x2F;series&#x2F;v&#x2F;very-short-...</a>')
