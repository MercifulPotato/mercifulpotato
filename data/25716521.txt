I am a 22 year-old software engineer who has never had money before. I have been maxing out my 401k and my Roth IRA.<p>My 401k, upon my (fiduciary) financial advisor&#x27;s advice, is 100% in Vanguard&#x27;s 2065 retirement date. I consider this my conservative account.<p>My Roth IRA is pretty risky, but I am allowing a high risk tolerance because of my age. I am about 50% in various ARK ETFs, and the other 50% are in long term stocks I believe in. AMD, SNAP, etc..<p>And then I have complete $1000 for gambling in robinhood that i refuse to put more money into. I just buy weekly&#x2F;monthly options with this account.<p>I don&#x27;t know where I was going with this. I just don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing if I&#x27;m being honest, unfortunately.')
