In fact, it generally greatly improves your experience.<p>Thanks to the ADA, American sites (or sites that do a lot of business with America) must work with assistive technologies, mainly web browsers designed for the blind. Most of those do not run js. So, you cannot design your website so that it doesn&#x27;t work with js disabled, unless you are willing to expose yourself to massive legal liability. People used to ignore this a lot, but since <i>Dominoâ€™s Pizza v. Guillermo Robles</i>, most sites have been fixed so that they are usable without js.<p>I strongly recommend getting ublock, blocking all js by default, and then whitelisting sites where it is required&#x2F;useful. It&#x27;s hard to overstate just how much better it makes browsing in general.')
