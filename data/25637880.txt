You&#x27;re taking a conclusion and trying to walk back a path of logic to some type of justification.<p>Let&#x27;s see this for what it is: arbitrary decisions that curtails the human rights of all human beings by politicians who are figuratively drunk with power. They are banning things for the common people while they leave their regions, have expensive $1k dinners for their political backers and ignoring all the rules they&#x27;ve imposed on the population. From Canada to California to the UK, we watch elected leaders ignore the bullshit rules they put on people, either because they think it doesn&#x27;t apply to them or they&#x27;ve seen the numbers and know the risks are bullshit.<p>We&#x27;re talking about a disease that&#x27;s literally has over a 98% survival rate if you&#x27;re under 55 (which causes people to spout more &quot;long COVID&quot; narrative media non-sense). 100 years from now, do you really think scholars will see 2020 and 2021 as anything other than the largest cast of mass hysteria to date?<p>Let&#x27;s isolate the elderly and vulnerable, or anyone who wants to be isolated, and let the rest of the world evaluate their own risks again.')
