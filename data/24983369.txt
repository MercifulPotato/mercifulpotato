Even tho I pay for a prime membership, buying all 4 seasons digitally in <i>HD</i> quality, would cost me 92€, there is no option to just rent them.<p>While ordering the blu-ray set for the whole show, on Amazon with delivery tomorrow, would cost me 48€, nearly half as much and I get a physical version I can use as often and wherever I want, even if the unthinkable happens and Amazon goes out of business.<p>Why does the clearly inferior version of a product cost that much more?')
