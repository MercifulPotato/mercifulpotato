No need to solder stuff or tear apart a whole phone just to replace a screen for example.<p>At the time, I’d buy them from anywhere between $15-$30&#x2F;phone depending on damage, swap out parts from unrepairable ones, or buy new(ie Battery replacements) and sell for around double the price.<p>I miss the days where you didn’t need a license and special training to repair these things.')
