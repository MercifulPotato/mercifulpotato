Prolog&#x27;s value lies in its database core.  But much of the cost of learning a new language is elsewhere, in dealing with yet another different set of ways to do familiar things.  With prolog, those differences are relatively uninteresting, so why not punt?<p>Not having to deal with &quot;how do I read a csv file in prolog?&quot; and such, frees time for richer ideas, like prolog search is a poor fit for most problems, but prolog is a nice language for writing problem-appropriate search.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yuce&#x2F;pyswip" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yuce&#x2F;pyswip</a>')
