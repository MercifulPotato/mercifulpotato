Item(by='ProfessorLayton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605643676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128696, text='Forever might be a bit of a stretch, but I believe there&#x27;s a lot to be concerned about the negative feedback loop that awaits SF and cities like it. A lot of businesses that make the city desirable to a lot of people (read: tax base) are on an indefinite hiatus due to the virus, meaning there&#x27;s little reason to pay exorbitant prices to live in SF for the time being.<p>The problem is that a lot of businesses won&#x27;t be able to survive this recession, and the city&#x27;s tax base will shrink further. Yes, those businesses will eventually be replaced, but it won&#x27;t be a quick affair if we reach the point of no return. Further complicating this matter for the businesses that <i>do</i> survive will be the fact that new businesses will be able to run much leaner due to being able to lock in much cheaper leases and not shackled with debt.<p>While I don&#x27;t believe SF is doomed by any means, I do think that it&#x27;s in for a day of reckoning unless it can reconcile its hugely bloated budget with the fact that it&#x27;ll be a prolonged climb to where it was. Now with a vaccine on the way it may be able to avoid this if it&#x27;s distributed fast enough, but I do think the window is closing rapidly.')
