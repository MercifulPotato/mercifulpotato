Do you want us to spit in your eye?&quot;<p>The question is obviously no, and here&#x27;s a big list of reasons why not.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re thinking of removing the private dwelling exemption. Do you agree?&quot;<p>The answer is obviously no. Police officers are going to talk about the impossibility of gathering evidence to prosecute the crime. CPS, and solicitors, and barristers are going to talk about the importance of free speech protections and the difficulty of proving <i>mens rei</i>. Judges are going to talk about the problems of convicting people of a crime when it&#x27;s difficult to show who the victims of that crime might be.<p>All of this thread happens because people don&#x27;t bother to read the source documents and get whipped into a frenzy by shitty low-tier troll groups like &quot;We Are Fair Cop&quot;.
