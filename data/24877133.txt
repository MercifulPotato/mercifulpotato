But it felt shallow. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. With mushrooms and other natural hallucinogens, i&#x27;ve felt more of a connection with things and had more of an introspective time. Especially at high doses.<p>With acid, it was always just fun. There wasn&#x27;t really much introspection about it. It just made everything feel profound and fun. Whereas, especially mushrooms, but also a few other plant based substances, the trips always led to more self reflection and more positive changes post trip.<p>I like acid more. I wish i could get some acid as nice as i had years back now, but when i want to deal with real life issues or emotional problems, mushrooms are where i turn to. Acid is more for those times when i just wanna take a vacation for a few hours and go on a magical journey.')
