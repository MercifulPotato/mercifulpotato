You have to spend 40+ hours a week coming up with ways to exploit human psychological weakness. You can dress it up in many other ways but that&#x27;s the core unavoidable aspect of it. Only a tiny minority of the work goes into ads that simply state of a product&#x27;s existence, and these often serve to make physical spaces uglier to live in.')
