There&#x27;s been enough said here recently about the problems with Gnome 3 and the attitude of the Gnome developers, but the 10,000 ft view is that they refuse to stop pretending that my desktop PC is an iPad. Microsoft made the same mistake with Windows 8 &#x2F; Metro, but at least they eventually backpedaled.<p>If you think Windows usability peaked around Windows XP, XFCE might be worth trying.<p>All I want is an application menu, some launchers, a window list, a widget&#x2F;notification area, and some reasonable keybindings. Gnome 2 had these things, and then early Gnome 3 got rid of basically all of them. If some fancypants UX researchers want to experiment with replacing menu bars with hamburgers, that&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m just not interested.<p>I&#x27;ve done more than my fair share of WM hopping (I still use i3 on my laptop because I like being able to resize windows with my keyboard when I don&#x27;t have a mouse), but XFCE is my workhorse. It may look boring, but it&#x27;s reliable. It has more than enough features for working productively, and I appreciate the fact that the development team doesn&#x27;t completely change the way everything works every few years just to chase the latest flashy trend.')
