Mastodon especially is quite usable (though obviously many fewer users than Twitter), the interface is as good as Twitter (better if you count not spamming you to login). I posted about my open source project and other random stuff and got several thought out, kind, non-spam replies with a new account. I imagine this is because of the barrier to entry and that I made my account on a open source focused instance. If Mastodon&#x2F;federated social networking became popular I imagine there could be &quot;Eternal September&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eternal_September" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eternal_September</a>) dynamics though.<p>I wonder if paradoxically federated communication would let you improve the quality of discourse by more proactively banning people. Mastadon works on a federated system where anyone can run they&#x27;re own &quot;instance&quot; which can then interact with other instances pretty seamlessly. Since people really can leave if they don&#x27;t like the rules you could be pretty heavy handed with moderation within individual instances to ban obnoxious people or have an invite only system.<p>PeerTube was a little rougher around the edges, but still very impressive for being pretty new and doing p2p video streaming. There was more lag than YouTube but with decent internet it&#x27;s fine. The choices for instances aren&#x27;t great and storage size and bandwith are limited. Storage&#x2F;bandwith cost money though and that may just be making what&#x27;s an invisible cost on YouTube visible.<p>My Mastodon: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosstodon.org&#x2F;@argosopentech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosstodon.org&#x2F;@argosopentech</a><p>My PeerTube: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peervideo.club&#x2F;video-channels&#x2F;argosopentech&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peervideo.club&#x2F;video-channels&#x2F;argosopentech&#x2F;videos</a>')
