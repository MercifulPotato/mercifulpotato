The situations in which multiple metrics could compete are sometimes difficult to conceive, but it will always happen if you aren&#x27;t performing something more sophisticated than &quot;up if metric &gt; value, down if &lt; value&quot; for multiple metrics. I think you&#x27;ve got to combine these somehow into a custom metric and scale just on one metric. I&#x27;m totally unsurprised to see that autoscaling failed for both Slack and AWS in this case.<p>I think you really have to look at metric-based autoscaling and say: is it worth the X% savings per month? Or would I rather avoid the occasional severe headaches caused by autoscaling messing up my day? Obviously this depends on company scale and how much your load varies. I&#x27;d rather have an excess of capacity than any impact on users.')
