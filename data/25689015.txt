Type system designs prevent solving those problems.<p>Most of my career has been focused on helping large companies use Python to achieve as-fast-as-C performance with extremely little code and extremely safety-focused non-OOP software architectures, including in high frequency trading (where I built a companyâ€™s entire core trading platform in Cython).<p>The idea that static typing leads to safety is false. Static typing adds more code, more code is more liability. The cost of that liability is not recouped with any offsetting benefits.')
