Flour, sugar and other powders found in the kitchen can actually be explosive if they are mixed with air correctly (eg: when tossed onto a flame).<p>Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is probably the only improvised item in the kitchen that you should use to put out fires. A kitchen should have a fire extinguisher that is BC or ABC that would be best for the first attempt at putting out the fire.<p>Even though water is not ideal, if you have a large source of it (eg: Pool, lake, firehose, etc), it will be your best option as it can cool faster than a small battery can generate heat. A garden hose or bathtub faucet might be able to supply enough water if the battery is relatively small.')
