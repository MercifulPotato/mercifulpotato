And most of that is international (US-&gt;Europe).<p>I&#x27;d say the most anxiety-inducing part of every flight is check-in and security. I started my career (and had budget for travel) at roughly the same time as 9&#x2F;11, so for many years, security delays were a real problem in the US... 3+ hour lines at IAD were common.  The thought of missing a flight because I&#x27;m caught in some sort of airport security limbo is awful for me.  And because most flights from DC-&gt;Europe leave in the evening, there won&#x27;t be another until tomorrow (or worse, two days out, on some discount airlines).<p>The flight itself is pretty low down the list of things that bother me.  I don&#x27;t check baggage (at least outbound, sometimes I have to check coming home if I buy too many gifts), so lost luggage isn&#x27;t a concern.  Mechanicals happen, but so far, they&#x27;ve never been bad enough to cancel&#x2F;reschedule the flight.  And once I&#x27;m in Europe, I usually have a car or take a train, so connections not an issue. For flights that do have a connection, they&#x27;re usually frequent enough to not be a problem (ie, Heathrow to Glasgow on BA).')
