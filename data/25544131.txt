These are very hard to solve because fundamentally it&#x27;s users fault, especially the ones with password-reuse habit. Nevertheless we responsible developers are the ones who should keep the internet safe, so feel free to chime in, evaluate my solutions and maybe we come up with &quot;the&quot; best practice against this type of attacks.<p>If there&#x27;s interest I want to make this into a library and open source a django-specific solution as it&#x27;s my everyday framework. The discussion applies to ALL web frameworks.')
