To answer your questions:\n - We have made an MVP, and it works. \n - While the speaker doesn&#x27;t go into the earcanal, it hovers over it. \n- It is private. Much like holding your phone to your ear while speaking.\n- The part that swaps out is the audiomodule. \n- The battery life isn&#x27;t that great for the MVP; but we hope to improve it with our production model.')
