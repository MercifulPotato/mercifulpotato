Item(by='Smaug123', descendants=None, kids=[25535980], score=None, time=1608895725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533441, text='To me, &quot;calling a trans person consistently by the wrong pronouns&quot; and &quot;referring to someone at work using a name you know is their spouse&#x27;s pet name for them&quot; would fall into the same category. I find it hard to view any of these as anything other than Dick Moves. I do have an unusually strong loathing of globally-inconsistent rules, though, which probably makes me more prone than most to generalise the rules along this axis (whereas you believe that they should not generalise past a particular point).<p>Re Harry Houdini specifically: I think it would have been reasonable, yes. Lord Buckethead does it. In fact, I think it would be reasonable to stand as Borat, and people voting for Borat would be voting specifically for Borat, not for Sacha Baron Cohen. If elected, I would expect Sacha Baron Cohen to rule to the best of his ability as if he were Borat.')
