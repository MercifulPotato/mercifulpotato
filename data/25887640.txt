Particularly since multi-GNSS receivers usually only support the GNSS that share bands (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS)<p>Perhaps the most compelling option for multi-system redundancy has been the reintroduction of a complete terrestrial navigation system. There have been perennial proposals to fund the construction of an &quot;enhanced LORAN&quot; system to cover the United States that have gotten as far as early design, basically ever since the decommissioning of LORAN-C, but it&#x27;s never quite happened. Somewhat contrary to what a lot of people might expect, the technology does exist to build a completely earth-based radiolocation system with substantial (but not complete) land coverage, it&#x27;s just a pretty expensive infrastructure project and has a hard time getting any traction at a time when the FAA is slashing the budget for existing navaid technology.<p>The infrastructure that was already &quot;half way there,&quot; e.g. FAA VOR&#x2F;DME amd the Coast Guard DGPS infrastructure built on the back of the cancelled GWEN project, is largely all decommissioned or in a slow process of decommissioning.<p>ASAT warfare has lead to some renewed interest, but not enough to actually get the money on the table.')
