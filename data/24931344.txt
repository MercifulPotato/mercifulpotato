And is lacking this long waited API to connect it with other tools. Just search “Notion API” on Twitter and you will see +20 tweets per day asking their support about the API ETA.<p>So, I was so IMPATIENT that I reverse engineered their private API, to be able to read&#x2F;update&#x2F;delete any page&#x2F;view – and then connect it with other tools using Zapier.<p>Today, I’m launching with my friend Shubham a tool with:\n - Zapier private connector\n - API documentation to hack around it\n - 30+ zaps ready to clone<p>One use case that motivated building this: Create automatically a note page for every Google calendar event that has a Zoom or Google Meet link. So that I can gather all meeting notes on a Calendar View on Notion :)<p>We’ll be here all day answering any question you may have!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notion-automations.com')
