You just need to build the app in Retool, and then enable &quot;public applications&quot;, which&#x27;ll let you expose the app publicly. We don&#x27;t bill for public users.<p>(Theoretically, the end users could get all the data by inspecting the network requests. But there&#x27;s really no way around that given that you&#x27;re exposing the app and its data publicly. I suppose you could get around it by adding a password to the public app. LMK if you need help with that!)')
