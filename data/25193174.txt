When Jailbroken, I can load a userscript that turns this off.<p>• Random apps have stupid names on my homescreen. Either the name is in all caps, or it&#x27;s too long and Apple puts a big ellipses in the middle. I can&#x27;t rename them unless I&#x27;m Jailbroken.<p>• Stock iOS has two <i>separate</i> low-battery alerts, the first of which occurs when there&#x27;s still a fifth of my battery left! I&#x27;m well aware of the red icon at the top of my screen.<p>• The stock iOS keyboard has a dictation key I <i>always</i> hit accidentally. I can disable it when I&#x27;m Jailbroken.<p>There are many, many, many more examples, these are just off the top of my head. It&#x27;s been long enough since I set up my Jailbreak that I don&#x27;t actually remember most of them, but I use a ton of let&#x27;s-call-them annoyance fixers, and I don&#x27;t think I could live without them.')
