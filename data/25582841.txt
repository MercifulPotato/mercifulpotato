You can play chess (as a program) and have totally 0 IQ in all over realms (e.g. any specialized chess engine, which is nothing like a general AI), whereas that&#x27;s no true for humans. Human intelligence allows a chess player to ALSO play chess, it&#x27;s not a chess-oriented algorithm.<p>The same way a plastic ruler might measure better than us (&quot;this is 12.45 inches&quot;, whereas we might say &quot;that&#x27;s about a foot&quot;, but its &quot;measuring intelligence&quot; is not human intelligence by any definition.')
