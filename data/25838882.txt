Yesterday I hit a brick wall where I am unable to produce.<p>Anxiety tendencies have been creeping up over the months because I’m in a sensory overloading environment, and I struggle to make the choice each day to kill 30 minutes for a fake commute to help keep my sanity.\nI gain energy collaborating with others, even if I’m the main or only person driving things.<p>I’m aware I need to monitor my own health more, and be ok to take breaks. Even take days off.\nIt’s tough, the anxiety doesn’t seem to subside until I produce well. This creates a perverse incentive, a toxic spiral.\nShowing some vulnerability and asking for help or care is tough too. This whole quarantine thing is stretching in some ways, damaging in others.<p>And yet here we are.<p>edit: I want to clarify, because top comments seem to be talking about the USA in the news. I am not experiencing anxiety because of the news, or worry of safety for self or others because of the pandemic.\nFor me it’s simply mental health issues because of isolation, loss of normal healthy coping patterns, and sensory exhaustion and sensory over sensitivity in my home converted to a home, school, and office all in one. Sucks.')
