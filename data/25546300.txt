Netflix still works, YouTube kinda works and that’s about it. It’s frustrating but it’s hard to see how to get around it. \nLong term support is very expensive and tv sales in the mass market seem to be very price sensitive. Seems to be a choice between pricing it such that you can support it, and not sell any or price it competitively and have no cash to update it. I guess that’s where the ad-supported idea came from as well. The only way I see this changing is if hackers figure out how to mass-brick them.')
