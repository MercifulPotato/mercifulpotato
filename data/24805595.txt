Original comment:<p>There may be something here, but their presentation leaves a &quot;snake oil&quot; impression. Mostly because of their repeated emphasis on &quot;CE&quot; certification, as though that had any bearing on the effectiveness of this treatment. They even say it has &quot;CE-mark certification for the treatment of tinnitus&quot;, which is really misleading, as CE simply means it complies with certain regulations regarding the construction of electronic devices, nothing at all about fitness for a given medical purpose.')
