For kids like me, it was a great deal - it sold for 1&#x2F;5 to 1&#x2F;10 the price of a new, boxed videogame, and it always had one or two full game releases in it, as well as a dozen or more demo versions, plus some zines and random stuff you mention. Sure, the games we got were a while past their release date, but in those times it didn&#x27;t matter - with Internet barely becoming a thing, gamers weren&#x27;t in sync with the global release schedules. In fact, we were all in sync with CD-Action release schedules! So e.g., maybe we got Jagged Alliance 2 in 2001, two years after its 1999 release, but before 2001 nobody would hear of this game over here, while in 2001 every other kid with a computer would have played it, and we could enjoy talking about it together. And because the CDs were also full of demos of other games, we never had a shortage of things to play.<p>(And if some demo piqued your interest, there were places you could go where you could get CDs with games and other software Ã  la carte, for cheap. :).)<p>--<p>[0] - Technically still have, but it&#x27;s been over a decade since I last paid attention to them.')
