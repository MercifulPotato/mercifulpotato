Running a site for 10 years, and it was earning $250&#x2F;day for years, then suddenly it dropped. For a while I had the same traffic and instead of 500 clicks a day Google would say I had 3 or 4 clicks. I contacted them, waited a month, and they said to label them &quot;Advertisements&quot; so users are not confused.<p>Well, my site is mostly text based and I have at least 50px of space around any advertisement, so they stick out like a sore thumb and are not confusing. Eventually the daily clicks returned, but then in the last year Google started taking back 80% of my revenue at the end of the month saying it&#x27;s &quot;Invalid Traffic&quot;. This is after years of it being around 5%. I&#x27;ve made no changes to the site, all the traffic is organic from Google search or direct visitors. I&#x27;ve never once in my life paid for traffic.<p>I contacted Google again, but they refused to give any information because they can&#x27;t share specifics for security reasons. So, I&#x27;m left losing 80% of my revenue this year and instead of making about 50k after my bills, I&#x27;ll break even or make a loss.<p>Since then I tried switching to another company that&#x27;s an AdSense partner. Of course they take a commission, but apparently they can actually show me the daily earnings with &quot;Invalid Traffic&quot; removed, and not give me a monthly heart attack and remove all my revenue as a surprise at once.<p>So, I can see how little I&#x27;m making on a daily basis now, but I&#x27;m no closer to resolving the issue because Google refuses to give any answers, so I&#x27;m completely on my own and taking shots in the dark.<p>The other week I tried building a database of 800 million IP addresses using lists of all IP addresses from datacenters, VPNs, proxies, TOR exit nodes, and IPs flagged as abusive. This obviously took some time to setup and I stopped showing ads to these IPs because maybe they&#x27;re bad sources of traffic? That didn&#x27;t seem to help.<p>Then I tried setting up some Javascript to not load ads until the mouse moved or a user scrolled. Maybe that would help to prevent any traffic where a user is not at the computer? Nope, didn&#x27;t work.<p>So, I&#x27;m out of ideas. Yes, I have ads.txt configured. Yes, I have a consent manager configured.<p>&gt; Your revenue is the literal sum of earnings from every click on your property. While ads are showing and being clicked on, you will always be earning more.<p>What you said sounds simple. However, like I said, Google can randomly drop my clicks from a consistent 500 a day to 3 and give no answers. Or, they can tell me I&#x27;m earning $250&#x2F;day and then when it comes time to pay a month later, they say they can only pay $50&#x2F;day and the traffic didn&#x27;t meet their standards. That&#x27;s a big problem when they just spent the entire month outbidding all my other advertisers.<p>Lastly, the site I run is filled with great people. It&#x27;s a community based website with tens of millions of comments. Users on average spend 10 minutes per session, the bounce rate is incredibly low, the average user loads 30 pages a day. People like it, it&#x27;s full of quality content and posts, and users are writing new comments every few seconds.')
