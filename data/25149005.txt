No interesting general principles or profound insights.<p>I hated it. Not exactly from the beginning, but certainly after the first year novelty wore off, and I despised it ever more as time went on. In the end - surprise, surprise - I didn&#x27;t do that brilliantly. A total waste of time but sometimes you only learn by making quite expensive mistakes.<p>I probably would have been a lot happier had I studied physics, or even maths, or - as I ended up converting into with a post-grad masters, and thankfully I at least managed to do well enough to qualify for that course - computer science.')
