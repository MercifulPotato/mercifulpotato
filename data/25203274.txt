I can&#x27;t see that happening in the next decade. And I&#x27;m by far not the only one with those kind of use cases.<p>I think a pure EV meets the needs of most consumers. But I think it&#x27;s incredibly short sited to drop something like the Volt from the product line, especially in places like here in Canada. Especially since it was superior to anything similar that has come out.<p>I also don&#x27;t trust GM to actually be pushing the EV transition. It feels to me like stalling.')
