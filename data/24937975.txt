Good catch. Although taking my words too literally. But none of the other technology artifacts rank even close. And BTW if Google started censoring emails they&#x27;d be in BIG trouble just like Twitter is. Thanks for helping prove my point.<p>Point #2) Twitter itself is not a news &quot;source&quot;. News Networks however ARE. News is reliable on Twitter because you follow only who you trust, and you make the assumption that you&#x27;re feed isn&#x27;t being monkeyed with by Twitter. You&#x27;re out of touch if you don&#x27;t realize you can get more accurate news faster on Twitter than thru News Networks. Trust me on that. Plus what you get from the networks is all propaganda anyway, and generally not worth my time.')
