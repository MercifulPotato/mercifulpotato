The election logs for Antrim County consist of 15,676 total lines or events. Of  the  15,676  there  were  a  total  of  10,667 critical  errors&#x2F;warnings  or  a 68.05% error rate.<p>&gt;The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines  is  of  1  in  250,000  ballots  (.0008%). We observed an error rate of 68.05%. This demonstrated a significant and fatal  error in  security and election integrity.<p>The first one sounds like they&#x27;re looking at warning logs the program outputs.
