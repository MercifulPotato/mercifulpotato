I wanted fanless silence and I wanted ECC and it took me a long time to find this machine but found it I did and it works. Linux reports seeing the ECC is indeed enabled (edac-utils?). Measured with a Kill-a-Watt meter it does consume more than 20W (maybe 30ish IIRC?). I actually disabled some Linux power management though to get bluetooth mice and keyboards to not lag after being idle for 5 seconds so my system might draw more power than others. Drives a 4K display buttery smooth, can watch all the YouTube and Netflix you want on Linux.')
