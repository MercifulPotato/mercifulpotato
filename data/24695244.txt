Excel is very hard to verify, because of corner cases like date conversion. Formulas and macros, maybe spread out all over multiple sheets in hidden away white-on-white cells, make things very opaque and impossible to verify for most users. After a long gone colleague has passed the usage of some excel file, it is treated as an arcane and unchangeable wisdom from the past, never to be really understood or changed. Just maybe used as a copy-paste value import to the next generation.<p>Also, recognized good practices for software development (which any excel sheet that does more than just a sum() will be) like commenting and versioning are quite hard to impossible in excel. So even if you endavour to do it &quot;right&quot; but with excel, it is just the wrong tool for the job.')
