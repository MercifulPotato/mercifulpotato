Once you have 2-3 studios using an internal engine there&#x27;s a critical mass that builds around it(assuming game types overlap to a degree).<p>Like everything there&#x27;s pros and cons, however if I were evaluating a external engine in 2020 anything beyond what&#x27;s present today would be a nice bonus and not something I would plan around.')
