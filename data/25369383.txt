Why do they have to pretend theirs is some mythical special sauce unable to work on Linux ?<p>That said, why don&#x27;t these mmo games give a Linux mode ? Pubg for example has mobile app, a lite app and a desktop lite app based on mobile. They are the same but they are matched with similar people only. Apply the same here. Give Linux users option to play the game, without the anti cheat and only match with similar Linux users. I get to deal with any potential cheaters')
