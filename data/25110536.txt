Where does one even see that line rate? It seems those rates would only occur at carriers, optical transport, or in very large data-centers.<p>* Intrusion detection, AFAIK, would mean that the packets have to be parsed and inspected. But most traffic is encrypted, right? How far beyond typical firewall capability can you get with this stuff if you can only look at the unencrypted part of the packet?<p>* Not sure exactly what &quot;intrusion&quot; means in this context? What are they looking for? What are some common rules that get applied? Every protocol is going to be wildly different and working at an application level. Don&#x27;t you need specific application experts to even think about writing such specialized rules?<p>* There are commercial products which, I think, do this stuff from Gigamon and Netscout. These products have special FPGA-based switches that have many 10G, 40G or 100G ports, how does the tech in the article differ? What&#x27;s the use case?')
