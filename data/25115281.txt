If you don&#x27;t have that USB stick they can usually be written with any macos, windows or linux machine.<p>Updates do not usually brick machines. I&#x27;m guessing your PCs that broke did not require another PC running the exact same windows version to fix? And I&#x27;m guessing that if those PCs were made within the last 5-10 years you could restore from recovery and not need another device?')
