Of course not. But they ended up doing it anyway.<p>I agree with the article&#x27;s main points, but I think the author gives the game&#x27;s creators too much credit here. You could tell from the first trailer that this game was going to engage in historical revisionism of the &quot;the Vikings were really noble heroes&quot; type. This isn&#x27;t oversight or subtext, it&#x27;s a conscious and deliberate choice.<p>The people who made this game weren&#x27;t stupid or ignorant. If they chose to erase the reality of Viking slavery and violence against defenceless civilians, it wasn&#x27;t an accident. They may (or may not) have intended to defend colonialism in general, but this  game is an entirely intentional attempt to defend _Viking_ colonialism specifically. And they will have been perfectly aware that this played into neo-Nazi tropes.')
