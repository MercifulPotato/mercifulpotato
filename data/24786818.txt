Item(by='save_ferris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602756269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786712, text='&gt; real life up has been incredibly stable for the last couple of decades in the west<p>This isn&#x27;t universally true in the US. Millions lost their homes in the great recession and never fully recovered, it&#x27;s just easy to forget that the American economy doesn&#x27;t work for everyone when it does work for you. Now millions more face eviction and starvation amidst a major public health crisis.<p>&gt; In the 70s (before social media), there were multiple bombings every year in the US. That is completely unfathomable today.<p>True, but mass shootings were unfathomable in the 70&#x27;s and happen at an alarming rate today. To your point, we&#x27;ve largely become desensitized to those stories because they just happen so often now. I think that the patterns of violence have shifted, not the presence of violence.<p>&gt; Social media is just giving you the impression that things are unstable because people like to complain when by any standard long-term measure itâ€™s just as stable as ever<p>I disagree with this too. Wealth inequality is skyrocketing and has been for many years. Average life expectancy has been declining in the US. Our current president has discussed running for a 3rd term and preemptively declined to accept the results of a Presidential election overseen by his own government. Has that ever happened before?<p>&gt; when was the last time a prominent politician was assassinated? - when was the last time a government building was bombed? - when was the last time a prominent politician was assaulted and left in the hospital?<p>These questions say more about the government&#x27;s ability to protect its members than providing insight into the stability of society. Congressman Steve Scalise was shot in 2017 during a practice session for a congressional baseball game, but survived. Gabby Giffords was shot in 2011 and survived. There are numerous attempts at these things that we&#x27;ll surely never know about.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that a group plotted to kidnap the sitting governor of Michigan and try her for treason. Law enforcement officials interviewed about that case largely said they&#x27;d never seen anything like that before.')
