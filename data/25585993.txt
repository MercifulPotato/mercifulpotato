Unfortunately, that meant Thursdays became the new Friday with people taking long lunches, leaving early etc.<p>As I left, they were integrating into the larger corporate structure to make sure everyone has the same Friday off beyond just our campus.

Ironically as the c-suite was considering going back to a 5 day schedule, people lower were pushing to go to a 8&#x2F;80 schedule.
