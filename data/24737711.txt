My friend wanted to stop them using the name, but after a few rounds of lawyers he got nowhere because selling clothes and selling a perfume are not overlapping businesses.<p>Also from what I&#x27;ve understood if you got a trademark, you have to defend it or else risk losing it. So while it often looks like a dick move, they&#x27;re kinda forced.')
