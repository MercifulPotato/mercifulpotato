I think a massive pandemic plus massive financial stimulus qualifies as novelty. The more history, the more confident you are that things will correct, but also the more history the more exposed you are to a regime change. Think of it like hypothesis testing, if evidence builds up over time it will take more evidence to change the test.<p>Having said that, timescale is relevant too. The kinds of strategies mentioned are somewhat long term buy-and-holds of certain kinds of portfolio, which require time to play out, and which have the attention of ordinary investors. If you were looking at very short term strategies like what an HFT might look at, the evidence builds up super fast in comparison.<p>The other big issue is you tend to look at whatever patterns you find that are repeated, but you don&#x27;t know why. The sort of thoughts that lead you to buy techs during the pandemic come from some kind of idea about dynamics, which are not so easy to prove.')
