This is the correct way to look at it.<p>Another point I don&#x27;t see so many people making here is it&#x27;s about more than just raw compensation. A lot of people at Google don&#x27;t like some of the things the company has sprawled out into doing now, e.g. war and surveillance tech.<p>A union is about creating some collective agency so labor can get what it wants, instead of being led around by the nose all the time by managers and owners who are motivated only by profit (or are at least not obliged to consider any interest, economic or moral, that laborers might have).<p>A union would give some strategic agency to labor--that is, the people who do all the work--at Google. If a majority does not want to make war robots anymore or whatever, they can assert their agency and get what they want, and stop making war robots or whatever.')
