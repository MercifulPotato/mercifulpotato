Fast, involuntary brain responses can be distinguished here from slower, more controlled responses. The researchers had expected the latter to involve consideration of the source&#x27;s credibility in addition to emotion, and thus that credibility might factor into peopleâ€™s judgments, whereas emotion should dominate in early and more involuntary responses. However, both late and early brain responses showed dominant influences of headline emotionality independent of credibility.</i><p>In the spirit of being critical even when we want to agree with or believe the conclusion: how &quot;good&quot; are these EEG studies?<p>I recall some scandal several years ago in which fMRI data was being promoted as far more useful than it really was, due to some buggy clustering software and maybe also p-hacking.<p>Are these types of results generally reproducible? How do we know they are valid?')
