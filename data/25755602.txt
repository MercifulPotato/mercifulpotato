They&#x27;re still legally allowed to enter the property until you evict them, which takes 30 days or more in most jurisdictions. You might be able to start eviction proceedings. You eventually sue them for damage to the property.<p>For a webhost, you call the police and....well what they&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t illegal so the police have no reason to care. If they were doing something illegal, ultimately the police might ask (or depending on the law, might need to get a court order) to ask you to shutdown the account. At this point, they&#x27;d no longer have access to the account.<p>In fact, if you imagine a person who does both on the same day, if they got out on bail, they would <i>still</i> be allowed into the house during the course of the eviction process. So they could continue using the house for a minimum of 30 days.<p>I don&#x27;t find this comparison to a landlord at all compelling.')
