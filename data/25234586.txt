Item(by='whakim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606529917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234189, text='I wasn&#x27;t intending to engage in name-calling; I apologise if it came off that way.<p>I agree that the earlier story should have directly mentioned the severance Coinbase offered to employees who left. That being said, the severance was pretty tangential to the point of that earlier story: that different companies have very different policies on workplace activism, and Coinbase was taking a hard line on politics at work (no politics allowed at work).<p>That being said, the NYT omitting a salient but tangential fact in a different story about Coinbase written several months ago hardly smacks of conspiracy. I try to read news articles on their own merits, giving some consideration to the agenda of the publication (and, as I mentioned earlier, the NYT has a perspective just like every other publication). To me, Coinbase didn&#x27;t really provide anything to refute the allegations in <i>this story</i> in their &quot;prebuttal&quot;, and the portrait of the company that the NYT paints seems pretty convincing.')
