They do match based on IP, since that&#x27;s all they really have from me.  When I delete cookies, though, things start over, basically.  Then I get recommendations based on what I&#x27;ve searched for in YT and what I&#x27;ve watched since I last deleted them.  It&#x27;s nice, really.  For a little while, YT doesn&#x27;t know enough about me not to show me both sides of an issue I&#x27;m searching for.  It&#x27;s really touchy, though.  Two or three videos covering one particular side of an issue in a row and the other recommendations disappear.<p>Of course, I can&#x27;t subscribe, like, ring the damn bell, or whatever it is they want me to do in every video.  I do use patreon for those content creators I really like.')
