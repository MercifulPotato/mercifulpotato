XNU is entirely C except for IOKit AFAIK.<p>My understanding is a lot of C++&#x27;s higher level features require pretty thick runtime support and complicate kernel level code to the point the traditional wisdom I&#x27;ve heard in both the hobby world and linux spheres is &quot;Avoid C++ like the plague&quot; or &quot;use C++ but be careful to avoid using exceptions&#x2F;RTTI&#x2F;etc&quot;.<p>It looks like Skift (and Haiku, apparently!) are mostly using the &quot;watered down&quot; C++, mostly for classes and templated generics, which is a good reason to use C++, yes.')
