I don&#x27;t care if this comment is perceived as partisan, it&#x27;s a statement of fact. If the republican leadership had unequivocally come out against the narrative that the election was stolen, this wouldn&#x27;t be happening.<p>Edit: Yes, it&#x27;s true that the top leader and his acolytes have engineered this outcome, but the majority of the republican leadership did not want this and do not benefit from this, they were (with some exceptions) simply too cowardly to speak out against it.')
