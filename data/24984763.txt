Definitely don&#x27;t stay in hotels in Alaska, if you&#x27;re not rich. Its crazy expensive (like $400&#x2F;night for Holiday Inn)<p>The way to do it cheaply is to fly in late June&#x2F;July and camp in Denali park. The weather is warm enough for camping and its fantastic. I actually feel camping is the best way to do it!<p>Assuming you already own camping gear. And can pack some food.<p>Here&#x27;s how it can be done:<p>$100 - Camping in Denali Park: $45 (entrance fee) + $17&#x2F;night x 3<p>$200 - $50&#x2F;day * 4 days  car rental<p>$50  - Fuel &#x2F; Snacks ( 300 miles round trip from Anchorage)<p>$50  - Denali Bus Ticket<p>$50  - Firewood&#x2F;Misc<p>_____<p>$450 - 4 days&#x2F;3 nights.<p>Budget left for flight $550 .<p>Depending where you fly in from you could come in under 1k. \nSeattle round trip flight in June $400.   NY&#x2F;Alaska is $620 round trip. Which would push you over 1k. But if you convince a friend to go with you, you could split the car&#x2F;camping costs.<p>You can also do wild camping for free, and if you&#x27;re into trying fly fishing, I definitely recommend getting a fishing license.<p>Fishing License Costs: 1 day - $25  &#x2F;  3 days - $45.\nA basic Fly fishing kit can be bought &lt; $100.')
