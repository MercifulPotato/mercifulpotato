I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re saying this but other people who have expressed that often, in my opinion, have a hidden implication that &quot;other choices&quot; really means no reputable choice would take their material, so they have to pick a disreputable choice, at which point people point to them and say &quot;See, they have to go to a disreputable choice; they must be disreputable too.&quot;<p>Going back to my original post, note that I didn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m entirely okay with it.  My argument is more along the lines is that a grassroots expression of opinion by individuals to other individuals who voluntarily want to receive it is okay but content being pushed by a source with money behind it can reasonably be treated with more suspicion because it raises questions about who exactly the money comes from and whether or not they have ulterior motives.')
