Completely agree. And with the new MacBook Air, I agree with everything you said except the battery life - the 2 day battery life is only true for &quot;light&quot; computing. Do any heavy computing, like compiling on Xcode, and the battery life comes down drastically, and may be nearly comparable to other Intel &#x2F; AMD laptop (ARM processors do beat x86 processors in power consumption).<p>That said, I do completely agree with you that the new Apple processors with its associated products will increase Apple&#x27;s profit and even its consumer base. So much that the loss of &quot;insignificant&quot; consumers like me, who care more about computing freedom and avoiding closed systems won&#x27;t really matter to them. Apple&#x27;s target consumers are no longer the tech savvy.')
