How many books did the <i>actual</i> writers of the New Testament read? Dozens or hundreds of people contributed to those writings.<p>Obviously a similar situation with Buddha -- &quot;his&quot; teachings are not always his.<p>There isn&#x27;t much else to this thread, but there are thousands of counterpoints.<p>All of <i>my</i> greatest teachers were voracious readers, and they read both widely and deeply.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the motivation of the thread is, other than to try to trivialize intellectualism (which I suppose is fitting for someone who thinks Jesus is responsible for the content of the New Testament).')
