Most users consume our docker images but there is zero reason you can&#x27;t compile binaries and run on bare metal.<p>That being said, Temporal backend consists of a few stateless and horizontally scalable services (matching service, frontend service etc). Because these roles experience load differently it often makes sense to scale them separately. Due to this design, users often find it convenient to use an orchestration solution such as Kubernetes, ECS etc. HashiCorp themselves run our technology using Nomad to directly answer your question.<p>The only thing we are strongly opinionated about is that you run the underlying database in a production-grade manner. Throwing a MySQL container into a helm chart isn&#x27;t going to cut it for serious usage.')
