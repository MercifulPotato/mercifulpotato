That&#x27;s why we have minimum wage laws. The idea is that rather than paying people what we can get away with, we pay them what they are worth to us.<p>If productivity improves, but wages are indexed only to inflation, then the rich get richer and the poor at best stay the same. They produce more but don&#x27;t see their lives get better. In a country that has produced so much additional wealth, it would be nice if the people who produce it became themselves better off, rather than have the gains concentrate in a smaller and smaller minority.<p>The minimum wage doesn&#x27;t just stagnate. It&#x27;s not inflation-indexed, so inflation eats into it: it hasn&#x27;t increased since 2009, and even though we&#x27;re often below the Fed&#x27;s target rate, inflation has still reduced the value of that by 20%. That suggests it&#x27;s time to raise it, and the $24&#x2F;hour figure helps put the quantity into context. It makes a $15&#x2F;hour wage seem very doable, since it&#x27;s less than half of the productivity increase.')
