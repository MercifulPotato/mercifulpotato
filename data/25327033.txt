This isn&#x27;t going to look nearly as pretty.<p>What I would like to have is a fan-cooled case with a circuitry which would take a high-power laptop-grade USB-C charger as an input and split that power between the Pi and the fan. Perhaps it could also split the USB-C port into a power input port and an actual extra USB port.')
