I still feel that &quot;smart&quot; watches peaked with Pebble. Long battery life, physical buttons &#x2F; no touch-screen, waterproof, shows notifications &#x2F; allows basic actions to be taken on them. That&#x27;s all I wanted from a smart watch, and it provided it all!<p>I don&#x27;t know who decided that I need to be able to make and receive calls on my watch, have a color screen, or any number of the other &quot;new features&quot; modern smart watches push. I wouldn&#x27;t mind a HRM, but I&#x27;d still prefer a 1-week battery life.')
