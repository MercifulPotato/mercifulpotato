I remember having to install ruby and to run jekyll for the whole purpose of creating html pages with templating! I thought to myself: If I wanted something as complicated as that I would just write it in PHP and &quot;require&quot; the pieces conditionally and just build it by doing &quot;php index.php &gt; index.html&quot;, works just as well for someone who doesn&#x27;t know ruby. Also most web developers already program with javascript, so why invent a ruby tool for that job?<p>So that&#x27;s a pretty cool project! Thanks for sharing! Will create some experiments!')
