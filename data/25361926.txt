So i think the implication is that he took resources from the state but didn&#x27;t stay long enough for the gov&#x2F;people to see an ROI.<p>But, as much as i am a lefty<i>(+capitalist)</i>, that seems a fault of the state. States should expect this more imo. You give near negative returns to companies to come to your state and then you&#x27;re shocked when they leave and you haven&#x27;t gotten your ROI?<p>But maybe this will be good. If the migration continues perhaps California will have to stop subsidizing low-tax states and let them fend for themselves more.')
