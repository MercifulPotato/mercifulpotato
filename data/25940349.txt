They don&#x27;t have an online review component (like Plugshare for example) so the car can&#x27;t know that the charger it&#x27;s currently navigating to is most likely broken. This will result in a shitty experience for inexperienced or non tech savvy EV drivers.<p>Tesla on the other hand knows exactly what&#x27;s happening on their Superchargers and share that data with their vehicles.')
