But that would be too honest and easy. Gotta have a way to siphon off lots of money for your own bloated salary and the best way to do that is to be between donation and destination.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why the Firefox people haven&#x27;t split from Mozilla to rectify this. What&#x27;s keeping them there? Didn&#x27;t Thunderbird devs split? What am I missing?')
