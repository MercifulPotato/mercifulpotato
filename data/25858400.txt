The barges could be unloaded more quickly than break-bulk cargo, and could be towed on inland waterways.<p>This proved not to be able to compete with container ships when they were introduced. The last LASH ships in regular commercial service AFAIK were the Baco-Liners, which served small ports in West Africa and were scrapped in the early 2010s.')
