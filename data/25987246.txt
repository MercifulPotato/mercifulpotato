Don&#x27;t want to spoil anything, as the feeling of discovery was a major part of my enjoyment.<p>Never did complete <i>all</i> puzzles, that was a bit too much, maybe I&#x27;ll give it another whirl...<p>I recently completed The Return of Obra Dinn, based on recommendations from here, which I also really liked.
