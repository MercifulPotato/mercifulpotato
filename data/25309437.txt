Computers are making us sad, mad, bad, but rarely glad. The subconscious works on us when we are not thinking. It brings up feelings we don&#x27;t know what to do with because we don&#x27;t understand them. The world is complex and we are sometimes tormented in our dreams. Technology is touted as a thing in itself. It all started so innocent. Just beepabopaboop. We crave meaning in our lives. Computers are not delivering this to us.
