There are plenty that disallow crawlers except google. We&#x27;ve crawled a significant amount now and just because you are unaware of them doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist. I can attest they&#x27;re there.<p>I&#x27;ll also add plenty of sites don&#x27;t block any engine but confer special privileges to google bot which depending on the site and their size are almost the same thing.<p>Edit: And I&#x27;ll add to limit confusion Reddit hides the sitemap and denies access there&#x27;s is not an outright ban -- it just makes it a lot harder.')
