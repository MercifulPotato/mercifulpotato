Amateur radio satellites and some cubesat kits [1] use primarily COTS components.<p>The lifetime and radiation environment for those applications are very limited, though. It seems that for short missions (e.g. &lt;2 years) and low orbits (&lt;500km), COTS hardware should be fine if properly shielded.<p>It would be interesting to see what difference it actually makes for HEO or even BEO missions, especially if a high degree of redundancy is introduced as well.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cubesatkit.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cubesatkit.com</a>')
