This isn&#x27;t a game: sometimes you simply <i>don&#x27;t get</i> to sit it out.<p>&gt; and inherently precludes the possibility of nihilism<p>I am quite happy to preclude nihilism entirely.<p>&gt; It would be extraordinary - and flatly in tension with common sense - to believe&#x2F;claim that agnosticism and&#x2F;or nihilism were not live options for some domain.<p>I could give a lot of answers to this, but I think the simplest one is that what you regard as &quot;common sense&quot; is not necessarily the same as what I do, so I don&#x27;t find that a very convincing counterargument.')
