So instead of configuring and maintaining one of the many Linux flavours (and all those layers) out there I have one standard system to worry about.<p>I have a K3s Rpi cluster running for a few months now. Setup was trivial and maintenance as well. If I have a problematic node I just remove it from the cluster, reflash the SD card with a new install of K3os and put it back in. No state or further configuration to worry about.<p>All my previous homelab setups where either hand-crafted snowflakes or configuration managed by some tool (Puppet, Salt or Ansible). Each comes with its own problems but they all have the problem that they accumulate state over time and become to hard to manage.')
