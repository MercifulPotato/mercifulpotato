What if I would use a second phone, a cheap one, used only for the whatsapp (and some other essential but privacy invasive apps). I would not have that second phone always with me, but it would provide me access to the social network I need without feeling tracked or providing more data than needed.<p>I do understand that this doesn&#x27;t fix exactly the issue presented here, but I already assumed that whatsapp data was already in Facebook&#x27;s hands one way or another. But I would limit the amount of information that WhatsApp can track about me by having this application on a phone which does not really represent my full actions as i don&#x27;t have it with me.<p>Edit: Corrected some typos.')
