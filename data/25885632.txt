Item(by='WClayFerguson', descendants=None, kids=[25886336], score=None, time=1611432906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885172, text='I&#x27;m glad we agree that classical mechanics accurately predicts macro objects.<p>However, atoms, molecules, and even molecular lattices containing a small number of atoms (or large number actually), behave as quantum wave systems. Even the link you gave states that &#x27;benzene&#x27; despite having 42 electrons, has a <i>single</i> wave function that determines probabilities for where an electron can be observed (but not WHICH electron. There is no WHICH ELECTRON in the function). In that wave function it means there&#x27;s no longer 42 actual electrons that even exist. There is nothing but a probability of where you&#x27;d find one if you collapse the entire wave simultaneously by taking a measurement of any part of it.<p>When atoms join into a crystal formation that becomes even a &#x27;higher level&#x27; new emergent pattern of vibrating probabilities, that&#x27;s more complex and structured than what the individual particles exhibited before the new pattern emerged.<p>You think I&#x27;m wrong to say atoms pop into existence?, but we know for a fact all particles are merely probabilities until observed. All observation is synonymous with wave-collapse, and only upon wave-collapse do you have actual particles with actual positions in spacetime. Every &#x27;frame&#x27; of every video you could ever create is a snapshot of &quot;a series of collapses&quot;, because that collapse is what created the particles that make up the &#x27;image&#x27; itself.')
