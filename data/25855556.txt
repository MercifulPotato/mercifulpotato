Not coincidentially, Naranja in Spanish&#x2F;Portuguese is Orange. (I think this is an instance of Indian words migrating west, probably via Arabia.)<p>The reverse is also true - lot of words in Kerala which had sea-trade with Portugal and Spain, are close to their Portuguese&#x2F;spanish equivalent, more than in other Indian languages. They are very closely related to the Iberian terms<p>- papaya<p>- sabola (Malayalam) versus Cebolla (Spanish&#x2F;Portuguese)<p>- kashuandi (Cashew nut)<p>Other related terms like kappalandi (ship nuts - i.e. peanuts) indicate  sea trade and that they were not endemic to India.<p>Looking at Malayalam terms gives a good indication as to which foods came to India via sea trade, possibly from South America, since the South was often the port of call.
