Lots of takers.<p>Soon enough, you go to a VC and show them your revenue stream, and tell them with more capital you can make the margins much better. They hand you a few million, and you start selling more $100 bills for $70 instead. Wow, you&#x27;re reducing margins and seeing insane sales growth!<p>A few more investments later and you&#x27;re selling $100 bills for $95 en masse. You have ads everywhere, your IPO and ICO are coming up. You probably have a few billion in funding from SoftBank.<p>Your stock price skyrockets because you&#x27;re THIS CLOSE to showing profitability and if the trend continues you&#x27;ll be making billions.')
