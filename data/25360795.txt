Their ability to consolidate resources is poor. They came late-to-the-game on tooling up an infrastructure team to provide both standardized libraries and rigor on how the architecture is used. The duplication of component logic is a direct consequence of this, as those components are ending up in the codebase as a side-effect of different segments of code, worked on by different teams, probably in different offices, &quot;reusing&quot; the same component---but not really, since they might be skewed on the version they&#x27;re depending on. It&#x27;s DLL hell in Javascript client form, basically.<p>And the product as a whole is chasing feature parity, not speed of UI.<p>The simplest way to not end up like Google Cloud UI is to not try to build a whole-product cloud solution. The second simplest way, if you&#x27;re Amazon and you&#x27;ve already gone that road, is to have different sub-parts of your mega-architecture be different &quot;apps&quot; (really, different websites), each of which need pull in only the pieces it cares about, and be willing to take a whole-page refresh when the user transitions from one page to another.')
