But it does mean that you don’t see explicit neo-nazi participation as a deal breaker. I think it’s perfectly fair to judge people who are willing to stand side by side with neo-nazis in order to get their preferred tax policy.<p>Of course, every party has its crazies. And we should moderate our judgement based on the percentage of crazies and their relative influence. A party that’s explicitly excluded their crazies from power should not be judged based on the crazies that they’ve rejected. But that doesn’t seem to be where we’re at right now vis-à-vis neo-nazis and other right wing extremists.')
