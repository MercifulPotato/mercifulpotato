Unless you hyperventilate (don&#x27;t!) the pain will be too great for most people to hold until they black out. And one can always just start breathing before that, never beat your own PR by more than a few seconds at a time.<p>Of course, when setting records it&#x27;s done in the water (because of the diving reflex), which should never be attempted alone.<p>I recommend apps for &quot;co2 tables&quot; when practicing.')
