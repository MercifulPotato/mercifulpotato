I read it as OP saying that those people likely watched unverified content that is now down, not necessarily illegal content.  It is basically an accusation of puritanical hypocrisy. However the problem with that accusation is that it is extremely difficult to distinguish the unverified and illegal content, especially at scale, and it is why Pornhub went with this extreme measure to remove all unverified content.')
