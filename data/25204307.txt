You have wealth you have to store somehwere because it is not being spent now. Can store it as equities, debt (including a bank account), Paper cash money under the mattress, gold bars, BTC, etc etc.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have the list of potential places to store it and can get a price&#x2F;value ratio but with a common term of &quot;X&quot; in the value<p><pre><code>  - A = 3.1&#x2F;X\n  - B = 2.8&#x2F;X\n  - C = 1.9&#x2F;X\n  - D = 4.2&#x2F;X\n</code></pre>\nGotta put it somewhere if you aren&#x27;t spending it. In the above you&#x27;d Choose &quot;C&quot;. Lowest price to value ratio even though you don&#x27;t know what the actual value is.<p>Yes, this is a massive simplification as it ignores diversification benefits and so on but there&#x27;s the basics of the usefulness of valuation where you don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t know the value.<p>&quot;prediction of the market&quot; here means &quot;Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going up or down this year?&quot; Warren Buffet completely ignores this, takes no view on it. Timing the market is very hard. Assuming the market will reflect the economy and the economy will grow because people work hard, are smart, we invent new things and population increases, then picking the best of what&#x27;s available is the normal value investors route, a la Buffet as the most famous practioner.<p>Burton Malkiel&#x27;s &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall St.&quot; is still, IMHO the best summary of all the theory and practise of investing - excluding the quant funds like Renaissance. Maybe he has an update for them? Maybe it&#x27;s also worth reading if it exists or maybe not. Don&#x27;t know.<p>No idea if renaissance time the market or what.<p>edit: punctuation and the Malkiel recommendation.')
