Never going to use that again, you cannot imagine how slow that monster was. It had VS integration, but it was such a bad product overall.<p>Used SVN previously for private stuff and I think it is still spread in many companies. I liked it, just all the small folders are a PITA and git is faster for larger repositories. It had far better tools than git in my opinion, TortoiseSVN. Heavy, but practical.<p>I would always use git now, even if only locally.')
