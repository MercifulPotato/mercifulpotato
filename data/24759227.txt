Serverless seemed more compelling to me 5+ years ago.<p>But nowadays, I just setup my K8 templates with auto-scaling groups on GKE, and it pretty much works just as well as serverless was promised. Compute demand gets seamlessly transformed into compute supply.<p>I almost never have to think about managing individual hosts. And the cost is cheaper and performance is more predictable than serverless. Plus it&#x27;s mostly all platform agnostic.')
