I know in my country, that intangibles are not expenses, but assets.  Because that makes them taxable.<p>If anything, it is a <i>boon</i> for these intangible-majority companies, that R&amp;D can be written off as expenses, because that can make for a favourable tax report.<p>But regardless of all that, accounting will still be necessary to account for a company&#x27;s finances, so it&#x27;s hardly a demise of accounting.  I may have misheard, but I believe to recall, that modern companies often keep two accounting books, one for the officially required accounting, and one that - they feel - better reflects their actual financial situation.')
