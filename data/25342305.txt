So your guess seems pretty on point. Indoor dining&#x2F;drinking means being around others without masks in areas where air is circulated rather than fully exchanged, so it&#x27;s about as risky as you can get short of a church service or choir practice (which has all of those risks but adds &quot;let&#x27;s project particles from deep in our lungs while singing&quot;). &quot;Spreading events&quot; under those conditions have been pretty well-documented, as far as I know.<p>So, I&#x27;d say Dr. Morrow is aware that some of the restricted business activities drive transmission and he&#x27;s supporting those restrictions. There are other activities -- like outdoor dining, as long as you&#x27;re not putting diners in circulation-restricting tents -- that seem to be lower risk, and could probably further mitigate risks by having limitations on group size, dining time, etc., rather than just a point-blank ban. And there are some other restrictions which just seem more like theatre, such as curfews. Do we think coronavirus is nocturnal?<p>&gt; Should we ignore them, then?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how useful that question is for folks who don&#x27;t run businesses facing that decision. If I was a restaurant operator, I wouldn&#x27;t flagrantly flout the local regulations even if I disagreed with them. I&#x27;m not, though, and the restrictions that more directly apply to me as a citizen -- e.g., try to stay at home during this surge, don&#x27;t gather in groups even with folks in your &quot;quarantine bubble&quot; -- don&#x27;t seem that wildly unreasonable.')
