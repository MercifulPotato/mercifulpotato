Also, even for a short interesting run of local behavior, the game never produces a stable behavior that grows in complexity beyond the initial information encoded in the random state. (i.e. if there is a bubble of cool stuff happening somewhere on the 2d plane, something usually interferes with it and destroys that pattern - like waves in the ocean, even when the energy curves combine to form a wave once in a while, they are limited and temporary).<p>So the Game of Life is actually an example that the system is limited to the information encoded in the initial starting state.<p>In the starting state there is either:<p>- a large enough random search space (i.e. a million random attempts with a 100x100 board might get something cool looking)<p>- intentionality (a person can design a starting state that can produce any possible stable system)')
