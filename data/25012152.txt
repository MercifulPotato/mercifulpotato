Nothing you can really do about it but it&#x27;s lame and should be called out.<p>I use a unique email address in my HN profile just for HN related stuff (it&#x27;s hn@&lt;my domain&gt;) and just received a spam from an Amazon recruiter &quot;about the status of my application for engineering management roles at Amazon&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve never applied to work for Amazon, never used that unique email address anywhere else, also not been an engineer for 10+ years!<p>This here is partly venting and partly to put others on alert.')
