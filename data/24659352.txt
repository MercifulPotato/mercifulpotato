Snowden spent a lot of time doing what he did, and still has a ton of insider information.<p>Anything he talks about in terms of his experience as a contract is probably subject to the agreement.<p>If you work for Apple, and then write a book talking about all of the meetings, transactions, decision inputs, criteria for projects, talk about projects that never came to light etc. - they probably would probably sue and try to stop publication.<p>So it&#x27;s hard to say exactly what is going on.')
