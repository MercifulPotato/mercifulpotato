When we meet in person, we don&#x27;t just look and talk at each other. When we meet in person, we don’t just look and talk at each other. We make notes, we write on whiteboards, we set timers, we raise our hands. Broadly speaking, we can effortlessly utilize our environments in order to more easily transmit ideas brain-to-brain. Unfortunately, video chat platforms have mostly killed that flexibility.<p>That why we built Align (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;align.link), the only extensible video chat platform. Platforms like Zoom have done a great job removing the friction of scheduling, starting, and joining meetings. But there is still the question of what actually happens <i>in</i> the meeting. We don’t want to answer that question, we want to help you answer it  instead. We made Align so that anyone with an idea of how to make their virtual meetings even just a little more useful can build an app to  bring their idea to life. And best of all, apps can be easily shared  with the meeting-goers of the world.<p>Our SDK is currently in private beta, if you’re interested in developing a meeting app, sign up for the wait list on our website (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;align.link&#x2F;#sdk-beta).<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your ideas for apps that can make your meetings better :)')
