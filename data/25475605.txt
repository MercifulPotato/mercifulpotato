You’re most likely a progressive white person who has the audacity to think that you can speak on our (minorities) behalf. We don’t need your friggin help. There is plenty of injustice in the world, but as a brown person, I have nothing but good things to say about law enforcement, living in America, and the abundant opportunities I’ve had as a direct result of simply being born in America.<p>Every time I go to the south, those white rednecks treat me and my brown family as one of their own. In the liberal state where I live, most of what I have to put up with is arrogant white liberals who genuinely believe they have white privilege and are even as racist and arrogant to say preposterous things like, “I’m going to use my white privileged to fight racism.”<p>People are dying to be little helpless victims today. It’s disgusting. All I see is a bunch of 1st worlders who have no real perspective on what it’s like to NOT live in a developed country.')
