The subject of adding properties to Java has come up numerous times over the past twenty years, and even though we&#x27;re adding quite a few new features -- most recently, algebraic data types -- properties are not added because we just don&#x27;t want them. Their &quot;bang for the buck&quot; is low, their potential for abuse is high, and adding them to an established language is even less appealing, as it creates a clear old&#x2F;new code divide. Most of all, it&#x27;s unclear whether the style of programming that relies on mutating individual fields is something that should be encouraged in the first place.<p>Another controversial feature that C# and Kotlin have but we don&#x27;t want to add to Java is extension methods. It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for different languages to reach different conclusions regarding certain features, with some biased more toward happily adding features while others are more conservative, and it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for different programmers to have different preferences. The important thing is that features are carefully considered by language designers before being added, and that the language&#x27;s &quot;feel&quot;, philosophy and context is taken into account.')
