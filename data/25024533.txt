They locked down for a number of months and have got effective control of the virus, with 9 days no infection so far since lifting movement restrictions.  There has been a lot of concern about peoples mental health and money is being spent both on highlighting the problem as well as making sure people are aware of services available.  My understanding is that the services are under pressure, but coping.<p>Lockdown is going to cause secondary social, health and economic problems, but if you can do it well and get control of the virus then you gain flexibility to deal with the secondary problems.  If you don&#x27;t control the virus, you will end up with those other problems as well as the out of control virus.<p>This is a no win situation. If you aren&#x27;t lucky enough to live in an isolated country and avoid the problem from the start, something that only worked for some of the really isolated island nations, then you have to move hard and fast to control the virus and hope to deal with the flow on problems once you have the immediate threat under control.')
