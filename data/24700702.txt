I don&#x27;t see comments attacking OP on the post you linked...<p>Now to address you actual point, what would a PR person do here exactly? &quot;Tesla is investigating the issue and will not provide any comments at the current time&quot;? They fixed the car so their internal metrics will ensure that whatever issue caused this will get fixed. It&#x27;s not economically sensible to fix any percentage of cars right after delivery.<p>I understand that Tesla light passions and that PR has got (ironically) bad PR in the last few years, but I fail to see how your comment is related to the issue.')
