Nuclear is extraordinarily expensive and often takes decades to plan and build.<p>Renewables can be built far cheaper and far more quickly. On grids that still have gas &amp; coal fired power stations, every GWh of electricity produced from renewables displaces a GWh that would otherwise be produced from fossil fuels.<p>Or, to put it another way, every dollar spent on renewables will result in a significantly larger and faster reduction of carbon emissions than if that same dollar were spent on nuclear.')
