What I meant is that procurement takes OSS-licensed code as a &quot;given&quot; and carefully considers what they get <i>on top</i> of the base product when they pay money (while developers often think that they are charging for the whole thing, but in &quot;enterprise&quot; context). And that is where the blue ocean ends. Independent of that, you are completely right that most serious companies view non-standard free&#x2F;&quot;free&quot; licenses as commercial and simply consider those as non-OSS products just like they would otherwise.')
