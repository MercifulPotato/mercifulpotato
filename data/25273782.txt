So for context I thought it might add a bit more depth to the question of &quot;whether or not NSF was funding Arecibo or trying to get rid of it &#x2F; defund it&quot; idea.<p>And personally I was surprised that for $8M a year you could fund the program (presumably that was with a bunch of clearly needed maintenance being deferred). It really is too bad that some billionaire didn&#x27;t just fund it. I&#x27;m wondering if Paul Allen helped out when he was alive.')
