There are been some major public relations problems when an organization said this, and were mistaken to mean pre-symptomatic, but the science is pretty clear.<p>We used to think true asymptomatic infections (never develop any symptoms but test positive) were ~50% of those infected. More recent research puts it at closer to ~20%. Again, some reporting bungled this by reporting studies from controlled populations (like a cruise ship) before they knew if cases were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, causing people to quote the number as the former, when it was really a mix.<p>COVID spreads like wildfire by pre-symptomatic people. There are mountains of evidence to support this. Spread by asymptomatic people is speculation.<p>&gt; Of course, whether you go on to develop symptoms or not, its still highly pertinent information if asymptomatic spread is not a major driver of infection.<p>Not sure, but I think you may be using the word &quot;asymptomatic&quot; to denote pre-symptomatic in this sentence.<p>&gt; As long as you self isolate upon symptom onset that should be enough.<p>It is not enough.')
