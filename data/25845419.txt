It&#x27;s inconsistent, ambiguous, and has many undeclared dialects.  Oh, and many people use 0-based index to boot, because, you know, whether that&#x27;s conventional or convenient (largely orthogonal qualities alas in math) depends on the context.<p>I mean, I can sort of buy his argument that it&#x27;s arbitrary, but then he also points out that there&#x27;s at least one advantage to 0-based indexing, namely that works well in offset based scenarios (not just for pointers).  So in which case is 1-based indexing convenient? Based on this blog post, never.')
