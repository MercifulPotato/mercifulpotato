It does dissipate quite quickly, so it&#x27;s important.<p>Dust and particular matter scares are definitely overblown. I live in zone 1, first floor with windows overlooking a small road, and I hardly ever saw PM25 level going over 2ug&#x2F;m3 in a year I&#x27;ve measured it. Compare that to the safe long term exposure level of 10ug&#x2F;m3 set by the WHO.')
