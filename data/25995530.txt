Googleâ€™s biggest ad clients achieve pretty incredible ROI (called ROAS) on each dollar they spend.<p>Yet overall advertising spend is relatively flat. It&#x27;s just shifted from one media to another.<p>Advertising will not collapse. Companies budgets for advertising is fairly flat as a percentage of revenue.
