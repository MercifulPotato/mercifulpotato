But in actuality there is an implicit `this` argument too. Armed with this knowledge it becomes trivial to see how the total input to the function is `N + 1` values. `N` being the length of the function, and the `1` representing the thing we&#x27;re searching for. Since constant values in complexity theory are handily ignored we get an input of size `N`.<p>And as to your second point, the choice of what is and isn&#x27;t a constant-time operation is generally a practical concession. There&#x27;s no reason to say &quot;you can&#x27;t say anything about any algorithm because it&#x27;s an implementation detail&quot; here. The conversation is specifically about element presence in an unsorted array. A very simple, easily understood, and unambiguous algorithm. Bringing up the runtime of the operation in a hashtable or in tree-structures is entirely nonsensical and just destroys any conversation there is to be had.')
