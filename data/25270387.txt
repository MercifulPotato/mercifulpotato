You will need to be very proficient with C++ (think adding features related to parallelism and concurrency using the upcoming C++20 Standard, the C++ Concurrency TS, Parallelism TS V2 etc) and be willing to work on AI Framework Internals (PyTorch, Tensorflow), A.I Compilers (TVM, LLVM&#x2F;MLIR) and&#x2F;or very large scale distributed systems. One day you will be working on enabling next generation A.I silicon and the next you may be working on a cluster with thousands of nodes. You have to really &quot;get&quot; Computer Science to thrive at Nod.<p>You need to be able to work remotely indefinitely given the current state of affairs we will not return to the office until everyone feels safe doing so.<p>You: Self starter and mostly importantly a finisher - pick something up and deliver without supervision. You will be a manager with a team size of one - you. You will need to pick the next problem on the way to achieve our goals and solve it. You will need to hold a lot of complexity in your head and have solid CS fundamentals. For what we do, Google may not have all the answers to your questions, github may not have any such sample code and Stackoverflow may have a vaguely related question with no replies, but you will be responsible for solving the problem. Everyone of us is a hands on engineer so you will thrive doing more of what you love.<p>Check us out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nod.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nod.ai</a> and drop us an email at stdin@nod-labs.com')
