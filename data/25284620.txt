That&#x27;s not how it works in Australia at all.<p>Here, salary expectations are given in the first screening call. If they can&#x27;t meet the expectation or you won&#x27;t be happy with their lower offer things end there.<p>Interviews &#x2F; code tests happen.<p>Offer comes over phone or email. This includes salary.<p>There is no signature at this stage and nothing is set in stone, its just an offer. If you accept the offer a contract is drawn up. Still nothing is certain.<p>Changes to the contract can happen here.<p>Once both parties sign. That is when you&#x27;re &quot;signed&quot;.<p>This happens well before your start date, usually you would stipulate the start date in the contract, so if you need to give a month&#x27;s notice to your employer your new contract with a start date from a month is signed before you even hand in your notice.<p>There is a 3 month trial period on all employment where they can walk without much repercussions, but this is more of a concession on your part because employment is very well protected.<p>Any weird IP bullshit or other conditions of employment that need signing would be in the contract you signed on for.<p>They can&#x27;t bait and switch like what you&#x27;re discussing. Any NDA&#x27;s are discussed up front and at least their existence is disclosed in the contract giving you a chance to see them early.<p>Basically you can&#x27;t put new conditions of employment on people after the fact, and if you did it wouldn&#x27;t be valid in court anyway, contract law trumps contract content here no matter what.<p>Things don&#x27;t have to work exactly like this, you might want to leverage the offer for a higher pay at your current job, counter offering is commonplace here but I wouldn&#x27;t ever accept one. They&#x27;ll be looking for your replacement as soon as you accept.')
