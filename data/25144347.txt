Item(by='superfrank', descendants=None, kids=[25145628], score=None, time=1605743657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143062, text='&gt; The point they are making is that if the author wants to live in India, if the work is entirely remote anyways, they shouldn&#x27;t have to provide additional value<p>They should because there is nothing stoping their company from hiring someone else in India for the Indian market rate.<p>&gt; If his work was worth $100K when he lived in SF, why isn&#x27;t the equivalent work worth $100K in Wichita?<p>His work wasn&#x27;t worth $100k. It cost $100k to hire someone who was willing&#x2F;able to do his work and come into the office.<p>&gt; but software companies should expect to pay a national rate for those types of jobs going forward if remote work is going to be more of a standard<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more, but I think a lot of people have things backwards. People in the Bay Area (etc) were being payed wages far, far above the national rate. These companies aren&#x27;t cutting wages below the national rate, they&#x27;re attempting to remove the premium they were paying to local employees.')
