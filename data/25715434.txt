Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610291977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25712834, text='&gt;Can you give a reasoned, principled argument against open borders, transsexualism, liberalism itself?<p>I&#x27;ve heard <i>plenty</i> of reasoned arguments against those things. Here&#x27;s the problem: they weren&#x27;t given by Trump supporters. They came from moderates, or in some cases, from Marxists.<p>Trumpism isn&#x27;t just opposition to what Fox News says the Democratic Party supports. It&#x27;s the belief structure that convinces people that &quot;open borders&quot; is even on the table in modern politics at all (it isn&#x27;t). If you think that &quot;open borders&quot; is more likely in the next two decades than the country being destroyed by an asteroid impact, you&#x27;re already in the disinformation hole.')
