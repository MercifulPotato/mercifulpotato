Here I&#x27;m assuming your parents shouldn&#x27;t try a PRC vaccine, so it&#x27;s virus vector Russian or mMRA Pfizer, both essentially accomplishing the same thing, both with high overall efficacy.<p>Or look at it this way: if they don&#x27;t get a good result from either of these two vaccines, they&#x27;re not likely to fair well from a real infection.  <i>Maybe.</i> We really don&#x27;t known why even at their age most people survive.<p>The other factor is how much you trust quality control.  Pfizer &gt; Russia &gt;&gt; PRC in my book, but I have absolutely no read on Russian quality.  But also note Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech is useless if not properly handled to its strict temp and physical requirements.')
