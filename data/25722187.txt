The top posts of the site were overwhelmingly calls for violence, racism, and the spread of conspiracy theories. Parler volunteer moderators curated all dissenting voices on the platform to produce the exact content they wanted (accounts are shadowbanned by default until they are &#x27;approved&#x27; for crying out loud).<p>This is the paradox of tolerance reaching its tipping point. Any sufficiently tolerant society can only be so tolerant until a bad actor becomes so detrimental to the continued function of that society, that they must choose between allowing some intolerance toward the destructive actor or risk losing everything by allowing the bad actor to continue their work.<p>This is not the patriot act. This isn&#x27;t Prism. This is a group of people grooming others to shout fire in a crowded assembly hall. Good riddance.')
