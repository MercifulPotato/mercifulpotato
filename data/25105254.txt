It assumes basic physics and maths, but then gives a nice overview about all the fundamentals - aerostatics, aerodynamics, propulsion, materials, structure of aircraft, etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;introduction-to-aeronautical-engineering-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;introduction-to-aeronautical-engi...</a><p>If you&#x27;re specifically looking at autonomous flight of drones, then the Udacity <i>Flying Car</i> nano degree is not bad (it contains several mistakes, but takes you through quite some material with neat exercises). It presupposes a bit more maths and programming. I was free (for a month) during the early stages of the pandemic, now I think it&#x27;s back to normal prices.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;flying-car-nanodegree--nd787" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udacity.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;flying-car-nanodegree--nd787</a>')
