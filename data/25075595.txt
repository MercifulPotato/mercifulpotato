The subject matter was fascinating to me but too far over my head for me to do anything practical. I picked it up a few years later and noodled around w&#x2F; neural networks a little bit but it never &quot;clicked&quot;.<p>1994 is around the time I read Steven Levy&#x27;s &quot;Artifical Life&quot;[1]. I definitely had the excitement the author has about genetic algorithms and classifier systems. They seemed much more approachable than neural networks, too. They appealed to the assembler programmer in me, I guess.<p>I&#x27;ll echo what others are saying here. Brute force compute has opened the door for so many possibilities. Evolution has had so more &quot;CPU&quot; and &quot;compute substrate&quot; to play with than we can possibly imagine. I&#x27;m unsettled by the idea that we&#x27;re training models we don&#x27;t actually understand. I&#x27;m also not dismissive of the possibilities that they open up, though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penguinrandomhouse.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;100796&#x2F;artificial-life-by-steven-levy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penguinrandomhouse.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;100796&#x2F;artificial-l...</a>')
