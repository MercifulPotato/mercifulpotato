Gradual karma is better because it implies that they&#x27;re probably not a troll.<p>- Did their karma come from the current subreddit or a different one? Just because you have karma from a popular sub doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re a good contributor to a niche sub.<p>- How frequently are they downvoted? Frequent negative karma in even-handed subreddits is a bad sign.<p>- Does the user have good reputation in related subreddits?<p>So it&#x27;s usually not the number that matters, but the context around that number and how it came to be. That said, usually these things only matter when a user is misbehaving: if you&#x27;re a mod you need to know whether they&#x27;re having a bad day, or if they have a history of breaking rules and trolling.')
