Most of the positive things you&#x27;re saying were the works of individuals putting their own safety and security at risk against the wishes of the government. The rest of the argument basically amounts to &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t have believed what the Chinese government was saying because there was a lot of evidence they were lying.&quot; I agree wholeheartedly, especially in retrospect, but that does not make their lying, and the long-term ramifications, acceptable. Transparency of the situation (or allowing outside observers) would have given the rest of the world valuable weeks or months and saved untold lives.')
