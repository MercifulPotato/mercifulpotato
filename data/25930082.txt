Item(by='serial_dev', descendants=None, kids=[25930368], score=None, time=1611764381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929095, text='&gt; Social media (and the attention economy) are worse for young brains than drugs.<p>I don&#x27;t think you need <i>young</i> in that sentence. I see social media&#x27;s negative effects on all age groups.<p>I see it in my own life (I&#x27;m 30): somehow, I feel compelled to keep track of politics, and I watch political shows way too much. I don&#x27;t learn anything from it 98% of the time. After I watch&#x2F;read about that topic, I can&#x27;t concentrate on anything for long, <i>I want to know more</i>. The moment I wake up, I reach to the mobile to read the news. Then, I visit some meme sites, then I go to Hacker News. When I don&#x27;t want to wake up yet, I repeat.<p>As a defense mechanism, I deactivated Facebook, I only post programming content on Twitter and I aggressively mute anyone who brings political tweets in my feed. I disabled notifications from most apps. I set up content blocker extensions so I don&#x27;t accidentally wander to sites I don&#x27;t want to visit. When I visit YouTube, I intentionally focus on the task at hand and try to not let the algorithm distract me (which is hard, because their recommendations almost always resonate with me). It works &quot;okay&quot;, but I still didn&#x27;t break the habit and I need strong self-control.<p>I see it also with my mother and sister, they are approx 60 and 35. They never get bored of scrolling through their feeds, they can&#x27;t focus on anything else. They also often feel bad because their lives don&#x27;t match what they see on the web. They make up a persona online that don&#x27;t match their reality (which I see).<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for banning these things for adults, but I&#x27;d raise this issue to the people who read my comment: most adults behave very similarly to children, so observe your behavior and adapt.')
