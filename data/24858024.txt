If you didn&#x27;t, your universe would break. Depending on the postulated mechanisms of action, the principles behind the magical invention will have vastly different impact on societies.<p>For example, it matters <i>how</i> is it the ships can casually sustain a 1G burn for a week at a time. If it&#x27;s efficient nuclear fusion, then the ships get bulky, energy is no longer a problem in the society at large, and the exhaust of said engine is a weapon of mass destruction. If it&#x27;s subspace field shenanigans, then aforementioned impacts don&#x27;t necessarily apply, but there is an open question of how small such subspace field combobulators can get, and what else could you do with them.<p>Technologies have second-order consequences, and societies shape to accommodate them. Half the fun of science fiction is in exploring those.<p>If you just call it magic and define it by a set of arbitrary rules, then your fictional universe will look shallow and inconsistent.')
