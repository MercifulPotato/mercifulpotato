And how much of that genocide was preceded of much hate speech? (how much were the free speech protections a factor in said genocide)<p>I think you may be right that ethnic genocide alone may not be enough to change a whole population&#x27;s opinions around free speech rights, that there may be additional factors required such as general awareness of how bad it was to engage in such acts and what contributed to those acts.')
