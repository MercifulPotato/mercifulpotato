This is why we must not fall for this &quot;critical social infrastructure&quot; trap. No one company deserves our business. We can and should go elsewhere.<p>I don&#x27;t think you realize it&#x27;s basically a privilege to be able to change your ISP. I have two options and have switched last month - it took three months of figuring out who should fix broken fiber (look at me, I have FTTH, another privilege).<p>so if you say you can &#x27;simply switch&#x27; your ISP, you&#x27;re in a lucky place.')
