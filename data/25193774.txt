Item(by='ed25519FUUU', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606178042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190668, text='&gt; <i>A grand jury has issued a pair of indictments accusing Apple’s head of global security, two high-ranking officials from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and a local business owner of exchanging bribes for concealed gun permits.</i><p>Hah! There actually isn&#x27;t any <i>other</i> way to get a CCW permit in most of Northern California, let alone Santa Clara County. It&#x27;s basically a racket under the guise of gun control. See this article from last year[1] and this youtuber[2] who tried to chronicle the process.<p>&gt; <i>The Santa Clara County sheriff’s system for granting concealed weapons permits is so inconsistent — and the record-keeping so fragmented — that it is difficult to discern any public-safety rationale behind a process the District Attorney’s Office is investigating over allegations of political favoritism.</i><p>To apply for a CCW you need to show your life is in <i>immediate</i> and <i>credible</i> danger, and then wait... months for a permit approval that will probably never come. This state loves to make law-breakers out of good citizens. I&#x27;m really glad they&#x27;re cracking down on the process, but it&#x27;s the STATE and COUNTY LAW THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE! Not sending a few scabs to jail for playing the game they created.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;spotty-records-may-hinder-das-investigation-into-how-santa-clara-county-grants-concealed-gun-permits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;spotty-records-may-hi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-wRgjsSHaGE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-wRgjsSHaGE</a>')
