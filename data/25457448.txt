She does the standard pawing at the door of a room she wants to enter. She then began pawing at her food bowl when she wants food. It now seems like she has started experimenting by pawing at other random objects, then watching for a reaction to see what we do. When we forget to take her down from the bed (she’s scared to jump off), she’ll do a distinct little gruff bark as if to say, “Hey! Come get me!” She now uses a similar bark to tell us when she wants us to remove her little sweaters hahaha')
