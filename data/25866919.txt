There are half-dozen source ports that are still under active development - some of them have fairly high system requirements in terms of CPU&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;RAM for advanced graphical features, but they’re generally much smaller than 2GB in size. e.g. GZDoom is 16 MB, not including the game assets.')
