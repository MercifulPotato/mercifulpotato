Item(by='nashashmi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602704004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777268, text='There was a previous article posted on HN about a new record being set for speed of sound.  The medium that transmitted the sound was high-pressure hydrogen.  I don&#x27;t know what rabbit hole I stepped into, but it let me to an article about solid hydrogen acting as a metal and becoming an awesome super conductor at room temperature.<p>I thought we had reached this record with solid hydrogen.  But I cannot find this online anywhere.  The material this article goes over is hydrogen-carbon-sulfide.  The previous record for superconductivity was using hydrogen-sulfide.<p>I wonder what other materials can be added to lower pressure at room temperature and maintain superconductivity.  Lithium? Nickel? Copper?')
