I am in NYC and read my lease break to see if I could brake it. Im from europe and this clause looks like illegal in my country but I guess USA is on a whole other level... If I move I could end up paying 1200$+ double rent for months...<p>&quot;In the event the lease is broken during the middle of the term, and the applicant did\nnot pay a year up front due at lease signing, the lease break fee is $1,200.00 made\npayable to the Shareholder. The penalty fee is charged by the coop board to the\nShareholder due to the lease break.
