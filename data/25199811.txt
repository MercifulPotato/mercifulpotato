I just purchased an Xbox One and subscribed to their Netflix style buffet service for digital games.  Game sizes range from 20-100GB. I&#x27;ve had to resort to only downloading 2-3 smaller games because my household already gets pretty close to our terabyte quota every month. These gamerpass services aren&#x27;t nearly as great if you&#x27;re limited to downloading a single game a month.')
