I have never used magic links before but want to try it with this project. My project is kind of marketplace where user is supposed to place an ad and come back maybe next next few days or a week and close the ad. Then he might not come back in months or years.<p>So I think for this kind of project where the user needs to authenticate himself one off and then maybe come back months later to log in again magic link suites well.')
