Then they can argue it was about finances, not personal. They offer a decent severance that requires the employee to sign an agreement that requires, in part, they don&#x27;t sue.<p>The word &quot;fired&quot; often is reserved for terminating someone for cause, where you really broke the rules and get no severance, not even the two weeks minimum that is customary. Non-performers usually aren&#x27;t treated this way. I&#x27;m not sure this is really what happened in this story.')
