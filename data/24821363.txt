There&#x27;s a part of me that wants to take this idea of biochar seedballs to support reforestation elsewhere. I live in the PNW, and it would be really interesting to see what it would take to convert lumber scrap&#x2F;timber waste into biochar&#x2F;syngas, produce energy from the syngas, and use the biochar to support planting trees (and possibly sequester some of it as well.)')
