Similarly, the New York Police Department arrested more than 3,000 people using facial recognition technology<p>Excellent use of technology to arrest rioters<p>&gt; According to the ACLU, the pervasive and precise surveillance system built in Baltimore<p>Does the ACLU even have any credibility left? Left....oops :-)<p>&gt; Researchers would like to think that their work in AI or robotics can be separated from politics of the moment. They are wrong.<p>Please explain why they are wrong....oh you didn&#x27;t, just skipped that part.<p>&gt; However, the surveillance systems built by police in New York, Baltimore, and Minneapolis are not isolated examples of excessive policing<p>How is using technology like A.I. to apprehend criminals, rioters etc, excessive policing? If you look at how we use technology today in our daily lives and places of work, that could also be said to be excessive. Does the OP want the police to go back to pre-computer days of mountains of paper work and inefficiency?<p>&gt; ... expanding surveillance apparatus that is granting law enforcement unprecedented powers to watch, search, and seize the sensitive data of American citizens without a warrant or even suspicion of a crime.<p>Well, you actually have to vote in congressional elections to make a change in the system in your state, but citizens of the US of A don&#x27;t like voting. Anywhere between 21% to 61% depending upon the state. Guess you better vote next time and get your senator to not endorse these types of data collections.<p>&gt; State, local, and national police have access to more than 20 databases that cover a person&#x27;s criminal history and his or her interactions with the state (e.g., drivers licenses) to build a “pattern of life” of the targeted individual, who may or may not have committed a crime.<p>So the OP thinks that there should be no data correlation between different datasets for any person?<p>The OP&#x27;s article is an exhausting mess of emotive statements with no facts to back them up. This article could have been something, but it is really just a rant.<p>Waiting for the lefties to vote me down because i don&#x27;t have a problem with the police doing police work and catching criminals.')
