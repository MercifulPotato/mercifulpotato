If they were posting corrections like this daily or weekly, then you could argue for EAFP. But your comment implies that they do zero vetting and just publish whatever they want. It completely misses the nuance that &quot;getting permission&quot; isn&#x27;t a black and white issue. It&#x27;s a spectrum and you&#x27;re rarely ever at 100%. You sometimes gotta make the call to publish a story at 95% or so, and in rare occasions it just turns out to not go your way.<p>You&#x27;re implying that they should never post a story unless they are 100% certain, which means most stories would never get published, defeating the entire point of journalism. Obviously the threshold needs to be high, you don&#x27;t want to post every single rumor, but just because they have 1 or 2 correction a year does not mean &quot;they&#x27;d rather ask for forgiveness than get permission&quot;.')
