This allowed the intruders to “replace source code files during the build process, before compilation,” Crowdstrike wrote.\n\n    The attackers also included safeguards to prevent the backdoor code lines from appearing in Orion software build logs, and checks to ensure that such tampering wouldn’t cause build errors.\n\n    “The design of SUNSPOT suggests [the malware] developers invested a lot of effort to ensure the code was properly inserted and remained undetected, and prioritized operational security to avoid revealing their presence in the build environment to SolarWinds developers,” CrowdStrike wrote.\n</code></pre>\nSo how do we guard against this type of attack? How do we know this hasn&#x27;t already happened to some of us? What is the potential fallout from this hack, it seems quite significant.<p>This must be why the Japanese Intelligence agencies prefer paper over computer systems. The digitization of critical national security apparatus is the Archilles Heel that is being exploited successfully. One example is Japan&#x27;s intelligence gathering capabilities in East Asia, especially China, which is bar none. Japan has a better linguistic understanding of the Chinese language (Kanji and all) but also interestingly much of PRC&#x27;s massive public surveillance equipment like CCTV cameras are made in Japan.<p>Even if they hire Krebs, I believe that if its digital, it can be hacked given long enough time period and unlimited state level backing and head hunting essentially geniuses of their country to do their bidding. I wonder how Biden-Harris administration will respond, it is very clear who the state actor is here. I&#x27;m very nervous about the ramifications of this hack.')
