Because just like Galileo it&#x27;s a culturally normative thing to hate on gay sex back then just like hating on solar centrism was. And I think a lot of the other prejudices against far out ideas are going to be these bullshit culturally normative bigoted biases that turn out to be incorrect. Just like the blanket Western cultural bias against tcm. almost just like the marijuana thing...you know &quot;marijuana turns you into the devil and makes you crazy&quot;... &quot;gay sex is morally wrong.&quot;  All of this bullshit kind of was eventually overturned in the tide of public opinion but at the time people were so certain (just like witchcraft) you know that there was a reality to their demonization.<p>So no, won&#x27;t rewrite nor retract. Is important to keep it in to reinforce how relative alot of this is.<p>I think you probably got upset by assuming I was associating gay sex with some sort of absolute measurable moral position. Hopefully what I said has reassed you that&#x27;s not the case and let you feel better about it.<p>Btw good point about crank aspects not tainting the whole. Maybe sometimes what we think of as crank is simply undiscovered science. Maybe Newton would have had a better theory if he knew something more about nuclear transmutation.<p>I think there&#x27;s a spectrum of these crank things though some stuff like flat Earth come on that has to be false.<p>But i think we should be giving more due, and less crank, to people like Hancock.. i know it&#x27;s a personal thing tho, how your feel about a particular person. I just don&#x27;t like to see a groupthink pile on, from any group.')
