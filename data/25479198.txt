Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608399372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478333, text='&gt; Maybe a percentage will, but I think when people are trying to guess and assume what these people will do as &quot;rational economic agents&quot;, they miss the human factors. No one is going to pick where they go to college based on the taxes on the ultra-rich unless they are obsessed with money. Once rich, are you going to uproot yourself entirely from any family, friends, and connections in the US? You have to consider that rational economic behavior still has to consider what the point of it all is, and money for the sake of money doesn&#x27;t tend to be the answer even among the hyper-rich.<p>I think this is probably true once someone has a career and a family, but the college part doesn&#x27;t pass the sniff test for me. the &quot;just graduated college&quot; group is probably the most mobile slice of the overall population. especially if you chose a college away from your hometown, you are pretty likely to either move back home or pursue a career somewhere else entirely at the end. I think other folks are also more mobile than you give them credit for. unless they currently have children in school, I find people are pretty likely to move if they see an opportunity for a significantly better combo of salary&#x2F;COL&#x2F;taxes.')
