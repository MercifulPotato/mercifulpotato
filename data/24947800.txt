In that case, the other roads can be completely starved, so a 6-way stop would have been better for those roads in those times.<p>As for t-boning, you can definitely have someone enter a roundabout early&#x2F;late and hit another car on the side, or dart in front of a car that&#x27;s in the roundabout (especially possible if the roundabout is not perfectly circular) and themselves get hit on the side.<p>And people manage to go &quot;out of turn&quot; in roundabouts all the time, by not yielding, or by tailgating.')
