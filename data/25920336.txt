Plex they focused on a single headend unit to do decode&#x2F;re-encode of data and many simple devices running a client GUI.  The head end controls the metadata.  KODI on the other hand has stalled out on the headend bits but added in full on emulation via libretro a couple of years ago.  So each KODI instances is complete thing.  Unless you add in something like mariadb.  In many ways Plex is &#x27;better&#x27; (streaming, support), in many ways KODI is &#x27;better&#x27; (better skinning, bluray ISO playback, etc).  Ease of use is about equal between the two (again not surprising their shared history).<p>I would like to use Plex for streaming but it does not support my particular set of media use cases (ISO files).  That may have changed but I gave up waiting years ago.')
