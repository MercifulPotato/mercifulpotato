If you use the same stone from similar quarries and stick to a faithful reproduction that might be a good experience. Otherwise imagine McMansion levels of construction quality to rebuild the colosseum. That would be disgusting. Also visiting ruins is an amazing experience. You can touch stones that were put in place by humans <i>millenia</i> ago. If that doesn’t stir something in you then you’re a different kind of person than me.')
