Given that most people are working from home now, and the fact that the new MacBook Pro is virtually identical physically to what I got four years ago, I&#x27;m actually considering just getting the Mac mini to save about CAD $1,000. I also have a 12&quot; MacBook which I adore, and so the times I do need something portable, it doesn&#x27;t get more portable than that. (And it&#x27;s surprisingly capable for my dev environment.)')
