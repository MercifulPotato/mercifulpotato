It&#x27;s very clear that most people in the US do not think socialized &#x2F; public healthcare is tantamount to Communism.<p>The US is left leaning compared to the majority of all nations.<p>Besides that, the US is far more progressive than eg Europe in many respects (and that&#x27;s ignoring parts of Europe still ruled by actual fascism and dictatorship, countries where it&#x27;s perfectly legal to beat your wife if you so choose and being gay is practically a crime). In the majority of Europe gay marriage is still illegal. How much more regressive and backwards can you get? The US is at least a decade ahead of Europe when it comes to gay rights and identity &#x2F; gender matters.<p>In Denmark they&#x27;re committing vast human rights violations against minority Muslims while the world looks the other way. Is that left by US standards? I don&#x27;t see the US forcing cultural eradication upon Muslims or taking their children away from them and indoctrinating them with nationalistic propaganda.<p>Across Western Europe de facto Neo Nazi parties hold immense political power.<p>In France Macron has practically declared open cultural war against Muslims.<p>Formerly open immigration nations like Sweden have become hyper xenophobic and have locked down access. Neo Nazism is rampant in Germany and so is xenophobia. Meanwhile the US is one of the few affluent nations on the planet that still welcomes the poor and the non-skilled, you don&#x27;t need to be rich or successful to immigrate into the US (and that&#x27;s before Biden&#x27;s Presidency begins, in which the Democrats will dramatically liberalize immigration).<p>Progressiveness is vanishing from Europe, while the US is becoming more progressive by the decade. So where are all these nations around the world that are a lot further left than the US? There are maybe a dozen, tops.<p>The US now spends more on its welfare state as a share of its economy than either Canada or Australia. In the next 10-15 years it&#x27;ll catch up to Britain on that point.<p>The US is also progressing much faster on drug decriminalization and legalization than Europe is. And half of Europe is guaranteed to remain backwards, regressive, on all of the previously mentioned items.')
