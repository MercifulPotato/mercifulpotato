Where there&#x27;s a primary state funded&#x2F;owned&#x2F;operated&#x2F;mandated provider&#x2F;option. Which sort of helps with keeping a ceiling on prices.<p>But at the same time youth unemployment was (and probably still is) very high, despite easy access to higher education. US unemployment rates reached its low point before covid19 probably because so much is tied to employment and there are so few restrictions on hiring and firing folks compared to some &quot;average&#x2F;median&quot; EU jurisdiction.<p>Then of course there are very real far right parties with power too, so yeah, it&#x27;s a lot less true that US Dems are so right of Europe politics. While at the same time a very authoritarian group runs the current US federal show, with a very real chance of that continuing, which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t help with the polarization of politics.')
