It can&#x27;t prove _anything_ about who actually sent it, because it can&#x27;t guarantee the ownership of the email account.<p>Not on it&#x27;s own, but it&#x27;s a critical step in this chain:<p>1. DKIM verifies that a message was sent by Gmail.<p>2. We assume Gmail is careful with its keys.<p>3. We assume Gmail doesn&#x27;t forge addresses.<p>4. Find evidence that links me to that address.<p>Most people will readily grant #2 and #3.  Now we just need #4, which can be easy.<p>No, it&#x27;s not cryptographically verified end-to-end, but it&#x27;s good enough to convince a court or to convince a respectable news organization to run a story.')
