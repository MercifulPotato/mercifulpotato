I started a new job (software engineering again) at the start of the pandemic. I feel like I burned a bridge with my manager prior to leaving so ... I won&#x27;t be able to return to that company in the future.<p>Haven&#x27;t really spoken to anyone outside of work (tiny company, too) since March. Left to my own devices at work. Haven&#x27;t seen anyone in person since April.<p>Spend most of my days online and alone. Attempted suicide over the summer. Not eating much, rapidly losing weight.<p>It&#x27;s my birthday in a few weeks and most days, I don&#x27;t want to live to see it.')
