The person you&#x27;re replying to describes a great methodology for smaller projects, but in many cases there are great reasons to take on dependencies. Not taking a dependency means you pay in person-hours to reinvent it, and sometimes that cost is much higher than a couple extra seconds of build time.<p>And, once you have a lot of dependencies, ES modules won&#x27;t save you. People expect web apps to load <i>fast</i>, and code is big. Things like Webpack help make it a lot smaller.<p>My point isn&#x27;t that this is <i>good</i>, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s not &quot;indefensible&quot;. There are very real practical reasons that big companies deal with the debt of dependencies and bundlers.')
