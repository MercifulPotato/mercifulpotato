There are also other things that are very difficult to get to work for math papers in HTML (even with conversions) such complex TikZ and other diagrams. Also, HTML rendering is still pretty ugly compared to LaTeX PDFs because LaTeX has a much better typesetting engine including hyphenation. With subtle changes meaning huge semantic differences in math diagrams, I still much prefer to read PDFs.')
