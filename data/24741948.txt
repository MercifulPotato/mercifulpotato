Eight years of Obama was enough for the racist cancer in the heart of American culture to finally metastasize and start to consume the body politic.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that Donald Trump basically shares many of those extremists&#x27; beliefs, prejudices and conspiratorial mindset (he&#x27;s the man who made birtherism a thing,) and so does nothing but fan the flames and grant them an air of legitimacy.
