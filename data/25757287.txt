That said, when I use accounting software, it&#x27;s pretty obvious to me that I am going to be sharing my transaction history with the accounting software. When I connect my bank account to Venmo, it is absolutely not obvious to me that I&#x27;m sharing my entire transaction history with Plaid. Replicating the appearance of my bank&#x27;s login screens is critical to the illusion.<p>Even if I did understand that they are storing and using my credentials, I should be able to expect from a reputable business that they are not scraping irrelevant transaction data and then using it for purposes that don&#x27;t explicitly support the app I am using. Selling my transaction history <i>definitely</i> isn&#x27;t supporting the use case I&#x27;m authorizing.')
