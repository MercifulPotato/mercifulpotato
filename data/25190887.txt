It&#x27;s not healthy to be indulging in &quot;fakeness&quot; and it definitely lowers your mental health. During my breaks, i like to indulge in other hobbies that I know bring me joy (like gardening, cross-stiching, and painting). the first couple times i did have FOMO. to deal with this i called up my true friends, actually had meaningful convos with them! Social media has its pros and cons, but if you aren&#x27;t careful and realize its harmful effects, it can be such a cruel technology.')
