I can see how that would get annoying.<p>I guess I&#x27;ve been lucky in that all the microwaves I&#x27;ve had over the last couple of decades, and the ones we had at work, do not show the time unless you&#x27;ve set it. My current one, which has 7 segment LEDs for the time digits, blanks all the digits, leaving just the colons. My prior one showed &quot;--:--&quot; if time was not set. The one before that had a graphical display and just showed blank where the time would normally go.')
