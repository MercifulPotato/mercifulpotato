Without knowing your specific gripes, it&#x27;s hard no know what&#x27;ll end up helping you, but here are my two cents:<p>- use emacsclient and have aliases for emacsclient -c and and emacsclient -n for popping up a new frame or using the console, respectively. I even have a window manager binding to open a new Emacs client window<p>- Rainer KÃ¶nig is the best at getting across org mode workflows. if you like watching nerdy videos, go watch him.<p>- keep vim around, I still use it, sometimes, but with no or veery minimal config.<p>- centaur tabs and the new tab stuff can help vim people who like tabs. I just got used to buffers.<p>- M-x is really Emacs&#x27; primary UI. don&#x27;t try to think of a million and one key bindings up front, just bind what you find yourself using M-x a lot for. You just need a nice completing read like ivy, helm or so, but doom has that.<p>- use magit. While many claim that org-mode is the Emacs killer feature, I&#x27;d say magit is even more important if you code. There simply is no better git interface, nothing comes close. You think git the new porcelain is cool? Magit is a git jacuzzi.')
