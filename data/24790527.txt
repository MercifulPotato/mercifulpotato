Or putting in many more hours than others.<p>I think I do both!  I&#x27;m extremely charismatic but imo not that bright so coast on personality but sometimes fall back on working lots of hours.<p>My charisma story is that I was very naturally attractive but then had an accident and gained a large % of bodyweight while bedridden for over six months.  When I came back into the real world I sort of got forced to improve my personality because I could no longer coast on looks!')
