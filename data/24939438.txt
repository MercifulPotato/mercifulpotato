You start with a good quality roast, pre-ground is fine, because average grind size is medium to coarse, which is a good general size (esp. if you don&#x27;t wanna over-extract).<p>For a brew method, immersion brewing (like an aeropress) is uncomplicated, fast and can make larger batches at once. Brew at ~205F for 2 minutes, extract gently, and add water if it tastes too strong. You can use that method to make a large batch at once and keep it in a thermos, or make coldbrew and then warm it up to ~160F. No need for a scale or constantly grinding the coffee, and you don&#x27;t end up with a single lukewarm cup of pour-over.<p>For &quot;fancy&quot; coffee you can do the same, except instead of adding water you can add frothed hot 2% milk. And if you really just want a &quot;coffee ritual&quot;: clean everything of old coffee residue, filter the water, bloom the coffee before brewing, wet the filter before extraction, and get your coffee:water ratio, temperature, and extraction time to match the roast. All of that and no hardware besides an aeropress.')
