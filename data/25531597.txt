It prefers to sell more rather than do proper targeting. The traffic swap was an old black-hat trick used by ad network affiliates even before 2000 (they used to push pop-under traffic as SEO traffic, for example). Just cheating.<p>It&#x27;s not right to judge ML by the quality of recommender systems. First of all, recommenders are just a small corner of ML, and on this scale are only developed at few companies. Second, I am not 100% sure they maximize what you want to see, instead they maximize what will make them more money. That&#x27;s why it sucks.')
