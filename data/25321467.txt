People in Sweden and Finland pay a lot more taxes. They pay thousands of dollars more every year, even when they don’t get sick. Median after-tax disposable income, according to the OECD, is $14,000-16,000&#x2F;year more in the US than Finland or Sweden.<p>Now, of course, Americans spend a significant part of that difference on deductibles, premiums, etc. But in most states it’s a few thousand dollars a year on average. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2019&#x2F;may&#x2F;how-much-us-households-employer-insurance-spend-premiums-out-of-pocket" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2...</a>')
