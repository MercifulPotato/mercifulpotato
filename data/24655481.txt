She WAS talking. The professor didn&#x27;t watch the flagged video, though.<p>Proctoring software doesn&#x27;t say &quot;fail&quot;. It just flags parts of the video for human review. Shitty teachers should be blamed.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the hatred for such software. The alternative would be to take exams at testing centers or campuses.<p>Personal real world experience (I&#x27;m an OMSCS student): I was taking a ProctorTrack-proctored exam in a company meeting room. A colleague of mine hadn&#x27;t read the company chat where I told I was not to be disturbed, and knocks on the door multiple times. I had to tell him to go away.<p>After the exam, I immediately contacted my teachers explaining what happened. Zero problems.<p>Another time, after starting the exam I realized I was in a bad body position (3-hours exam, I was in bed since the bedroom was the least cluttered room) and my back was hurting. I changed position by trying to keep my face in the webcam at all times (but for sure I failed for some seconds) , and again I contacted my teachers afterwards. Zero problems.<p>I&#x27;m sure my video was flagged both times.')
