A big one for me is left turn lanes. Often there are 2 left turn lanes (let&#x27;s call them A and B) and they turn into 3 lanes on the other road (let&#x27;s call them X, Y, Z) and it&#x27;s not obvious whether A-&gt;X, B-&gt;Y, or A-&gt;Y, B-&gt;Z. I&#x27;ve seen many cases of both instances. They really should paint down colored lanes or something to make it unambiguous.')
