Is there a tutorial to help acquire the necessary math&#x2F;background knowledge to be able to comprehend what&#x27;s being modeled?<p>For example, what are &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;d&quot;?<p>Also &quot;Type I&quot; and &quot;Type II&quot; errors?

Or would this require significant learning i.e. a full semester course or a textbook.')
