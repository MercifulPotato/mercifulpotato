We&#x27;re still early in our journey so we’re not there yet, but we’re moving fast. We&#x27;re working on a new collaborative UI for interacting with your data in a way that solves a lot of problems we&#x27;ve witnessed with current monitoring UIs (let me know if you want more detail). It&#x27;s in early development and we haven&#x27;t released it yet, so while Opstrace does have a UI now, it&#x27;s currently limited to system management (adding&#x2F;removing users and tenants). For interacting with data, we currently ship a Grafana instance per tenant. The roadmap has some basic information about this (might not be something you stumbled across). Let me know if I can clarify anything else. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;references&#x2F;roadmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;references&#x2F;roadmap</a>')
