I would amplify it a bit and say talk to real humans in real life (not through a screen).  Be a good neighbor, smile and greet people, help strangers.  It sounds trite, but I think its the best path. A persons physical community is more important that twitter (or HN for that matter).  Culture is made from the choices and shared knowledge of individuals.  Being open to others is a prerequisite to influencing change.  Accepting imperfections and poor decissions in others is a prerequisite to improving things. I don&#x27;t see a magical switch that can be flipped to suddenly change a culture, nor do I see secret cabals controling us from the shadows, so no help from the illuminati or whatever..  It&#x27;s the choices we make and the views we hold about our fellow citizens, and those are better in real-life than on-screen.')
