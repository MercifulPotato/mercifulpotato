I hope Elon takes his security as seriously as he does batteries and rocket nozzles. If he left the helm the intellectual and visionary capital of Tesla might not change much, but the social and financial capital would drop fast and far. I kind of hope he watches too many Bond movies and decides to seal himself in a hidden lair and run things from there.<p>But Apple is still Apple after Jobs.
