I wanted to focus on the e-book variant first.<p>While this is not necessarily an argument against a printed version, note that this book works best when reading on a computer. It comes with the full source code bundle and a small utility that allows to execute all code examples interactively.<p>Also, it is likely that there will be updates to the book in the near future. I&#x27;m already considering to write an appendix. By exclusively providing an e-book, iterative improvements are easier to do and the readers get all updates for free.<p>Nevertheless, I may consider to offer a printed version later on.')
