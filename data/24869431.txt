The engineer arrived early this morning, and immediately set about finishing the copper run from several poles away to us. Before long he was back at our door to handle the internal wiring, which he quickly noted had an unnecessary route bridge (I don&#x27;t know what this means, but it relates to internal copper wiring), which was degrading the signal. After the fix, he got us up and running at just under 30Mb&#x2F;s (7Mb&#x2F;s upload) - not stellar, but this will do until our longer term plans come to fruition (a joint FTTPoD order with many of our neighbours, using the Government&#x27;s DCMS Gigabit Voucher Scheme to bring us 900Mb&#x2F;s full-fibre).<p>My family and I are extremely grateful to Clive Selley and his team for taking a personal interest in our case, and local MP Cheryl Gillian&#x27;s staff for playing their part. (sadly there was no response from Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch.)<p>The engineer who ultimately got us connected today told me he was in the process of studying for a masters in Nuclear Engineering, and I wish him the very best in that endeavour!')
