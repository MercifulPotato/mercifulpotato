Item(by='tathougies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605054702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053665, text='&gt; The implication of working coronavirus vaccine by end of October was that it would be available for use (you can find quotes from the Trump administration saying they were working on distribution of hundreds of millions of doses by the end of the month), not that there would be a preliminary report from a still ongoing trial indicating that the vaccine works.<p>Trump said there would be news of a vaccine. Obviously, it won&#x27;t be available by November. If you listened to Trump or Pence, you&#x27;d know that the US arranged for a working vaccine to be delivered by December or January, not November.<p>&gt; The question was whether it led to improper behavior on the part of Joe Biden. That email proves nothing. It&#x27;s entirely plausible that Hunter Biden got this guy an invite to some social function where shook hands with the Vice President.<p>And indeed, that would actually make Joe Biden&#x27;s claim that he had no involvement with his son&#x27;s business dealings a lie. Biden could have been honest and said, I met a few of my son&#x27;s friends but we never discussed business. However, he didn&#x27;t. He unequivocally stated that he had absolutely no knowledge of his son&#x27;s business dealings and had no interaction with anyone from Burisima. That is a lie.<p>&gt; The prosecutor was fired for not investigating the company that hired Hunter Biden.<p>Then why did the new prosecutor immediately drop charges and investigations against Burisima? if this was the reason he was fired and replaced, shouldn&#x27;t the new prosecutor then take up the charges?<p>Sorry for the late reply.
