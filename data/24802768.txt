Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=[24803803], score=None, time=1602867916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800758, text='&gt; What would be strategies in case of Kickstarter campaign will fail?<p>I think you chose the wrong goal here.<p>I don&#x27;t think you really want a one-time, lump sum donation to &quot;unlock&quot; your code under a FOSS license.<p>I would think you want regular, recurring payments to keep you in the job of writing the code that pushes the project forward.<p>Judging from the cron job of &quot;Electron-so-fat&quot; posts here on HN, there may be an audience for that. And judging from the fact that you&#x27;ve already raised close to $10,000 to unlock the initial code, unlocking code may be a sufficient incentive to get that audience to pay you to do the work.<p>But to keep that number up for recurring payments I think you&#x27;ve got to keep on the &quot;Farmville&quot; route, at least if you want to get paid anywhere near the going rate. That is, there needs to be a risk not only that you abandon the project if you don&#x27;t get paid, but something the audience cares about will quickly die if the payment goals aren&#x27;t met. You&#x27;re kind of doing that here with the MIT license being a kind of &quot;stretch&quot; goal, but I think you could do it more effectively on a recurring basis with the code itself.<p>AFAICT you can achieve the following approach with either choice of the MIT or GPL (either version). That is:<p>1. you work on the next feature in private<p>2. get it ready for a release<p>3. release a video of you demo&#x27;ing the feature<p>4. if your recurring payment goal gets met for this period, you commit the feature to the public repo<p>5. if not, you delete it<p>This complies with both licenses-- there is no requirement in either to share the source code for a binary that you haven&#x27;t released yet.<p>I will admit it is seems strange, as there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll have to delete useful code if the goals aren&#x27;t met. But if you don&#x27;t take that approach you risk continuing to develop a project for an audience that isn&#x27;t willing to pay the going rate. That, and the burnout that it causes, is a much bigger problem than my suggested approach could ever be.<p>Besides, this is how most businesses work anyway. No drive through is handing out the food first and collecting the money second.')
