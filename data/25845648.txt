I was a little low few years ago (I tested because after reading pseudoscience research I wanted to know) but since building this into my routine my levels are back to normal. N Taleb wrote about it and I was a bit skeptical but then thought why not give it a try it&#x27;s free and will not hurt (or make some quack rich).<p><i>&gt; whereas very simple things such as what time of year one is born in is actually a more telling factor</i><p>interesting. I wonder if this might have to do with school starting in autumn and kids born in autumn might then be more likely to start the year after - instead pushing themselves in for an early start this very year when they&#x27;re legally able to start school. it would be obvious if kids that are actually a year older then the classmates had more time to be ready for school than their peers. Otherwise it would also be interesting to see this repeated in the Southern hemisphere where autumn is actually spring.<p>Many Japanese I know would laugh at Astrology but are 100% convinced that blood-type affects personality.')
