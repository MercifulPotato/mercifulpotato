A fan of some book? Search for it on Altavista and you likely found some kind of fan site which had a little bulletin board community organized around it. Or maybe a usenet group. A few minutes down the road you were talking to strangers on the other side of the planet about something you were all actively interested in. Hell, even radio stations had their own chat rooms and forums. Many free software tools had dedicated IRC channels. Mailing lists and usenet groups abound.<p>These communities were all <i>interest based</i>, and there were sooooo many of them. Because they were interest based, they mostly attracted people who at least had something in common with you, which made it easy to relate to them. And because people are not onedimensional, they were often part of many different communities. Which, aside from being fun, was also a great way to learn how to interact with people all over the world.<p>Sure, flame wars were a thing, and I&#x27;m sure people were bullied and whatnot. Community moderation worked pretty well, though (as someone who administered a 10k+ members forum) it could be a lot of work. But no one ever damaged their mental health by frequenting a knitting forum.<p>Facebook pretty much destroyed all of these (or at least decimated them). Perhaps these groups are still around, but it&#x27;s now actively hard to find them. FB does not foster a sense of community. It&#x27;s not a platform where you will learn anything about any topic. It&#x27;s not an environment that&#x27;s conducive to improving personal interactions. It attempted to centralize those things, and it failed. Instead of paying attention to things that interest us, we now have FB and its ilk begging us to please pay attention to their garbage. I miss actual communities, warts and all, and I think that young people&#x27;s mental health would be better off if they made a return.<p>Final note: yes, there are exceptions, I know it&#x27;s not all quite as bad as I&#x27;m dramatizing here.')
