They’re essentially turning on and&#x2F;or ramping up the existing self-regulation mechanism of the immune system. I’ve only read the abstract, but what I’m not sure about is their selective delivery&#x2F;targeting method, as that seems the hardest part. The various regulatory pathways cells are fairly well studied for most AI conditions and the mRNA sequences for their associated receptors could be programmed readily as I understand the technology.<p>However, if it does work in humans it’ll be a <i>huge</i> leap forward for treatment of auto immune diseases. Perhaps long term, even inflammatory issues like arterial plaque, which we’re slowly realizing is formed by chronic inflammation as much as by high cholesterol. Alzheimer’s May also be largely driven by incorrect immune responses too.<p>I suspect the challenge will be long term mRNA suitability, e.g. if the mRNA delivery mechanisms will develop immune reactions of their own. The cost of delivering the mRNA treatments could be large too. Biologics for autoimmune conditions require self administered shots too, but don’t require deep freezer cold. Also it could increase long term cancer risks by over stimulating self-regulatory pathways.<p>Not sure if the full article mentions if it’s a one time shot or on going. I’m presuming ongoing dice mRNA will degrade.')
