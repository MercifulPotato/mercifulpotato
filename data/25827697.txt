Babies are gona happen.  When they do, they should be fully supported as much as necessary to make sure parents and children get what they need at a base level.  I don&#x27;t mind my taxes paying for baby formula and diapers.  We should probably fund daycare too.  This is that &#x27;equality of opportunity&#x27; conservatives are so fond of in place of &#x27;equality of outcomes&#x27;.  Well, if that&#x27;s true, at the very least we need to make sure that everyone gets the bare essentials to properly raise a child.')
