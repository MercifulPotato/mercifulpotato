Also the lack of libraries really hurts when it comes to even basics like queue and database interactions. Many times there&#x27;s a few libraries that are all half finished. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really like Haskell a lot, I just find that F# brings a lot of well-thought out compromise between Haskell and the wealth of libraries in .NET for production code. If it was my money in my startup, I&#x27;d have no qualms betting on F# to get me to market as soon as possible. If it was my personal OSS project that I work on for personal edification and enrichment, I&#x27;d choose Haskell nearly every time.')
