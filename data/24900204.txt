A new drug may help or it may harm.<p>If the drug turns out to harm people, a healthy person may be able to deal with it and recover. While a person that is barely hanging on to life may be pushed over the edge. There&#x27;s no data to support a new drug raises the survival rate. It may in fact lower it from low to zero. During testing you generally want to kill as few people as possible.<p>Once more data has been collected on the drug, then the balance starts to shift toward giving it to at risk groups.')
