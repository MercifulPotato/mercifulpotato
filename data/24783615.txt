There weren&#x27;t &quot;apps&quot; and web sites had not centralized themselves. And cost, speed and service coverage remained very limited. You couldn&#x27;t justify a data plan just for Mapquest when you could print it out at home. Most kids, myself included, wouldn&#x27;t be getting any phone for a few years yet. The mobile phone&#x27;s purpose in the 2000&#x27;s was served well with what was in feature phones: call, text, Snake, maybe email.<p>In contrast, the iPod, a rough contemporary with the Hiptop, addressed something more immediately compelling with a two-sided, integrated marketplace when paired with iTunes. There was a value proposition in that since not everyone was or wanted to be a savvy song pirate, and you could buy singles instead of albums. Internet speeds and access were ready for that use case.<p>Apple&#x27;s success at the time, both with iPod and with iPhone, rested on timing and quality of integration, which returns again to that which the article alludes - we have a lot of early-adopter developer services, and some of these are in a position to be more like an iPod&#x2F;iTunes. But I don&#x27;t think the article goes deep enough in recognizing that even the iPhone was capitalizing on underlying infrastructure developments to channel them through a specific product and service mix.')
