Lock-in becomes barrier to entry as the market becomes saturated. I’m not sure how many people feel that strongly about keeping long-term historical fitness data.<p>If the data creates powerful network effects in a way that results in a winner-take-all effect then in theory a monopoly could emerge even before market saturation. Is there a strong case for that?<p>App developers will want to create apps for devices that are popular, so that is an effect. Eventually enough apps could potentially create a barrier to entry, if “volume of apps” is the buying criteria.<p>But often the volume of apps is pretty irrelevant. Show a user a compelling experience with 10 mind-blowing apps and you can still compete against an App Store filled largely with trash.<p>In the end it’s a couple hundred dollar device you put on your wrist. There may be extremely compelling products that have large market share, but I’m just not seeing how that can become a <i>monopoly</i>.')
