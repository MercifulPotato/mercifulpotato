ZFS seems like it could be a good backend for this, but the general idea would be that you have “collections” of files, and you have disks. Many collections may fit onto one disk, or maybe one collection requires many disks to hold it. The exact mechanism of storage is abstracted away from you unless you specify it manually. And then, there is a mechanism for authoring and syncing removable media like hard disks or writeable DVDs to provide backup of these files. Bonus points if you don’t need to be able to store the full collection on your main drive in order to browse&#x2F;search.<p>Photos would be a good starting place for this, since they are easy to fingerprint.')
