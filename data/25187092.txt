For all the bullshit about connectedness, the basic physical human urge social media stimulates is for conflict.   \nAll the other things like sentimentality, status signalling, attention seeking, are parts of the underlying addiction to conflict because in a lot of hind-brains, that sensation  represents opportunity. It&#x27;s a vice.<p>Outright bans are clumsy, but imposing a cost or bar to entry, like most societies do with alcohol and drugs, might be constructive.<p>I&#x27;m tired of meeting friends and family in person and listening to them spend 20mins one-way unloading all the shit they read on the internet. They&#x27;re so indexed on things that aren&#x27;t physically present in the moment it&#x27;s like talking someone through a psychosis or reasoning with someone with schizophrenia. It&#x27;s a mass hysteria machine. When I talk to some people, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not even talking to people anymore, I&#x27;m talking to some node of the internet.  \nWe&#x27;ve basically invented language cancer, nice one guys.')
