I&#x27;m not sure anybody can speak to the intentions of the people that reported it with certainty.<p>Let&#x27;s stop the speculation on what pindab0ter would or would not agree with. Clearly you and I interpret their message in completely different ways, so unless they want to come back to clarify their statement, let&#x27;s just stop with the speculation.<p>&gt; Is that consistent with the thread? Are you arguing that the majority of CoC reports are outright lies? I thought this thread was about the use of CoC to enforce a code of behavior, and if stringent enforcement counts as misuse.<p>Look, you asked me to define &quot;weaponize&quot; within a specific context. So I gave you 2 examples: one where I thought use of the term would be appropriate, and one where I thought the term would not be appropriate. I was trying to answer your question about the definition of a word, that&#x27;s all. I have no idea what proportion of CoC reports are outright lies or half-truth motivated by hidden agendas.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t like that you&#x27;re trying to reframe OP&#x27;s experience as &quot;stringent enforcement&quot;. The case described in OP is clearly selective enforcement, which is pretty much the opposite of stringent.')
