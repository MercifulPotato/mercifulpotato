On the other hand, just every expert in this or that language will always have a counterargument for you and a solution to the problem. Because he IS an expert! The thing is, not all people are experts or even will be. Most people want a tool that doesn&#x27;t get in your way, easy to pick up and deliver the results. That is why Python is so popular despite being slow, inefficient and basically a glue for C&#x2F;C++ libraries. Hell, even for interfacing with C Python loses to Lua. But all these shortcomings didn&#x27;t matter in the end. Python2 â†’ Python3 didn&#x27;t kill the language either. I am afraid Scala&#x27;s error margin is not as big.')
