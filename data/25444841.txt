Coin yearly inflation is the metric people should be concerned about. BTC is less than 2%, whereas Ethereum is around 4% today. With PoS, this figure will drop to &lt;2%, so equivalent to Bitcoin. The whole &quot;ETH supply is infinite&quot; is such a lame argument. It&#x27;s not infinite, because your life isn&#x27;t infinite. It has a finite yearly inflation, just like Bitcoin.')
