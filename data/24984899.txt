Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604443465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983218, text='&gt; Would YouTube, Instagram, or dozens of other companies have been able to get where they are w&#x2F;o the support of their acquirers?<p>Yes if they got access to capital, which they could have gotten easily. You forget that Google bought Youtube because google video wasn&#x27;t gaining traction and youtube had the &quot;network effect&quot;. The same goes for instagram and facebook. It&#x27;s all &quot;whatif&quot; but youtube and instagram most definitely would have been major independent players by themselves.<p>Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon, etc were able to grow without being acquired. Remember that page&#x2F;brin even tried to sell Google to Yahoo. Google did alright even though they weren&#x27;t bought out.<p>Youtube and Instagram had no real peers like google did ( altavista, excite, etc ) and they both were able to create the network effect before they got bought out. I think google and facebook really got lucky snapping up these companies. Not just in financial benefits but look at the cultural impact these companies have on the world.')
