Nothing supports SSLv1 anymore. Telnet is (largely) a thing of the past. Yes these migrations can be painful, and place some burden on users to change their practices. I get that there are a large number of scripts out there which may need to be adapted to work in this new world - but how is that different to any API change? Major breaking changes like this are rare, because the cost to users is high, but even so I don&#x27;t recall seeing this insistence that things must _never_ change in, for example, glibc.')
