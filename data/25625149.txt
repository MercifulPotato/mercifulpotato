Seems like the perfect watch for a week at the beach, where you want to know about the sun but not be a slave to the minutes.<p>Some questions...<p>Why is it so thick?  (Guessing the double stacked batteries plus a movement?)  Any plans for lower profile V8?<p>I see some models are two batteries, one for analog hand and one for digital, one with 5 year run time, one with 1 year run time.  Why two?  What’s the battery situation with this V7?<p>How waterproof is it?  Nautical time demands nautical proof packaging.  See all the kits parts and lug sizes, etc., but not waterproofness.<p>Fascinating concept, feels like what would have been a ‘maker’ project on Kickstarter if it existed circa Y2K.  Back then, though, you’d find these kinds of “who thought of that things you didn’t know you needed” in Sharper Image, which suckered me into more than a couple off beat watches.  As a collector of both analog and novelty time pieces, I’d pick this up but feels more like $45 to $295 (depending on materials) rather than $695, even in “today’s dollars”.<p>TY for creating an account and sharing!')
