Nobody knows what to pay and what not to pay, for one thing.  There isn&#x27;t any trust - as many posters here describe, paying medical bills in the US is (feels like?) a constant struggle against being defrauded by both your insurance company and your doctor.<p>I always tell the same story in opposition to our current capitalist healthcare model:<p>1. When my oldest daughter was born 10 years ago with Spina Bifida we had private insurance through my employer.  The premiums for this were something like $15,000&#x2F;yr.  At the time this was probably 1&#x2F;3 of my total income.<p>2. Despite that, we continue to receive bills that we couldn&#x27;t possibly pay for years after that.<p>3. Since my third child was born, the children have been covered by a state program (Georgia), and pretty much everything has been covered, no questions asked.  As a consumer, this is pretty much all I care about.<p>I recognize that the current system is bad for the service providers as well, as evidenced by this article.  The doctor in question gotten all he&#x27;s gonna get from insurance companies.  He has no hope of collecting this money, so he may as well turn it into good PR (cynical perspective, I guess, but that&#x27;s me).')
