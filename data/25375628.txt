Skip-level meetings should be about distilling important topics from your 1:1&#x27;s with your direct manager and sharing with your skip what they need to know. There shouldn&#x27;t really be any information that your skip has that your manager hasn&#x27;t gotten weeks earlier (if it&#x27;s negative, so they can try to fix it).')
