It&#x27;s also absolutely true that virality can create dangerous situations which are difficult to control.<p>Instead of banning, which I agree has problems, I favor putting questionable communities in a &#x27;slow mode&#x27; where people need to wait to join them (and maybe communications within the community are delayed). Then, in 5 or 10 or 15 days, you can see if the community is still &#x27;a problem&#x27; (whatever that means in this situation) and if greater moderation is required. The idea is to preserve communities that build over time, give admins time to make decisions, and highlight the hard questions that need to be answered by platforms.')
