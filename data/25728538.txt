The ethnic Uighur people are Muslims, for the most part. They form a distinct subculture within China. The Communist Party sees their nonconformity as a threat to social harmony. That&#x27;s why, in addition to forced sterilization and forced birth control, the government has imposed forced re-education in concentration camps.<p>Their goal is to destroy the Uighur population&#x27;s distinctiveness as a subculture in China. It is deliberate ethnocide (by forced internment) and genocide (by reproductive suppression).')
