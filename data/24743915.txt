But the quality is inevitably lesser to an HDMI adapter. A version for MacOS is being developped, according to their website<p>It&#x27;s called &quot;Imaging Edge Webcam&quot; : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp&#x2F;app&#x2F;webcam&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp&#x2F;app&#x2F;webcam&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;m personally using an A7ii with a Tamron 28-75 for Canon EF, and it works much better resolution and quality wise with the HDMI, just because of the limitation to 1024x768 of the USB camera mode, which was really meant for tethering. Coupled with a 4$ phantom battery, it&#x27;s awesome! I can get a clear image in the very low light conditions of my room at night, too. No need to turn the lights on, even :)')
