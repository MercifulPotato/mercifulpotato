I just took another look at it and it merely reports what % of the studies mention those effects without effect sizes or anything of the sort.<p>Also they clump psychotomimetic and dissociation effects together which is really weird as ketamine is a dissociative.\nIt&#x27;s literally the highest number in their analysis (72%) because dissociation is to be expected from a dissociative.')
