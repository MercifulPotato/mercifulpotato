It’s my data and I should be able to do anything I want with it. I’m happy to pay for superior product experience but not for them to hold my playlist data hostage.<p>I use songshift so I can copy my Spotify playlist to Apple Music...just so I can listen to music offline on my Apple Watch. How is it reasonable to have to pay for 2 music services just because interoperability sucks. Spotify and Apple are in this tug of war and it makes them both worse companies for their users.')
