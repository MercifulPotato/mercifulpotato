Maybe not direct money exchanging hands, but pages for early access and such. And everyone knows to laugh at IGN&#x27;s and others&#x27; reviews. Knowing that they are just paid for hypemachines... Or at least don&#x27;t dare to be truely critical for fear of not getting access next time. Still they do deliver marketing briefs in nice package so they kinda have a place.<p>What really triggered the gamergate was that writers directly attacked their audiences, with suspiciously similar articles from multiple-source at nearly same time.  And that they care more about themselves and their buddies than their audience. And many don&#x27;t even self-identify as hobbyist... Which really should be death knell for any hobbyist media.')
