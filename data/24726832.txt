They have something like a 100Mhz fairly high bit depth A&#x2F;D on them. At the time the price&#x2F;bandwidth was crazy (and still is if someone managed to pull it off with a modern docsis 3.1 system). I got some boot logs&#x2F;etc but didn&#x27;t get very far into reverse engineering the chip. Its too bad that the chip vendors go to such lengths to hide what is basically mostly repackaged 3rd party IP from designware&#x2F;arm&#x2F;etc.<p>Current DOCSIS has ~200Mhz sampling per OFDM channel, given a 3rd party tuner in front of it, the results might be pretty crazy.')
