As a Windows user, I can absolutely be unhappy if software I prefer does not run. If someone comes around and says &quot;but that software was originally for Mac... you aren&#x27;t allowed to expect it to run well on Windows! A <i>real</i> Windows user wouldn&#x27;t complain about that software.&quot;<p>And if the software I prefer runs <i>better</i> on macOS, I have a good reason to switch away from Windows. Just as if software you prefer runs <i>better</i> on Windows, you can complain about macOS (or in this case, incompatibility due to the ISA switch.)<p>My issue was with the comment using &quot;mac user&quot; as an excuse for software that isn&#x27;t what the &quot;true&quot; mac user considers essential not working well.')
