For example, for high-stakes predictions (eg elections) we saw significant gaming because people see it as an opportunity to move the media narrative.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this in the current US Presidential Elections, with big swings in betting markets for the presidential outcome itself, without the same swings in related outcomes (eg, you see a swing in the price for &quot;the winning president is X&quot; <i>without</i> the price for &quot;X gets above 270 electoral votes changing at all&quot;)<p>Obviously this creates arbitrage opportunities, but the media narrative is the real issue.
