I actually have at least a 10 GbE card (and switch) on the way to test those and see if I can get more out of it, but for _this_ test, I had a 4-interface Intel I340-T4, and I managed to get a maximum throughput of 3.06 Gbps when pumping bits through all 4 of those plus the built-in Gigabit interface on the Compute Module.<p>For some reason I couldn&#x27;t break that barrier, even though all the interfaces can do ~940 Mbps on their own, and any three on the PCIe card can do ~2.8 Gbps. It seems like there&#x27;s some sort of upper limit around 3 Gbps on the Pi CM4 (even when combining the internal interface) :-&#x2F;<p>But maybe I&#x27;m missing something in the Pi OS &#x2F; Debian&#x2F;Linux kernel stack that is holding me back? Or is it a limitation on the SoC? I though the ethernet chip was separate from the PCIe lanes on it, but maybe there&#x27;s something internal to the BCM2711 that&#x27;s bottlenecking it.<p>Also... tons more detail here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geerlingguy&#x2F;raspberry-pi-pcie-devices&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geerlingguy&#x2F;raspberry-pi-pcie-devices&#x2F;iss...</a>')
