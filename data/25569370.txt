I live in Germany and we didn&#x27;t have a strict lockdown where you would get a fine for doing non-essential outside activity. In April cultural and fitness were closed. Therefore the only way to do something is to go outside.<p>The interesting thing would be to understand how many other people you were meeting with which I would think that data does not provide. I mean Google likely has that data but didn&#x27;t anonymize it in order to release it.<p>Meeting more people than allowed and not covering your mouth and nose is something that was spot checked and still is.')
