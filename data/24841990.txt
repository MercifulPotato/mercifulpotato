Depending on what you are doing, it can be difficult, for example iteratively calling any of the LinearAlgebra methods, since there is no interface for preallocating work arrays (doing the ccall on BLAS yourself is not a fun work-around). It is also not always clear why something is allocating, even with the debugging tools.')
