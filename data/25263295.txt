Look at how many of us are actively trying to disengage from smartphones. Not having a smartphone is now unusual to a lot of people, but their use could be affecting us in ways that we don&#x27;t yet understand on a scale of decades.<p>Cynicism reminds me of Brave New World, but even for walled gardens like Pinterest that I would rather not put up with, thousands of people outside the tech sphere have taken them up and used them for purposes which are materially advantageous to them. Imagine all of the Facebook-exclusive events that went on to connect people to marriages a decade later, or ideas for wedding registries sealed away in Pinterest. &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for Facebook&#x2F;Pinterest&#x2F;etc., then my life wouldn&#x27;t have turned out like this.&quot; These platforms are becoming melded with millions of people&#x27;s lives in inextricable ways. We have seen what is possible with enough ingenuity and progress, and we probably won&#x27;t unsee it. People are happy to use these things, and imposing your will on them to change is usually what people would deem poor social etiquette.<p>Unless civilization collapses, I doubt it will be any time soon that technology regresses to before this point or a significant movement to move off these platforms emerges.')
