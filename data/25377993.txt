Sure, if you want to do business with customers through Apple&#x27;s platform then you need to abide by their terms, but you <i>can</i> do business with them.<p>On the surface it feels a bit like complaining that you can&#x27;t do business with customers through Stripe, because Stripe has Ts&amp;Cs that you need to abide by. Apple&#x27;s situation is more complex, but I think the underlying reasoning on this specific point is the same isn&#x27;t it?')
