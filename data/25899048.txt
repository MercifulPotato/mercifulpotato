If object A contains two references to object B and you want to read A back into memory the same way (rather than have it contain two different but identical objects B) you have to deal with the issue of referential integrity. No cycles needed.<p>If your domain model is strictly that of rows in an RDBMS, there&#x27;s no problem. Otherwise you&#x27;re not storing objects but <i>graphs of objects</i> and overlooking that simple fact is the source of many serialization problems.')
