It seems to be the only platform with the clout to get support for most streaming apps and that also updates its software regularly for a long time. I don&#x27;t like the idea of a single, proprietary platform being the end-all, but every manufacturer-specific platform seems to be missing key streaming apps, and then there&#x27;s Google where it&#x27;s unlikely Google will support the device in a year.<p>Roku has built-in AirPlay support now too, which I believe makes it the only non-Apple device that you can &quot;just&quot; stream to from an iPhone.')
