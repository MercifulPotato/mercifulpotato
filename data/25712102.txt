He and four communist leaders were arrested.<p>The event supported the earlier claims of the National Socialist Workers Party, that Germany was on the verge of a communist revolution and only majority by them could stop it.<p>At the urging of Chancellor Adolf Hitler, President Paul von Hidenburg immediately issued the Reichstag Fire Decree, suspending civil liberties such as freedom speech, freedom of the press, public assembly, and the secrecy of the post and telephone.<p>The government arrested large numbers of communists, including members of parliament.<p>In their absence, the Nazis and their allies, the Germany National People&#x27;s Party, achieved a majority in the legislature. Exactly one month after the Reichstag fire, they passed the Enabling Act to help them against the seditious communists by giving the Chancellor the power to pass laws without parliamentary approval.<p>Soon after, President Hindenburg died and the President&#x27;s office was merged with that of the Chancellor Hitler, making Hitler the head of state and the executive, or &quot;FÃ¼hrer und Reichskanzler.&quot;<p>But......the important thing is that they successfully addressed the insurrectionists&#x27; attack on the Capitol!')
