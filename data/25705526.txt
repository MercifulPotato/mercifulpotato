Now, one side would need to somehow get the other side convinced that yes, we respect you as human beings even if we disagree on some things. And that respect does <i>not</i> just mean nice words, but also actual policies which make people (not their opinions) thrive. Bad news is that it is not an easy task - for either side.<p>Due to the election results, it is now Democrats&#x27; turn to see how they can start to heal the nation. It is imperative that they see that the reason for Trump&#x27;s success is not racism or misogyny of Trump&#x27;s supporters. The real reason is that there are lots of people who think that their life is not good. And <i>that</i> needs to be fixed. Bad news again is that it is not easy. Even worse is that if you fail, escalation continues and at some point you are looking at breaking the country or even civil war.')
