I&#x27;d say that healthy people have more freedom so they have more choices to make. When you come down to it health is about freedom. Freedom from preoccupying pain, constricting impairment, freedom to do whatever. Choices are a symptom of freedom. We must have a different definition somewhere in here. Haven&#x27;t read the article yet.<p>Edit: Having read the story, the spoons are a metaphor for units of personal energy required to do a basic everyday task, and the choices, as used in above quote, are compromises you have to make when you have too little spoons to do everything you&#x27;d like.<p>Edit2: man, it&#x27;s easy to get downvoted in this thread. Do I come off as unsympathetic or something? I&#x27;ve been depressed for most of my life, so spoon-shortage isn&#x27;t exactly new ground for me.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think that while freedom is everyone&#x27;s ultimate goal, whether they comprehend it or not, it&#x27;s not necessary for happiness (and not the same as happiness). Happiness is about accepting what is (whatever it might be). Unhappiness is about rejecting what is. To say that happiness depends on what you can do, is to project your internal rejection onto the external &quot;capability&quot;, thus retreating to the comfort of not owning your own feelings.<p>Of course, if someone said &quot;take this pill and you&#x27;ll be able to do everything&quot; I&#x27;d down the whole bottle, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;d rather circumvent the symptom, than face my own addiction to powerlessness.')
