Wise words.<p>I miss pre-2015 Twitter. I interacted with a lot of fellow devs across the world. Who I would often meet IRL at conferences. It was super enjoyable and valuable. Alas I unfollowed everyone and only open Twitter a couple of times a year.<p>FB I stopped using many many years ago which was easy. I do use Instagram for sharing vacation and new puppy photos privately. But I easily go months without checking it most of the time. I never scroll.<p>I go through phases on Reddit. I like r&#x2F;rust and get a lot of my Rust education from posts there. Which sucks me back in, unfortunately.<p>I&#x27;ve never gotten pulled into the YouTube rabbit hole. I just click links that happen to be hosted there from time to time. I don&#x27;t subscribe to much other than SmarterEveryDay and a handful of similar channels. An alternatively would be nice. I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad about my YouTube usage if it wasn&#x27;t Google.')
