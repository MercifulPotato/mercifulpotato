Not even for components created by me... But it&#x27;s a good idea I didn&#x27;t think about.<p>At the moment, it&#x27;s all pretty straightforwardly coded. I first aimed at having an MVP in the app store, so the functionality for the app is now limited. In my roadmap though components will be rearrangeable, allowing for more complex UIs and I am evolving the codebase in that direction.<p>The rest of what you mention is indeed in my plans. The idea is exactly that: too much time is spent on those same things.')
