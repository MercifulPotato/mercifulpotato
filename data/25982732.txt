At Tesla&#x27;s Austin Factory the Giga Press Die Casting machines can already be seen being assembled&#x2F;installed even before the part of that Building Section&#x27;s precast concrete roof is installed!<p>Those Giga Press Die Casting machines will free up more plant space for other operations to produce even more autos and Trucks as that Die Casting process matures and replaces even the robotic&#x2F;other assembly steps that were required previously. So Tesla&#x27;s earlier Fremont Die Casting production will be followed up by more and larger sections of the Autos&#x2F;Trucks that are cast in a single step on to the point where the vehicle&#x27;s entire unibody can be Die Cast in a single step.')
