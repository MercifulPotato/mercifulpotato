Joe Rogan expresses dumb and not so dumb ideas which are scattered all over the place from what might be called left or right. He has weird pseudoscientific health opinions that are both right and leftish, aggressive ideas about masculinity he takes a lot of dumb conspiracy theorists at their word. These are enough reasons for me to not really like his takes, but he&#x27;s had good interviews, he&#x27;s had liberal economic ideas expressed too, I just don&#x27;t think the left and right buckets are useful.')
