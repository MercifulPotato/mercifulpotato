News should only come from approved sources. Once the veracity has been checked by a Facebook employee, it is then empirically true or false. I don&#x27;t know why people in the 21st century cannot understand that all statements are true or false, and that we can place authority for determining truth with companies with known, trusted political allegiances.<p>For example, I have read a lot about healthcare-for-all not being free. The clue is in the name: &quot;free&quot; healthcare. I can&#x27;t believe that misinformation, probably spread by insurance companies, has been allowed to spread.
