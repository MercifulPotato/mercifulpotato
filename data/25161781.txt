While I do follow a proper rule of 3 for backups, my main FreeNAS volume (100TB) is where I will randomly dump stuff until I sort&#x2F;backup it up later. It hosts a wide range of stuff from media, to small files (db). The only thing that will eat that data is a hacker, massive sw bug, or my house burning down.<p>I&#x27;ve broke a lot of systems and data over the years. With that in mind, I like my data storage (NAS&#x2F;filer) to be boring and predictable. FreeNAS is exactly that for me.')
