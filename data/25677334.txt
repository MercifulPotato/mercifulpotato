As long as there are foreign investment opportunities you are going to see very little inflation. As long as unemployment or underemployment stays high you can keep printing forever without having an impact on the value of the currency.<p>&gt;The FEDs of the world, that pump up the monetary supply have all agreed on the same game plan: It&#x27;s call UP is the only way out. The only way to deleverage the economy is to inflate away all the debt. The Governments of the world are all on board with this policy. Why do you think they&#x27;re all so desperate to create high inflation (3%-4%)? That&#x27;s how you reduce the debt burden.<p>You know, if the central banks actually did their job properly you wouldn&#x27;t want to hold BTC at all because the income of workers would rise faster than the value of your BTC. They are not desperate just incompetent (well, in theory they are unable to solve the problem).')
