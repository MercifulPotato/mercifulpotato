On the other hand, I have a fair bit of French songs in about 3 or 4 playlists and yet have never gotten a recommendation of French stuff...<p>I&#x27;ve tried to understand how the algo somewhat works to suggest stuff but with no luck... I keep hitting the don&#x27;t like this song or artist and yest somehow I still manage to get dreadful recommendations each week :(')
