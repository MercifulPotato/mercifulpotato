Competition is always good, no matter what.<p>But on the other, I had such a terrible experience with all the Macs that I had to work with in the last two years that I&#x27;m no longer recommending Macs to anyone. So much so that the illustrated performance gains are simply irrelevant.<p>To give you a little bit context.<p>I really liked Apple. I&#x27;m a product designer, and I was able to ride the wave of mobile app designs with the first release of the app store. It practically shaped my career. So I&#x27;m forever thankful for that and was always happy with them. I&#x27;ve always recommended them wherever I go, because they just worked.<p>But recently...<p>I spent about 6-7k worth of Macs for myself and my family (in past two years). Companies I was working with provided Macs worth 8k alone (two high end devices). And all of these had all kinds of different issues like:<p>- USB-C monitor working on 2 devices but not the others (Mac Minis).<p>- Bluetooth connection dropping at least twice a day (for around 30 sec, especially annoying during zoom meetings)<p>- Software issues like mac client popping every bloody hour. Disrupting either my workflow or my screen sharing.<p>- Overheating issues (and slowness) with my Macbook Pro 16&quot;, because I&#x27;m charging it from the wrong side.<p>- Trackpad stopping working for a couple of seconds from time to time, making me question my sanity.<p>- Mac Minis refusing to wake up the monitor from time to time.<p>- Macbooks sometimes freezing when being woken up.<p>And the list goes on ... and some of these devices were returned and exchanged a couple of times to no effect. And there is no Mac in my family that just works. Not anymore. And it become so annoying that I started selling them and purchasing custom Window stations instead.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the offtopic, but needed to vent.')
