When I didn&#x27;t get my PC, and eBay told me to fuck off, I asked the bank to reverse the transaction and&#x2F;or to provide me with the true person&#x27;s details (it looks like ebay seller gave me the correct bank account number, but fake name). The bank told me to file a police report. I did. Sent a copy to the bank. The bank told me to fuck off.<p>End of story. sad_trombone.mp3')
