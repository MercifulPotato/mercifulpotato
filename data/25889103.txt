Forced migrations always create a decision point, at which point people may gather their resentments and move to something else. But if you don&#x27;t eventually force a change, you have to live with all of the language&#x27;s historical mistakes.<p>My shop was interested in migrating long ago, but we had to wait until languages and frameworks (such as Django) supported 3. On projects where that wasn&#x27;t a risk, we moved to Python around 2014 or so. But: I totally get that for some shops, the feasibility of migrating was low.')
