In fact, Grant repeats quite often in his videos that they’re not a substitute for doing problems.<p>I’d highly recommend watching the videos side by side with reading through Axler. They will help develop the right geometric intuition (which Axler does a decent job of, but books can only do so much as a medium). I believe the 3B1B videos can also be quite motivating, which in my experience is the most important factor when self studying.')
