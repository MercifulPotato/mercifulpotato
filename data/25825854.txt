You have the freedom to adopt countermeasures. You can drive defensively and stay alert when behind the wheel as a countermeasure against other drivers possibly being drunk. You can wear a mask (properly), social distance, avoid crowds, etc., as a countermeasure against other people possibly having an infectious disease. That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work in a free society.<p>In this case, the consequences extend beyond merely contracting COVID-19. The consequences also include society-wide social and economic impacts that are amplified disproportionately by people who make &quot;poor decisions&quot;.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t have roadblocks everywhere with cops forcibly administering breathalyzers to all drivers to make sure none of them are drunk.<p>We absolutely do. You probably live in one of the minority of states in which they are not legal.')
