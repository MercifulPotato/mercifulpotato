I didn&#x27;t look into the details of what parts of HyPer were borrowed and I missed the adoption of the DataBlocks [1] storage format. DuckDB is designed to be an embedded HTAP (Hybrid Transactional&#x2F;Analytical Processing) engine.<p>I think the project is immature and the documentation is sparse. I expect to see detailed documentation on default file locations and the recovery process for an OLTP&#x2F;HTAP engine and I didn&#x27;t see anything like that in the DuckDB docs. My bad, I should have checked my assumptions.<p>I would not adopt DuckDB as an OLTP replacement for either SQLite or PostgreSQL without a strong OLAP component and some serious performance&#x2F;load&#x2F;integrity testing, but it sounds like you are confident in its abilities. Thanks for sharing your experience.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;db.in.tum.de&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;publications&#x2F;datablocks.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;db.in.tum.de&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;publications&#x2F;datablocks.pdf</a>')
