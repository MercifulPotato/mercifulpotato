Item(by='tidepod12', descendants=None, kids=[25688357], score=None, time=1610126269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25684154, text='&gt;Now, gushing praise aside, making sure the labels are truly accurate is the hard part. For example, I’m not sure how iMessage can claim it doesn’t track payments when I use it to actually make payments, but I guess the point is aside from the system that actually processed the payment that iMessage itself is not using any metadata of that payment. Very interesting distinction which boils down to whether a bullet item might show up in the box or not.<p>It&#x27;s a classic &quot;lies, damn lies, and statistics&quot; scenario. The graphic might be <i>technically</i> correct but it&#x27;s misleading in a way to spread a specific message. It irks me that this image keeps being spread all over.<p>The thing people should actually care about isn&#x27;t if <i>iMessage</i> stores&#x2F;uses this information, but if the organization in control of iMessage stores&#x2F;uses it. It&#x27;s just like I don&#x27;t really care if the WhatsApp app stores all this info, the actual problem is if Facebook (the company) uses it for some reason. WhatsApp (the app) just happens to be one of the avenues that this data is collected.<p>For iMessage, sure, maybe technically iMessage isn&#x27;t collecting my payment information... but Apple still gets it via the Wallet app. Maybe iMessage isn&#x27;t storing my location history, but Apple still is through the iPhone location history. Maybe iMessage isn&#x27;t watching my app usage history, but Apple Screen Time sure is. This applies to all of the things listed as bad under the WhatsApp label.<p>Secondarily, the graphic is also misleading because the WhatsApp side of it becomes artificially larger since most of the items are listed twice. It immediately causes you to think &quot;WhatsApp collects a lot more&quot; due to the size of the box, but in reality the box could be collapsed to half the size. It just so happens that the way Apple chose to present this information makes it seem like WhatsApp collects twice the data.<p>Personally (perhaps naively) I do trust Apple with this information more than Facebook, but the graphic is still misleading by implying that it isn&#x27;t being collected and used in some way.')
