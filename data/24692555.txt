Legs moving on pedals, arms and hands wheel turning, head+shoulders turning to look left and right.<p>As someone who lives in the midwest, I have to disagree.  Pick pretty much any random 100 mile stretch of I-70 or I-80 between the Appalachians and the Rockies and the majority of it will be straight enough that you could set the cruise and only have to turn the wheel a few degrees at most as long as traffic doesn&#x27;t do anything stupid.<p>When I was younger and dumber I once drove from I-71 near Cleveland almost to Chicago with just my knee on the wheel.  There&#x27;s a kink about half way across Indiana that was the only real challenge.')
