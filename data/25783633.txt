I actually liked C++ as a language, but it was exhausting and deeply uninteresting to write my own build system with a stringly-typed language that almost completely punts on package management (even the approach described in TFA is embarrassing to anyone who has used other mainstream languages) and has first-class support for certain dependencies (IIRC CMake has builtin functions for Qt and gtest and probably others). No doubt that CMake is a moderate improvement over Make, but it&#x27;s still far, far worse than just about every other mainstream programming language&#x27;s build tooling.<p>EDIT: I remember being amazed when Go came out circa 2011 that I could just &quot;go build&quot; a project and it just worked. One had to understand &quot;GOPATH&quot; which was slightly counterintuitive but not too bad, and of course it wasn&#x27;t reproducible (both of those problems are pretty much addressed nowadays via modules), but I was blown away that I could actually just &quot;go build&quot; or &quot;go test&quot; and focus on my application code instead of my project tooling.')
