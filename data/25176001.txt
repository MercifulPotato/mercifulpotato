The key positions for those three are mostly the same but they play completely differently. It&#x27;s not too hard to learn each one but it takes some practice.  With prior experience it doesn&#x27;t take that long to learn the ins and outs of a new model.<p>For the different keyboard sizes, that might be something that new students could train on. Professionals already out there might want to practice on them but that stinks to have to get stuck with a random piano size at a gig.')
