Didn&#x27;t know until I was already in college. AFAIK he&#x27;s never made an effort to reach out to them, grant resources, give a talk, anything. It&#x27;s a majority-minority public school in a solidly middle class (like, actually middle  class) suburb, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re flush with funding. Whatever his relationship to it had been at the time, you&#x27;d think he&#x27;d find it within himself to give back a tiny bit from the exceptional fortune and life that he&#x27;s built. The reality, though, was that a lot of us didn&#x27;t even know who he was, even though all of the school computers had their homepages set to Google.com.<p>I think that&#x27;s emblematic of Google&#x27;s regard to reinvestment.
