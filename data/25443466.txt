In fact, the only hardware failures I&#x27;ve experienced have been external (usb) hard drives failing after a few years, and a laptop keyboard failing after someone spilled tea on it.<p>In terms of what the repairman told you, when I called Compaq&#x27;s support to get help with the keyboard, once the person on the other side of the line heard me say I was running linux on it, he said &quot;that&#x27;s your problem&quot;. I had to reiterate that my problem was someone spilling tea on it, and that I had been running linux on this particular laptop for almost 2 years without any keyboard issues, thank you very much. In the end, Compaq told me they didn&#x27;t have spare parts, and the keyboard started working again after letting the machine dry up for a few days (that was the last time I bought Compaq though!).<p>My point is: computer repair and tech support people are almost programmed to find out something that they&#x27;re not responsible for and that could explain your problem. I don&#x27;t hold it against them, I think it&#x27;s a normal bias, but I would never take linux advise from a repair person, unless they work on a linux shop.')
