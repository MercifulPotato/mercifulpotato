If 100% students passing through landed a job then the unit economics would work provided hard costs are low enough. Business might even be successful at 30% post Lambda School employment. However, as they scale that number will fall because the type of student they recruit might change and the pandemic also having a short term effect. As % post employment falls revenues fall and more students are needed to increase absolute revs. This could also go hand in hand with cost-cutting, of which there is evidence. All in all, an experiment in business model is taking place.')
