He himself claims practising yoga for years. How do you justify him never coming across eight parts of Yoga? Moreover on his website he admits similarities with Buddhist meditation but reluctantly[1] and justifies by claiming of &quot;stripping the religious aspects&quot; just like you.<p>so as far as religious trappings are concerned, Hinduism and Buddhism aren&#x27;t religions in Abrahmic sense. There is no creed to be followed, there are no prophets, and you don&#x27;t have to follow commandments to achieve eternal bliss in after life. Buddhism and Jainism don&#x27;t even have gods per say.<p>Word Dharma comes from Sanskrit root dhri, which means maintains the stability and harmony of self, society, environment, and universe. This means there are no prohibitions but only principles to be followed to maintain the balance. Depending upon the situation same principle might suggest diametrically opposite actions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wimhofmethod.com&#x2F;tummo-meditation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wimhofmethod.com&#x2F;tummo-meditation</a>')
