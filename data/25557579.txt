Compulsory school attendance was established in Austria-Hungary by Maria Theresa and while these schools were different, just 50 years passed and the schools looked almost exactly like they do today, because of Prussian pressure. Prussian schools invented the system of sitting in a classroom, learning a topic by drill and then exams, and we still do that today. The schools here in former Austria-Hungary and Prussia are actually proud of this heritage... There are many books (both novels and not) from that time period that are also describing the schools, you can read one for yourself.')
