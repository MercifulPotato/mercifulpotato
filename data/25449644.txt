Only a small subset of the class was using Macs <i>and</i> the built-in reader, so it took a while to discover. The problem eventually turned out to be some oddity in the way it treats whitespace[1], that Adobe and a few other readers were perfectly fine with, but not Preview.<p>[1] PDF is one of the strangest file formats I&#x27;ve worked with. It is a bizarre mix of binary and text, and some of the other design decisions are also perplexing.')
