Item(by='vzidex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611770152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25931327, text='&gt; Few farms will talk about killing their animals, of course, keeping what is happening sterile in appearance is pretty important for keeping the amount people eat high<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I was trying to point out. Animal product industries have so many different ways in which they&#x27;re cruel to animals - e.g., for dairy, the things I pointed out that are missing from the posted webpage - that individual companies can try to make themselves look better&#x2F;ethical by pointing out the one or two things they&#x27;re doing better than average, while omitting all of the other horrific parts of the pipeline (as another poster in this thread said, &quot;ethics-washing&quot;).')
