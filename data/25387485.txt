It just feels..... wrong. Way more like stealing from content creators than just blocking ads in the first place. That combined with what feels like a cash grab with their cryptocurrency likely immediately turns a lot of people off.<p>ps. I know, I know. Brave&#x27;s ads are unobtrusive, they don&#x27;t track you, they donate crypto to the sites, etc. etc. It doesn&#x27;t change the underlying emotional response a lot of people seem to have to their business model.')
