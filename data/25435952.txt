The guidelines say:<p><pre><code>    Note: “Personal Information” and “Personal Data”, as defined under relevant privacy laws, are considered linked to the user.\n</code></pre>\nThis implies that email addresses are, by definition, considered linked to the user&#x27;s identity. The fact that someone could submit a fake email address is irrelevant, just as if you collected mailing addresses and someone put in &quot;123 Fake Street&quot;, or if you collected phone numbers and someone put in &quot;123-456-7890&quot;.')
