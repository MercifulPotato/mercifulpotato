I&#x27;m not one of them and I do what I can to educate people, both here and elsewhere, about the reality of what a lot of poor people live with. But that seems to mostly be irrelevant to the points people here are making today.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you seem to feel so compelled to argue so strenuously that everyone here is missing some important details about how the poorest of the poor live in the US. I really don&#x27;t think they are. I think that&#x27;s just mostly got nothing to do with this discussion at the moment.<p>I also think HN is fairly well informed these days overall on such topics because they put up with me being openly homeless for nearly six years and I still sometimes write about that and sometimes hit the front page on such topics. So the crowd here isn&#x27;t generally all &quot;la la la, not listening.&quot; This just seems honestly not relevant to the discussion, at least not in the way it is being approached.')
