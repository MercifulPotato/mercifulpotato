If your particular community is US-centric, going to Russia (or China) for hosting will serve you well, as they have little interest in what you&#x27;re doing and will not easily give in to pressure (if you&#x27;re scared of the US cracking down on you, you should probably avoid the EU as well).<p>Still, I agree: Having to take these steps as anything other than a far fetched precaution is horrible.')
