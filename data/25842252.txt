Item(by='seanwilson', descendants=None, kids=[25842329], score=None, time=1611113027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842197, text='&gt;  1 PR, you know what introduced the breakage. 30? Good luck.<p>To be clearer, I mean there would be say 30 pull requests merged into &quot;develop&quot; and they would only be merged into &quot;master&quot; and pushed live after detailed manual testing. This is versus merging each pull request directly into &quot;master&quot; and going live immediately, where you wouldn&#x27;t have time to do detailed manual testing every merge.<p>You would still have the git history in both approaches to debug.')
