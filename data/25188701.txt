But when we talk about things &quot;that aren&#x27;t physically present&quot;, a good percentage of that talk can be useful to one or more of the participants; though we also do a lot of what the parent is complaining about.<p>That said, I do know what they mean. I also hate to see people getting almost traumatized by the random crap they find on social media. Especially if it&#x27;s bullshit - and it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s bullshit, but you can&#x27;t say it, because that would invalidate the other person&#x27;s feelings. So yesterday, it was &quot;did you know our government wants to XYZ?!?!!&quot; (no, they don&#x27;t, the news article was lying, as usual). Today it&#x27;s maltreated pets (could you <i>please</i> unsubscribe from the feeds that trigger you every couple weeks like clockwork?). Tomorrow it&#x27;ll be a YouTube drama (between a very niche vloggers).<p>Perhaps it is human nature, perhaps it was also present with the old media. But what seems different is <i>isolation</i>. I remember that before the web became truly mainstream, people would talk a lot about bullshit they&#x27;ve heard on the news. But they would all talk about <i>the same</i> bullshit. People would ultimately take comfort in an understanding that they share the knowledge about the story. Today? Everyone has their own isolated social media feed. So you end up having people unload completely random and unexpected stuff at whoever is willing to listen to them.')
