And for the most part, I am. After all, even Ferraris that do have back seats often require the rear passenger to sacrifice leg room, so you can imagine peoples’ reactions when I allude to fitting car seats back there. However, after trying a plethora of Ferrari models, I can confidently say there are models you can choose from, if you have a family and still want to spoil yourself by driving a Ferrari.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merlinautogroup.com&#x2F;kid-friendly-ferraris.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merlinautogroup.com&#x2F;kid-friendly-ferraris.htm</a>')
