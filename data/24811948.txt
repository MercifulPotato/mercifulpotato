The idea that there should be no consequences for spewing vitriol and using lies to back it up is insane. It&#x27;s been demonstrated time and time again that people can&#x27;t fact check every single statement and this fact is used by malicious actors to manipulate people to their ends.<p>Its also really strange because for every other system we have, we accept legislatively enforced boundaries. There are constraints around the manufacturing of drugs, food products, vehicles, etc. We have regulations around pollution.<p>Even for abstract ideas, we socially agree on norms. Nobody would think it&#x27;s acceptable to just called somebody the n word (or some other derogatory word) in the work place. Healthy companies tend to get rid of &#x27;brilliant jerks&#x27; who yell or bully other employees, despite their technical competence. Why? Because we understand that this attitude creates a corrosive environment that is fundamentally not beneficial for the good of the group. We even understand this in personal relationships. We break up with people who lie to us and manipulate us.')
