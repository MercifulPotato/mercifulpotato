HTTP&#x2F;3 didn’t have to use UDP ports 80 and 443, it was just most convenient for all parties concerned to use the same numbers as the TCP ports, because there was no obvious reason to change it.<p>I do wish you could specify which port to use for your HTTP with SRV records, but it’s unlikely that will ever happen.<p>10–15 years ago, SCTP didn’t work on the internet at large, just like it doesn’t now. Face it, protocols at this layer have ossified so that TCP and UDP are your only options if you want broad compatibility—and that’s nothing to do with any one party, it’s everyone’s fault. TCP and UDP will never get another sibling. (See also how TLS ossified in 1.2 so that fundamental improvement was an enormous effort and 1.3 is <i>still</i> not universally supported.) Fortunately, UDP is pretty close to raw IP, so there’s not a great deal of difference between implementing QUIC on top of UDP and QUIC on top of IP.<p>&gt; <i>Over 5-10 years we could get 90% adoption of an entirely new network stack.</i><p>Nope, this is absolutely false; I even have a concrete counterexample: IPv6. Standardised in 1995–1998, supported by DNS since 2008, supported by all major OSes by 2011, but still unavailable to a very large fraction of internet users. (As a consumer of internet, I’ve encountered IPv6 support in one commercial internet supply in Australia, but not in any other, or any residential or cellular connection in Australia, or in a few stints in India, or in a cellular connection in the USA.)<p>You’re seriously overestimating the ability to get people to change. If your solution is incompatible with the past, people won’t change because no one’s using the new thing (because it’s incompatible). If your solution is compatible with the past, people won’t change because there’s no good reason to. Most of the time people will only change if there’s a compelling reason to: e.g. with HTTP&#x2F;2, many adopted it because the multiplexing normally improved page load performance, and with HTTPS, many adopted it because browsers were starting to label their sites as insecure if they didn’t, and they didn’t like that.')
