That&#x27;s how I use mine most of the time, streaming via podcast websites in mobile Safari or using my local NPR affiliate&#x27;s app. In these cases my phone is handling the audio stream, so its battery is draining and if I step out of the apartment it will cut off. Deeper app integrations like Spotify are nice because my phone isn&#x27;t in the signal path.')
