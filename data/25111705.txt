In the case of Uber&#x2F;Lyft (and other Gig economy for that matter) you do not sign a contract with each transaction you do with them.<p>Therefore, your contract with them, it&#x27;s to pick up and drive users of the platform under terms set by the platform. This is obviously an employer - employee relationship.')
