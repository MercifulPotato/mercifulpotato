I like learning low level stuff but never felt like it was worth the investment to properly learn the oddball x86 assembly code. I have an Amiga background where I did some assembly coding on Motorola 68000. I absolutely hated the x86 hardware platform when O switched over. It felt like everything was a kludge. Too few registers. Weird segment registers etc. ARM looks much nicer and you can use same instruction set on tiny micro\nControllers.')
