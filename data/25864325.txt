In this case, there seems to be little doubt that the reporting is factual; the reported lawsuit does exist and does make the reported claims.<p>That matters, but it isn&#x27;t the only thing that matters.  Again: the fact that the NY Post themselves didn&#x27;t outright lie in this story does little to refute the idea that they&#x27;re a disreputable paper.  The way they choose facts to report and how they arrange them can be the real source of disrepute.')
