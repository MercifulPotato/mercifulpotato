If you&#x27;re going to blame anyone for the TARP program surely it would be the government?<p>I do get why people are angry at those who recklessly over leveraged, although I would still argue that this is more of regulatory issue. If you allow people to take reckless financial risks some percentage of people will always do it.<p>It&#x27;s also no reason to be angry at hedge funds as a collective, in the same way it would be silly to be angry at all mortgage owners (past &amp; present) for the GFC.<p>However, if you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s fine to blame the individual hedge funds involved in the GFC for reckless harm and negligence then I would would tend to agree, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be what&#x27;s happening.')
