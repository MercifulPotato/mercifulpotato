It&#x27;s a PCM array.<p>If what you mean is &quot;the artifact isn&#x27;t &#x27;aliasing&#x27; until it finally goes through the DAC&quot;, my answer to you is: that&#x27;s a useless and counterproductive distinction.  I inadvertently introduced an artifact into my digital signal that I cannot easily remove.  That this artifact magically gains a label only once it passes through the DAC is pedantic nonsense that helps no one.')
