We have much more than the word of Trump and his &quot;sycophants&quot;.<p>We know, and no one disputes, that the left and some individuals on the right want Trump out of power very badly. We don&#x27;t need Trump to tell us that, they have said so themselves, loudly, for the past 5 years.<p>We also know, and no one disputes, that the election officials in a number of key areas have their jobs because the local elected Democrats want them to be there. We don&#x27;t need Trump to tell us that. We know it because elected officials ultimately decide who works for the government, and the elected officials in these areas have virtually all been Democrats for decades.<p>We also know, and no one disputes, that significant restrictions were imposed on election observers that did not exist in previous elections, such as requiring them to keep 6 feet away from election workers. We don&#x27;t need Trump to tell us that, we saw pictures and videos of observers being forced to sit far enough away from workers that they could not plausibly do any meaningful observing.<p>We therefore know, and no one disputes, that local election officials had the means, motive, and opportunity to bias the election against Trump.
