For topics where there is conflicting or poor evidence or that bear on the culture war, I do not want people voting on what is the consensus truth. I want to see all the evidence.<p>That&#x27;s a nice sentiment in a vacuum, but we&#x27;re not in a vacuum.  It&#x27;s sort of like focusing on getting every child a college education when you can&#x27;t even manage to teach them all literacy yet.<p>At the point, I feel like the priority needs to be around figuring out a way to defeat disinformation and misinformation to restore some kind of common ground understanding of the facts.  The marketplace of ideas can&#x27;t function if major factions reject truth-seeking in favor of blatant lies that are appealing for various other reasons (e.g. emotional satisfaction, ability to manipulate others, etc.).')
