Walking through the house in the evening to make sure the kids didn&#x27;t leave lights on (and to lock up the various doors, and set the thermostat back, etc) is annoying. Being able to speak a single voice command to do all that on my way upstairs is much more convenient. Could I still do it by going to a different room? Absolutely. Is it nicer to not have to do that? Definitely.<p>Why did you have a CD player if cassettes worked for your? Was rewinding the cassette really too much trouble? Kids these days...')
