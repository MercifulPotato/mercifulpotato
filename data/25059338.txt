Javascript defines it&#x27;s floating point rounding behaviour as what Intel CPUs do. ARM behaves differently by default, so they implemented an instruction to emulate the Intel behaviour specially to avoid Javascript running too slowly implementing the excepted behaviour in code.<p>This doesn&#x27;t give ARM chips an advantage over Intel CPUs at executing Javascript for obvious reasons, once you know why they added it.')
