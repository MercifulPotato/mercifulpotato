The actual protobuf uses (B) - which is convenient in most cases, because when you start constructing a protobuf usually you don&#x27;t have all the data ready yet.<p>However, with required fields, this means when you construct the protobuf it starts with all required fields missing - i.e., an invalid state!<p>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the best way to fix it, because it would be infeasible to rewrite all the code to gather all the fields and then construct the protobuf - also it will be hugely inefficient in many cases.  However, I feel the &quot;no required fields&quot; rule is essentially a null pointer (the &quot;billion dollar mistake&quot;) in disguise - the actual problem is that the API doesn&#x27;t enforce type safety.')
