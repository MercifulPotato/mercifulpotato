Conservative corporation.<p>It was also important to keep employees for a long time. I worked for a Japanese corporation, and my boss was 7,000 miles away, and didn&#x27;t speak English.<p>So, for me, keeping my employees happy, and feeling valued, was important. Since these were fairly senior (C++ programmers that had been coding around 30 years or so), I gave their families and personal space a <i>lot</i> of respect.<p>This was appreciated, and I was rewarded with personal loyalty.<p>The risk to the corporation was that it was <i>personal</i> loyalty. I have no doubts, whatsoever, that, if I had left, the entire team would have left quickly behind me.<p>My management was not as respectful of my personal life, as I was of my employees, but I enjoyed a pretty remarkable level of trust, as I have some fairly well-considered personal Principles.')
