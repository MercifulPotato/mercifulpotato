Though there is this weird trend to heavily suggest otherwise even in supposed serious sources, which has given me a major chip on my shoulder on this issue.<p>What they have is proto-writing. The Mayans have full writing, supposedly, and Aztec &quot;script&quot; seems to look like the Mayan&#x27;s so many assume it must be the same, when it is not at all. Proto-writing pictograms are not at all like cuneiform or Chinese characters. There&#x27;s no word, for example, for the to be verb in any Aztec script&#x2F;pictogram. What nouns you can say exist are only what any picture anywhere would have. You can&#x27;t say &quot;Tototl was feeling despondent on the rainy day of 5th reed&quot; and have someone else read that thought a century later because there are no words to construct a spoken sentence like such. The best you could do is draw a mural with a guy, with rebus device to suggest his name, surrounded by rain, hoping to convey such a sentence. But at that point you&#x27;re just guessing.<p>It changes things a lot. I was reading the blurb on that Fifth Sun book and they were getting quite romantic suggesting a narrative of the true forgotten story of the Aztec in their own words the Spanish conquerors didn&#x27;t want you to know! That&#x27;s so dishonest to a naive audience. Whatever scholarship they are doing it has to be a combination of post-colonial recordings of oral history, post-colonial Spanish or Spanish influenced contemporary writings, and archeology. There is no other way.')
