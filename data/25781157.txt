In 2010, Western Hemi energy demand was ~130 PBtu, while Easter Hemi demand was ~330 PBtu[1], or 2.5x more.<p>So at this same price point, it would be 210T to power the whole world with solar, or 50% more than global GDP in 2019 (but only using 2010 energy consumption numbers, so it&#x27;s actually much more). And of course you&#x27;d need to keep adding more solar as demand went up.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_consumption#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:World_primary_energy_consumption_in_quadrillion_Btu_by_region.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_consumption#&#x2F;medi...</a>')
