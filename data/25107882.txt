The entire article is about one updated app on iOS 14, the health app.<p>The title should be &quot;The new iOS 14 health app is driving me mad&quot;.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not clear on why the author wrote the post. It seems like an admission of being obsessive compulsive.<p>Just ignore the new features in the updated health app. Problem solved?')
