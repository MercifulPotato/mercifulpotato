If that were true, and frivolous requests were being made and dismissed routinely, then GitHub might curb their voluntary &quot;compliance&quot; machine. Is that actually happening, or are you trying to argue that it&#x27;s a slippery slope?<p>If bad complaints are not dismissed by the courts, then it&#x27;s a really bad law, or a bad court. That is a problem for GitHub, granted. If you are shopping for a source code hosting service that will insulate you from such DMCA claims, then sure, GitHub has just shown they won&#x27;t do that. I guess!<p>I&#x27;m not sure that will have any measurable impact on their business model. They were never to my knowledge in the business of providing that kind of protection, before or after Microsoft.')
