For one, unions often diminish individual accomplishments and liberties in favor of what begins as collective interest, and eventually becomes union leadership interest. Unions become an entity themselves, and always trend towards bureaucracy, self-justification, and corruption.<p>I would never, ever join a union. I like having my role and compensation being things that I am free to negotiate based off of my own leverage. The only situation in which unions would serve me are situations in which the power imbalance is so great between the available market employers vs. the employees, that the employees possess little to no leverage in any negotiation. Literally 0 software engineers in America are in such a situation.')
