It&#x27;s why abortion activists call themselves pro-life&#x2F;pro-choice. To take their words at face value is incredibly naive. For example, the line about &quot;economic justice&quot; almost certainly means the authors believe the company should be used as a propaganda vehicle for socialism&#x2F;communism. And the line about a &quot;welcoming environment&quot; is an outright lie as shown by these same employees&#x27; bullying and harassment of numerous wrong-thinking employees (James Damore and Miles Taylor come to mind as a few examples).')
