The FS wasn&#x27;t shutdown without unmounting, or anything like that, but just <i>used</i> intensively. We had heard that you should keep plenty of unused space on BTRFS file systems, and this must be why.<p>The file systems couldn&#x27;t be restored with the official suite of tools. It was a backup anyway and we restored the data from secondary backup.<p>I&#x27;m not positive that there is any other file system that I&#x27;ve ever lost significant data on.')
