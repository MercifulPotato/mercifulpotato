That&#x27;s what I loved about Sublime Text. But I also like an IDE for all the help it gives me, things that the alternative editors don&#x27;t do yet.<p>I&#x27;ve used VS Code for a while as well, it&#x27;s faster than Atom at least but it&#x27;s still web technology which feels like a TON of overhead that no amount of hardware can compensate for.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of Nova, but apparently I installed it and forgot to actually work with the trial so I have no clue how well it works. I also doubt it works for my particular needs, which intellij doesn&#x27;t have a problem with (old codebase with &gt;10K LOC files of php 5.2 code and tons of bad JS, new codebase with Go and Typescript &#x2F; React).')
