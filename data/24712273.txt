Market rates (a measure of local supply and demand) would be more useful.<p>Applying network theory, though <i>up to a substantial fraction of total employment</i>, it&#x27;s <i>absolute</i> and not <i>relative</i> size that matters.<p>As of May 2019, total SF Bay Area tech employment was 835,600, an increase of 116,900 over the December 2000 dot-com peak.  <i>That increase alone would rank 4th on this midwest list.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;05&#x2F;tech-jobs-soar-all-time-record-heights-bay-area-apple-adobe-facebook-google&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;05&#x2F;tech-jobs-soar-all-ti...</a><p>In that 835,600 Bay Area workforce, what you&#x27;re going to find is <i>both</i> breadth <i>and</i> depth.  Need <i>the best</i>, or a top-ten, or <i>the</i> top-ten devs in a specific skill?  You&#x27;ll likely find it.  Need 10, or 100, or 1,000, or 10,000 bodies within a given specialty or skillset?  Likely there as well, certainly <i>more</i> likely than elsewhere.<p>Want to <i>attract</i> remote talent?  Pretty good odds.  At least until housing got too rich and smoke too thick.  Want to swipe local talent?  Noncompetes illegal FTFW, just make a good enough offer.<p>It&#x27;s not as if tech talent competes against non-tech talent.  It doesn&#x27;t.  At least not for jobs.  For housing and transport, yes, but that&#x27;s where the SF Bay Area by and large <i>loses</i>.<p>And I&#x27;m not making the case <i>for</i> the midwest hubs, mostly the opposite.  Unless there&#x27;s some <i>specific</i> centre of excellence ... they&#x27;re simply <i>not</i> going to attract talent.  The body counts are likely for basic tech skills generally.<p>The West coast offers entertainment (VFX&#x2F;CGI&#x2F;gaming), search, social, ads, business automation (Oracle, Salesforce), commerce, HW &amp; devices (Apple), and some relic defense tech, plus modest manufacturing.  NYC has more ads &amp; entertainment, and finance.  DC has government, defence, and surveillance.<p>The midwest has ... relic manufacturing, some new manufacturing, healthcare, food &amp; ag, a lot of back-office work, and ... not too much else that really comes to mind.  Real estate?  (Cratering.)<p>Plus a lot of tech-unfriendly legal and political legacy.<p>Chicago ... <i>kind</i> of has scale?  But at 40% the size of the Bay Area&#x27;s scale, <i>even if equally complex and skilled</i>, by Metcalf&#x27;s law it would have one <i>sixth</i> the net value.<p>(There are plenty of issues with Metcalfe&#x27;s law, this just illustrates how much scale effects alone <i>might</i> affect net prospects.)')
