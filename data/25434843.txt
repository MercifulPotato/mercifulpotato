Simply giving people the capacity to show up with guns is not what the preamble means.<p>Still, I think the rememdy is to amend it out if it is no longer useful; I agree with the plain interpretation that the right is an individual right, not a state right. The preamble can be part of a rational argument for the 2nd Amendment&#x27;s lack of utility toward the end of repealing it; the argument can start with something like &quot;The Second Amendment&#x27;s preamble gives justification to its inclusion in the Constitution. That justification clearly doesn&#x27;t apply to the modern world because modern civil defense looks nothing like what the Founders envisioned. It&#x27;s time to ask whether the Second Amendment places contortions on proper regulation of deadly weapons that hinder a free and happy society in the 21st century.&quot;')
