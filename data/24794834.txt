I do not have 12% annualized returns.<p>Indeed, I just checked portfolio visualizer, which gives a 1997-2020 return of 8.5% CAGR for the 500.  My guess is you started adding in 2007 (so your principal was very small during the great financial crisis) and you&#x27;ve been adding during the entire recovery.  You don&#x27;t know how lucky you are.  Of course, maybe you just bought QQQ in 1997.  Again, you don&#x27;t know how lucky you are.<p>The number of fallacious assumptions embedded in your syllogism is difficult to unpack. I&#x27;ll start with one, past returns are not indicative of futures results.
