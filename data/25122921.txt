Some will say that they can make a cool dropdown in 2 minutes with 20 divs and some js and css, the issue is this 2 minutes components have lot of bugs and missing features (accessibility, keyboard supports, missing events) and then if you need the same dropdown in other section but you need to add 1 small thing you duplicate it again.<p>For comparison in GUI toolkits you use the existing feature complete dropdown. And if you need more customization you extend the dropdown and override it&#x27;s render&#x2F;paint function and you can painted as you want. What I liked about this powerfull GUI toolits is that most of the time you used the built in stuff so all application look consistent and only special apps would create custom stuff.<p>I wish browser makers would focus on improving the existing DOM elements and adding a few more so we could use native ones instead of having to implement custom shit because the designer wants the component to look in a specific way but  you can&#x27;t CSS the native element to get the result.')
