It’s not hard to implement, it’s just that nobody does it, because it’s dumb.<p>You seem to have a very Java-centered view of the universe, because it is absolutely not true in most languages that inlined calls preserve call stacks. Call stacks are debug information, and there’s absolutely no requirement for compilers to preserve debug information while doing optimization. Requiring that would be lunacy, and it would prohibit a huge number of optimizations (or require costly bookkeeping).<p>I don’t know what the situation is in Java-land, but if Java preserves inlining information in call stacks using bookkeeping, then good for it, I guess. It can’t come for free, so you’re taking a performance hit for that pleasure. It’s certainly not something that is common, or commonly understood as a requirement for optimization.')
