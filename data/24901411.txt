Need your whole body, surely?. This overlaps with Transporter problem from Star Trek and the Prestige, it&#x27;s not you who lives in there, just a copy.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be a problem if it isn&#x27;t the same you or if the old you dies. Linear continuity is rooted in our biology, and this would be something entirely new that requires new ways of thinking about it.<p>Reconstituting memories and information would be a game changer. Imagine manipulating them! Making them more efficient encodings, removing inaccuracies, etc. (There&#x27;s a lot of potential for bad here too.) Cloning memories, merging them...<p>If you&#x27;re extremely concerned about not being the same person, maybe consciousness can expand to fill a vacuum? I&#x27;m not particularly concerned, but there might be ways of dealing with the issue.<p>This is all so sci-fi that it probably makes the researchers laugh and shake their heads.')
