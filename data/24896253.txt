Although my time-with-product has been relatively short (a week or so), I am really happy with it.<p>Pros:<p>- Ryzen 7 4750U is awesome.<p>- Lots of RAM.<p>- Easily customizable orders from Lenovo with great features to add<p>- Renoir graphics are pretty solid<p>- keyboard is fantastic, classic ThinkPad feel and usability<p>- Easy to upgrade. Ordered with a 128GB nvme and immediately upgraded to a 1TB, saved about $200.<p>- docking station allows for easy desktop use with multiple monitors<p>Cons:<p>- libfprint is still in it&#x27;s early stages imo, so the finger printer reader is tough to set up with linux.<p>- no backlit keyboard (on the one I ordered, can&#x27;t remember if that was an option or not)')
