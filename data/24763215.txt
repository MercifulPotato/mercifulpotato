Item(by='nikkwong', descendants=None, kids=[24763448], score=None, time=1602574889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763029, text='I agree with your sentiment, but let me play devil&#x27;s advocate to potentially turn over a few stones.<p>&gt; communications agencies around the world have provided us with well researched safe exposure limits and compliance<p>Based on what evidence though? Aren&#x27;t their conclusions based on the general consensus that epidemiologists have gathered over the last few decades demonstrating that RFs don&#x27;t cause cancer? IMO, that&#x27;s a low bar; and they have a history of time and time again approving technologies, food products, and chemicals that in hindsight prove to have far worse health implications than originally believed.<p>I think citing any one individual study is a flawed argumentative technique, so I&#x27;ll just say I was certainly surprised when Scientific American (whom I find to be in the top 5 publications in terms of credibility) published this piece[0] stating that speculating on the health effects of 5G are not completely unwarranted. The piece is an op-ed but I have found that Scientific American is very selective in what they do choose to publish. I assume the claims they are making on the effects of EMF in the piece are based on the totality of the evidence.<p>Practically speaking though yes, like you, I don&#x27;t pay thought to it. Though if we do eventually realize that these technologies did end up having some negative health externalities I will find myself unsurprised.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;we-have-no...</a>')
