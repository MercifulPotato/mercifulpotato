Restricted docker containers for all local testing. There&#x27;s a reason various companies do not give developers admin access to their machines.<p>edit: This or related concepts (SDLC, audit logs reviewed weekly, security team sign offs on system changes, etc.) are in my experience pretty standard in large enterprise security reviews for vendors that were high risk. The issue is that everyone probably lies and doesn&#x27;t actually do any of these things even if they say they do. The incentives are set up to certify vendors rather than fail them.')
