The weirdest part to me was how FEW correlations they have to offer.<p>If I give a large group 4,000+ pieces of random information and a multi-year block of history, I&#x27;d expect the number of interesting and surprising coincidences to be staggering. Instead, the &quot;deltas&quot; and obsession with 17 is weak at best. One could say that it is more interesting that so many Q posts somehow have so very little in common with anything at all.')
