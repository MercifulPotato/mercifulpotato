We were students at Rice together. Not saying we knew each other well, more like passing acquaintances, but I recognize his name.<p>Anyway, as I recall from compilers classes (it has been ~30 years), the Dragon book heavily emphasized parsing, but the professor said &quot;I&#x27;ll assign you a parse to do by hand for homework, but and that&#x27;s it&quot;.<p>The overall attitude was a combo of 1) parsing theory is also covered in another theory of computation class (where the classic textbook was at the time &quot;Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation&quot; by Hopcroft and Ullman, but these days may also be Sipser&#x27;s book; 2) there were so many other topics to cover in compilers that a week or so of parsing was all the time budget allowed; and 3) the research focus of the professor&#x27;s work was in other areas, and compiler research in general was the same.<p>So not enough attention to parsing might be a side effect (perhaps unfortunate). Even if there is enough material to have an entire class on parsing.<p>I took the advanced course in compilers too, which was more like a topics class - a research paper every week or so. I don&#x27;t remember anything about parsing there either.')
