Item(by='voisin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604003049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934367, text='&gt; You should not have any expectation of privacy once you are outside the confines of your house.<p>My first reaction was “what a sad dystopian position.” But then I thought further and while I agree in general, I think “privacy” needs a bit more nuance to it. If you are outside should it be against the law to have a camera that films you for security? No I don’t think so. There is a reasonable expectation that business and home owners will have security cameras to protect their property. But in the case of filming you in order to monetize your likeness and shopping habits, I think this goes a step too far, and becomes broadly unacceptable as too intrusive. Should I only be able to retain my information (likeness, shopping habits) by hiding in my home? That’s the dystopian part.')
