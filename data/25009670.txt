Like a month ago I came up with a similar metaphor. Only, instead of a health inspector, I focused on the fact that dirty dishes get piled up.<p>You put them in the sink. The sink gets full. You put them on the table, on the stove, on the counter-top, on the floor. You can hardly walk. You&#x27;re working on a little corner on the table because the rest is full of stuff. How are you supposed to continue to work efficiently with all that clutter?<p>The manager cares only of how fast you can get food out the door. To them, washing dishes is a waste of time and money. Customers aren&#x27;t paying you to wash dishes. They&#x27;re paying for the food.<p>The problem is seeing how the buildup of clutter affects the speed of preparation of food.<p>Of course, quality is also affected. For example, you need a sieve. It&#x27;s dirty; you used it for flour. Now, you want to use it for powdered sugar. Well, that&#x27;s similar enough, right? There&#x27;s no time for washing; the customer is waiting.')
