It creates the same output signal in response to a photon every time.<p>Varying the pseudo-ISO simply varies the gain of the downstream post-readout amplifier. That&#x27;s where noise is introduced.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s better to take a deliberately underexposed photo and tweak regions of it in post to achieve the desired exposure instead of introducing global noise from in-camera amplification.')
