The original community was on Slack as well.<p>We moved our community chit-chat to GitHub when we were invited to the Discussions beta. The main reason why I like it: It moves discussion closer to the code. Specifically it creates a nice swim lane next to `Issues`. I think of a progression of `Discussion` =&gt; `Issue` =&gt; `PR&#x27;. It gets discussion out of issues and PRs and declutters comments.')
