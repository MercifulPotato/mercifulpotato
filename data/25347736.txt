The details and pricing may have changed, but as far as I know, the commercial Qt Embedded product has always required a distribution license. This means you have to pay a royalty fee for each product that you sell that uses Qt. This is on top of the license you pay per developer to develop the software. If development is &quot;done&quot; but you are still distributing the product, presumably you would have had to pay the distribution license but could let the development license lapse. Has this changed with Qt 6?')
