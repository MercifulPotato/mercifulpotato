I spent a lot of time with this yesterday analysing it in a VM and I couldn’t find any cases where on reboot it caused chkdsk to actually take any actions. It always found the file system clean.<p>What it seems to do is trigger a consistency check for the next reboot and some alarmist notifications. This is probably a simple check assertion somewhere which is seeing unexpected data passing through a call.<p>That is a problem but significantly less of one than actual corruption.<p>If anyone has evidence to the contrary and steps to reproduce it I’d be interested to try them.')
