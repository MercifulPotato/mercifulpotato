One, there are now many more places to buy advertising. People are seeing more advertising than they ever did before, and there is more competition to provide space. Two, demographic targeting.<p>Suppose you sell widgets at a margin of $10&#x2F;customer. You buy an ad in the newspaper, 10% of the readers are prospective customers, 5% of the prospective customers buy the product because of the ad, so showing the ad to 50,000 readers is worth $2500. The newspaper knows this, and the market lacks competition, so that&#x27;s about how much they charge.<p>The internet comes in. Now you can target based on demographics, so the percentage of people who see your ad who are prospective customers is now 40% instead of 10%, and showing it to 50,000 people is now worth $10,000. But there are also many more sites competing to sell advertising, so the ad network doesn&#x27;t get $10,000, it gets e.g. $1000.<p>Then the advertiser says holy cow, we can make $10,000 by buying $1000 in advertising? Buy more until diminishing returns causes the marginal value to get back to breakeven. Go buy $5000 in advertising. They end up spending twice as much as before even though the price is lower. (Remember though that advertising is mostly zero sum. The advertiser isn&#x27;t actually making a ton more money all of a sudden because their competitors do the same thing and it cancels out. They&#x27;re only buying that amount of advertising because that&#x27;s the amount of sales they <i>lose</i> if they <i>don&#x27;t</i>.)<p>So the advertiser pays twice as much as they used to in order to get more value (or avoid losing more value) than they used to. But most of the money is going to Facebook and Google and diffused out to a million random kitten blogs, when it used to go to local media outlets.')
