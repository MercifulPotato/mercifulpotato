Pets can and do cause a lot of damage. They can urinate on the floors or walls, leaving odor that is very difficult to remove. They can chew up or scratch up doors, walls, floors. A pet can easily do thousands of dollars in damage in a one-year lease term. Of course not every pet does this but you don&#x27;t know in advance.<p>On the other hand landlords compete for tenants. So they may want to allow pets but impose a surcharge for the potential damage.')
