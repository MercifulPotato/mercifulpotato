Also, wheat varieties are engineered to output a lot of it. So at some point our body says &quot;no more&quot;.<p>As soon as you stop eating what&#x27;s bad for you, your body is going to forget that it once tolerated what is not tolerable.<p>So it&#x27;s a one-way street. Once you stop you can&#x27;t go back. I feel indeed much much better since I stopped gluten and milk-based stuff. But yes, it becomes a social problem as friends don&#x27;t understand and in some countries, restaurants just don&#x27;t give a sh*t and blatantly lie when they don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s not fun to spend the evening with a distressed belly after eating what&#x27;s wrong for your body.')
