I seem to be building decent spacial awareness or muscle memory on some of the more common frets (3-9) and seem to be getting an ear for standard tuning. Songs with different fret positions (12-15 especially) seem to give me some trouble. I think I just need more consistent practice. It&#x27;s still fun though. Memorizing complete songs will be a challenge.')
