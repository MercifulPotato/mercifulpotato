The thing is it made me lactose intolerant and very sensitive against sleep deprivation.<p>What basically happens is stomach pains from time to time and that I need to visit the bathroom quite often, sometimes in a big hurry.<p>I&#x27;m living basically as before, eating too much lactose still and getting too little sleep. I am starting to get better on it though.<p>Get enough sleep is a big point in general I believe if you want to your body to be healthy. Also eat healthy and move a lot. I have a standing desk and tries to stand most of the day. It helps a lot.')
