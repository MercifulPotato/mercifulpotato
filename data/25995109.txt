The NSCC is not a government agency but an industrial consortium of sorts.  The formula they use to determine margin requirements for a given stock has a &quot;discretionary&quot; parameter that can be raised at will. Ken Griffin didn&#x27;t need to ask Robinhood to delist GME directly, he just could&#x27;ve told his buddies at the NSCC to raise margin requirements so high that Robinhood &amp; other brokers didn&#x27;t have any other choice.')
