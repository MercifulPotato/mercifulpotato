Further, it appears that only official LineageOS versions are taken into account, but for some phones much newer TWRP &amp; LineageOS versions are available (such as the 2017 mido that has well maintained ROMs with Android 11 and recent kernels). And even a screen replacement is only 20$ &amp; maybe 20 more if you want to have a repair technician do it for you (it does involve heat gun and glue admittedly).')
