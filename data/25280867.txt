That said most things are there for a reason and once I dig in I usually see the need.<p>That said I do love it despite its warts.  There&#x27;s no doubt some Stockholm Syndrome at play here, but I love the API (which is pretty curlable btw, a mark of a great API IMHO) and the principles (declarative, everything&#x27;s a YAML&#x2F;JSON object in etcd, etc).  I see it the same way I did C++ (which I also loved).  It gives you <i>great power</i> which you can use to build an elegant, robust system, or you can create an unmaintainable, complex, monster of a nightmare.  It&#x27;s up to you.')
