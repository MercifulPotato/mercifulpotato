I don’t care how ineffective it was. I’d want it investigated and stopped.<p>The level of interference to the election was so trivial I doubt you can back that attitude up. At some level of ineffectiveness, having an investigation and stopping the activity is more costly than just ignoring it. Investigations take time, money and it turns out have collateral damage:<p>Looking at the charges out of the Mueller investigation, for example [0]:<p>- ~80% of those charged are beyond the reach of the US government and the charges aren&#x27;t going to be tested. Weak evidence that whatever it was they were doing did anything given the Trump 2020 election counts were pretty similar to&#x2F;improved on the 2016 counts.<p>- ~15% of those remaining hadn&#x27;t done anything wrong until they were hit with process crimes in the investigation itself (counting those with only &quot;false statements&quot; charges + R. Stone).<p>- ~5% of charges I can&#x27;t be bothered to read up on, but given that 95% of the charges are scrambling to find a problem I doubt the remainder are all that impressive.<p>I&#x27;m not deeply up to speed on the all 5 of those &quot;false statement&quot; charges - but the one against Flynn were probably politically motivated. They were interviewing him about a call where the investigators already had a transcript of the call. It is unclear why they were charging him for what could be a mismemory of routine diplomacy.<p>By my reckoning, at least 75% of the charges in the Muller investigation that could actually be prosecuted were crimes that wouldn&#x27;t have existed except for the Muller investigation! That is a big cost for what turned out to be nothing much. Even if you want to use some sort of irrational strategy as a deterrent the cost is higher than the benefit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Criminal_charges_brought_in_the_Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%932019)#Table_of_charges" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Criminal_charges_brought_in_th...</a>')
