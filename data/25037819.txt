What&#x27;s interesting is that with regulations around aerospace SpaceX can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t hire Canadians. The country effectively went 180 degree backward from the Nortel years when it seemed interested in being a pioneer in network tech to simply being a consumer. Seeing how Nortel didn&#x27;t protect it&#x27;s IP again foreign nations, that&#x27;s probably a good thing that SpaceX doesn&#x27;t hire Canadians.<p>This pattern also extends to the rest of what remains of the Canadian aerospace sector. When Trump slapped tariffs later judged to be illegal on the Bombardier CSeries the Trudeau government simply... looked away and did nothing, allowing Airbus to swoop in and grab the plane and it&#x27;s IP. Again, Canada will handle some assembly while engineering moves to Europe.<p>Are these measures... popular with the Canadian public? Help me understand here.')
