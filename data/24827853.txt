It was amazing. DND was something I wanted to try for a long time but the barrier to entry was (at least, perceived to be) really high.<p>Great to see this finally launching. I&#x27;ll be recommending this service to anyone who&#x27;s interested in dipping their toe into DND. I also love that you&#x27;re making being a &quot;Professional Dungeon Master&quot; a plausible future career choice. :)')
