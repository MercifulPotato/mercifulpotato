Passing certification, or &#x27;going gold&#x27;, means the game is ready, can be completed, and has all content in it.

Going gold means the branch is cut, it&#x27;s in the can, and discs are being printed. Just admit that you exaggerated for press coverage and get over it. No one really cares about another month delay, but lying about going gold is just bizarre.')
