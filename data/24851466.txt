Someone with knowledge of code generation and compilers could take this Matlab feature as an inspiration and implement a C code generator for Julia functions.<p>&gt; Right now, it appears like a niche interpreted language for numeric geeks only.<p>Yes, it was designed for numerical and scientific computing. In Julia, you can at least prototype the numerical algorithm before implementing in C++ or Fortran.')
