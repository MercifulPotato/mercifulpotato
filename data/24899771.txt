Let the people decide for themselves what is true and false.<p>Basically the social media company argument is... we think people are too dumb to figure out what is &quot;real&quot; or not so we are going to censor. That to me is an extremely damning view of the common person.<p>But then, everywhere on the platform.. &quot;make a plan to vote&quot;. So you trust people to vote but don&#x27;t trust them with the unfiltered information so they can inform themselves without outside intervention?')
