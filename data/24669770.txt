How could they be evil if they&#x27;re getting people to spend less time on FB?&quot;<p>50M hours &#x2F; 1.5B DAU is about .03 hours, or about &lt;2 minutes per person. The average person spends 1h15m on FB, this is less than a 3% drop in overall time, but likely a larger proportion of that time is spent scrolling and seeing more ads than it is fixed on a single video.')
