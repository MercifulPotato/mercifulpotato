The friends last mobile location was in X parents house (before it went offline).<p>We have already reported it to police and the investigation has started.<p>The police will obtain authorization to get into the X&#x27;s house tomorrow.<p>How can I help the investigation? (I am a computer scientist.) For example, is there a way to hack into X&#x27;s online accounts (our police isn&#x27;t that great with technology)? Or can I theoretically break the door to his house, so that police can search it sooner?')
