I was hoping that the embedded JS would have working metrics for the viewed width&#x2F;height, which it does not.<p>That means that mouse events and such have transformed coordinates, not matching the position of the cursor.<p>I have this small project demonstrating the ways embedded JS gets rendered.\nI think I&#x27;m going to revise it and see if both projects can be merged.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xyzzy&#x2F;scripted-svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xyzzy&#x2F;scripted-svg</a>')
