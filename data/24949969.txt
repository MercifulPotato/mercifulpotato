The fact that I hear almost 0 about health and minimizing comorbidity issues is astounding. Yes, I realize people can&#x27;t all of a sudden not have co-morbidities, but we can instill these behaviors now with evidence that may help prevent issues the next time something like this transpires.<p>This is befuddling given that many that have died from Covid-19 have had co-morbidness and have suffered from life style diseases.<p>One positive side effect of the pandemic is that a lot of people have stopped smoking.
