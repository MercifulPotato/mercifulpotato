If you have restricted budget and can choose the time when you record, this is a very good option that I always recommend to people I talk to.<p>On the other hand, when you do remote work you don&#x27;t choose the time. Also, you will probably have other considerations for your desk placement. In the end it is much more important that you feel comfortable when working at your desk than to have good lighting in your webcam for your coworkers.<p>So, if you like to sit front to the window then sure, go on. But if that would make you uncomfortable then I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.')
