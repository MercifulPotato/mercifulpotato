If it’s to high, then stuff gets fried, two low and stuff just doesn’t turn on.<p>The amps are determined by how much the receiving device can consume. And of course decreases as the device charges (if you’ve got a full battery, then you don’t need more power). If the receiving device pulls to many amps, then the voltage will start to drop, this then causes the receiving device to reduce its power consumption.<p>Ultimately power electronics are extremely robust today, you would have to try very hard to fry modern electronics. This is a result of how modern electronics converts power, which naturally makes them very robust to fluctuating inputs. (I’m simplifying a lot, want to learn more then look up DC-DC converters, and see how they’re implemented in silicon)<p>In short, just don’t worry.')
