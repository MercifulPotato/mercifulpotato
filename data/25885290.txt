Similarly, &quot;Stumbling on Happiness&quot; is an easy introduction to the psychology of happiness, but also tells you a lot about perception, memory and decision-making, and the illusions and biases we have. And finally &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot; is a slightly deeper and longer but still accessible book that digs into the details about how many of the biases we have (that the other books talk about) arise due to the interplay between the conscious and unconscious parts of our brains - it felt like a deeper explanation, but I&#x27;m glad I read after reading about most of the biases before in the &quot;lighter&quot; books.')
