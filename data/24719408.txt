Look at the mess that is all the typedefs and defines in the Win32 API for example. It&#x27;s extremely hard not to pass in the wrong typedefs, and there must be extremely few programmers who know which aliases are the same on every platform and which could change.<p>Aside, newtypes (Or the equivalent in C for example, wrapping a single member in a struct) can be very annoying. I would advicse against this, just like I&#x27;d advise against using type aliases.')
