We are building a cloud product but there&#x27;s a ruthless crack down on cloud costs (2 30-minute meetings involving some of the most highly paid people in the company) with the result that most things go untested.

There are other reasons too but there&#x27;s a clear lack of common sense. I lost 2 weeks of valuable work to one of these &#x27;crack downs&#x27;.')
