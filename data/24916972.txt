Asia causing millions of casualties, literally destroying cities, taking sex-slaves on mass, i.e. &#x27;Horrors of Mechanized 20th century&#x27; - on par with Nazis. Not some localized trade dispute with a pack of merchant marines firing on innocents, &#x27;monopolizing trade of a few sectors&#x27;.')
