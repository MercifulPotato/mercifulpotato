This was the introduction of differentials in my son&#x27;s high school.<p>I am a physicist, so I started the other way round, by talking about speed, how it is calculated, how one can get more precise by shortening time and that, eventually, we get to the exact momentary speed.<p>My son started to ask all kind of question such as how to &quot;get closer&quot; on my wavely drawing, to which I told him &quot;good question - this is possible only when we know the function d(t)&quot;, etc.<p>It is only when he understood the general reason for differentials to exist that we went back to the conditions (continuity, planes, etc.). He actually deduced the continuity constraint himself because he understood the &quot;why&quot;.<p>My math told told us once &quot;I will show you a neat trick that you will not understand this year, but when you understand it next year it will be way less useful to you. Just know that it works only when this and that&quot;.<p>So lack of perfection is sometimes useful for people to understand something at all and not wander off after the first two introductory sentences.')
