I&#x27;ve never been thrown from my seat at work. (Ok -- once.) At work I&#x27;ve never been surrounded by a group of strangers having a shouting argument. And much more.<p>And there were many bus trips where I would not get a seat until the very end of the ride, and still manage to get work done. A single burst of work was frustrating, but you&#x27;d make the most of it. Honestly - it was a transformative experience. I completely agree with you here:<p>&gt; it helps substantially to know that even if I only do 2 minutes of the thing, I&#x27;m making progress.<p>...and that was the trick for me. Transforming it from &quot;in 2 minutes I won&#x27;t even get the IDE loaded&quot; to a situation where &quot;in 2 minutes I&#x27;ll make small but genuine progress, progress that I can <i>bank</i>. A tiny but solid win.&quot; And seeing that happen over and over is what got my brain into a place where I would be kind of &quot;proud&quot; instead of &quot;frustrated&quot;.<p>With this topic in general, when you say:<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t like the &quot;wear running shoes&quot; example either<p>...I think maybe you&#x27;d need to go back to the real source of this stuff, which is not the linked article, and not James Clear, but Fogg. Also the book &#x27;the power of habit&#x27; by Duhigg is quite in depth.<p>Because if you only read the 1-minute pop-psychology versions it&#x27;s very easy to pick holes in it and it looks quite superficial, I get that. They present it as just little &quot;hacks&quot; and how can you get a deep trust in it, if it&#x27;s just gimmicky little hacks?<p>Anyway, best wishes.')
