I have external motivation to produce results on a weekly basis.<p>2. I have to be able to justify all my decisions to everyone on the internet (anyone who cares at least...). I end up thinking things through more deeply.<p>3. I get continuous feedback from others - not nearly as good as a cofounder who&#x27;s 100% in the business, but still helpful.')
