For me the &quot;cultural&quot; aspects are quite important (discussions, people you meet, etc) but that may not be true for everyone.<p>Also if you are perfectly capable but feel you need to alter your &quot;credibility brand&quot; the actual quality of the education may not matter.  I have a friend who enrolled in grad school entirely to meet people, ended dropping out part way through to start a company, and did fine.  So there are many paths to &quot;success&quot;.')
