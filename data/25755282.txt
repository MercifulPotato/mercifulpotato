I was born there, has the country passport, don&#x27;t mind 2 week quarantine, commercial airlines have expressed interest but they are simply not allowed. Only a pitiful amount of repatriation flights are done.<p>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s harder to go back to my home country than to get a visa to the US. I&#x27;m lucky I can stay long-ish term in the US but many many others are screwed.<p>I understand the country is underequipped to deal with a lot of people coming back and it&#x27;s better to protect many more people inside but I do feel forgotten sometimes. What&#x27;s the point of having the citizenship then if I can&#x27;t even come home?')
