Experience ordering around &#x27;underlings&#x27; isn&#x27;t enough for this job. &#x27;Charisma&#x27; isn&#x27;t experience.<p>Evidence of fitness would help. Significant elected public governing experience might provide a record of success as evidence.<p>Maybe, just maybe, there should be some way to get rid of a Bozo (like the UK has).')
