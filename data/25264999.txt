They are providing a shitty experience while doing it.<p>Of course from an economic point of view they are right! For businesses it still makes sense to do this most of the time (especially since webapps are crippled on iOS) due to the large user base. If they didn&#x27;t have that user base I&#x27;d bet very few people would tolerate this crap.<p>This is one of the handful of reasons that I boycott Apple, I find their business practices morally unacceptable.<p>[1] Sub-standard for CI&#x2F;server use cases.')
