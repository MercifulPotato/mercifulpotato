If you are a confident power user and you are happy to spend some time debugging things when they go wrong, then please try out Dendrite. If you are a community, organisation or business that demands stability and uptime, then Dendrite is not for you yet - please install Synapse instead.<p>&gt; Does Dendrite support push notifications?<p>No, not yet. This is a planned feature.<p>&gt; Does Dendrite support application services&#x2F;bridges?<p>Possibly - Dendrite does have some application service support but it is not well tested. Please let us know by raising a GitHub issue if you try it and run into problems.')
