So if there&#x27;s a disagreement on the right way to implement something, you&#x27;ll likely see multiple competing implementations, because people would rather implement their own library than use something they see as the wrong approach. Hopefully over the long term this means the best approach wins out and the ecosystem will converge on it, but with the small number of people involved this tends to be a slow process.')
