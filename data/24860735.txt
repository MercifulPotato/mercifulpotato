It isn&#x27;t a compromised version of a gasoline vehicle. It truly is an ambitious approach to an electric vehicle. Like triple the power of past Hummers and with more range (!) than the conventional gas guzzlers.<p>It has a bunch of interesting features that showcase the best of GM&#x27;s engineers. It really is a good flagship. By going for the most machismo vehicle in the line-up, they&#x27;re helping Tesla destroy any last vestige of electric vehicles as just fancy golf carts.\nI mean, this was (and in some circles, still is) the popular perception of electric vehicles 17 years ago: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CcmZ1dof3Qw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CcmZ1dof3Qw</a><p>(Also, in absolute terms, they get the biggest emissions advantage over a conventional powertrain this way. Convert a Hummer from conventional to electric saves like 1 pound of CO2 per mile driven versus like 0.25 pounds saved per mile for, like, a subcompact car.)<p>Vehicles like this are super important for helping convince the general public that climate action and electrification of transport doesn&#x27;t mean diminished capacity and a smaller, more boring future.<p>I was super impressed by the video GM released on it. I have said skeptical things about past &quot;Tesla killers&quot; and I am very much a Tesla fan, but I only have good things to say about this.<p>With such a huge battery capacity, it might even be useful for towing, who knows!')
