That is a result of the internet, but smartphones supercharged it as they add constant availability to the mix.<p>The issue with social media is that it is specifically designed to distract and grab attention, and the information they use is mostly gossip crowd sourced by their users to sell advertising against.<p>There needs to be some real education about how to use social media responsibly during schooling, and the companies also need some strong regulation to stop the exploitation.<p>The harm done is similar to gambling in my view and needs to be regulated in a similar way.
