Just wait till you hear what other animals are named! For your reference I&#x27;ve attached a photo of the eponymous magnificent beast in question [0].<p>There are ~14 billion USDT minted, and BTC alone is going for a market cap of 500bi.<p>$14B my dude, that information is <i>stale</i> as all heck. They&#x27;re printing $700 million dollars worth per day right now. Their market cap just reached $24B. Remember just days ago when microstrat announced a blockbuster $400M investment? Tether prints that every 12 hours.<p>See the way market cap works is you only have to control the most recent trade to set the market cap. That means literally nothing. The old trope goes if you print 1 trillion of your own crypto and sell it to a buddy for $1, that&#x27;s a $1T market cap.<p>$24B of cash, with $700M new printed every single day buying up Bitcoin is absolutely enough to control the price. That&#x27;s simple economics, and you can find an explanation anywhere. I can of course provide you with an article if you find yourself unable to obtain one.<p>&gt; Also, it&#x27;s interesting how you downplay the fact that the Fed printed 22% of the dollars in circulation in 2020 alone with the majority of it destined to bail out banks and surely to end up under control of Wall Street.<p>This is utterly irrelevant. The inflation rate is trending around 2% per annum. If that goes up, they&#x27;ll print less or claw back more. Supply is not the only factor in the determination of inflation, velocity of money is critical. I suggest you learn more about the money supply before trying to reinvent it.<p>In fact if we pretend for a moment that bitcoin is a currency, you can see that while the supply is flat-ish, the price is skyrocketing. This is massively deflationary for a currency, and this is in fact, in part, due to a reduction in velocity of money (aka HODL BRUH).<p>&gt; Perhaps if the crypto projects start saying that the funds are going to gender studies your worries will be eased?<p>I have no idea where you&#x27;re going with that and I won&#x27;t be following you. This has nothing to do with social policy and everything to do with the North Korean government collecting hundreds of millions of dollars to fund their nuclear weapons program.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alaskaphotographics.com&#x2F;alaska-photo-articles&#x2F;muskox-photos&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alaskaphotographics.com&#x2F;alaska-photo-articles&#x2F;mu...</a>')
