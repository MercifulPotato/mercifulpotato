I didn’t make my point very well, but essentially I believe that Apple has found a positive spin for the fact that they decided to reduce their input costs by removing the bundled charger. They did that at the same time that they - first the first time ever - included a USB-C to Lightning cable.<p>If it were about saving the planet and not just reducing costs they could have included a discount voucher to allow anyone buying an iPhone who genuinely needs a charger to get one without incurring an extra expense.<p>Ultimately it is a good thing if we reduce the number of unused chargers being manufactured, but right now I suspect many iPhone 12 buyers had to buy a new charger anyways and wound up paying extra for it. In that case it’s rather cynical of Apple to pass it off as being for the environment when the benefits accrue to them.')
