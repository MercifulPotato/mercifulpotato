It incorporates elements from most european languages families (balto-slavic, germanic, romance), and the grammar is most particularly inspired by slavic languages.<p>And it was pretty much a goal of its creator to be both familiar and foreign for different european language families, as he had experienced division in Poland between speakers  of those different families and wanted to have something more universal to gather them all together.')
