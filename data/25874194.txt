Fine.]<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good blog post for the right reader, but for something to land on HN front page, I generally look for either:<p>1) a story that, while specialized, reveals something accessibly technical and interesting to a semi-expert crowd, or<p>2) explains something at a sufficient level of expertise&#x2F;detail that people not in the middle of it can grasp and apply to their own knowledge.<p>This story seems not accessible to the general reader.  Or it reads like someone&#x27;s private notes.  I think it needs a level of abstraction or summary to be accessible to the readership here.')
