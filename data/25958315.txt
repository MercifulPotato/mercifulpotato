I want online platforms to have the power to moderate.</i><p>I&#x27;m very anti-regulation in general, but I think that regulation is absolutely needed regarding censorship of DMs on platforms like Messenger, WhatsApp, and the like.  Posts and groups are one thing, but they&#x27;re also censoring people&#x27;s private conversations.<p>There are entire domains that you can&#x27;t even link your friends to via Messenger.  This is a dangerous situation.  Much of our society&#x27;s only contact details for much of their social graph is via these censored platforms that can suspend you on a whim.<p>Regulation to enforce availability of data and contacts export&#x2F;takeout after suspension would be good at the very least. Saying something the platform doesn&#x27;t like shouldn&#x27;t cut you off from your address book.')
