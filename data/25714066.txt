I was fairly outspoken about defending their right to expression, but that was only to &quot;safe&quot; groups of friends rather than the general public. (Of course, now that ISIS is basically dead I can be a bit more free with my words and admit to disliking them being censored)<p>Regarding your kids agitating example, as a society we already do plenty of brainwashing of kids, it&#x27;s why our ideas of right and wrong are so different from 200 years back.<p>Also, we had near absolute free speech on most of the internet for most of the 2000s, so your fearmongering there rings hollow.')
