I&#x27;m all-in, <i>except</i> for Fahrenheit for human-related things.<p>Along with the benefits you mentioned, the Celsius scale, being a scale, does not have most of the benefits that the rest of the metric system has. You don&#x27;t take advantage of powers of ten (we don&#x27;t talk about kilodegrees Celsius), and you don&#x27;t do conversion to other units. For those things, you need Kelvin anyways.')
