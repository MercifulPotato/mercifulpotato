Back to the 80-90s!<p>This is the last memory &amp; perfomance increase we can grab now without adding too much complexity!<p>You can try the engine without half float here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.binarytask.com&#x2F;task?id=5959519327505901449" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;talk.binarytask.com&#x2F;task?id=5959519327505901449</a>')
