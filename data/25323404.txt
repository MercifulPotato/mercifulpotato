Just to be disagreeable? I didn&#x27;t post anything bad or misleading.<p>I&#x27;ve found that it is entirely possible to be both polite, and <i>quite</i> firm.<p>Dishonesty is a big deal to me. I am <i>incredibly</i> honest and straightforward (&quot;Blunt&quot; is the word that has often been used). I worked <i>many</i> years, at a fairly deep level, for a Japanese corporation, where Honesty and Ethics were Principal currencies. In fact, I have been accused of being &quot;disrespectful,&quot; when I have been entirely respectful, but unyielding. There are a lot of people that consider the definition of &quot;respect&quot; to read <i>&quot;Bends over and squeals for me.&quot;</i><p>I can deal with discourtesy, if it is <i>honest</i> discourtesy, but you won&#x27;t get anything but honesty <i>and</i> courtesy from me (believe me, that has not always been the case, but I don&#x27;t like to fight all the time, like I used to). These will, of course, be accompanied by very ethical behavior (which, sadly, does not mean that I&#x27;m a &quot;doormat&quot;).<p>If you want to live your own life on different terms, then knock yourself out. We probably won&#x27;t cross paths, much.')
