Of the 100 or so interviews I&#x27;ve done in the past few years I&#x27;d say about 2% were White American, 5% were of East Asian origin, and the rest of South Asian origin. Fact is if Silicon Valley firms actually want to be diverse, that is to say accurately represent the demographics of the USA, they need to hire more White Americans, not fewer.')
