Millions of patients suffer from conditions that can be treated—and possibly cured—by delivering DNA or RNA sequences to the right cells.  But these are very early days: data and engineering will be instrumental in propelling the field forward. This is where Patch Bio operates.<p>We are a multidisciplinary team of experts passionate about making a difference for patients and solving challenging technical problems. We offer great benefits, including full health care and generous time off. We welcome remote team members—and if you want to join us in person, our lab is located in SoHo, in the heart of NYC.
