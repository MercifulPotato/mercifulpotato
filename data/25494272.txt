What I&#x27;m hoping we&#x27;ll see is a total rethink of what&#x27;s possible in a lens; adapting this new technology to make new designs that exceed what was possible before, rather than just matching it. If they can bring costs down by making use of this new tech then I think it will re-open the market for &quot;I want something that does more than a phone camera&quot;. At the moment lens prices are pretty bonkers but I think that Canon f&#x2F;11 lens is a great indicator; it&#x27;s basically less than 1&#x2F;10th of the cost of a traditional 800mm lens and does more than enough for most people.')
