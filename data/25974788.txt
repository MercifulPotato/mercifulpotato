I mean, I strongly disagree, but I acknowledge your position of not supporting protections beyond that.<p>But you should know that that isn&#x27;t what other people generally mean when they say &quot;free speech&quot;. For example, most people would also say that freedom of speech also requires that people aren&#x27;t fined money for saying things that they believe, or things like that.<p>If by saying this you are trying to shift the public understanding of the term in a direction of such minimal applicability, I would oppose this shift.')
