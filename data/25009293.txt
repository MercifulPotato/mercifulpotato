Happiness is certainly not noted in the country on a regular basis.<p>What I remember reading about this is that the researchers pointed out that there are cultural differences, so &quot;happiness report&quot; has to normalize for it. For example Americans often talk how happy or unhappy they are, or how much they &quot;love&quot; something, but Finns don&#x27;t generally think this way or almost ever say &quot;I&#x27;m happy (olen onnellinen)&quot;. There is also a certain cultural modesty, so in conversations you rarely make extreme statements like &quot;I&#x27;m really happy&quot; which could make you seem superior to others, you would rather say something like &quot;things are good&quot;. I think what the happiness report concluded that while many people don&#x27;t state or show extreme joyful happiness, many are more content or in peace with their life and have less anxiety.<p>That&#x27;s my personal observation following my friends or family in Finland and comparing that to friends and family in California. See that people in US have more extreme need to achieve, work very long hours, compete and be better than others, be joyful constantly, but also have lot of fear and anxiety, especially when it comes to children. Many of my Finnish friends have both parents working and they have to do very little for the kids schooling. Kids go to the school by themselves and are expected to do their homework by themselves.<p>In US one of the parents have to be almost 100% homemaker and even then it&#x27;s a lot to raise a family since you get very little help from the society. They also more have worries and anxiety of their own future and their children futures. Are they safe? If they get sick will do we afford healthcare? Can they get educated? Can they get a job and live good life? Can I retire when you need to? The competitiveness even seeks in to the very first years of the children&#x27;s life where in Finland you don&#x27;t even get grades and there are no standardized testing until you&#x27;re 18.<p>In Finland, people might have similar fears or anxiety, but in lesser degree since most of those situations are covered by the society.')
