The line of languages is six decades old, after all.   The first Lisp program I ever wrote was on punch cards on an IBM 7094.<p>The evolution of to Common Lisp had to deal with this.  The solution (which works well) is that the default mode of the Lisp reader converts symbol names to upper case, unless they are escaped.   So, the common case is that symbols are lower case in source files, but are upper case internally, and typically are printed in upper case (that can be tweaked if desired.)')
