At an ecosystem level the privacy awareness level and incentive structure is clear between the big companies.<p>Nitpicking and hyperbole isn&#x27;t helping make your point like you think it is. Do you think my mom knows how to opt out of something like that on Android or if that&#x27;s even possible? No. But she&#x27;s IS going to be using Apple Maps by default and have a heightened level of privacy all the same.<p>Privacy is taking care of your entire customer base and making intelligent default considerations. Not giving nerds a pane of options.')
