The white box the computer was in had plastic wrap around it but everything else was cardboard or paper.  The cable was secured with paper, not twist-ties.   The white box fits neatly into the brown cardboard box and is protected at the corners.<p>Also happy with the M1 Mini, which has 16GB but I don&#x27;t do virtualization.  Mostly too many tabs.')
