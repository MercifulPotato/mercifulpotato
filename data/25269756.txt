It has all the necessary basics (gps, step counter, always on color display, heart rate sensor, notifications, weather forecast, time, alarms) and real 40-45 days between battery charging. I couldn&#x27;t stand charging each day or a few times per week.<p>Edit: and it can be operated in a real un&quot;cloud&quot;ed mode if you use the 3rd party gadgetbridge app (born of pebble user needs and extended to support more watches since). That was the dealmaker for me.')
