It drives the activity underground. Examples include prohibition and narcotics in general.<p>In the case of Holocaust denial it also suggests a lack of confidence by the establishment, that they fear that the deniers have a plausible case. I, like most people have seen mountains of evidence showing that the Holocaust did happen.\nAll bar a few cranks and simpletons having taken the trouble to look at both sides would surely come to the conclusion that the Holocaust did happen and see the promoters of denial for what they are.<p>Denying people the opportunity to hear the deniers&#x27; case promotes the suggestion that there is a conspiracy concealing the truth from the public.')
