Was it even enough protestors to be called a minority who bought bombs? The press would love a few photos of people with guns storming the capital, because those that I&#x27;ve seen look like very poorly behaved tourists with souvenirs and selfies. Gallows happen to be a traditional prop at protests (eg, [0]).<p>&gt; If they had found a senior official I donâ€™t think they would have been safe.<p>Nobody feels safe when a protest gets out of hand, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a fact that the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the chain of command of the United states of America were about to be injured. It is entirely plausible that the mob would have screamed at them then been broken up. That is the most likely scenario.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirror.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;tommy-robinson-leads-brexit-betrayal-13709691" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirror.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;tommy-robinson-leads-...</a>')
