Item(by='kevstev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610036032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25671714, text='Interestingly, I have something of an inside view on this- my wife was one of the early enthusiasts, and I guess you could accuse her of being one of the &quot;cliques&quot; discussed- I have been to an instructor&#x27;s house, a friend of ours is a publicist of sorts for someone prominently mentioned in the article, she will be in the wedding of someone she met at Soul that used to work the front desk (and I guess <i>not</i> coincidentally loves bright red lipstick) and would frequently have her bike moved to the front row.<p>She used to spend a jaw dropping amount on Soul- it was her favorite activity to take her clients to. Around the time they IPO&#x27;ed, she felt a change- the expansion took her favorite instructors out of her favorite studios, and often even out of the area as they helped open up locations in LA, Miami, etc. The new ones never had quite the same magnetism- which is of course subjective- most people have their personal favorites, and while there was some overlap, this could differ substantially from person to person. They used to give gifts to their top riders at the end of the year in the form of free classes, that went away, replaced with &quot;charitable donations&quot; and eventually just dropped altogether. Top instructors tried to branch out on their own, some successful, some not, but the point being is that really it was over expansion and IMHO brand dilution, which I guess you could call exclusivity (though I personally feel its a bit different than just exclusivity) that really sent them into a downward trajectory. She went from taking 4-5 classes a week, to mixing in Cycle Bar and other studios, to finally in October 2019 just deciding to get a Peloton.<p>All that said, they still had 1.62 million rides in 2019... which while down from ~1.8, that&#x27;s not exactly a fad or a dead business- I actually thought their drop would be far bigger to be honest. Personally though I feel this was less of an effect of a fad, than the more typical story of the bean counters moving in and pursuing growth and next quarter&#x27;s numbers at the cost of the quality of the brand.<p>To be honest that article was quite eye opening- I guess what I thought was a unique experience and fandom by my wife was something that the culture carefully cultivated.')
