Someone who is motivated, and who has the talent and&#x2F;or background to be able to grasp the material.  How do we prove that they learned it?  How do we prove it in a way that a credential-driven society will accept?  (Especially, how do we do it for a fully online college degree?)<p>2.  Someone who is <i>not</i> motivated, or who does not have the tools to grasp the material.  How do we detect that they&#x27;re floundering or giving up?  How do we keep them from falling through the cracks?<p>Those are two completely different problems.  I could see solving the first one with testing - you pass the test, you pass the class.  The problem is getting society to accept the credential as meaning the same as an in-person class or degree.  Western Governors University uses this approach; I don&#x27;t know whether or not the outside world views their degrees as &quot;real&quot; degrees.<p>To my way of thinking, the second problem is harder.  You can&#x27;t solve it with technology.  You need human intervention, preferably from humans that the student has a connection to, and that are talented enough in teaching to know how to help.  I have no clue how to handle that remotely.  If the parents aren&#x27;t those people, then... what?')
