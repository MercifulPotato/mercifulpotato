Pelé was used for media in the same way.<p>He&#x27;s definitely one of the greatest when it comes to how symbolic he is to the game, he represents Argentina&#x27;s rise to the top of the football world, which has followed as Argentina has consistently put great players since, but I have high reservations as to calling him the best of all time.')
