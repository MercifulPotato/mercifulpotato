I see articles comparing cost to own...but my cost to own most vehicles is insanely low as long as I can buy the parts. I have enough tools to perform all mechanical work.<p>Most of maintenance is in brakes and tires these days for most cars.<p>Additionally, I just looked on rockauto.com(they sell auto parts) and there is so little Tesla parts. I can buy body panels for other cars, engines, engine internal components, literally 80% of parts that are on the complete vehicle. Tesla is a complete joke as a car manufacturer.')
