Item(by='manicdee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610924633, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813823, text='&gt; But I do think there are quite a few conservative, non-fascist, anti-Nazi people who will read a &quot;employees can call out fascism!&quot; comment and feel at least a bit like it&#x27;s meant toward them<p>That&#x27;s a problem for the definitely anti-fascist, anti-Nazi to sort out with themselves. Why do they identify with fascism in this context? Is it because they have openly labelled the BLM movement as a terrorist organisation? Is it because they cheered when protesters were deliberately run over or shot?<p>&gt; I think [Trump has] done 10x the damage to conservatism than Nixon ever could have.<p>IMHO this is because of the number of Conservatives who followed him. It&#x27;s not Trump&#x27;s fault, though he&#x27;s an easy scapegoat. Trump certainly empowered a lot of people to express opinions and perform actions they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have, but Trump didn&#x27;t make those people say those things or behave that way.<p>If Trump is prosecuted and imprisoned, that will be a great start. There will be many people who will see Trump imprisoned, dust their hands off and say, &quot;well, job&#x27;s done, that&#x27;s fascism in the USA dealt with,&quot; only to be shocked when it turns out that jailing Trump didn&#x27;t actually solve anything and the USA continues to suffer problems such as entrenched white supremacy in the police forces around the USA, crony capitalism in all levels of government, and political parties acting in their own selfish interest.')
