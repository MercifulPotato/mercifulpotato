I disagree with pretty much all of them:<p>&gt; Then friends won&#x27;t visit, it&#x27;s more of a hassle to schedule - however infrequent these visits are they&#x27;ll be even less frequent.<p>I would MUCH rather stay in a nearby hotel (and have my guests stay in a hotel). I would feel less like I was imposing.<p>&gt; You&#x27;ll go fewer places and do fewer things if everytime you want to go somewhere you have to deal with getting a rideshare van.<p>I think there&#x27;s likely some truth to that, but it also means I rearrange my life to plan for this better and also to make those outings more meaningful.<p>&gt; No backyard cookouts, no sitting on the deck, you&#x27;ll go to the park less frequently<p>The analogy I use is the gym: I can do workouts at home, but the mental routine I have for getting up and going to the gym means I actually go much more often. Similarly, if there was a nearby park I liked I&#x27;d use it much more frequently. I know I felt that way when I lived in the city vs. where I do now in the burbs (note - the burbs weren&#x27;t my choice ;)')
