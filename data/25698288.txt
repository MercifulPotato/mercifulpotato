It was an act of war. Both involve violence, yes, but trying to draw a line between them is just nonsense.<p>As far as not being “hyperbolic”: an armed mob overran the capital in an attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power, and got <i>very</i> close to getting their hands onto the chain of succession. Men with guns and flex cuffs wandered the building with maps and checking unmarked offices for members of congress. Five lay dead, and multiple pipe bombs had to be defused. The federal government remained paralyzed for hours, as someone in the chain of command refused authorization to send in the guard, and the Pentagon <i>refused to pick up the phone</i>. They built a gallows outside, and looked sure as hell like they were going to lynch Mike Pence.<p>If you think I’m being hyperbolic here, the issue is your lack of perspective and not me being worked up.')
