I go back, ultimately, because I love the flavor.<p>That said, I would never work as early as 9am if I didn&#x27;t have to. Caffeine allows me to jumpstart my brain for programming. I need coffee in particular: tea sustains but doesn&#x27;t jumpstart.<p>Exercise first thing in the morning can act as a substitute for coffee in getting my brain jumpstarted. While I find it easy to exercise at 6:30-7am in the Summer and Fall, Winter and Spring in southern New England suck. At 6:30am, it&#x27;s often dark, 10-20F, windy, and damp. It&#x27;s an area made for depressions.
