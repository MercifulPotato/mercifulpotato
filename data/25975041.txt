Oh that&#x27;s right you can&#x27;t stop rich people from having dinners and talking about manipulating the market. The only thing imposing restrictions and laws in a free market now is solely to fuck over the retail investors while letting the elists continue controlling the market. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been thought about during the 1918 crash and the 2008 crash. Everyone is making it seem like the stock markets only experienced crippling manipulation only during 2000s. The game is set in stone and any government intervention prevents it from ever being a &quot;free market&quot; ideologically.')
