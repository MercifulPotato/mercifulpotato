Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609449167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25596892, text='<i>&gt; We have actual issues at play here</i><p>The only actual issue in play for you personally is COVID, and I&#x27;ve already said I agree with your judgment about the &quot;COVID is a hoax&quot; belief being a lie. My point about &quot;unreliable sources&quot; was not that your particular judgment about COVID was wrong; it was to try to get at the root cause of <i>why</i> your belief is so dramatically different from your family&#x27;s, and why I think it will be so difficult to get them to change.<p>However, I am perfectly willing to give specific answers to the specific questions you ask:<p><i>&gt; do I go to New Years celebration or not with my family?</i><p>Based on what you have described, I wouldn&#x27;t go if I were in your place. My wife and I have refused to participate in some gatherings with her family for much the same reasons (their belief is not as extreme as &quot;COVID is a hoax&quot;, but we are not confident enough in them taking the proper precautions to risk it, particularly as my wife already has some chronic health issues).<p><i>&gt; Do I follow them to Disney World next month?</i><p>Same answer as above. (Note that in this case, you also have to worry about how reliable other people at Disney World are at taking proper precautions.)<p><i>&gt; How much should I work to convince my family that flying on an airplane is a bad idea?</i><p>Based on what you&#x27;ve described, unfortunately I think you have very little chance of succeeding between now and next month, so to me it&#x27;s more a matter of how much risk of permanently alienating your family you are willing to take in an attempt that will almost certainly be futile.<p>Why do I think you have very little chance of succeeding? Well, that&#x27;s what my discussion about sources of information was about. You think the problem is to convince your family that &quot;COVID is a hoax&quot; is a lie. But <i>I</i> think your problem is much harder: to convince your family that the sources of information they trust are so unreliable that they should stop trusting them and start trusting the sources of information that <i>you</i> trust instead. Which is going to be a very heavy lift since the sources of information you trust have also told lies.<p>It&#x27;s possible that you refusing to go, and explaining why, will move the needle some.<p><i>&gt; Do I just watch them recklessly endanger their lives to see Mickey Mouse?</i><p>I&#x27;m very sorry that you find yourself in such a position, and I&#x27;m also very sorry that I don&#x27;t have any good ideas for how you could stop them between now and next month. Unfortunately, for the reasons I have given above, I don&#x27;t have any such ideas, other than refusing to go yourself and making sure to explain to them why you are refusing.')
