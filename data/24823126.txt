If the neighborhood already has five boba shops, the sixth one that opens is facing a lot of competition.<p>Which in some respects doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be innovative at any point, just well timed and positioned. Underserved niches often love &quot;more of the old stuff&quot; if it brings back something they thought was lost. And bringing back the old stuff can be a gamble just as much as doing a groundbreaking thing; in that case, having a way of doing it better is a great derisk.')
