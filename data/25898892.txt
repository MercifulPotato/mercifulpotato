It&#x27;s a weird city, especially when you compare it internationally. There are some amazing restaurants, but they&#x27;re difficult to find and I think that probably adds to the appeal of them. I think the cost to entry in SF has a lot to do with it. If you&#x27;re dropping that much money to open a restaurant here you have to make sure it appeals to the largest possible audience and that audience generally has pretty predictable boring tastes. Also, corners are more likely to be cut as far as quality of the actual ingredients. That&#x27;s my take anyway, it&#x27;s tough to wrap my head around even after all these years.')
