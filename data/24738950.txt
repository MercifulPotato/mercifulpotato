Once created, objects and collections must be immutable.<p>So this language would not be general purpose, as it would not be suitable for high-performance computing.<p>Large scale simulations almost always involve arrays that are modified in place. Being able to somehow declare a collection to be immutable would be highly useful, but not having the option of mutable collections limits the kinds of problems that can be approached with the language.')
