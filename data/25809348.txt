Yes, some people post low quality content, say horrible things and behave antisocially. Yes, in a community you want to restrict destructive behavior (by excluding people if need be).<p>But deep inside we all are, at times, selfish and evil, and at times, beautiful and wise. You can learn something from everyone. But you need to meet people at their terms. For some, it&#x27;s over an esoteric internet protocol that you need to be a geek to use. And for some, it&#x27;s over a glass of cheap lager in the backyard of an auto repair shop.')
