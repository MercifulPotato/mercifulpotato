Leveraging the influencer’s audience and credibility is a shortcut to gaining massive traction. People really, really trust their favorite influencers.<p>I was shocked when a semi-famous influencer admitted that one of the businesses that bears his name actually receives zero input from him, yet he takes 60% of the profits. He was approached by someone who wanted to use his name to jumpstart the audience and the deal was too good to pass up.<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if the recently publicized “Mr Beast Burger” is a similar collaboration. It’s pitched as something Mr Beast came up with, but I wouldn’t be surprised if some entrepreneurs were already building a ghost kitchen business and shopped it around to influencers who were willing to claim it was “theirs” in exchange for some of the profits.')
