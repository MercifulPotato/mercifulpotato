Always. Every time.<p>Not only are you conveniently ignoring that reality, but you&#x27;re also ignoring the fact that humans are humans. False information is <i>much more powerful</i> than true information, and &quot;making up your own mind&quot; is simply not possible when you are bombarded with orders of magnitude more false information that has been carefully constructed and self-selected to misinform you and appeal to your emotions.<p>Stop. Just stop. You&#x27;re not helping. You&#x27;re not enlightened. You&#x27;re part of the problem.')
