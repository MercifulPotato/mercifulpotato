Item(by='abnry', descendants=None, kids=[24749245], score=None, time=1602434561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746295, text='What a sitcom teaches almost never comes from the &quot;moral&quot; of a plot or subplot, but what it treats as benign and acceptable or what it consistently mocks in the background.<p>For instance, in The Office, a character flashing her breasts, blurred out mind you, is outrageous enough to be laughable but not outrageous enough for the actress to avoid doing so in front of the production crew making the show. That communicates a lot and shifts the overton window.<p>Or it may be the subtle mockery of the values of a kind of person by making the person who holds such values into a comical buffoon or disgusting character. For instance, Angela is a &quot;devout Christian&quot; but is written to be a flaming hypocrite, and as the only representative of a Christian on the show suggests that is what all Christians are.')
