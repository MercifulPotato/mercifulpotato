Just that the entire country isn&#x27;t built on racist behaviour like US is&#x2F;was, it&#x27;s not systematic as in the country as it exists now(and largely how it existed in the post WW1 shape too) wasn&#x27;t built with racist institutions and principles. Again, and I cannot stress this enough - that doesn&#x27;t mean that racism doesn&#x27;t exist there.')
