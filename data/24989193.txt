Anyway, the climate doesn&#x27;t care. Human emissions will reach equilibrium with what&#x27;s compatible with life on Earth, one way or the other. Figuring this out is preferable to massive loss of life and degraded standards of living for the survivors.<p>I find it particularly telling you exclude nuclear as a baseload and specify it has to be fossil fuel baseload.')
