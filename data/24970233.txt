There are definitely divergent camps within the party, but I suspect none is confident enough to split off and try to run separately from the others (and sacrifice the &quot;Republican&quot; brand). Perhaps exemplified by how Tea Party and Libertarian folks vote Republican because they don&#x27;t have enough political clout to get anywhere on their own. I&#x27;m sure the same is true on the liberal side (Green Party?) and I&#x27;m just not as familiar with that side.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m saying is I would be surprised because I don&#x27;t think any single camp within the Republican party is dominant enough to beat the rest of the party. But on the other hand I was surprised when the party picked Trump as their candidate, so I could be surprised again.')
