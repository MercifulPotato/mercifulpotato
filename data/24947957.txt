The pain following the nerve block wearing off was indescribable. Groaning was about the most I could do. The pills might as well have been made out of sugar.<p>You&#x27;re right, perspective does change permanently. There weren&#x27;t &quot;seeing the light&quot; moments but I certainly know now who my friends are. I have an interesting view of life now. The residual pain is a reminder that I don&#x27;t have time for nonsense anymore. A pain in the arm is enough, I don&#x27;t need a pain in the ass also.<p>I&#x27;m also viciously dismissive now of any legislation or practices that limit controlled substances. I&#x27;m not an addict and I shouldn&#x27;t be punished for other peoples acts.')
