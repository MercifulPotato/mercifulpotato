But today, in 2020, a verified DKIM is strong indication about the identity of the writer, or that the keys werenâ€™t safely stored.<p>Except that we&#x27;re talking about leaks of emails that date back by years: the earliest Podesta emails are from 2010, back when Google was using 512-bit (!) keys for DKIM. Those were leaked in 2016, at which point <i>1024-bit</i> keys were already considered crackable by a motivated attacker.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that those emails were <i>faked</i>, only that &quot;an email written in 2020 that&#x27;s verifiable in 2020&quot; is not the target of interest.')
