Backups without easy access are mostly worthless.  If I make backups, I have to think about how they&#x27;re stored, where they&#x27;re stored, how they&#x27;re preserved, how I access them, and how I query them.<p>Do I have a backup per contact?  Per app?  Are they stored in my Google Drive?  In flat files on my local PC?  What happens if my PC&#x27;s hard drive crashes?  How do I automatically keep the backups up to date?  How do I keep them in sync?  How do I access and query them remotely if I&#x27;m not at my PC?<p>Now multiply that across every different service you use, and that&#x27;s a lot of mental effort that I don&#x27;t want to go through if I don&#x27;t have to.  Most users don&#x27;t want to either.')
