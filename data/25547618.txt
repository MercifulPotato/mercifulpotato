The Dockerfile for a simple application such as black must be very short (probably 3-4 lines), the alias is probably quite short and the container overhead time is minimal for native docker (the story might be different for things like docker mac).<p>On the other hand, you get some benefits from installing black through docker rather than through the system package manager: is is completely isolated from the host and the only way to break black is to update it, changing anything in the host will not break your black install.<p>I am not sure either what you mean by &quot;just configure your environment properly&quot;, but I am going to assume you mean installing black under a virtual env or equivalent? Then it is also annoying for different reasons: you must reinstall it once for each project, updating python to a new (major) version breaks your formatter, you cannot move the env around, to name the ones that come on top of my head.')
