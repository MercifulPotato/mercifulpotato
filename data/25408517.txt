Spanish universities are still pretty opposed to other countries style of <i>handholding</i> education that Bolonia (tried) brought to Spain, and UNED is probably the most extreme version of that.<p>Also, depending on the faculty, UNED books can be pretty bad (and expensive), although I heard this changed lately.<p>From what I gather from people in other countries, they also require you to study and to be competent, but it is extremely rare to find teachers and professors with ridiculous standards that you often find in Spain. So, If you have the opportunity, save yourself the pain. You&#x27;ll still learn, be respected and it will be easier.')
