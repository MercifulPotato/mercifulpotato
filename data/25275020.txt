Memory access always happened in a fixed and very low number of CPU cycles (the entire RAM essentially had L1 cache performance). The cpu-memory-gap only slowly started to widen during the 90&#x27;s when CPU frequencies started to skyrocket and caches had to be added to CPUs. Unfortunately this problem still isn&#x27;t as widely recognized as it should be in high-level programming circles even today.')
