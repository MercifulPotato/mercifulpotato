Are any in use? Are they really more general?<p>The claims of the generality of Actors seem to rely on continuous time and non-determinism. Actors, determinism, non-determinism, concurrency and the completeness axiom are models which we can use to express computation and our surroundings, and nothing more.<p>One man says lambda, another says actor. Given our models of physics; given Planck and Heisenberg, are they really different? If so, how? Measure theory rests on the completeness axiom, but it is just a very useful axiom.<p>Am I missing something?')
