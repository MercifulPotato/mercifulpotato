There you will find that research in software engineering can be broadly grouped into the following categories: Evaluation research, Proposal of solution, Validation research, Philosophical papers, Opinion papers, Personal experience papers.<p>While I agree that the usual way to deal with the criticism of the work is to redo the work with better evaluation (and thus, more strongly supported arguments), I think that in any ethics research you&#x27;d need more than just publications that fall under Evaluation research (which is what you are likely referring to as &quot;true AI research&quot;).')
