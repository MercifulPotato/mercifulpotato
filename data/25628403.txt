The vast majority of computers dating back to the 1960s didn’t allow you to install anything you wanted on them (if you wanted support!).  My network switches (outside of merchant silicon) don’t allow it.  The game consoles don’t allow it.  My in-car computer doesn’t allow it.<p>The Personal Computer with its tinkerer and hobbyists roots is the exception.  I think tinkering is great.  But I also think it’s legitimate for a user to trust their device can’t be tinkered with.<p>The restrictions of the iPhone are a feature.   Getting rid of them is getting rid of one of the main drivers for its success.  I think forcing Apple to allow jailbreaks without blocks is legit, as it allows for tinkering.  But that’s not generally what people have in mind:  they want the full Apple experience except Apple can’t set the rules anymore, but retain all the responsibilities for support.<p>Let’s also be clear - if I was a software developer, I can download and install my own software on my iPhone - without jailbreak! - today, without the App Store, and without Apple review, using ad hoc distribution.  So personal software install and tinkering has never never been the issue.<p>This is about ISVs that want to force apple to lower their security restrictions so their 3rd party stores can curate and sell whatever they want, and Apple still has to support everyone.<p>This is not going to happen by the EU or US governmentS.  At best they might regulate the App store process.  But governments won’t cross customers and customers will en masse object to a Wild West experience like the PC.<p>I do appreciate computers that don’t have restrictions, but I don’t want or need that in my phone.  If you do, then go ahead and buy one that acts that way.   The happy iPhone users will continue to live in their walled garden.')
