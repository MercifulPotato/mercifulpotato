Item(by='xapata', descendants=None, kids=[25206433], score=None, time=1606280447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25205103, text='You&#x27;re saying it&#x27;d require a salary of $500k or more to find someone competent enough to manage an investment opportunity worth $100k annually?  That implies the investment opportunities are actually quite complicated.  Obviously, opportunities exist for investment gains at all magnitudes.  The question was whether they&#x27;re easy enough for the average Jolanda.  If Jolanda would require $500k annual salary to do the work, then, that easy opportunity doesn&#x27;t really exist at all.<p>Alternately, if Jolanda doesn&#x27;t need to make this opportunity her full-time job, then the investment company can pay her $500k to manage many of these small opportunities.  After all, there must be many opportunities.  Otherwise only 1 of the HN readers would be able to exploit it.  In which case, again, it doesn&#x27;t really exist at all.')
