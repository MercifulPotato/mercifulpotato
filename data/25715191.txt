I.e. you can spread information but only if the majority of people agree with it. (A post is evaluated&#x2F;moderated by a small group, then a bigger group, etc., until perhaps it reaches the entire population). Moderation is not limited to groups, so echo chambers would not have a chance.<p>EDIT: minorities still have a chance in two ways: (1) they can have discussion groups which can be large but still limited (2) the majority will have some tolerance and thus will only suppress the ideas of minorities if they find them objectionable.')
