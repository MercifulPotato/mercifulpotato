The problem plaintiffs have is that the contract they signed lets Robinhood essentially refuse to trade if it wants to. In order to defeat that, you&#x27;re going to have to argue that those contract provisions violate federal law and are therefore unenforceable. That&#x27;s not really want the complaint does. Instead, it seems to argue that Robinhood&#x27;s error was in failing to allow trades in GME in the first place, not in the reasoning for its failings. (At least they actually allege enough of this to potentially get discovery, which is better than some other complaints I&#x27;ve seen recently).')
