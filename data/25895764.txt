Most companies try to limit or restrict the scope of what they <i>must</i> open source. With the GPL, depending on the version, how the code interacts with your project (static linking, dynamic linking, IPC, etc.) you may or may not have to release your code under the same license.<p>In particular Google&#x27;s strong anti-AGPL stance has caused a chilling effect for adoption of AGPL projects at companies, hence why commercial licensing is frequently an option.<p>Finally, you can believe whatever you want, but ultimately it&#x27;s the lawyers who decide, and your ass (assuming you&#x27;re an IC) isn&#x27;t the one on the line when shit hits the fan. Lawyers don&#x27;t like GPLv3 and they don&#x27;t like AGPL.')
