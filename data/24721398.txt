At some point the software needs to understand each other and that requires people to work together. A technical solution around schemas can assist the coordination work, but it can&#x27;t replace it.<p>EDIT to add: Since we can&#x27;t remove human coordination, I question the value of arbitrary schema composition when it incurs the huge DX cost of using a URL to represent every attribute.')
