The only way to tolerate it, is by removing all UI and only keeping the text. But even then some ugly, contrast breaking window pops up, when I use search etc.<p>So I will likely switch to sublime text (even though I only have to work on windows sometimes).\nSimply because of aesthetics I choose a solution nicer for my eyes, when I have the choice, which I do.')
