In a real court system, we judge people by their actions and behaviors, sometimes their speech can play into that. I assume that&#x27;s what the author was referring to. (Apparently the origin of this quote is not clear, but it does seem to come from that same time period) This can&#x27;t be compared to social media, the only way to judge anyone in the context of a social media platform is by what they say. That&#x27;s all there is on these platforms, if you take that away, there&#x27;s nothing left. You are judging someone every time you make a decision whether to like&#x2F;follow&#x2F;reply&#x2F;retweet or not. If your view is that all that doesn&#x27;t matter and the speech is meaningless, then it follows that any perceived punishments are also meaningless.')
