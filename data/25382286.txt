You can see that in how most events are simulated instead of native. As such, we&#x27;re not really simulating user experience, and in fact the accuracy of testing doesn&#x27;t seem to be meaningfully better than what&#x27;s available in Karma.<p>DX is fantastic, of course, but I&#x27;d feel quite uncomfortable in committing to a commercial offering that I thought was being less than fully honest in what they were offering, just as a matter of trust.<p>It really is a great test runner on its own merits, though.')
