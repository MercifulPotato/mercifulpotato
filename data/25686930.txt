Github, for example, isn&#x27;t a great example of a &quot;scalable&quot; frontend: think about it, where do you see anything more complex than showing&#x2F;hiding a widget? Compare with something like Google Maps or Google Docs and we can see that there&#x27;s a world of difference in the amount of client-side complexity involved.<p>This second point goes both ways though. A good amount of &quot;web apps&quot; are more similar to Github than they are similar to Google Maps. There&#x27;s definitely some merit in the idea of using classic server rendered frameworks like Rails + JS augmentation, as can be seen by the increasing popularity of SSR among the popular SPA frameworks.')
