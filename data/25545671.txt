Everyone else just got a job, they went to trade school or had an apprenticeship or just less specialized work. A lot of that kind of work - briefly in history and into the present - required having a degree. Software engineering is not one of those.<p>So don&#x27;t get it twisted. People that want to pursue a complete education because they are interested in the subject can keep going to academia. For everyone else, it is a waste of time, software engineering trade schools are cheaper, faster and good enough.')
