A friend of mine is an avid pirate and is often the first one to recommend to me some new book&#x2F;TV show&#x2F;movie, which in quite a few cases has led to me buying a ticket or a paperback etc. I&#x27;ve also then shared my thoughts about the media I&#x27;ve consumed with others, and they also bought tickets!<p>In my friend group, one dude downloading Into The Spiderverse led to six of us seeing it in theaters.<p>This is obviously anecdotal, but it&#x27;s always seemed to me that piracy is almost free advertising in some cases (though obviously not universally.)')
