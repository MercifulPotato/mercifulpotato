It couldn&#x27;t recognize the lane markings, so it&#x27;s jiggling the wheel and flashing warnings when I&#x27;m in the fast lane on the interstate, and for an instant I think I&#x27;m hydroplaning. Not helpful.<p>I think it has radar cruise control, which I haven&#x27;t tried out yet, but I&#x27;m not sure if I trust it. And I sure hope the auto-braking doesn&#x27;t do anything weird. It did warn me a couple days ago that someone stopped in front of me to turn left, but if I couldn&#x27;t see that, I would still have had an accident.')
