You have to get as far as St Catharines&#x2F;Niagara before prices start looking closer to affordable for middle class incomes. And forget about going north, my father in law is in Barrie, and fairly modest homes on his street are going well over $700k.  That&#x27;s almost as much as I paid for this 6 acre &quot;estate&quot; 8 years ago, and by my calculation with a 25 year amortization and with a very low interest rate and following the &quot;housing not over 30% of pre-tax earnings&quot; that works out to a required household income of $130k.<p>That&#x27;s not anywhere close to average household income in Canada, which is more like $90k, and there are certainly very few high paying jobs in Barrie itself and it is only marginally commutable to Toronto.')
