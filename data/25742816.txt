Unlike browsers which has a lock symbol how can desktop apps inform whether communication is over tls for example?  There is also the challenge that it &#x27;was&#x27; tls at one point when you first inspected but could later changed to some non secure transmission without being informed of such change.<p>What might be some solutions to this?  I have yet to see anything that is standardized for this purpose.  Other than, loosely here, 2fa token for purpose for login only, but is still without knowing whether transmission to endpoint was over secure channels.')
