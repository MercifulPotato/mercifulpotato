We&#x27;ll build some &#x27;perfect thing&#x27; long before we build some &#x27;useful thing&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ve become very skeptical of rust for this reason, it&#x27;s so addictive to a certain personality type that I wonder if there is true reasoning behind the need for hyper strictness.<p>I don&#x27;t think we need Rust actually, I think we just needed a &#x27;clean&#x27; version of C++ with some nicer things around pointers and that would have been fine.<p>Edit: Should say I&#x27;m not against Rust, it&#x27;s super cool, and likely has applications. I&#x27;m just skeptical of our reaction to it. I think it&#x27;s &#x27;borrow checker v1.0&#x27; and future languages may improve on that.')
