Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=[25665777, 25665630, 25667168], score=None, time=1609980638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664990, text='The 2017 referendum was boycotted by opponents of statehood (for various reasons to do with the wording of the referendum question and the way it tried to slant the options) and had something like 23% turnout, so citing it as an expression of popular will is a bit weird.<p>The 2012 referendum also had the statehood question effectively boycotted by many people who favored keeping the current status, because selecting &quot;keep the current status&quot; wasn&#x27;t an option on that question (it was a separate question altogether, where it got 46% of the overall vote).  So statehood got something like 61% of the votes of people who voted on the statehood-specific question at all, but only ~46% of the votes cast in the referendum; representing that as a &quot;yes for statehood&quot; is also pretty weird, since that&#x27;s about the same number of votes that &quot;keep the current status&quot; got, with the remainder presumably favoring one of the other &quot;more-independence&quot; options.<p>2020 is different and new: it&#x27;s the first Puerto Rico referendum I have seen where there was a sanely worded &quot;state: yes or no?&quot; question that actually got a majority voting for the &quot;state&quot; option (52.5% or so), with something resembling sane turnout (~55%).<p>So yes, respecting this is probably a good idea.  &quot;Respecting&quot; the 2012 or 2017 results by making Puerto Rico a state would not have made any sense.<p>Edit: Now that I have read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senado.pr.gov&#x2F;Legislations&#x2F;ps1467-20.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senado.pr.gov&#x2F;Legislations&#x2F;ps1467-20.pdf</a> page 31 lines 6-15, which define the &quot;no&quot; answer to mean a specific course of action which is not just &quot;don&#x27;t become a state&quot;, I am less happy with this referendum.  Now we have to guess at how many people knew what the &quot;no&quot; was defined to mean and voted for what they perceived as the lesser of two evils based on that....')
