I think this happens often - the progressive&#x2F;leftist&#x2F;etc. position involves <i>multiple</i> points of departure from our current society, and if you try to look at the merits of any single strand by itself, it falls apart.<p>For instance, many progressives are advocates of people losing their jobs for harassing coworkers. If you look at this position in isolation, it looks like they&#x27;re arguing for a cold corporatism, that anyone who threatens the reputation of the corporation should be thrown onto the streets. However, many progressives are <i>also</i> advocates of stronger social safety nets for people who lose their jobs, whether by their own misdeeds or misfortune - from increased unemployment (or even UBI), to stronger tenants&#x27; protections, to government-provided healthcare. Firing someone for their misdeeds is much less cruel <i>once those safety nets are in place</i>, and the moral calculus very rapidly shifts to protecting their coworkers.')
