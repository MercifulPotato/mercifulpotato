What the project seems to do, however, is change that understanding that slavery <i>contributed</i> to all those problems and instead claims it is the <i>root cause</i> of all of them.<p>Root cause and proximate causes can relate to the same problem but if we conflate the two we may get a very different understanding of how to fix it. I’m not convinced that every problem highlighted passes the “if not for” test. (E.g., if not for slavery, the US would have universal healthcare).<p>Side note: I appreciate all the thoughtful responses you’ve taken the time to give in this thread')
