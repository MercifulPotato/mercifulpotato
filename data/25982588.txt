Most of Germany&#x27;s migrants are not from Africa and most are from the EU. Germany has a &quot;black&quot; population of about 2%, compared to the 10+% in the US.<p>Then, you get the fact that the minorities in the US are more qualified than the ones in Germany. Germany doesn&#x27;t attract the most talented in the world, like the US and due to the lack of two oceans protecting it from the rest of the world, Germany doesn&#x27;t get to be too picky about its migrants. The biggest attraction to foreigners is its welfare state. So I would hesitate to conclude to much from such a simple comparison.')
