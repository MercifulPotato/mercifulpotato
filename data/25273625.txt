Big one no though.  But it seems those remaining could harm anyone who do the repair.  It was not designed with only one less cable.  And hence those remained can cut anytime and anywhere.  The whole area could be a danger Zone.<p>Seems you need to demolish the whole site if the discussion along this line is true.<p>See whether any better information.
