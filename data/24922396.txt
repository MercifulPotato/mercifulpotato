The docs website has tutorials on how to install TensorFlow and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get started. I got it to start playing with TF and it certainly did the job but I found that I was running into its limitations pretty quickly.<p>I (foolishly?) hoped I could run a low-param version of GPT-2, but even the smaller models were too large to run on this small GPU. So be aware if you&#x27;re interested in this developer kit that it won&#x27;t be able to run complex models, especially if you&#x27;re getting the new 2GB version. Anything like image recognition&#x2F;classification would work just fine though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B084DSDDLT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B084DSDDLT</a>')
