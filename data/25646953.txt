In reality, in most European countries, welfare abuse it at most 2% of all social welfare users and usually at 1%. The data just doesn&#x27;t support large-scale welfare abuse. Is it shallow when people still assume there are huge amounts of moochers?<p>Now are there reasons why you might ask someone how long they stayed at their previous job? Yes, definitely. Does that make everyone suspect automatically? Hell no.<p>I don&#x27;t have more data on the subject, so I won&#x27;t draw any definite conclusions as to whether it is warranted to base someone&#x27;s professional worth on the number of years&#x2F;months served. My own experience shows only a very weak correlation there, and no correlation at all between seniority within a company and said company&#x27;s attempts at retaining that employee.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people who had &quot;ten years&#x27; experience&quot; who in reality had done the same year, ten times. I&#x27;ve seen people who had three years&#x27; experience but were driven, looked into things on their own initiative and who outclasses those &quot;seniors&quot;. It all seems to depend on what you&#x27;re exposed to and, lacking exposure, what you&#x27;ll subject yourself to of your own accord.<p>Have you read any studies on the subject?')
