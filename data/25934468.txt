There&#x27;s no &quot;we&#x27;ll see&quot; and then maybe I get a bill in a few weeks.<p>* I walk in to a different doctor&#x27;s office and the answer as to whether I&#x27;m billed or not is the same as at the other doctor.<p>* Because of these first two items, I walk in and they can tell me ahead of time what my bill will be.<p>* We can now replace &quot;walk in&quot; with &quot;check their websites (or call) and comparison shop&quot;.<p>Maybe they can&#x27;t tell me if my treatment is taxed until I&#x27;m diagnosed, but that still gives me the option to find out my bill before treatment. Once I&#x27;m diagnosed, if it&#x27;s non-urgent I can shop around.<p>Price transparency is non-existent in US healthcare.
