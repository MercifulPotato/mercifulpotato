They are <i>non</i> moronsâ€”they may be <i>darn good</i> report-builders, but haven&#x27;t been trained in insights, for instance.<p>If you&#x27;re reacting to my word choice in that last sentence, know that I <i>am</i> frustrated with people who claim to be data scientists but can&#x27;t derive insight.
