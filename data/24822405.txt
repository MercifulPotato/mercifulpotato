It isn&#x27;t society doing the diagnosing. It&#x27;s just a group of highly privileged individuals. It&#x27;s one disinformation entity demanding privileged position in the disinformation space.<p>All state propagandists complain about disinformation. Whether it is the bbc or chinese propaganda organizations or russian or whatever. They all claim to be worried about and fight against disinformation just like the nytimes. After all, if you are fighting disinformation, then you must not be party to disinformation. But we all know that&#x27;s a lie.<p>&gt; That is, the advertising system.<p>Nope. Disinformation&#x2F;propaganda&#x2F;yellow journalism&#x2F;etc predates the modern age of advertisement. In the past, newspapers were funded by wealthy business people, politicians or government. And they were all created to further the aims of their creator via propaganda. Ask yourself who created the nytimes and why?<p>&gt; This business model should be illegal.<p>Nope. You are being misled by disinformation. It&#x27;s not the business model or the profit generating mechanism. It&#x27;s the nature of the business itself. News&#x2F;media&#x2F;etc exist to manipulate people. It was created to tell people how they should think or feel about events. To guide the herd.<p>Also, engagement was important long before social media.')
