In which case then your own defense against something being used against you might as well be existential suicide, because in your view the game is so inherently stacked against you, the only winning move is not to play.<p>Why do I say your argument relies on an abstract notion? Because you&#x27;ve not provided any evidence that any of the efforts to unionize in the U.S. tech industry- whether the Kickstarter union, or the TWC, or any other fledgling efforts to organize- constitute an actual threat to immigration. Sure, you&#x27;ve provided evidence that there are anti-immigrant voices in the industry, and that is definitely a cause for concern. That said, you haven&#x27;t established any material link that the two distinct phenomena are connected. There&#x27;s no evidence that anti-H-1B nativists are agitating for unionizing in tech. And no, the US Tech Workers Trojan horse [0] does not count. The only comment you cite is yourself making the case for them and one commentator agreeing with you. Hardly an entire Know-Nothing movement.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24536273" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24536273</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24536757" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24536757</a>')
