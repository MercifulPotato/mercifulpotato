That was the most organized and well-taught course I have taken on Coursera.  The visuals for explaining algorithms were beautiful, Dr. Sedgewick explained the material extremely well, and my favorite part, were the assignments.<p>The assignments are completed in Java and cover the lecture material from the week.  For example, your 1st assignment is to use a union data structure to determine if a grid percolates, similar to a coffee filter percolating.<p>One slight drawback with the course was that it was originally published several years ago, so the forums are not well moderates much more and some of the previous quizzes are no longer available.  Also Princeton does not issue certifications of completion.<p>Still itâ€™s the best online course I have taken in a MOOC.')
