For your &quot;How popular is investing in the community?&quot; section, I would try to adjust that so it&#x27;s not an absolute number. Right now you don&#x27;t know whether &quot;investing&quot; seems more popular just because there are more users or stories overall or because a higher proportion of the items submitted are about investing. For example, instead of the raw number of stories that month with &quot;investing&quot; in them, look at something like that number divided by the total number of stories for that month, which would give you the fraction of stories that month that contained the term &quot;investing&quot;.')
