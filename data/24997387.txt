If you were bad with the opposite sex you&#x27;d get rejected by the women in your circles, but at least you&#x27;d get a chance to talk and meet face-2-face and still stay in touch platonically later. Now you can get rejected, ghosted and stood up by thousands of other potential mates before they even meet you which must do wonders for your self esteem (&#x2F;s).<p>Same with finance. Some would make more $ than you but you wouldn&#x27;t know about it. Now you can FOMO while you watch others making $$$ on trading platforms from their Cryptocurrency or TSLA stocks and feel left behind in the rat race.<p>My $0.02')
