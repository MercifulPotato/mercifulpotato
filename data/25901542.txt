I have a robot-vacuum with a lidar that wasn&#x27;t all that expensive.<p>Waymo says it cost $75,000 for the lidar in one car a decade ago, and in 2019 they said they got the cost down to $7,500. So at the time Tesla decided to forgo lidar the costs were certainly very high. I&#x27;m guessing the range in your vacuum is multiple orders of magnitude less than a car.<p>Waymo must have been betting costs would drastically fall over time. No idea if it&#x27;s a lot less than 7500 now.')
