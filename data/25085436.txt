That <i>is</i> confusing. Screen time is not a singular activity - there&#x27;s an infinite diversity of things that you can do on a screen - some great for your health, other very poor.<p>It&#x27;d be like a study came out saying &quot;food proven to make Americans overweight&quot; because, on average, people eat junk food. Strictly speaking that is true, but it&#x27;s not <i>useful</i> information.<p>[1]: Alright, it considered &quot;non-work screen time&quot; as an unvariegated whole - but my point still stands here.')
