With only 1 car, I rent out the second space.  3 years ago, I could rent it for $350 per month.  Now, I can get $200.<p>Around here, the condominium and the parking space are different tax IDs, so you can buy and sell them independently.  A lot of buyers choose not to buy the parking space when they buy the condominium.  You should assume that when your local builders are moving from 1:3 to 1:4, they are doing so in response to market demand for parking.')
