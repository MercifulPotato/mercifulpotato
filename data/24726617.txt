As others have pointed out, though, had he been carrying a .223 rifle with a 30 round magazine (an objectively more dangerous object) I can&#x27;t imagine you reaching the same conclusion.<p>Why is a guy with a fused (but apparently not filled?) pipe bomb presumptively a &quot;criminal&quot; but a guy with a rifle not?
