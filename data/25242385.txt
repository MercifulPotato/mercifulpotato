Does this cause a different type of candidate to be favored?  Does it cause the voter to be different?<p>I don&#x27;t know, do the candidates lobby outside of this format?  Do they email around campaign materials and try to get people to vote for them?  Do they rally supporters through Zoom?  (maybe OSM is not quite that level)<p>Hard to get a sense of what it&#x27;s <i>really</i> like to work with someone through written text, but maybe that&#x27;s to certain people&#x27;s advantage if they don&#x27;t speak well in person.   Does someone who responds well over text = suited to negotiating and managing a huge project?   Do you have to ask more questions to figure out what kind of work&#x2F;family&#x2F;personal situation they&#x27;re in, and how much time they really have to devote to your project?   How confident can you be?  How about if a decision about the project involves millions of $ later -- trustworthiness?<p>Can you imagine if the elected board gets together for their first Zoom call and a 60 year old retiree sees a 13 year old teenager?<p>Fascinating.')
