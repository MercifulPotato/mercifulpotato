Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603920160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24915959, text='<i>&gt; It&#x27;s now much easier to see my Google-related tabs and there is a decent consistency whereas before calendar, gmail, and drive looked totally different.</i><p>Sure, if &quot;Google-related&quot; is the meaningful category you&#x27;re trying to distinguish from other tabs, rather than a particular task or application.<p>So, yes, branding-wise these logos all look related (inbred, even), but is that really the single most important quality for them to have? The outcome is that these logos aren&#x27;t distinctive enough from each other, and have been abstracted to meaninglessness. A better balance between those two concerns could have been struck, primarily by relaxing the apparent constraint that every logo has to include every color.')
