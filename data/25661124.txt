Then complains about being asked to do coding. And then, based on just those two, saying that you know you&#x27;d be unhappy working with people like him.<p>Amazon isn&#x27;t great environment in most of the pockets of the company (haven&#x27;t worked there, but worked with a lot of people who came from there), so it&#x27;s quite possible that you &quot;dodged the bullet&quot;.<p>But only when pressed, you start to complain how interviewer is immature, arrogant, rigid. That&#x27;s not what you originally stated - you had issues with an interviewer age and being asked to do coding. I&#x27;m not trying to defend the interviewer - it&#x27;s very possible that they were bad interviewers - big tech companies push people early to start interviewing. But things that you complained about initially make it sound like you maybe also not a very pleasant candidate to work with, that comes into the interview with a lot of bias.')
