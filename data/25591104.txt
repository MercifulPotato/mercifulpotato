It is reality.<p>Both the cost and capability of automation tech needs very significant improvement before we can talk realistically about it actually replacing basic labors.  I have experience with these things.  We have come far.  There is far to go.  I am not being negative here, just brutally realistic.<p>About as brutal and real as the problems related to low wage employment.<p>And as I said above, whether we have that available as a meaningful component in the discussion changes nothing.<p>One other argument is all our innovation and increased productivity was supposed to be associated with it being far cheaper to live.  Increased automation augments that promise.<p>Fact is Americans face ever higher cost and risk exposure relative to their income despite much progress on those fronts.<p>We are not seeing it get cheaper to live so far.<p>Will we?<p>Fair question.<p>We will need to see that happen, or automation changes nothing about the basic discussion we are having here, and that is people have costs to exist and show up for work.<p>And at some point, we can also say, if there is work to show up for, but we do not have to say that today, and for a reasonable future given where we are and the current pace of advancement.<p>There is a lot of work to do, that we need to do, and we might as well employ people respectably and invest in them to get those works done, in addition to the massive value basic labors already add to our lives.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but my time is worth a lot!  There is a great chance we both can do work that isn&#x27;t basic too.<p>Those people doing basic labor enable us to do that which we do.<p>How much is that worth?<p>I would suggest it is worth enough for them to make it and show up for work, same as us.  (I am not suggesting they get a wage same as ours, just one that allows for a reasonable, modest, dignified life, and that they get it because what they do is necessary.)<p>Up thread I posed a question, &quot;which is it?&quot;<p>Corporations fully funding their labor, or government insuring that and corporations pay what they feel they can or should pay?<p>Someone has to pay, or they die and don&#x27;t show up for work.<p>I don&#x27;t care which.  I do care that we continue to refuse to discuss which way it should be and instead treat all this like some problem the people doing basic labors for us should solve on their own, despite their contributions having good value and being necessary.')
