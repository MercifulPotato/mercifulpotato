I never quite understood why &quot;Docker&quot; ended up being such a big deal in the way it was&#x2F;is.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t doubt or disagree that it is a potentially extremely useful technology, buut it seemed (and still seems) crazy and nonsensical to me that it is enough to power a whole &quot;business model,&quot; of the size it apparently got. Somewhat similar to &quot;curl&quot; or &quot;ssh,&quot;  or even the Linux kernel -- it could sit under a lot of stuff and be very important, but would work much better as a free and&#x2F;or open source without limitations kind of thing.<p>Not whatever it is now.')
