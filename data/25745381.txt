This leads to military, technological, and ecnomicall dependence as well. Until recently, this dependence was not a big problem, but as situation in the US started to slowly deteriorate it started to show more and more drawbacks.<p>The other country in addition to China with a certain level of political independence is Russia and it&#x27;s also quite sensitive about nurturing its national infrastructure. It got certain level of success here, though due to its economic capabilities and population size, it&#x27;s far from China&#x27;s level (e.g. they don&#x27;t have viable YouTube and Twitter competitiors). The other country which could fit here is India, but I am not familiar enough with its national IT infrastructure.')
