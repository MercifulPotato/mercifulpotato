Isn&#x27;t mostly men behind OnlyFans? And also aren&#x27;t male performers in general paid significantly less than female performers in porn? I feel like things like that were deliberately left out of the article because they didn&#x27;t contribute to the narrative it tried to build.<p>Have to use a throwaway lest my skeletons get attached to me.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t mostly men behind OnlyFans?<p>Yeah. The irony to me of this wave of the &#x27;sexual revolution&#x27; is that the message is that it&#x27;s OK for Women&#x2F;Men to sell their bodies as such on the internet... And the end result is a bunch of white men who were in many cases already rich are getting richer via their &#x27;cut&#x27;. OnlyFans&#x2F;Manyvids&#x2F;Etc are just like the Apple or Android store. They provide some level of legally required and&#x2F;or percieved need (Verification, APIs and docs, etc) and then get a cut for doing not much else.')
