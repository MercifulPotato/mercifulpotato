Item(by='c0nsumer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606534083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233647, text='I&#x27;m a mountain biker, and I also ride fatbikes in the winter. There&#x27;s a couple other reasons for carbon:<p>- Carbon fiber is a worse conductor of heat than aluminum. Use some carbon fiber bars, foam grips, and either carbon brake levers or aluminum ones with heatshrink tape over them and your hands will stay warmer in the cold. When it&#x27;s REALLY cold and you&#x27;re using pogies (grip area covers) this is particularly important as it means less heat wicking away from your hands.<p>- In my experience the sidewalls on carbon rims are a LOT stronger than aluminum. Sure, it&#x27;s possible to break carbon, but it takes a lot more force than it does to dent or crease aluminum. I&#x27;ve ridden carbon rims hard on seriously rough trails, hitting rims on things which have dented my aluminum rims, and the rims are just fine.<p>- When building bicycle wheels one of the usual steps is truing the wheel, or adjusting the tension on each spoke to pull the rim into being straight and eliminating wobble. This is not a thing with carbon rims. With carbon rims they are SO stiff that instead you bring all the spokes up in tension evenly and then maintain this even tension and ensure the wheel is straight (no radial or lateral wobble). Unlike aluminum rims, changing the tension on just one, or even a handful, of spokes won&#x27;t pull that part of the rim in whatever direction. The rims are just that stiff, and a well-built even-tensioned carbon wheel will last a long time.<p>- It&#x27;s also possible to do far more complicated forming with carbon fiber than one can do with metal, particularly at reasonable weights. Having a very low stand-over height (good for technical mountain biking) with carbon is no big deal; just some engineering. With aluminum it requires a lot more material, which can add pounds (noticeable amounts) of weight.')
