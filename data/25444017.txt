Because of the tiny display and underpowered processor I had to get creative, I installed Arch plus i3 and it worked like a charm. In fact, I noticed my productivity actually went up. Eventually I got a new laptop, I switched off Arch to Ubuntu but I&#x27;ve been using i3 ever since.<p>If you&#x27;re an i3 user here are a couple cool things to check out:<p>- scratchpad [1]: Little known i3 feature. Let&#x27;s you put individual windows in a scratch workspace and then pull them up quickly over your regular workspaces. Really useful docs and things like that, I keep my time tracker in a scratch workspace.<p>- rofi [2]: This is a dmenu replacement with a nicer interface that lets you combine lists of commands in a single search window. I have it configured so I can search through my open windows by title or run any program from the same interface.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3wm.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;userguide.html#_scratchpad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3wm.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;userguide.html#_scratchpad</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;davatorium&#x2F;rofi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;davatorium&#x2F;rofi</a>')
