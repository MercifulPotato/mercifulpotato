Seems pretty plausible to me that it has something to do with technology.  Perhaps it has something to do with dating apps, perhaps young men are substituting porn for real intimacy, perhaps some combination.  Either way, doesn&#x27;t seem like a good change.  And by the pigeonhole principle, if more women are having sex than men, it must be the case that some men are sleeping with multiple women (modulo homosexuality and young women sleeping with older guys).<p>(I don&#x27;t think &quot;you just need to be a better partner&quot; moralizing has much explanatory power, it&#x27;s a lecture that can be delivered in any time or place to any gender and doesn&#x27;t speak to underlying trends.)')
