It means the same thing, but the meaning different because of the context:<p>Lifetime: lifetime means that the first lifetime outlives (is as long or longer) the second<p>Type: lifetime means that the type is constrained by the lifetime. Because &#x27;static means &quot;the lifetime of the whole process&quot;. That means that the type is not constrained.')
