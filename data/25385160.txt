No more emailing yourself.<p>In layman terms, it helps to save time by eliminating the distractions of unimportant tasks we all get every day.<p>You just focus on 3 most important outcomes and get it done faster, achieving what really matters.<p>The method behind the app allows you to set priorities for the year, month and a week, working every day on 3 simple tasks getting closer to your big goals step by step.<p>It is still an early version and I plan to build more features but I believe it&#x27;s already doing its job and I&#x27;d love to know your feedback.<p>Any comments on how I can improve the tool, or you enjoyed using it, or you found a bug. Just anything no matter how brutal. I&#x27;d love to hear from you at any time. Please comment here.')
