I&#x27;m afraid EU law is often very bad at protecting small businesses, so while I wish you luck in fighting the good fight, I wouldn&#x27;t be so confident about your legal position as a corporate entity. But of course, take proper legal advice, as it looks like you are. And maybe Irish national law can help you even if the European provisions don&#x27;t.')
