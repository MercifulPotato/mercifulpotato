Accessing a memory location can fix bit-flips (ECC is a &#x27;correcting&#x27; code). But systems that don&#x27;t regularly visit every memory location, can accumulate risk. Those dark corners of RAM can eventually get double-bit errors and be uncorrectable. So an OS might &#x27;wash&#x27; RAM during idle moments, reading every location in a round-robin manner to get ECC to kick in and auto-correct. Doesn&#x27;t matter how fast (1M every hour or whatever) as long as somehow ECC has a chance to work.')
