But Debian Mint (Mate&#x2F;Cinnamon&#x2F;Gnome) is pretty OK too.<p>Personally, I have never understood why anybody installs Ubuntu. Ubuntu was better for a couple of years, right at the start, and has just gotten worse since. The only thing it does better is that an installer that understands current hardware is easier to find. (Debian has it too, but tries to hide it, because &quot;nonfree&quot;.)<p>So, installing Debian Mint is the best of all worlds. Once you have installed Debian Mint, you have regular Debian.')
