The inheritors of the tragedy are movies like Fight Club, The Godfather, etc. Shakespeare used the anti-hero very well: Richard III, Othello, and Macbeth all resonate very strongly with modern audiences.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure I&#x27;d put Hamlet in that category, and really points up what you&#x27;re saying. Hamlet is tragic in the Greek sense, a concept we rarely get today. Hamlet&#x27;s more heroic than anti-heroic: he&#x27;s got a body count but he&#x27;s not vicious about it. He at least wants to be a good person -- not just by his own lights but by what he thinks others expect of him. (Unlike the more vicious anti-heroes, who don&#x27;t see themselves as evil but aren&#x27;t averse to having other people see them that way.)')
