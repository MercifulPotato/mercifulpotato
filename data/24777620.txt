I guess you&#x27;re alluding to how citizens can &quot;vote&quot; which means it&#x27;s actually a democracy to which I would strongly disagree. I have little to no influence over my government as I live in a gerrymandered district so my representative is decided for me ahead of time. I also only get to pick between 2 old white guys every 4 years which is me actually being optimistic as I don&#x27;t live in a state that actually decides the presidential election so my vote doesn&#x27;t matter there either.<p>In a democracy I would actually be able to vote on issues and have my voice heard. That&#x27;s clearly not happening in the USA.')
