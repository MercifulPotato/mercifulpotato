The UK already uses STV, D&#x27;Hondt, and AMS in various elections. There is no campaign to change those to FPTP. The reason we can&#x27;t change the Westminster voting system is exactly the reason we want it: because it would disrupt the existing party alignment and power structure. Same reason we still have an <i>entirely unelected</i> legislative house.<p>The same, presumably, applies in America. Parties are willing to sabotage elections altogether there rather than risk making them fairer.')
