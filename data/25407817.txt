This is something that I feel tends to get glanced over in Nim or D circles.<p>Both advertise fast compilation, and they do compile quickly, but my experience with even 5-10k loc projects with those languages start to see some time sunk into the linker, even with Gold. This will inevitably lead to the change-execute cycle taking 1-3 seconds, while I have had no issue with substantially larger fpc code bases compiling and running in milliseconds.<p>For Rust and C++ devs a change-execute cycle sub 10 seconds is  incredibly enticing. However, fpc has ruined me for what fast compilation really means.  It also makes me really wish Nim had stuck to fpc as a backend.<p>I know very little about what is actually going on behind the scenes here. If anyone has any info about pascals compilation as well as linkers in general I would love to know more.')
