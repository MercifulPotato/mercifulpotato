It&#x27;s pretty difficult to find work that isn&#x27;t one of those three categories, especially one that doesn&#x27;t require a bunch of credentials. I think the closest the average person can get to something like a &quot;dream job&quot; is some sort of compromise: teacher instead of service-work for people that like people, a lighter trade like carpentry instead of a heavy trade like HVAC, working at a corporation that does something you like instead of a bank, or the modern favorite: the side-hustle.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a jaded pessimist, though.')
