Companies thought data was an asset but as the hacks and regulations pile up I think they will begin to view it as a liability.<p>So what are their options:\n1) Try and beef up your tech operation. Maybe spend $xxM with AWS and hope their customer engineers can set you up right. This is a distraction from selling cars or whatever it is that you actually do, but the shareholders like that you&#x27;re modernizing I guess.\n2) Buy insurance. The same thing that people do to prepare for any other potential disaster that they can&#x27;t prevent. If Russia decides to hack you there&#x27;s nothing you can do, but at least the insurer will cover the bill.<p>The key is that this should <i>NOT</i> come from a traditional insurance company. Those companies do not have the ability to assess the risks properly nor do they have the expertise to recommend simple preventative measures or help a customer recover from an incident.<p>Instead there needs to be some sort of combination Cybersecurity consultancy and data insurance company. They come in, audit you, fix the low hanging fruit, and insure the rest. Maybe they even sell you some cloud services too for data warehousing, etc.<p>All the cloud companies are trying to sell Kubernetes to every traditional company out there. Forget it, just sell them insurance.')
