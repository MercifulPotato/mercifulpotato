I guess they were &quot;misguided&quot;, as you say.<p>These people were well-understood by government, who listened to their imperialist and racist demands.<p>Well, the rest of Europe defended themselves through alliances and coordinated military planning, and the USA did their job to bomb the authoritarian regime back to their place.<p>Today&#x27;s &quot;misguided&quot; Trump extremists are part of a very big group of Trump supporters, who might very well turn the USA into a less-globalist, more authoritarian regime. Perhaps imperialist.<p>In this case, the best for the world would be to quickly disable US military power, ideally with precise nuclear strikes.<p>Nobody in this scenario is &quot;fundamentally evil&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can solve all conflicts by &quot;understanding these people&quot;. This is about which side &#x2F; ideology has the most power.<p>Power is what really matters. The USA is seen as the good guys today because they were powerful in WW2. If Germany had gotten their way, they would be the good guys, and USA the evil ones.')
