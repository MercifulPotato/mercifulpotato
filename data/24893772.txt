I told him &quot;vi(m)&quot;, but also mentioned emacs. When I was learning coding (with linux kernel versions before 1.0) these were the only practical choices, and since I am happy with vim, I never looked around for the upcoming alternatives. But I think some progress might have happened in this field, over these decades (of course vi and emacs have improved, too). So I have two questions:\n(1) Did you start with either vi or emacs and then switched to another editor, because it worked better (whatever that means) for you, i.e., not imposed by your work environment etc.\n(2) What would your editor recommendation would be, for someone using GNU&#x2F;Linux environment, nowadays?')
