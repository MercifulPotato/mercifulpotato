Internet discussions (HN included) seem to mostly just be people who have no idea what they are talking about speculating wildly, and treating their speculations as unimpeachable. We would benefit a lot from a greater focus on providing sources and evidence.<p>The description of it as &quot;harassment&quot; is incomprehensible to me. Why post on a discussion board if you aren&#x27;t willing to handle disagreement, and defend your claims?<p>TBH, if you want to convince me that someone who is disagreeing with you politely is acting in bad faith, you have an uphill battle.')
