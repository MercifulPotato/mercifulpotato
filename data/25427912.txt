Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608017587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427198, text='&gt; I think for me it seems more like Google is just very much against people speaking up about anything.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re right; certainly I would cleave off Google&#x27;s private interests (shutting up people who damage their business prospects) from Google&#x27;s idealized public position (good, diverse, modern liberal values, a trusted source of information, etc). Few people know what their management _really_ thinks or talks about, but we do know their public position well.<p>Consider this, at least: when firing James Damore, it was absolutely not necessary or expected for them to say anything about how this shouldn&#x27;t impact efforts to continue to make sure white males are represented in the workplace - quite the contrary.<p>&gt;  from my personal experience I canâ€™t really ascribe this to either liberals or conservatives particularly.<p>If you reread my post, hopefully it should be clear that I actually did ascribe this behaviour to everyone. The issue in CA is that, at least in urban areas, the liberal value set is the norm, and is enforced as such, much as Christianity would have been enforced a century ago in many cities. For those implicitly doing the enforcement, ranging from thought leaders to city politicians to moms posting on Facebook, it&#x27;s just the water they swim in; virtue is on a single axis and like most good people they want to swim upstream. It&#x27;s not &quot;particularly intolerant&quot; in the grand scheme of things, compared to other such cultural centers throughout history, but it is particularly intolerant of anything outside of postmodern American liberalism today, and is perhaps (outside of maybe NYC) the biggest enclave of such thought in the world.<p>&gt; If you have personal experiences with intolerance in CA being worse than other places<p>CA and the Hollywood-&gt;SF corridor in particular export their value set to the entire world, never mind just America. The intolerance for free speech, conservative or third position values that we see on social media today stems from this. It&#x27;s not enough to enforce it within their own cities, rather it seems that they need to export it in the form of regulations and propaganda that continually escalates in intensity over time.<p>It&#x27;s not far from the proselytizing behaviour that religion has had forever; memetically speaking, it&#x27;s actually entirely logical that any successful cultural set of values and ideas would have to propagate itself via word and deed in order to survive and grow generationally. In many ways, liberalism is just a third-rate religion; it may have some improvements in select places over the traditional value set that it replaces, but has lost the ability to truly create communities somehow in the process.')
