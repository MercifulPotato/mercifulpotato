I just want to see more people pulling that sort of stuff, instead of replicating something they don&#x27;t understand, when they clearly have skills to do better.<p>I think you&#x27;re comparing two different intentions here. When those games were made, the goal was to push the graphics of the snes as hard as they could. Most retro games are made with the intention of, well, looking retro.<p>If you look at a game like say Hollow Knight, that&#x27;s where I feel like art styles like Yoshi&#x27;s island evolved to. There&#x27;s still people going for that painted look, you just don&#x27;t notice them or compare them to retro games because, they don&#x27;t look retro.')
