AMD and Nvidia have made custom SOCs for game consoles for years now; they could create customized SOCs for PCs if this was a critical issue. But I don&#x27;t believe it is. The PC workloads and use cases follow well-known patterns and market segments and you don&#x27;t really need a lot of different custom accelerators, or be on a single SOC for that matter. Video-related processing has been part of GPUs for many years.<p>For that matter, making RISC CPUs is not actually a huge obstacle for these guys. (Nvidia does.) Yes even Intel.<p>The article also seems to entirely omit the M1&#x27;s heterogenous core strategy, where 4 of the cores are high performance and the other 4 are optimized for power efficiency. A deeper analysis of this and how software manages them would be more interesting.')
