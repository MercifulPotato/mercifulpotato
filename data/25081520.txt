Running anything non-trivial (e.g. k3d and a few pods) led to a very noticeable slowdown. My fan was noisy all day.<p>Instead I purchased (for a very, very modest amount of money) a decommissioned rack server with a dual Xeons (2*8=16C&#x2F;32T) and 64GB of DDR3 RAM. It&#x27;s on my local gigabit network. I docker-machine into it. The hardware is obviously older but build times are in the same ballpark.<p>I&#x27;m holding out for the 16&quot; ARM MacBook Pro but I&#x27;ll probably pull the trigger when it&#x27;s released.')
