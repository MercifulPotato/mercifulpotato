If you are a tech person communicating with a decision maker, they are typically looking to understand options and their implications and risks, not the details of how the options work. They can then decide, based on their (presumably) better knowledge of the wider context, which options to select. If the decision makers are genuinely intelligent and motivated, but their eyes glaze over when you describe something, chances are you have chosen the wrong things to communicate to them.')
