They compete in Solar power (solar roof), in battery storage (commercial and private), autonomous driving (Waymo is valued at more than 100 billion, why shouldn&#x27;t Teslas autopilot division alone too), energy autobidder, own battery tech and so much more. Maybe they are a bit high right now, but just simply comparing Tesla to VW or whatever doesn&#x27;t cut it.')
