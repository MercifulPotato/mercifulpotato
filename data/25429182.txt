Honestly, it&#x27;s a bit shameful that a device that is marketed as the gold standard in privacy would even support such an identifier in the first place, it has literally no purpose beyond mining peoples&#x27; data.<p>Now that the third-party tracking ecosystem is slowly drying out I&#x27;m curious what advertisers will come up with to circumvent these new measures. Anyone here that works in the industry and wants to share some plans?')
