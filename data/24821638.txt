Item(by='overgard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603060183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819040, text='&gt; If you introduced to C++ a Result type, or a package manager (I assume people have done this already), most C++ developers wouldn&#x27;t end up using them. Most libraries wouldn&#x27;t be using the same vocabulary. It would be arduous to even move the standard library over, because it would be a breaking change. Much of the tooling out there would probably never get specialized support.<p>CMake kinda makes me think there&#x27;s definite interest in this kind of thing in the C++ community. It&#x27;s janky and horrible, but it has tackled the module&#x2F;package&#x2F;library issue a little bit (not in an elegant sense but its a little more standardized)')
