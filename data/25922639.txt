This is an important distinction.  Removing duplicate code might not be removing duplicate knowledge and having duplicate&#x2F;similar code doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;re duplicating knowledge.<p>A toy example: if you happen to have 2 products that are the same price you still wouldn&#x27;t want to combine them into one constant value.<p>Some code might be similar by happenstance and combining that will cause problems when that happenstance stops being the case.')
