Use it all. You are working with multiple windows 50 chars wide each? Use it all.<p>Having long lines simply because you like long lines is usually hard to understand, but the opposite is also true. Each line should be &#x27;one logic instruction&#x27;, splitting a function call for the last parameter looks just wrong (for me) specially if it is placed below with 70 spaces at the beginning.<p>Try to display heavy 80-chars code in a 70-wide window and you&#x27;ll see (same as for some emails).')
