I&#x27;ve rebuilt them from the ground up, done a lot of chassis work on them and made them go a lot faster than they originally were designed to.<p>The classic mini is a work of art. You <i>can</i> do just about anything with it. But the balancing act between weight, handling, size and power is a delicate one.<p>Adding batteries and an electric motor is for sure going to upset that balance in ways that you will not enjoy as much as you may think and I suggest that before you embark on a project like this to find one and drive it first, to see if it is something that you will like once it is done.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Mini&#x27;s are notoriously hard sprung and that you&#x27;re going to have a hard time getting it to handle safely. Personally I&#x27;d pick another platform, if you want to go vintage try a Citroen DS or a VW Beetle. Slightly more room to play with, especially the beetle is a breeze with the rear wheel drive drive-train.<p>It will also end up being a lot more reliable and probably cheaper too because you won&#x27;t have to miniaturize everything and getting rid of excess heat will be a lot easier.<p>Finally, note that in most countries this is not going to be road legal, in the UK it can be done but elsewhere you are going to have to go through a very expensive test regime in order to get certified.')
