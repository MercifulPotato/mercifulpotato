You can&#x27;t compete without recreating the same issues that those giants already have in the US or China. I don&#x27;t even <i>want to</i> compete with Facebook just to have European Facebook, it&#x27;d suck just as much.<p>I want smaller companies, which don&#x27;t abuse data, which don&#x27;t sacrifice security for &#x27;hypergrowth&#x27;, who are able to moderate their content and comply with laws rather than ignore them, and so on. Companies like this will never compete with American or Chinese giants in a &#x27;free market&#x27;. It&#x27;s like having a green energy company compete with companies that can legally pour their waste into the river.<p>The EU needs to create rules to reward small companies and to curb large ones. Don&#x27;t copy &quot;maximal consumer welfare&quot; doctrines or prioritise convenience, promote decentralisation. It looks like there&#x27;s some good stuff in these new laws, but they don&#x27;t go far enough yet.')
