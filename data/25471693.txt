Look at the difference between Apple&#x27;s &quot;little&quot; cores and the stock ARM &quot;little&quot; core.<p>&gt;The performance showcased here roughly matches a 2.2GHz Cortex-A76 which is essentially 4x faster than the performance of any other mobile SoC today which relies on Cortex-A55 cores, all while using roughly the same amount of system power and having 3x the power efficiency.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16192&#x2F;the-iphone-12-review&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16192&#x2F;the-iphone-12-review&#x2F;2</a><p>Apple&#x27;s Icestorm &quot;little&quot; cores are in the same performance ballpark as the big cores in the Qualcomm variant of a Galaxy S10.<p>That&#x27;s a night and day difference.')
