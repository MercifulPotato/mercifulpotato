Huge hedge funds are called market movers for a reason.  These hedge funds decide to short your company&#x27;s stock and they have a direct impact on your stock value regardless of whether the hedge fund has any basis for actually shorting.  Their &quot;reason&quot; can be 100% bullshit.  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  They put a large short position on your company and it has an immediate direct impact.<p>Not only that, like you said about disinformation, it also allows them to get other parts of the market to also jump on board.<p>The way shorting works with hedge funds is that it is a self fulfilling prophecy a huge majority of the time<p>And people talk about how capitalism has driven companies to only care about the next quarter.  Everyone realizes this is overall a bad thing.  Short sellers are one of the reasons you have to do that.<p>I don&#x27;t believe shorts have any intrinsic value they are actually bringing to the market.  People choosing not to buy stock at existing prices does the same thing people claim shorting does.  You don&#x27;t need to borrow stock and sell it back making a profit to have a functioning trading system.')
