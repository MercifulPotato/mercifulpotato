I made my way into a tech career in what would properly be described as “hacker” in the traditional sense, though I never applied the term to myself. I came into a ton of formal knowledge and became quite talented through paths that opened with recognition of my experience and skills. I’m going into the job market for the first time in a few years and this is exactly what I feared.<p>That said, I’m still very talented and I’m not going to let it shake me. Y’all can have the rat race, I’ll go find myself a place I can be productive.')
