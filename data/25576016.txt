Prisoners also sew their employee uniforms, and they only make a few cents an hour from it.\n\n    Target – Since the early 2000s, Target has relied on suppliers that are known to use prison labor.\n\n    IBM – Apparently, inmates from Lockhart Prison in Texas manufacture this tech giant’s circuit boards.\n\n    Texas Instruments – Like IBM, their circuit boards are also made by prisoners. They even got a new factory assembly room specially made for inmate laborers.\n\n    Boeing – A subcontractor of Boeing was found to have used inmates to cut airplane components. Unsurprisingly, the prisoners only get paid less than a quarter of the usual wage for such type of work.\n\n    Nordstrom – The company was once under fire for selling jeans made by inmates. They have since stopped the practice though, and have promised not to use involuntary labor of any kind again.\n\n    Intel – Like other tech giants in this list, Intel has also outsourced labor from prison. Some of their computer parts were made in a prison manufacturing facility.\n\n    Walmart – Despite pledging not to sell products made by prisoners, some of the retail giant’s subcontractors were using prison labor to dispose of customer returns and excess inventory.\n\n    Victoria’s Secret – The top American underwear designer was paying inmates peanuts to make their expensive lingerie.\n    AT&amp;T – Rather than outsource their call centers to other English-speaking countries, AT&amp;T hired prisoners instead. The problem is, they only receive $2 an hour for a job that usually pays $15.\n\n    British Petroleum (BP) – In 2010, BP hired Louisiana inmates to clean up an oil spill. They received no payment from it.\n\n    Starbucks – We all know that Starbucks employees make little hourly. But the prisoners who make the packaged coffee sold in their stores make even much less money. They only receive as little as 23 cents an hour.\n\n    Microsoft – In the 1990s, Microsoft made a conscious decision to hire prisoners to pack their software and mouse. A spokesperson at that time even claimed that the company sees nothing wrong about it.\n\n    Honda Motor Company – The Japanese car company hires inmates from Ohio Mansfield Correctional Institution to make some of its car parts. As expected, the company paid them next to nothing.\n\n    Macy’s – Like Walmart and Target, this retail giant also uses prison labor to save on its operating costs.\n\n    Sprint – Following the footsteps of its competitor, AT&amp;T, Sprint also staffs its call centers with underpaid inmates.\n\n    Nintendo – To pack their Game Boys, Nintendo hired a subcontractor who, in turn, hires prisoners at deplorable rates.\n\n    JC Penney – Since the 90s, JC Penney has used prison labor for its clothing line. Female inmates used to sew leisurewear sold in their stores, and more recently, prisoners from Tennessee are making jeans for them.\n\n    Wendy’s – As part of its cost-cutting measures, Wendy’s uses prison labor to process beef for their hamburgers.\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.globaltel.com&#x2F;companies-use-prison-labor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.globaltel.com&#x2F;companies-use-prison-labor&#x2F;</a>')
