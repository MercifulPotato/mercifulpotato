Apparently Reed-Solomon decoding needed a ton of matrix-multiplications.<p>Modern &quot;NPU Hardware&quot; is simply systolic compute.<p>------------<p>Traditional CPUs load data and then store data. The core itself can remain unchanging in the demands of different applications.<p>Systolic Compute always loads&#x2F;stores data in the same order, as it traverses across your systolic array. The systolic array designed for CD-ROM playback is quite different than the systolic array for NPUs.<p>You gain faster speeds by building the hardware itself to handle the load&#x2F;store pattern of the algorithm. That way the CPU-core itself doesn&#x27;t waste time on loads&#x2F;stores, nor do you have to worry about memory bandwidth issues or whatever.<p>But by doing so: you lock yourself into a particular application. Modern neural-net NPUs can only do FP16 matrix multiplications.<p>That&#x27;s fine. If you want the fastest neural net in the world, systolic arrays will get you there. But that thing will ONLY be able to do neural net calculations, nothing else.<p>Maybe you build the systolic array into an FPGA so that you can reconfigure the hardware later. Or maybe you just go with an ASIC because you&#x27;re Google and can afford to build out clusters of ASICs of Systolic Arrays that can only do tensor-calculations.')
