He stated that it enabled voter fraud by eliminating chain of custody.  I have yet to hear a single advocate of mail-in voting explain how chain of custody can be preserved and ballot harvesting prevented.  There is clear evidence of harvesting, e.g. 100K ballots 99% for Biden, dropped off at a polling station in Philadelphia with no chain of custody, no Republican poll watchers allowed in the room, nothing downballot i.e. only Biden was selected on the ballots - this is ballot harvesting, at a very minimum.')
