This is an argument for citizens to get more involved in their government process, and to avoid being suckered by government fear-mongering that results in citizen&#x27;s accepting ridiculous intrusions into their lives.<p>Apple deciding to allow or not allow third-party app stores is irrelevant in the face of a government that has decided to pass a law that requires a particular app to be on all phones.  If that law is passed, that app will end up on phones, regardless.  The only alternative is that Apple would give up a market consisting the second-most populous country in the world, which isn&#x27;t likely.')
