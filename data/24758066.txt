This includes censoring and de-platforming voices that don&#x27;t agree with them.<p>After you&#x27;ve convinced yourself that &quot;I believe that we should hire whoever is the most qualified, regardless of their ethnicity&quot; or &quot;I believe that all lives matter equally, none more than any other&quot; are HATE SPEECH, it&#x27;s very easy to convince yourself to ban people with those opinions from being able to speak their opinion.  This is why throwing around &quot;Nazi!&quot;, &quot;White Supremacist!&quot; for people not actually exhibiting those behaviors is so dangerous.  Once you de-humanize someone, it&#x27;s easier to convince yourself to take away their human rights (like free speech).')
