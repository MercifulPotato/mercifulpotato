Its only got so many TSMC slots. We&#x27;re in a period where every chipmaker is selling out every single chip they make, but AMD still isn&#x27;t making as much revenue as NVidia or Intel because they&#x27;re simply capacity constrained.<p>AMD will stick around for sure IMO, but they&#x27;re not nearly as strong as their stock price makes them seem. With that being said, the Xilinx purchase (lolwut?) will put them in a stronger position.<p>Frankly though, AMD has no business buying a behemoth like Xilinx. But... if their investors give them enough money, then sure, I guess its a good move.')
