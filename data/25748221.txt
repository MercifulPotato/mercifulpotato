If the government pressures twitter to ban your account, that&#x27;s censorship and a violation of freedom of speech.<p>My argument was that your right to freedom of speech does not compel others to publish your speech.<p>If you send me an e-mail with your opinion and the instruction to forward it to all my contacts, then I am not violating your freedom of speech by refusing to do so.<p>And yes, freedom of speech does not protect net neutrality. That&#x27;s why we need the FCC to set those rules and enforce them.<p>What some people are arguing for is a sort of &quot;opinion neutrality&quot; for social media companies that forces them to treat all opinions equally without moderation.<p>You can certainly debate the pros and cons of such a rule, but it&#x27;s not a consequence of your right to freedom of speech.')
