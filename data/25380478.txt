So no points to YC for choosing them out of the applicant pool on their own merits.<p>The Airbnb founders seem to be good at Making Friends and Influencing People. Which is clearly a valuable trait in Silicon Valley but not all that admirable. Neither is the business they built, which has caused perhaps as much misery in the world as it has eliminated.<p>YC set out to create the next generation of tech companies like Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Apple. Instead, YC has only helped to launch some pretty mediocre companies that will be hardly be footnotes in history. Sure, they made money, but they were already rich.<p>The Airbnb and DoorDash IPOs are evidence of YC&#x27;s failure to achieve its real mission rather than evidence that it succeeded. If it had succeeded, we&#x27;d all be talking about the Google-killer or Apple-killer they launched, and not these super boring room rental and food delivery services they&#x27;re left with as a consolation prizes.<p>It&#x27;d be awesome to see YC&#x27;s original mission fulfilled. It was a grand idea and would be great for the world.')
