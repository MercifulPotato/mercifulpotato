They&#x27;re specifically for reducing strain on the eyes when focusing at short distances for longer periods of time, which is the core of the problem.<p>Before I got a prescription for such - which has completely solved the problems I suffered for a long time - I had to resort to tricks like taking frequent breaks just to focus my eyes on things at longer distances, which is only a band-aid rather than an actual solution to the problem.')
