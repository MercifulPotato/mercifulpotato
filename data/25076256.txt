Together with colleagues from Sandia National Laboratories, and Microsoft we want to better understand experiences of LGBTIQ+ software managers and engineers related to mentoring. We want to ask you a few questions on what mentorship means to you, and whether you have any experiences to share as a mentor, mentee, or both. Through this research, we seek to identify effective mentorship practices and to develop methods to help policy-makers and team leads promote a more inclusive workplace culture.<p>Participants must be 18+.
