The state loves sticking its nose into pretty much every area where it doesn&#x27;t belong; they want to tell you on what days and from whom you can buy groceries; in many fields you&#x27;re not allowed to start a business without permission from competitors; their gun laws are about as restrictive as they come while still being shall-issue; marijuana and gambling (except for the state-run numbers racket) are still illegal. The city governments of any political leaning aren&#x27;t any better; Austin still hasn&#x27;t legalized building housing other than detached single-family in the overwhelming majority of residential-zoned land.<p>It may have low taxes, but Texas is the furthest thing imaginable from a small-government state.')
