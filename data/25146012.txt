Private equity is a scapegoat for outdated business models. Covering up a non-viable business with the appreciation of your buildings is an accounting trick (and was a big factor in the 2010 crisis: a lot of companies went bankrupt not because their businesses suddenly became unviable, but because their businesses had been unviable for years but they made a profit on the value of their buildings); selling off the building while it&#x27;s still worth something and letting the actual business stand or fall on its merits is a better approach.')
