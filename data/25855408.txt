I really enjoyed both <i>Salt Dreams</i> and the book about Fresno water development history linked in some of those comments (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;water-for-a-thirsty-land-the-consolidated-irrigation-district-and-its-canal-development-history&#x2F;oclc&#x2F;36954078&amp;referer=brief_results" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;water-for-a-thirsty-land-the-...</a>).<p>Fresno has a really rich history with regards to water development and I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t get more press for that. I also liked the bus system there.<p>Meanwhile, Fresno is the butt of jokes in movies and otherwise mostly gets ignored.')
