Drugs need to be developed. From idea to market only a tiny fraction of medication makes it. You need studies ovet studies, and most of the time a drug does not make it through that process because it&#x27;s ineffective or dangerous or both. The few that make it need to compensate for the cost of this process, not just their own but all of those that didn&#x27;t make it.<p>So, in &quot;rich&quot; countries, a pill that costs $0.10 to produce can easily cost $1000. That&#x27;s a necessity to finance the whole process of getting there.<p>After that is all done and established, sure, you may get that same pill for $1 since it&#x27;s either that or no sale. But that does not mean the whole system would work for $1 per pill everywhere in the world. Then the pill would not exist in the first place.')
