I started out doing WordPress, and that&#x27;s still what mostly what makes me money.<p>But now that I am using 30-40 different machines that host 3-400 sites, each with their own installs, and knowing how to do stuff efficiently with the shell is super useful.<p>To me, that situation feels kinda unlikely, but at the same time dang it&#x27;s nice to just ssh into a machine and know what I&#x27;m doing.<p>I have coworkers and clients who just can&#x27;t do certain kinds of tasks or troubleshoot stuff with certain kinds of tools because they just don&#x27;t have the CLI knowledge.<p>So while I generally agree with your post, I will offer an alternate idea to balance it: if folks are thinking that learning how to use a shell is a waste of time because they can do everything in a GUI, if they took the time to learn the shell at a a level of most of the things they use every day in an IDE, they are &quot;not losing in efficiency at all and possibly making gains when it comes to certain tasks.&quot;')
