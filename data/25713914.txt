If siasky.net is compromised it will serve you code which steals the account. This is strictly inferior to normal web, as you need to trust both the app developer and the portal code is served from.<p>Having multiple mirrors is NOT decentralization.<p>My criteria for &quot;decentralized web&quot; candidates are:<p><pre><code>  * credentials are managed by a trusted component outside of controls of apps, let alone mirrors\n  * content integrity is checked before it is used\n  * switching between nodes happens automatically in \n    background, there should be no SPoF (i.e. if download \n    through node 1 fails client should automatically retry \n    from node 2 and so on).\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think you can achieve this without integrating with a browser.')
