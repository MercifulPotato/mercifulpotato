So some places already do this. Unfortunately that database went down multiple times during the day, leading to long queues and delays for voters.<p>In Australia, we do a similar check, but using paper rolls and cross-check for duplicates afterwards. No computer to go down means no delays.\nIf they find a duplicate they investigate, and if there&#x27;s ever enough to make a difference, they would re-run the election in that area.\nOnce we lost a box of votes and they had to re-run the election across a whole state to make sure.')
