Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=[25231114], score=None, time=1606495210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229903, text='&gt; I guess the reason why the Italian consortium sent this (otherwise stupid) cease-and-desist to this poor Australian guy, is because they&#x27;re desperately trying to defend the real stuff from the fakes.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;otherwise stupid&quot; it _is_ stupid. They should be going after the counterfeiters not someone who is both trying to educate people on making as authentic a cheese as possible while simultaneously making very clear that his cheese is not a true grana padano. Personally after seeing the consortium act like this, I consider all their other actions suspect. In my mind, this weakens their legitimacy as an organization. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only person with this reaction.<p>&gt; I sympathize with the guy, but it&#x27;s a global battle; and organizations that are supposed to defend the consumer are doing next to nothing (expecially in the US). This is not about protecting a &quot;brand&quot;; it&#x27;s about the fact that when you buy grana padano in the US and it&#x27;s made of sh*t, you as a consumer should be able to tell.<p>That has _nothing_ to do with this youtuber.')
