You can interpret the strings however you want.<p>JSX actually doesn&#x27;t return a data structure. It&#x27;s syntax only and some transforms do things quite different from what React.createElement() does. And this is part of the problem with it and why it can&#x27;t really be standardized - there&#x27;s no semantics <i>to</i> standardize.<p>lit-html as an render implementation does indeed target only the DOM, it&#x27;s not trying to target non-web platforms.')
