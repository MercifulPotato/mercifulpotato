My first assignment was to test torpedos that could hit the same spot on a submarine.  Why?  Because the double-hulls of the Typhoon were made of titanium.  A Mark 46 could hit it and I doubt the crew would even notice (exaggeration, of course, but you get my point).<p>My second assignment was to write programs that processed data from a towed sonar array.  We were looking for ways to find Typhoon submarines hiding in underwater canyons.<p>It is funny to me now to see a Typhoon mothballed with tourists crawling all over it.  We were honestly scared of this thing.')
