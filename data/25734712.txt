E.g. right now a lot of the supposedly separated bike lanes near me in Manhattan aren&#x27;t protected in any meaningful way, so you often see cars illegally parked in them and sometimes even driving in them (!).  Protection is as simple as physical curbs and other barriers that prevent vehicles from being able to get into the bike lanes.  That&#x27;s protection.  Intersections actually do tend to be protected the most because they have started building some curbs at corners as pedestrian refuges between the bike and vehicle lanes, which have the side-effect of keeping cars out.')
