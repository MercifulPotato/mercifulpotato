The exact % changes depending on population dynamics (who gets sick, and where), but the biggest contributing factor is the number of people in the previous stage of the pipeline. (If you double cases, then a few weeks later, hospitalizations will almost certainly double).<p>If a case-spike happens, the idea is to make a decision <i></i>BEFORE<i></i> hospitalization spikes up a few weeks later. We want to be ahead of the wave, not behind it.')
