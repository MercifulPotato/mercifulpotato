You need to consider your bias when you say &quot;gimped&quot;, especially when using it to paint everyone with negative character traits which should always make you reevaluate what you&#x27;re saying.<p>Most people don&#x27;t give a shit about browser extensions to begin with on any browser, not just Safari. But those who do can probably figure out how to google &quot;safari ad blocker&quot; like they do in any other browser.<p>uBlock Origin gets 99% of the way with its declarative AdBlock filter rules (like EasyList). That you don&#x27;t seem to know that is a red flag on your ability to evaluate alternatives. Arbitrary code per network request is only useful for some niche improvements that almost nobody cares about.<p>uMatrix is what&#x27;s hard to build with declarative rules. And almost nobody, even among HNers, cares enough to use that. Certainly a loss, to be clear, but not a good example of why every browser needs that API just so a handful of powerusers can use it.')
