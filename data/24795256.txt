The fact that there is plenty of evidence for ancient civilizations before the Greeks believing the Earth to be flat (for example, descriptions in their mythology) indicates to me that the observations needed to figure out that the Earth is round are not superficial. Sure, it seems like they are if you live in a society that already has the belief and can teach it to you. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they actually are.<p><i>&gt; this is really just a myth</i><p>The myth referred to in that Wikipedia article (which I fully agree is a myth) has nothing whatever to do with what I said, or with early Christians. You are attacking a straw man.<p>What I said, in fact, is stronger than the statements made in that Wikipedia article. The article only says that &quot;scholars have supported&quot; the view that the Earth is round since the 600s AD. <i>I</i> said that the Christian church had taught it since it accepted it as dogma, and that, AFAIK, was several centuries earlier than the 600s AD.')
