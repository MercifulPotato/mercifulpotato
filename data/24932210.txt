That is an idea that should be eradicated. Something that may blow off, at least partially, this century, can&#x27;t wait the hundreds to thousands of years for the backup plan that may provide the space exploration.<p>Yes, it is something that we should keep researching. But it won&#x27;t be a solution for our urgent problems.')
