War is effectively another means of politics (Clausewitz&#x27;s quote is often mangled a bit). So if you would prefer no military alliance, you would first need to abolish all political alliances. No trade agreements, no environmental agreements, so on and so forth. What causes conflicts isn&#x27;t military issues, it&#x27;s political issues.')
