While I&#x27;m not trading these stocks, what if this happens with a stock I <i>do</i> have money in?<p>Initially I had thought, &quot;hey, there&#x27;s this Interactive Brokers place that seems a bit further removed from places like Robinhood or Fidelity&#x2F;Schwab&#x2F;TD&#x2F;ETrade.&quot; But apparently they&#x27;re now blocking trades too.<p>What is the right way to ensure you&#x27;re able to trade?
