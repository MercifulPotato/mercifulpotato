Item(by='bavent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611088230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837570, text='Some of the deaths caused at the protests last summer were actually caused by right wingers shooting protestors, such as Kyle Rittenhouse, a child with an illegally-purchased firearm, breaking curfew, but whose presence was condoned by the police even though he was breaking the law. Garrett Foster was killed at a protest by a right-wing guy who shot him as he (the right-wing guy) was trying to drive through the protest crowd. Heather Heyer in Charlottesville. Even when left-wing people are having a peaceful protest, they are murdered by right-wing terrorists.<p>The very few incidents of left-wing people attacking&#x2F;killing others are not planned, premeditated, organized things like the attack on the U.S. capitol. No left-wing people are showing up to marches with zip ties planning to kidnap politicians. No left-wing people are planting pipe bombs at political offices. No left-wing groups are trying to infiltrate the police to...demand police reform or make them stop killing minorities? Shit maybe they should. Much better than right-wing groups infiltrating them to hopefully incite a race war.<p>If you can&#x27;t tell the difference between people protesting police brutality and the police targeting of minority groups, and people storming U.S. state capitols and the federal capitol with guns, trucks full of bombs, zip ties, etc., as part of a planned action, then this discussion is pointless.')
