That was an interesting read.<p>This has happened a few times. First with TunSafe, I think it also happened with CloudFlare&#x27;s WG implementation, etc. The idea that a third party unsupported implementation shouldn&#x27;t count.<p>I think this is a case of the message being lost in the tone. As a user of Wireguard, I definitely don&#x27;t want to think about whether this is an official implementation. But having many competing implementations is exactly what would cause confusion (imagine a news article talking about how someone overcame a Wireguard exploit to get into a network).<p>It&#x27;s like having 20 different apps that claim to be compatible with Signal. I&#x27;d have no idea which ones have gotten the same amount of rigorous testing. Fragmentation in these kinds of areas (especially when the original project is itself open source and hasn&#x27;t stagnated) can often make things worse by causing even a little bit of doubt or hesitation.')
