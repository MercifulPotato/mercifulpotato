The data is REALLY bad. That small group will create a larger group who would provide support (financial, etc).  Once a critical mass is hit, the larger group who was turned away because of bad feelings will come around.<p>It&#x27;s more important to focus on the people who would actually do something and who would provide support. These articles and stories don&#x27;t turn away the people doing all the work, it actually inspires them more.<p>For example, I am one of those people and this article makes me want to do more and puts more urgency into it.')
