The top schools all reject a bunch of 1600 scorers every year. If all you have going for you are good grades + good SAT you probably aren&#x27;t going to get into an elite place. Sure it&#x27;ll help you get into a tier 2 school, but at that point you&#x27;re usually better off with a public option.')
