I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that it feels or is cult like at any point.  I think the Internet, and some perspectives of those who have written about him, may give that impression.  But Wim is about sharing, not bringing you into his fold and sucking resources out of you.  Wim has a large personality which can work against him in some regard.  I learned a lot from Wim and his instructors and I have better understanding of myself.  I would highly recommend his excursions to anyone that has an open mind that&#x27;s interested in learning about themselves and meeting like-minded people in the process.<p>A couple good resources for you to check out if you&#x27;re interested. Scott Carney does the best job of dispelling Wim as his original intent was to basically shine the light on Wim&#x27;s snake oil in &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Kill Us&quot; [0] (spoiler: that is not the end result).  Scott recently released a new book called &quot;The Wedge&quot; [1] that incorporates some of Wim but a lot of other practices and people that fit into the idea that we have more control than we realize and getting out of our comfort zone has healthful benefits.  Being in 100% climate controlled perfect environments doesn&#x27;t always help us.  The other one I&#x27;d recommend is James Nestor&#x27;s new book called &quot;Breath&quot; [2].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottcarney.com&#x2F;what-doesnt-kill-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottcarney.com&#x2F;what-doesnt-kill-us</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottcarney.com&#x2F;the-wedge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottcarney.com&#x2F;the-wedge</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrjamesnestor.com&#x2F;breath&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrjamesnestor.com&#x2F;breath&#x2F;</a>')
