Item(by='enkienki', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611126323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837378, text='The only thing I see reddit as being useful for is its oddly specific questions.<p>The mentality on that site is &quot;support everything as long as it follows our values as a whole&quot; so you&#x27;ll see a bunch of a random questions being answered relatively well, personally helping me with those random things I know nothing about.<p>As a normal place to be though? It&#x27;s brainwashing. Most people don&#x27;t spend enough time on these sites to realize but I&#x27;ve worked a job where I had a solid 3 hours out of every day to browse. It&#x27;s quite literally the same opinions being held at the top of the comment section. If your opinion isn&#x27;t in line with the standard, it&#x27;s downvoted, regardless of your fact behind it.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve had an argument with someone about anxiety and they described their issue as mentally debilitating. They really couldn&#x27;t handle chatting with someone online, let alone talking with people. I have no issue with that but I did point out that we&#x27;ve been arguing back and forth for maybe 5-6 posts now and they have been growing with aggressiveness. Over this argument, I received close to 100 downvotes, then got banned from the community.<p>The initial post? It was about a drug to treat anxiety and how groundbreaking it was going to be. I mentioned in my post that, coming from a family of pharmacists and seeing effects firsthand, I know of a lot of people who get significantly worse because of drugs like this. Specifically mentioning that you need to get tested in multiple ways before something like this should be considered (talking about the effects of a similar drug for depression).<p>Socially it&#x27;s a terrible place to be. Factually, quite interesting if you ignore karma (but they make it really hard to ignore karma).')
