You want a few people who innovate, but otherwise much prefer to delay the future by 10-20 years than to the potential risks of bringing it sooner.<p>If the same was prevalent in software, we&#x27;d likely still be coding in COBOL on IBM mainframes.<p>Tesla is a very interesting case study - actually managing to bring the future sooner (with relatively small accumulated damage so far) in a field where being conservative is considered a virtue.<p>If you&#x27;d rather work with the apprenticed person, this model still exists in banks, who are willing to pay big bucks to maintain their cobol backends.')
