At the end of the day, mobile Facebook app gets most of its data from FB servers? So, If someone has liked &#x2F;YellowBirds page and spent 2 hours on &#x2F;BirdsBirdsBirds page, you kinda get they are into the birds? Wouldn&#x27;t that already provide looots of information?<p>If they don&#x27;t use IDFA, I guess they would loose capability of linking the events from different apps. I don&#x27;t know targeted advertising world that much, but is that a big deal? I think even without cross app tracking, FB has capability to provide quite detailed targeting. I&#x27;m not sure why they reacted this aggressive, feels to me like there is egos involved, possibly Zuck struggling to accept Tim can force him to do something.<p>Other thing I wonder is how this notification going to look like in the apps using FB SDKs.')
