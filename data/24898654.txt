I don&#x27;t know if Google is having a bad rollout or this is deliberate but my Google Home is being triggered a lot more often now and I don&#x27;t recall anything remotely close to the wake phrase being said. Also, the responses to questions when actually prompted are not at all what I&#x27;m expecting. Particularly, Google has trouble understanding a lot of context around Spotify playlists. It still cannot distinguish between a song and an album with the same name despite me prepending the request with &quot;Play the Song...&quot;. Overall it&#x27;s just a terrible experience and that makes the whole assistant thing less like an assistant and more like a toddler that refuses to cooperate.')
