Adobe, Apple Inc., Google, Intel, Intuit, Pixar, Lucasfilm and eBay.<p>Apple&#x27;s involvement was particularly egregious: they threatened to destroy adobe with spurious patent litigation unless they participated.  Google executives also explicitly acknowledged that there actions were illegal and directed staff to keep discussions about it out of email.<p>The companies basically got a slap on the wrist: the settlement was a tiny fraction of direct saving the cartel members enjoyed from wage fixing.  Almost no incentive to not do it again, just next time don&#x27;t leave emails explicitly acknowledging your criminal activities.<p>Their actions didn&#x27;t just hurt their own employees, they depressed wages industry wide.  After the scheme stopped these companies reset their pay scales.  I got a substantial increase in pay even though I was not working for a participating company and worked on the clear other side of the country (I worked for a company HQed in Sunnyvale and who heavily competed in that job market).')
