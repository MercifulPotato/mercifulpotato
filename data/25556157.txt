It&#x27;s cool to see how people work, and I&#x27;m sure the folks building the services you&#x27;re using appreciate the kind words.<p>I also had kind of a strange reaction to it, which I tried to figure out, and I&#x27;ll explain it in case it&#x27;s at all representative of other reactions being posted here.<p>I think it&#x27;s just kind of intimidating to read a list of SaaS someone else uses. After reading the whole list, in the back of my head I&#x27;m imagining the burden of learning all of these all at once, of managing  a dozen new passwords and payments I&#x27;m not currently managing, etc, and I&#x27;m not imagining an improvement to my own workflow because my work doesn&#x27;t match yours.<p>It&#x27;s easy to imagine getting zero or negative value out of any SaaS if it&#x27;s not solving a problem I personally have.<p>But on the other hand it&#x27;s hard to imagine getting less than 12&#x2F;mo for any service that is doing something for me. And it&#x27;s hard to imagine that a 3 person team mistakenly believes they like some service they&#x27;re using.<p>So I&#x27;ll skip the judgment about how you&#x27;re spending money on improving your work environment and say thanks for the post.')
