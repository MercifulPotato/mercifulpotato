I remember calling it &quot;pearl milk tea&quot; in middle school, somehow switching over to &quot;bubble tea&quot; in late high school to college, and now calling it &quot;boba&quot;. And I don&#x27;t think I heard of the slang meaning until much later.<p>Aside from that, as I am a first generation (native-born) Chinese-American, this article discusses my identity scarily well from an angle that I never really thought about. Despite Subtle Asian Traits becoming popular around the time that I was cutting my Facebook usage after I graduated and started work and &quot;boba liberalism&quot; being a term I learned today, I&#x27;m not really that many steps removed from this all. Why is it that I subconsciously tried hard to prove myself to classmates that I&#x27;m an American, but on the other hand, I tried to be as &quot;Asian&quot; as my Asian-American classmates? This article hit a cultural identity nerve in me and I haven&#x27;t really formed a coherent set of thoughts on it.<p>(Maybe this also ties into why I&#x27;m such a boba purist in that I reject anything that isn&#x27;t tapioca balls + whole milk + some sugar but not too much + good tea, though when I&#x27;m feeling less tolerant of lactose, oat milk surprisingly tastes almost no different from whole milk in a boba drink.)<p>Also, the boba metaphor for culture that the author presented also really works well in another way. A person born of parents from Shanghai and a person born of parents from Beijing can have very different cultural backgrounds, but that richness gets lost when they become Chinese-Americans. Similarly to how boba, a Taiwanese drink, has become a de facto symbol of Asian American cultural identity overall. Some might argue this is a &quot;bad thing&quot;, but, well, as I mentioned earlier, I&#x27;m still coming up with a coherent set of thoughts around this.')
