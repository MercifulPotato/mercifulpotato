The components that gets this barebones computer working have now been a permanent clutter that have displaced where I&#x27;m supposed to work on personal hobbies.<p>It is also a hassle every time we are required to sign paper documents as I don&#x27;t have a printer (not that I can&#x27;t afford it, but normally it would be a white elephant). What should take several minutes will now take at least 15 when doing stuff with PDFs and photographs of signs.<p>As I live alone and am quite picky on food, this also means I have to cook more often. So more kitchen tasks while making sure vegetables are consumed fresh. Not being able to do groceries &quot;just-in-time&quot; has also lead to some inefficiencies.<p>As work-personal boundaries are blurred, I also decided to pause my work inspired side project. Partly because of discipline (it helped me make work results, so it&#x27;s very tempting to work on it during &quot;work hours&quot;) and partly because it bothers me that my workplace can claim ownership on things they could not have come up by themselves and never knew they needed. Thankfully I was able to shift my mind on another interesting side project.')
