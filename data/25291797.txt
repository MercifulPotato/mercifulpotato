Frank (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;12035503-the-darwin-economy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;12035503-the-darwin-econ...</a>) where he proposes a tax on super expensive luxury consumption precisely because its main utility is social signalling. For example, spending $6 million on a sweet 16 party would have exactly the same utility as spending $3 million and paying $3 million in taxes on it, if everyone had to do the same. Probably more useful as a thought experiment than workable policy, but interesting to consider.')
