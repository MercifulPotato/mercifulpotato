Anything advertised lesser should be viewed with suspicion, particularly for safety critical products.<p>All that said, there are opportunities to improve, but those opportunities mainly exist in the software space.  Focusing on hardware solely to create a moat isn&#x27;t innovation, it&#x27;s making landfill fodder.<p>Finally, I have significant experience in this area, both as an athlete and a coach.  Enough that I would unmask myself very quickly if I mentioned any details.  I don&#x27;t coach anymore and don&#x27;t have any financial interest in that either.  Teaching people to use these devices safely isn&#x27;t an &quot;instructional videos&quot; and &quot;warm up&quot; ordeal.  This will sound silly but people generally don&#x27;t know what their body is doing without tight feedback loops and their perception breaks down under stress&#x2F;over the duration of a workout.  We frequently had people row in front of mirrors to get things to click (another business opportunity in the computer vision space).  It&#x27;s painfully obvious when you go anywhere that has mixed classically trained and self trained rowers who is who.<p>I only raise questions because the move-fast-break-things approach is dangerous when you&#x27;re breaking people.  I couldn&#x27;t care less about the VCs getting fleeced by this.')
