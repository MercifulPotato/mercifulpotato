I write maybe a 100 lines of PHP, slap on a HTML template, some Vue.js here and there... and there you go, your small project is ready. Many people do similar with Wordpress, jQuery, etc. In my case, clients also get a synced staging site so they can even do upgrades on their own (click giant upgrade button, sync if it works, open ticket when not).<p>If it&#x27;s going to take more than a week, I directly involve Entity Framework (recently more Dapper than EF but anyway), React&#x2F;Next.js, Typescript (switched from NHibernate + knockout.js to this stack lately). Most of the pages are rendered on the server. Performance is crazy. Maintainability is great too! They need to call me, or hire one of the many react&#x2F;.NET devs available if an update&#x2F;migration is needed, but it&#x27;s easy to understand as no magic is involved.<p>We need to understand that these 2 are shockingly separate worlds. So, all these words just to say that I agree with you :) But there is one catch: Sometimes a quickly implemented site organically grows into multi-sites, or into an app that does more than to manage content, that&#x27;s the point the customer needs to understand these concepts too.<p>Better to explain to them from the beginning!')
