Your body is a colony, like an ant colony or bee colony. In all instances, most individuals can&#x27;t start a colony of their own but it&#x27;s limited to a set of queens&#x2F;gametic cells.<p>As for shooting into the head, some multicellular life forms can actually heal from that. From planaria you can remove any part of their bodies, it will grow back. Shooting into an ant colony won&#x27;t do much harm to them either, nor is removing the branch of a tree.
