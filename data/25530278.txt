Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608836259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25530045, text='A reasonable case can be made that (if we employ the &quot;is evenly divisible by 2&#x2F;has 2 as a factor&quot; definition) zero is not composite, so has no factors and therefore can&#x27;t be even.  I happen to disagree, but it&#x27;s not clearly right or wrong.  This is why when mathematicians from different subdisciplines&#x2F;communities spend a fair bit of time on &quot;when you use the term ... what do <i>you</i> mean?&quot;  Outside a shared definition of exactly what &quot;even&quot; means, the question is meaningless, and within one, it&#x27;s trivial---the least interesting possible questions in mathematics, but we seem to spend a lot of time on them.')
