People from Southern Europe constantly interrupt everybody and each other - which btw is also why I think they have to talk so quickly. If you don&#x27;t get your thought out in time, somebody will interrupt you, whether you are male or female.<p>It gets better heading towards Central and Northern Europe where it seems like culturally, people interrupt each other less. However then personality plays a bigger role and there are people who just need to insert their opinion right then and there - a pretty annoying trait in either sex, imo.')
