I might have ads in the future (for non-supporters) if a company whose product I actually use comes to me about it. My only goal right now is to be getting more than I pay per month on mailchimp&#x2F;hosting, which is about $55. Ultimately I hope that if people find value in the work I&#x27;m doing, they&#x27;ll help support it. If not, oh well. I&#x27;m enjoying curating, writing, and connecting with subscribers, and that&#x27;s enough for me at this point.')
