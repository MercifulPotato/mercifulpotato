Since the pledge was created in 2010, the wealth of the donors has not decreased but has instead increased from a combined $376 billion in 2010 to a combined $734 billion in 2020 [2]. Many who have made significant donations, have done so to private foundations, which often pay salaries to their family members and have no obligation by law to actually spend the wealth on active charity organisations.[citation needed]<p>Donations in general are a topic of public debate, in part, because in many countries they are tax-deductible, which means donations reduce tax obligations for individuals, and tax revenue for government.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MacKenzie_Scott" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MacKenzie_Scott</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Giving_Pledge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Giving_Pledge</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;real-time-billionaires&#x2F;#5f078cfc3d78" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;real-time-billionaires&#x2F;#5f078cfc3d78</a>')
