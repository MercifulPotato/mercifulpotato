There is a popular saying, &quot;Arithmetic is to mathematics as spelling is to writing.&quot; Of course, a mathematician is often good at arithmetic just like a writer is often good at spelling. However, someone merely good at arithmetic is no more a mathematician than someone good at spelling is a writer.<p>A related story from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ams.org&#x2F;notices&#x2F;200410&#x2F;fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ams.org&#x2F;notices&#x2F;200410&#x2F;fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf</a> quoted below:<p>&gt; There is also a running joke that mathematicians tend to be bad at mental calculations. The story about Grothendieck prime comes to my mind: In a mathematical conversation, someone suggested to Grothendieck that they should consider a particular prime number. &quot;You mean an actual number?&quot; Grothendieck asked. The other person replied, yes, an actual prime number. Grothendieck suggested, &quot;All right, take 57.&quot;')
