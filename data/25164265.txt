I love it and I think it&#x27;s gotten a easier to install over the years (hard to gauge because I also understand more), but it does lean towards the minimalist side. The big win for me is using a lightweight window manager (i3 in my case), which you can do with any distro.<p>My main recommendation is stick with one of the major distros because you&#x27;ll get more results when you search for solutions to issues. With Ubuntu you&#x27;ll find more hits for specific problems, but I think the quality is also sometimes lower. Whereas I think Arch has the best documentation (for linux in general, not just Arch) but in general you&#x27;ll need to understand more about what&#x27;s happening under the hood.')
