Why should they be forced to open it up? How are they limiting their competitors?<p>&gt; they are nearly 2x ahead of Qualcomm using the same ISA at the same power level in 3rd party userspace computation only benchmarks<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether you&#x27;re speaking about M1 or A14 here. A14 is just a bit faster than other mobile SOCs, certainly not 2x.<p>If you&#x27;re speaking about M1... well, what are you comparing it against from Qualcomm? Do they have a similar product, with a similar target and power envelope? The recently announced Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 from Qualcomm is around 6-7W TDP, which is 50% that of M1.<p>&gt;  There isn&#x27;t any vertical integration in those, the raw performance is just better.<p>I&#x27;m unconvinced. We need to consider the 5nm production process, the everything-on-soc approach, and the fact that Intel is selling more-or-less the same CPUs as 5 years ago. The Ryzen 7 4800U is quite close to the M1 both performance wise and TDP wise. Now, take a 4800U, make it 5nm, build a SoC with it which includes the memory and build a finely tuned OS - aka &quot;vertical integration&quot;. Would you really think you could appreciate a performance or thermal difference?')
