For starters, you&#x27;re basically giving your credit card company a free loan.<p>If given a choice between paying 100% and being done, or paying 105% and getting the 5% back later, almost no one would chose the 105% option. (I know it doesn&#x27;t actually work this way, but it&#x27;s still a good illustration.)<p>Additionally, that program necessarily adds some cost, which is just rolled into higher prices that you (and everyone else) pay.<p>All that said, I completely agree with your point. I wish credit card reward schemes would just go away.')
