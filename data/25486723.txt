(Chefs still communicate a lot like this with each other.) My favorite recipe direction ever, from Martha Washington&#x27;s family cookbook, is &quot;cook until it is enough&quot;.<p>Fanny Farmer invented the idea of rigorous measurements. And later, exact temperatures and times, when thermostats were invented. Scientific cooking is great for getting the results to come out every time and to communicate recipes to people who don&#x27;t already basically know them. That took a lot of standardization and didn&#x27;t come about until quite recently.')
