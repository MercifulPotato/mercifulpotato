Automated, self-replicating probes could reach every star system in the galaxy by moving and spreading as fast as they can but effectively colonizing each system would take a lot longer. This isn&#x27;t a game of Civilization where you just pump out settlers, real colonists need a reason to leave everything behind and stellar scale civilizations probably take thousands of years to mature and fully exploit their star system.
