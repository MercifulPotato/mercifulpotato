People essentially &#x27;volunteer&#x27; to move where we need them to. But they actually would move for a few years. Maybe even stay there, permanently. As long as they live there, they can vote there.<p>Emphasis at first would be red states close to turning blue, or with large electoral college votes. Then maybe states needed for local change, could ask people to move to &#x27;support&#x27; the changes needed.
