Item(by='windexh8er', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610396887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734698, text='I&#x27;ve been a Keybase user for a couple years now.  I started using Signal when it was TextSecure.  From Signal Insights 98% of my conversations are encrypted because I pushed Signal hard on friends, family and colleagues early on.  I talk to one person on Keybase that refuses to use Signal (not exactly sure their rationale anymore).  For some reason I thought Keybase was going to give me the early experience of Twitter, where I was able to interact with people in the same field without having to know them IRL.  And while Keybase does recommend I follow &#x2F; interact with some of those people it feels less attainable to start up a random conversation or jump into a public thread like I did early on with Twitter.  To be clear I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s Keybase&#x27;s fault.  As for getting non-technical family and friends using Keybase, well...  I find that it&#x27;s not as approachable.  I think it is more convenient in some cases (chat history is probably the #1 item), but it&#x27;s also clearly geared towards people who likely have an idea what PGP is (re: PGP key identity proof, etc).  I wish there was something that mashed up the best of Signal, Keybase and Twitter.  But at the end of the day I&#x27;d probably still use Signal for the majority of direct person to person messaging because of the time and personal effort I&#x27;ve put into getting my circle to use it.  The switching cost is too high a bar now to consider anything unless it&#x27;s exponentially better (and I don&#x27;t think that exists).  I also really don&#x27;t like the fact that Zoom owns Keybase and can&#x27;t see myself recommending it much moving forward over alternatives like Element.')
