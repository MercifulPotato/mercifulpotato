Art conservation isn&#x27;t about recovering the original information. It&#x27;s about making the work do the job it was intended to do.<p>If there&#x27;s a big hole in the middle of a painting, the painting is currently doing a bad job of being a painting, because the hole is distracting people from <i>looking at and experiencing</i> the <i>rest</i> of the painting.<p>If you, as a conservator, <i>fill in</i> the hole (in a reversible way) with, well, <i>anything</i>, it&#x27;ll likely stand out less than the hole itself did. And, therefore, the painting will now have been &quot;repaired&quot;, in the sense that it&#x27;s now doing a better job of <i>communicating the art</i> that the painter intended to communicate by painting it, than it did when there was a big hole in it.<p>Same thought process with colorization. A B&amp;W&#x27;s <i>medium</i> distracts the modern viewer, who is used to color photos, from the photo&#x27;s intended <i>message</i>. For modern B&amp;W photos, the B&amp;W look is <i>part of</i> the message; but for B&amp;W photos taken when B&amp;W photos were the <i>only</i> kind of photos (especially candid or portrait photos, rather than &quot;art&quot; photos), this choice of medium is mostly <i>unintentional</i>.<p>Colorizing the photo—even somewhat poorly, like with old Technicolor movies—will result in the viewer of the photo being <i>less distracted</i> by the photo&#x27;s medium than they would by a B&amp;W photo; and therefore paying more attention to the <i>content</i> of the photo itself. Which is, in most cases, what the photo&#x27;s taker would want.')
