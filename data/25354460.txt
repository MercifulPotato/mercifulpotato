Growing about 40% per year. Obviously there is risk here, so the investment targets needs to account for it. It&#x27;s a physical, price sensitive business, so profit margins won&#x27;t be like FAANG-like.<p>So, in order to be successful (to IPO investors), doordash needs another 25X growth in 5 years... ish. I&#x27;m probably missing something.<p>(sheesh, asset prices are super-high atm... moving on)<p>Strategically, there&#x27;s definitely something to delivery. It&#x27;s prone to natural oligopolies. Delivery is also, at this point, the critical infrastructure retail generally... not just food. Same day delivery is a game changer for ecommerce, so owning that network does actually have the kind of potential needed for this kind of growth.<p>That said... the big worry is getting stuck with a similar issue to uber. The market may not bear many doordashes, but it will bear a few. Local competitors can play. Doordash might have their margins squeezed. It&#x27;s certainly not a guaranteed success.')
