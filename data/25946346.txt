The thing ran on a tiny lithium-ion battery for weeks, which was nifty.  But the flash when the screen refreshes every minute is super distracting if it&#x27;s anywhere in your field of view.  That to me was a dealbreaker.  (If it helps, the datasheet says that it damages the display to refresh it every minute, and it did indeed die mysteriously after a year or so!)<p>I think I like normal LCDs for status displays.  It is possible to redraw the screen without inverting it and drawing a lot of attention, so it is more &quot;ambient&quot;.')
