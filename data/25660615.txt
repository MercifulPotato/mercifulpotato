For this idea to work, there would need to be some framework for picking exactly one row from a group. The simplest thing would be to raise an error if there were multiple candidates, but perhaps there are better ways. I think the operation of picking exactly zero or one things from a group is so common that it&#x27;s worth making provision for it.')
