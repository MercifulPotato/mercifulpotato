The real thing that is stopping adoption...<p>The capital gains tax issue isn&#x27;t stopping your average person from wanting to use Bitcoin. If we&#x27;re being honest, how many people would be voluntarily reporting taxes on their Bitcoin purchases anyway? I suspect it would be similar to how many people self-reported the sales tax they owed on out of state online purchases before it was automated: Near zero.<p>The bottom line is that rational consumers <i>like</i> the features and services offered by traditional banks and credit cards.<p>If someone steals your credit card and spends a ton of money, you just call up the credit card company and get your money back.<p>If someone gets access to your Bitcoin wallet and takes all of your Bitcoin, that&#x27;s it. Game over. Should have had better OPSEC, grandma.<p>Likewise, people don&#x27;t want to manage wallet passphrases and key files themselves. They want an exchange to handle the details for them, including as much risk as they can move to the exchange.<p>The reality is that Bitcoin is still far and away an inferior experience to traditional payment methods. If I pay with Bitcoin, I have to deal with transaction fees and variable network delays and I have zero recourse if the vendor simply steals my money. With a credit card, the bank literally pays me 1-3% to use their credit card, payment is instant, and I can simply call the bank up and reverse charges if something goes wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t understand all of these mental gymnastics to explain away Bitcoin&#x27;s shortcomings for payments.')
