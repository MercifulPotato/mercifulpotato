Is that what we&#x27;re calling it lol?<p>A week in which more Americans died from covid than any week prior. The day after the insurrection over 4k people died from covid, a disease that half the country thinks is a hoax. The lame duck president (who has done his very best to spread covid) whipped an armed mob into attacking the nation&#x27;s capitol building during the vote to confirm his opponent. Trump accomplished that final betrayal the old fashioned way, with a stage and a podium.<p>But yes, the industry sure is seeing some unprecedented stuff. Banning the president from Twitter is the biggest thing HN has ever seen because a large chunk of its users are trapped in the tiniest bubble in the country.')
