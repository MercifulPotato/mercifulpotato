I do really hope that RCP and a lot of the other independent media (even the highly left-slanted ones like TYT) manage to survive and thrive - but I think aggregated news is a thing that has value and I think that <i>maybe</i> highly opinionated commentary of news (like you&#x27;d see on twitter&#x2F;facebook) also has value since it allows for more room for advocacy of ideas.')
