I know that some people swear by it but it&#x27;s hard for me not to think that it&#x27;s the programming equivalent of listening to music on vinyls.<p>For one thing it&#x27;s extremely mouse-driven, which is already disqualifying in my book but to each their own.<p>The whole &quot;anything can be a tag and you can execute it by clicking the middle mouse button&quot; can seem novel and exciting if you&#x27;ve never used Emacs, which did the whole &quot;everything is configurable and scriptable&quot; a long time ago and IMO better.<p>Then the lack of syntax highlighting is pure elitism in my book. I tried to give that a chance but when you listen to the arguments of its proponents it often boils down to &quot;colors are childish&quot; and &quot;books are black on white and we read those just fine&quot; which makes complete sense unless you think about it for two seconds.<p>I genuinely don&#x27;t get it. When I first read a Vi(m) tutorial it seemed esoteric, complicated and weird, but I understood why some people found it more efficient that way. Watching somebody explain acme reminds me of TempleOS, filled with weird idiosyncrasies of dubious usefulness while lacking super basic features.')
