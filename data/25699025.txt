Item(by='ytpete', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610185947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695564, text='There&#x27;s a distinction between &quot;violent protest&quot; and &quot;protest at which at least one (potentially minor) incident of violence and&#x2F;or vandalism occurred&quot; - the latter seems to be what those statistics are counting.<p>If 10,000 people march through a city and <i>one</i> of the 10,000 sprays graffiti on a single store or breaks one window, most would not call that on the whole a &quot;violent protest.&quot; How many were in that category and how many had truly widespread violence or more severe destruction? I&#x27;d love to see a source capturing that. Anecdotally though, in online discussion I often see people treating it as a given that BLM protests laid waste to whole neighborhoods in multiple cities, which seems more like flat-out misinformation...')
