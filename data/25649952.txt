They have been used though to add meta-information to special tools. So unless you use those tools and require to add the specific meta-information, you can treat comments as plain comments.<p>Hiding certain meta-information, like exporting a function with a C-compatible signature when building a shared library is not a great way of doing things, but on the other side, it is a special usage which isn&#x27;t part of the language itself, so not part of its syntax.')
