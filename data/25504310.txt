It takes &lt;2 minutes of research to figure out that it&#x27;s a network of financial institutions approved by Ripple controlling their network, as well as their supply schedule details&#x2F;distribution. Anyone who buys XRP should be expected to figure this out for themselves. The government shouldn&#x27;t waste tax dollars and resources babying irresponsible people who don&#x27;t take the time to figure it out before buying.<p>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m defending Ripple. I think anyone who buys XRP is making a very unwise decision, precisely because the government does ridiculous things like this all the time.<p>I wish the government wouldn&#x27;t do things like this and Bitcoin had no use case. But alas, governments will continue to suck.')
