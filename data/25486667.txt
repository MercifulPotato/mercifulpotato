Item(by='_huayra_', descendants=None, kids=[25487630, 25487420], score=None, time=1608476726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486299, text='&gt; We need to change attitudes towards sex work to remove the shame rather than stop entry into a massively popular and universal industry that crosses all cultures.<p>Legalizing, but heavily regulating vices is definitely the way to go. I think a lot of European countries have good models for this (Switzerland and Amsterdam come to mind). The demand for these things is going to exist, and is usually best if it is legalized and put into red light districts &#x2F; out of public, etc.<p>That said, social tolerance should not devolve into some sort of forced social acceptance for the &quot;liberation&quot; of sex work. Just as any woman should be free to engage in sex work, I should be free to judge her for it (just as my girlfriend would be justified in asking about whether I ever purchased sex work). Just as anyone should be able to eat what they want, health consequences be damned, I should be able to call them &quot;fat&quot; instead of whatever PC word people use these days like &quot;rotund&quot; or &quot;plus-sized&quot;, etc. Both of those are choices, and adults have to accept the consequences of those choices (unlike inherent things like sexual orientation or skin color). I cannot go and get a bunch of face tattoos and then whine about lack of acceptance when I get turned down for client-facing tech jobs.<p>You can&#x27;t have your cake (engage in sex work, on either side of the transaction) and eat it too (complain about how society does not accept your decision with open arms). It&#x27;s ironic that folks who are all about &quot;freedom&quot; are more than willing to call the Thought Police because society doesn&#x27;t agree with them.<p>There&#x27;s also a difference between certain things that had been considered taboo &#x2F; forbidden but are now accepted vs. sex work and drugs: the ends do not justify the means. Allowing gay marriage provides an ends (i.e. more people, LGBTQ folks, who can live on equal legal footing as hetero folks) that more than justify the means (accepting that societally and legally). Legalizing drugs that allow folks to alter their conscience more than justifies the legalizing and shift in attitude.<p>What are the ends &#x2F; results for sex work? While certain sex workers may make an inordinate amount of cash (which is certainly their right to do in a free market exchange), sex work does not provide a net benefit to society. It ruins relationships (e.g. infidelity with porn or physical sex acts, harming unwitting partners and children of the transgressors) and prevents them from even starting (e.g. stunted personal development due to excessive porn use, as I have seen in a lot of my male colleagues who were the first generation to grow up with high speed internet porn and are now in their early 30s and have no idea how to connect with a partner as a human being and not just a sex object; or in women who sell their bodies one way or another and then end up in no relationship or in an abusive or otherwise substandard relationship because they neglected to build career and interpersonal skills that could benefit them and their pursuit towards self-actualization).<p>Although these harms cannot and should not be regulated against by the government, it would be reckless to encourage ignorance of the societal harms.')
