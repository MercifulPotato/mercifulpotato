Maybe you&#x27;re not familiar with the world of journaling&#x2F;notebooks, but people use them (and have been using them) for the same purpose. Before technology, people still wrote information down about the people they cared about.<p>&gt; Saving your friend&#x27;s child&#x27;s birthday in a database just so you can say that you remembered vs actually remembering their birthday<p>I mean if you&#x27;re taking the time to write it down I think that demonstrates a level of genuineness. It&#x27;s not always possible to e.g. have the foresight 3 months in advance to say &quot;ah I can&#x27;t do that because my friend&#x27;s child&#x27;s birthday is then&quot;.<p>&gt;I would rather have 1 genuine relationship, rather than 100 superficial, inauthentic relationships.<p>I think authenticity has a lot more to do with experiences you have with a person, which is augmented by making sure you&#x27;re available to spend time with them on important dates, having awareness of their likes and dislikes, and just taking note of general information. I find that, personally, when I take the time to write these things down, I actually keep them in my memory.')
