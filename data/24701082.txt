Other countries achieve lower drug prices because their governments regulate those prices.<p>2. The US (especially a particular political party) is anti-government regulation, especially when it comes to price controls, so drug prices are MUCH higher in the US.<p>3. Thus, the US president has issued an executive order to allow reimportation of drugs so that the US can take advantage of other countries&#x27; lower drug prices.<p>In other words, we won&#x27;t pass our own regulations, so we are <i>explicitly</i> delegating our regulatory authority to other nations so that we can take advantage of the effects of their regulations.<p>Honestly, whether or not you are pro or anti regulation, this current state is just f&#x27;ing insane. You certainly can&#x27;t consistently state that you are anti-regulation and be for this policy.')
