It&#x27;s a good point in general (just think about Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, webpack and the like), but I don&#x27;t see TypeScript as the &quot;new and shiny&quot; anymore.<p>Although there are alternatives (Flow, for example), to me it seems like the community has picked TS as the way forward, so in my opinion TS is a very low risk technology with real benefits, so I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate adding it to a project&#x27;s tech stack.<p>It&#x27;s here to stay and a big chunk of JavaScript developers enjoy using TypeScript.')
