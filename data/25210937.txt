Laser fusion relies on creation of a spherically symmetric shock wave, which in turn momentarily creates huge pressure and temperature in the center of a pellet, thus igniting the fusion reaction. Any asymmetry (caused either by miscalibration, setup design, pellet flaw or even simple thermal noise) gets amplified by plasma instability effects and results in huge energy losses. The wiki article [0] briefly covers some of such effects.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inertial_confinement_fusion#Issues_with_successful_achievement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inertial_confinement_fusion#Is...</a>')
