In fact, I treat &quot;I am not after job security&quot; as one of the important points when presenting to potential employers.<p>I try to do good job and think for the outcomes for the employer first.<p>I value trust and I try to make it clear to my boss that they can trust me to always work with best interest for the project and company.<p>For example, I always make it clear when I make mistakes and then we try to figure out how to solve them.<p>I think, overall, this brings much better job security than trying to sneak technology to create a project that only I would be able to maintain.')
