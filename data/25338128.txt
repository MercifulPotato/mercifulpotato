Building bases on the moon, mars, or the asteroid belt doesn&#x27;t require terraforming, anymore than living on an Antarctic base through winter requires the ability to farm for food, and wear a bikini.<p>We spent $700 billion a year on the defense budget, and $7 trillion on wars, $1 billion on inspiring stunts like moon landings or mars landings once a generation, are not really a waste, the money is mostly spent on earth, dual use technology comes out of it, and it opens the possibility of  space tourism, not to mention just cheaper launch capabilities (driven by the need to send a million tons to Mars) also benefit building a better space-based asteroid&#x2F;comet defense system too.')
