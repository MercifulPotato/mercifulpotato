I swim with it, I find it really great. I can even operate the watch in the water since it&#x27;s not a touchscreen. And it would be worth the price just for having an ultra-compact GPS navigation unit for hiking. (It can run turn-by-turn navigation for 2-3 days, in the default low-power mode it can last 3 weeks with heart rate + step tracking + other basic metrics.)')
