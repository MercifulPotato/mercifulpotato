Item(by='userbinator', descendants=None, kids=[25772862], score=None, time=1610600242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771264, text='<i>is a safety issue since functions like the backup camera and defogging and defrosting setting controls stop working as well as audible chimes, which are used when the turn signal indicator is activated and to alert drivers while the vehicleâ€™s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system is engaged</i><p>Interesting choice of functionality to call out; IMHO backup camera is much lower in importance (Teslas still have rear windows and physical side-mirrors) but HVAC and other controls normally used when traveling forwards would definitely be high. How about things like the speedometer?')
