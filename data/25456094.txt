Item(by='a3n', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608217015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25455085, text='&quot;Facebook Criticising Appleâ€™s iOS 14 Privacy Changes is a Hypocrisy&quot;<p>Hyper-huge internet and other information gathering companies (which includes Apple, Samsung, Sony and refrigerator  manufacturers) are hypocritical by nature and by choice.<p>Their primary activity is to collect personal data, for purposes ranging from ad revenue, to social and political manipulation, to legal and illegal cooperation with law enforcement and repressive governments, and everything in between and beyond. They profit from the non-ad activity by money, of course, but also from permission to operate and exist in various and any repressive regions and countries.<p>They sell themselves to us as organizing the world&#x27;s data, or connecting people, or giving us the ability to sell our crappy crafts or our influence. But they&#x27;re really selling our lives to any and all comers.<p>Hypocrisy? Please. It&#x27;s a business plan, and a profit center.<p>Composed and transmitted from my Android smart spy, via my Verizon internet connection.')
