I have Comcast Business and it has been great. I used to have Fusion from Sonic in an apartment in Santa Clara, CA at 9Mb&#x2F;s. This was acceptable and the service never felt constrained. Unfortunately, I moved to a house in the same city and the bandwidth Sonic quoted was 3Mb&#x2F;s. They pitched bonded to bring it up to 6Mb&#x2F;s. At that point I looked into Comcast Business which starts at 35Mb&#x2F;s and the L1 support aren&#x27;t idiots.<p>Sonic has its own problems. I have been a customer of theirs off and on for over twenty years, and their support has gotten worse while their sales tactics started mimicking AT&amp;T and Comcast. Being a scrappy underdog doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore.<p>It took three attempts to get a DSL connection at my last apartment because AT&amp;T failed to do work on their end. Granted, Sonic is dependent on AT&amp;T and they are treated as a customer in this regard, but it is a major weakness. A customer should NOT be informing Sonic that a scheduled activation wasn&#x27;t completed; Sonic should be the party reaching out to a customer.<p>I have had modem reboots and complete failures with Sonic equipment. Documented these incidents in excruciating detail and Sonic support responds with boiler plate, telling me to do things I have already done. I would love to buy my own equipment, but unlike cable modems, nobody makes DSL modems for the general market anymore.<p>I never signed up for promotional email, but Sonic started sending me a sales pitch every week for DirectTV. I normally deleted these, but it got to a point that I was getting three a week. When did Sonic decide that automatic opt-in was an acceptable business practice?')
