In the particular type of copyright being argued in this particular case Oracle has stated that changing the name or spelling of the methods would have been enough to avoid being in violation:<p><i>Using the district court&#x27;s &quot;java.lang.Math.max&quot; example, Oracle explains that the developers could have called it any number of things, including &quot;Math.maximum&quot; or &quot;Arith.larger.&quot; This was not a situation where Oracle was selecting among preordained names and phrases to create its packages. As the district court recognized, moreover, &quot;the Android method and class names could have been different from the names of their counterparts in Java and still have worked.&quot;</i>')
