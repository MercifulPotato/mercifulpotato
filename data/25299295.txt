However, in the general case, since these comparisons treat earlier bytes as more significant, fast implementation either needs dedicated instructions or wide big-endian unsigned integer comparisons.<p>A related use case is that if you have structures full of unsigned big-endian integer types, memcmp() will give you the same ordering as numeric comparison of the integers.  It&#x27;s a pretty corner case, but it might be useful for b-tree key comparisons where you have compound keys, say in a database table with a compound primary key.')
