I was recently looking at the Apple Watch and rowing machines. Ignoring that a wrist-based heart monitor isn&#x27;t great for things like boxing or rowing, you can&#x27;t really get the heart rate monitor to connect to gym equipment. Instead of ANT+ or Bluetooth LE Apple did release GymKit in 2017--but very few things support it. The &quot;rowing&quot; exercise doesn&#x27;t measure things rowers find useful (it&#x27;s basically a generic cardio workout). When using a separate heart rate monitor and syncing your workout with Apple Health you can get double measurements heart rate (the AW constant heart rate and the strap during the workout).<p>The fitness industry has a pretty well-developed ecosystem (I grabbed a random 5 year old heart rate chest strap and it paired immediately to the rowing machine). Garmin has seemed to have embraced that for at least a decade. It can definitely use improvement, but Apple has its own thing and it&#x27;ll give you grief if they didn&#x27;t have your use-case in mind.<p>To be fair, others like Fitbit has similar issues. With them you can&#x27;t even grab detailed heart-rate data.')
