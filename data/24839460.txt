This isn&#x27;t some antivirus bloatware that comes preinstalled, or a firewall imposed by corporate networks. The <i>entire pitch</i> of Little Snitch is that it enables <i>you</i>, the user, to monitor and control <i>any</i> bit of traffic that leaves your machine. No one was asking for Apple to bypass that.')
