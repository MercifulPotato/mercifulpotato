Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Fountains of Paradise&quot; (where I first heard about space elevators), but it looks like this isn&#x27;t aimed at technological ideas, more straight science.  Though &quot;telescopes&quot; is one of the categories.<p>Glad to see Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Tau Zero&quot; on the list - that made a big impression on me when I read it back in the 70s.<p>Fun that Ted Chiang&#x27;s &quot;Exhalation&quot; shows up in 3 different categories.  Stunning story.  I would have included his &quot;Tower of Babylon&quot; story as well - in cosmology &lt;g&gt;.')
