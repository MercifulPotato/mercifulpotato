There is no need to call anybody out on their genetics. Its almost like people forget that absolutely nobody chooses to be born as a specified skin color or culture. Not every single &quot;white&quot; American is racist. That is more than absurd. Racism exists in other countries as well, we are so quick to forget Rwanda and other genocides.')
