With USDT, your aim is to buy crypto low and sell them high and become bigly rich, THEN you cash out (which is the end game). It&#x27;s just greed.<p>Notice that the general confidence in the crypto ecosystem (HODL culture), and in Tether itself (it&#x27;s just a FUD, it&#x27;s been so many years and nothing have happened) contribute to the desirability of USDT. Also notice that when I say cash out, I&#x27;m not talking about redeeming USDT, but buying crypto then selling the crypto on an exchange or OTC that has an off-ramp.')
