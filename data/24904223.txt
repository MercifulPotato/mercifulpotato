The solution presented is not a BeyondCorp but rather an SSO implementation that adds authentication to the internal application.<p>For BeyondCorp, it essentially:<p>* Must be Layer 7 protocol, access privilege aware (achieved by an identity-aware access proxy).<p>* Promotes authorization as opposed to authentication only.<p>* Should be able to enforce security policies (time, location, context, 2fa).<p>* Must be aware of the security state of the user device.<p>Shameless plug: Check out our zero trust service access project TRASA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seknox&#x2F;trasa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seknox&#x2F;trasa</a>).
