They conflate &quot;chemical&quot; with a compound beyond natural complexity. Humans excel at creating compounds that naturally do not naturally occur in abundance for thermodynamic reasons. Chlorofluorocarbons come to mind immediately.<p>So how is it scaremongering? It is both accurate (PFOAs, etc are indeed chemicals) and of the proper connotation in the common parlance (using &quot;chemical&quot; to mean something manmade rather than naturally occurring).<p>Your argument holds no water.<p>By the way, an article in Scientific American isn&#x27;t scientific literature. It&#x27;s a magazine intended at lay audiences. You might be confusing it with something like Nature journal.')
