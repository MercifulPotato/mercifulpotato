I use elpy for Python development in emacs.<p>My development style is highly iterative and I tend toward functional paradigms. I build up a Python program by evaluating lots of small pieces, slowly building those into the structure of my program. I don&#x27;t write code into a saved file without first evaluating it in a linked REPL session.<p>Python does not support the same style of connecting to a live process, like Lisp does. Nor does it have the same facilities of redefining components in a running system.<p>The surface level actions look similar between my Lisp development and my Python development.')
