Most people get their CC through their bank, and have to submit chargebacks through their banks. Half of the banks do straightforward and simple chargebacks, half want you to do a ritual dance like the swiss example and treat you like you want to rip off someone.<p>Also, consumer protection is nice on paper, but especially for smaller amounts of money or not-so-clear cases it doesn&#x27;t work well. You still have to get a lawyer and go to court. Also, since there are no class-action suits US-style, where companies seem to be somewhat afraid of getting sued, in Europe they rely on the statistics of most people being too lazy to sue, because everyone has to sue one-by-one for themselves only. Only rarely, for high-profile stuff, consumer protection offices get involved with class-style (but fairly toothless usually) suits.')
