The only thing that can help such people is real in-person and trusted interaction, like at church, with a community help group, or with a therapist.<p>At best social media can be used to identify candidates to be offered an off-ramp from the road they are on, but that needs to be done by people who do de-radicalization as a full time job or mission, not casual social media acquaintances.  Very few people are dedicated to that kind of work today.')
