Without defending what he said, you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s disgusting how that was reported on compared to what he actually said.<p>However, (according to Bradley Kuhn, who was a FSF board member at the time) his removal from the FSF was a long time coming even without that incident, though that wasn&#x27;t obvious from the outside.<p>Bradley Kuhn was able to write the sentence &quot;In fact, RMS&#x27; views and statements posted on stallman.org about sexual morality escalated for the worse over the last few years&quot; with each word linked to a separate post from RMS, spread from 2016 to 2019.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just my reading of them, but your comments give the sense that his defense of Minsky was the only wrong thing he said.  That&#x27;s its own half-truth on your part, there&#x27;s plenty more that he&#x27;s been saying for years.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebb.org&#x2F;bkuhn&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;fsf-rms.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebb.org&#x2F;bkuhn&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;fsf-rms.html</a>')
