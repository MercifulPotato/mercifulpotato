Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many ear training apps but there was little progress after hours of frustration.<p>A couple of months ago I found a very different method. The idea is is to internalize pitch by singing. For example, you play a triad on the piano and then sing the 3 notes individually. Or you train yourself to sing an interval. Say you&#x27;re working on fifths. You play a C in the piano and then sing G, then play D and sing A, etc. I saw results within the first hour.<p>If anyone is interested I can try to find the video where I got this from.<p>Another method I can recommend is transcribing music by ear. You&#x27;ll be amazed how quickly you will be able to find notes and then chords once you get more experience.')
