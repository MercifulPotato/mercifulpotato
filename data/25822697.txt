Why not just sell the expensive-to-make bulbs at an equal or higher margin than standard ones? Are they protecting the bulb-replacement specialist industry by giving them something to do? Where are the competitive free market forces?<p>I&#x27;ve been using LED lighting at home for a decade+ now. Some bulbs I bought back then still work. Many of the newer ones are failing fast, obviously struggling with heat in the fixtures they&#x27;re in, which has been bothering me. The bits I like best are adhesive LED strips driven by a stand alone power supply with PWM dimmer in the living room. They&#x27;re mounted in aluminum backed diffuser rails. I expect that stuff will last near as long as I do. They&#x27;re under-driven and run cool, and the power supply seems high quality.')
