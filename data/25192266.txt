In March I was flying MUC-&gt;SFO (the day before Trump &quot;closed the borders&quot;, lucky timing for me). Due to COVID the plane had been downgraded from an A380 (which I was excited to try out, since I&#x27;d never been on one) and instead was a smaller Airbus which was also new to me. First time I went to the bathroom I was totally caught off guard. No idea this was a thing, had never even heard of it.<p>So novel that I took pictures to show my friends when I got back in the ground :-)')
