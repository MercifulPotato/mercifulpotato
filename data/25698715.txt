Without any qualification, this is naturally understood to mean &quot;all funds&quot;, which is not the concrete policy proposal behind (what seems to be most uses of) the phrase.<p>I myself had this understanding of the phrase &quot;defund the police&quot; when I first heard it (which is not something that I would support) but I do support most of the concrete policy proposals behind the &quot;defund the police&quot; movement that involve reallocating funds from the police to social services and other programs. I would be hesitatant to use the phrase myself though, because this interpretation seems quite common among people not &quot;extremely online&quot;.')
