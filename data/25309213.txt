I haven&#x27;t worn any of mine for about ten years. Since retiring I haven&#x27;t worn most of my collared shirts or smart trousers. None of those things are remotely wearable in my new volunteering role which involves physical work outdoors in the cold and rain. Those things would be recycled tomorrow if COVID hadn&#x27;t made my local recycling facility inaccessible.')
