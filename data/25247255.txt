Thank you for spending your time writing it.<p>A number of things occur to me when I run into articles like this.<p>1. &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; is simply the study of illusion, which our society is replete with because..<p>2. Over-classification and a culture of secrecy by institutional actors who have an &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality who seem so surprised when..<p>3. People take offense to being talked to like children who &quot;can&#x27;t handle the truth&quot; and are automatically classified as &quot;one of the them or the enemy&quot; from which the truth is to be withheld<p>4.

Sure, they can get it wrong, and sometimes really wrong but really, what else would you expect?<p>5. Like it or not there is a bell curve, or distribution of intelligence in the population. People gravitate towards different levels of interpretation, and I often see arguments like &quot;you can&#x27;t argue with stupid&quot; without acknowledging the perfectly rational impulse as defined above and that whatever level of interpretation they&#x27;re using probably wasn&#x27;t meant for them.')
