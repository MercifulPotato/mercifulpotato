I see this a lot lately, and it&#x27;s just frankly boring noise, of the whiny kind.<p>And then goes with name-dropping and stating that people who can talk about popular culture can&#x27;t possibly know anything high-brow, which it even isn&#x27;t in this case (high-brow might be for instance Adorno&#x27;s book on Mahler to give an example I could barely follow). It&#x27;s utter ignorance assuming that everyone you&#x27;re prejudiced against for inane reasons can&#x27;t possibly be perchance better educated than you are, could you imagine, oh the horror. There are several varieties of utter ignorance at play here IMO.')
