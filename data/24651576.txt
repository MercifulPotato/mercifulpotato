Maybe that&#x27;s what the OP is worried about.<p>USB-C has really simplified a lot of things:\n- Which way do I plug in? Any way.\n- Can I charge my new Ultrabook laptop with the same cable as my phone? Most certainly.\n- Is the port easy to recognize? Yes, just give it a quick look\n- Forget the Micro USB from now on? Yes<p>I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re still at 70% along the transition, but compared to other solutions the C is way better and more convenient.')
