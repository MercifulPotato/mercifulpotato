Item(by='tenebrisalietum', descendants=None, kids=[25650450, 25649297], score=None, time=1609869540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648177, text='It <i>should</i> be simple in a sane society.<p>School should be for educating children and shouldn&#x27;t be a government-provided babysitter.  A working, functional society should make children a benefit if it wants to exist past a generation, and it should therefore enable and support families so children aren&#x27;t a personal financial devastation to people and things like education don&#x27;t have to be overloaded with other functions.  We need to fix these social problems.<p>The reality is otherwise, of course.  So, if businesses really depend on public schools babysitting children to have workers or exist, then it&#x27;s proper that they suck it up and work with the school schedule if they are really that subordinate to it.<p>&gt; Which means modifying public transportation schedules and business hours.<p>Only some major cities in the US have public transportation that&#x27;s really developed, reliable, and useful enough to have this problem--everyone else commutes to work (or is only taking public transportation because they don&#x27;t have a car).  The cities that have the resources to have the system in the first place also have the resources to reschedule rides--it happens anyway for special events, holidays, etc.')
