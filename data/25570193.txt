Hypothetically, there&#x27;s nothing actually stopping those elections from choosing someone outside the party, but when we&#x27;re talking in election over a population of 350 million people, even getting an individual&#x27;s name in front of the voters such that they think to write them in requires a level of organization on par with a national party. Popular votes also inform, but do not single-handedly control, who the parties sponsor.<p>But the story of the parties themselves is a story of slowly widening democratic representation. The DNC system was even more tilted towards party insiders before the McGovern election. It&#x27;s been pulling in popular vote over the decades, but it&#x27;s not a mobocracy. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the RNC, after Trump, modifies its rules to add some kind of backstop against a television celebrity having so easy a path to the Presidency over career politicians.')
