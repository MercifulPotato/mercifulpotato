I wouldn&#x27;t call that social distancing either.<p>That&#x27;s two strikes against outdoor dining: lack of masks and lack of social distancing.<p>I&#x27;d love to have asked that UCSF expert what she had to say about this.<p>Something else to consider is that restaurants aren&#x27;t only doing poorly because they&#x27;re being locked down, but even when they&#x27;re open many people are choosing (very sensibly, from my perspective) to avoid them.  That won&#x27;t be fixed by ending lockdowns.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m still waiting to hear someone tell me how many lives would be saved by allowing restaurants to open.  Is it going to be anywhere near 3,000 in a single day?  Somehow I very much doubt it.')
