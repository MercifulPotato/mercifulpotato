We just had an election with historic turnout and easy voting and Biden will have won by less than Obama did twice.<p>I won&#x27;t comment on whether the US is red or blue or purple.<p>However, it&#x27;s quite clear that the Trump administration specifically and the Republican party in general have been engaged in actively suppressing voters in general, and the democratic party&#x27;s electorate in specific.<p>We&#x27;re talking about an administration that, while fully aware that there was a disproportionate and significant amount of pro-Democratic party voters who depended on mail-in ballots to cast their vote, they did their best to:<p>* sabotage the USPS&#x27;s ability to process and ship mail up to the election,<p>* enforce rules refusing to account for all mail-in ballots,<p>* and prop up their own electorate to vote in person to avoid the risk of their votes being filtered out by their sabotage campaign.<p>We&#x27;re talking about a campaign designed to filter out votes to competing candidates, hoping to skew election results in your favor.<p>This is not how a party that values basic democratic values operates.')
