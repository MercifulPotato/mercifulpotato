Because they have no airtime limits, they can commission many more series than traditional networks used to; but they just don&#x27;t want to keep them around for long if they think they are not working, because unlimited airtime does not mean unlimited funds.<p>In practice, I think some of the series this piece laments would never have been produced by networks. Would you be happier reading only one half of a story, or not even knowing the story existed at all? I think the answer can differ between different people.')
