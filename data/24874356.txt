When you are focusing for video, you&#x27;re often &quot;pulling focus&quot; (i.e. adjusting the depth where you&#x27;re focusing) very slowly, and sometimes back and forth between two or more set distances [1]. No autofocus lens is going to know what the director or cinematographer had in mind for the shot. At best you can have AI which will follow a moving object, or look for eyes, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the general case at all.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Focus_puller" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Focus_puller</a>')
