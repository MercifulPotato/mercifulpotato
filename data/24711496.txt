The PS5 isn&#x27;t quite available yet either.  So this is a valid comparison for systems you could have in hand by end of this year, but couldn&#x27;t yet have in hand right now.<p>&gt; but I think storage performance is as important, since load times and stuttering take me out of the game in a way slightly worse graphics wouldn&#x27;t (purely my opinion). From what I can tell, equivalent I&#x2F;O for the price is still a ways off on the PC side.<p>I think you&#x27;re over-estimating the impact of storage speed on the gaming use case here.  You can easily fit a 1 TB 3 Gbps NVMe SSD into a $1k PC budget, and you aren&#x27;t going to notice the delta between that and the 5.5 claimed Gbps on the PS5 for gaming.  Neither of these SSDs is gonna be a bottleneck for any kind of stuttering in games.  An underpowered CPU&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;slow memory would be much more likely culprits once you&#x27;ve got the NVMe SSD part nailed down.<p>&gt; One also has to be careful to factor in time spent purchasing and building; I do not value my time at $0.<p>Well then you should only be buying pre-builts if you don&#x27;t derive enjoyment from assembling computers and thus need to pay yourself a wage to do so.  Personally I love the whole process of researching and assembling computers; it&#x27;s a hobby (an infrequently practiced one though, by the nature of it).')
