Learning a language unlocks a whole new culture for you - both online and if you travel to a country that speaks it. Depending on the language it can also help at home (Spanish in the US, for example). For traveling in particular, if you speak the native language fluently it really opens up a very different experience than going around as an English-speaking tourist, it&#x27;s very cool and fun.<p>That being said, focus on just one new language. Three at once is extremely hard to balance without committing a very serious amount of time and having a high level of natural language learning talent. The easiest languages to learn with English as your native language take around 500 hours to reach conversational proficiency [1] which is an hour or two a day, try to learn 3 languages at once and that&#x27;s nearly a full time job. If you dedicate yourself to spending an hour every day it&#x27;s realistic to reach conversational fluency in a year and a half or so, if you go more casually it might take 3-5 years or longer.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;foreign-language-training&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;foreign-language-training&#x2F;</a> (this is for full professional proficiency, you can probably converse smoothly with less than that)')
