I work in Ruby and as good as RubyMine&#x27;s refactoring is, it can never be 100% because Ruby&#x27;s a dynamic language.  There are a lot of RubyMine &quot;power users&quot; at my office and, other than less than perfect refactoring, I haven&#x27;t seen anything it can do that vim can&#x27;t do.  In fact, when it comes to navigating files, rails.vim seems superior.  The only thing I&#x27;m jealous of is the built-in terminal that has tabs within the main screen.')
