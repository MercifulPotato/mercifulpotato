Doesn&#x27;t take much time, and gives me a lot of peace-of-mind that my emergency stuff is actually going to work when I need it.<p>On that note, something that I also don&#x27;t see people doing, is making sure they know how to use their equipment for its intended task. I made it a point to try an extinguisher on a tiny fire in a safe setting, just to make sure I understood how it worked.<p>Ditto for always taking the stairs down whenever I leave a new hotel room. I get a little more exercise, and if there&#x27;s a fire, I&#x27;ve already &quot;escaped&quot; once.<p>Pro tip: do not attempt to apply this advice while flying. They don&#x27;t even let you keep the slide!')
