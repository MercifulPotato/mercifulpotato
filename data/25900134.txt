New Zealand has been in their summer but just reported their first case of community spread in months as their autumn gets underway -- being an easily isolated island I imagine they might have more success keeping things under control, but if Covid goes endemic I don&#x27;t expect lockdowns to halt it in its tracks there any better than they have in the US or Europe. I don&#x27;t buy China&#x27;s numbers given that they have laughably reported a single Covid-19 death for a country of 1.4B people in the last 8 months, and find including them on a list characterized by &quot;minimal invasion of peoples&#x27; freedom&quot; bizarre.')
