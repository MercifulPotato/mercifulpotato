It contains a lot of unnecessary explanations of basic facts, making it unnecessarily tiresome to read for an expert. Presentation matters, because it stands between you and the substance, and you have to be able to get to the substance as fast as possible to review the paper.<p>&gt; [...] (given the attention to PCG at this point, if there were serious criticisms of it it seems a failing on the part of the journal not to address these).<p>Well, the paper was rejected before it could come to that point...')
