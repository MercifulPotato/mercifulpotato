If you assume that Denmark has lower usage of Tinder than US, CA, or UK, and then you assume that not all Danish people are paying with Danish credit cards (many of them would be using Play Store subscriptions, which seems like it would bypass the issue you&#x27;re describing), the affected population is probably really small.<p>Then you also have to consider that most of Tinder&#x27;s paying users are heterosexual men, and they know that they can screw those men over without losing their business because Tinder is an irreplaceable marketplace to find women.<p>With all those assumptions, Tinder isn&#x27;t being as stupid as they sound, but rather coldly rational.')
