My programs tend to feed data up to a desktop computer, typically into the loving arms of a Python program.<p>I got into computers almost exactly 40 years ago, and the earliest exposure of most kids to programming was in BASIC. I read a book on the Z80 microprocessor, and felt that I could have at least taken a crack at assembly, but didn&#x27;t have access to a Z80 machine.')
