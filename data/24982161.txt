I love seeing languages benefit from existing ecosystems. For anyone interested, there’s a similar library in python called rpy2.<p>Rpy2 is finicky, but if you’re doing something more traditionally softwarey and want to benefit from R, I still find it easier to use a general language like python and call R than it is to use R alone and try to do things it’s not great at and doesn’t have an ecosystem for.<p>It’s great to see another venue like that.')
