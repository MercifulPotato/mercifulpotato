The excitement is it&#x27;s a way to hack around political failure.<p>- Renewable are great, but our current political economy just likes them because they don&#x27;t require coordination and are marginally cheap. But when trying to do a completely renewable economy, those benefits dissipate when we need electricity storage or arbitrage&#x2F;rationing on a huge scale, and that requires good good old coordination and politics again.<p>- Regular nuclear power plants are great but the anglo-sphere can&#x27;t do them for the same reasons they can&#x27;t do subways.<p>- Tiny nuclear power plants aren&#x27;t intrinsically better at all, but perhaps can both have reneweable&#x27;s ability to accommodate our shitty political economy, and maintain that ability all the way to 100% no fossil fuels for electricity.<p>There&#x27;s nothing great here, just a last ditch to throw technological band-aids on social issues.')
