Click reset password\n2. You enter your email and new password (already here!)\n3. A password reset request has been received for your Matrix account. If this was you, please click the link below to confirm resetting your password: [link] If this was not you, do not click the link above and instead contact your server administrator. Thank you.\n4. Text page with the sentence &quot;You have requested to reset your Matrix account password&quot; but a button saying &quot;Confirm changing my password&quot;\n5. Button clicked, password is set to the one entered in step 2.<p>This just absolutely is waiting for abuse. Every other site asks you to enter the new password <i>after</i> you have clicked the link. Here it&#x27;s before you have clicked and there is no option to see or confirm the password entered initially. There is no indication that that is what&#x27;s happening. In addition the word &#x27;reset&#x27; is confused with &#x27;change&#x27;.<p>Super easy for anyone - even the most techie user - to be fooled by this workflow. Someone else initiates the request and enters a new password, grandma gets the reset link and clicks it, password is changed and the other party can login and change also the email.')
