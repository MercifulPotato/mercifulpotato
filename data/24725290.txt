If you reject the idea of fighting racism by stomping it out where you find it and instead try to use counter-racism, suddenly you&#x27;re in the business of determining precisely, exactly the opposite direction of the existing racism. If you screw it up you just add to the problem. See: video-game speedrunners blasting through levels at enormous speed because devs thought that &quot;pushing in the opposite direction&quot; was conceptually easy, but it turned out not to be -- and that&#x27;s just 3 dimensions! Here we&#x27;re talking about people&#x27;s lives, with hundreds of dimensions. There&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s going to end well, it&#x27;s just tossing gasoline onto racial tensions. Sure, the gasoline might extinguish the fire. It&#x27;s not impossible. I&#x27;d place a lot of money on the opposite, though.')
