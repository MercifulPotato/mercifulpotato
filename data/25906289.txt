This is not accurate, unless you are perhaps discussing cars.  But for aircraft the torque supplied by the motor is not nearly so critical.<p>First of all propeller thrust is a function of airspeed, and it falls off significantly as you accelerate, irrespective of whether your powertrain is electric or hydrocarbon.  This is a direct consequence of physics that can&#x27;t really be avoided and it&#x27;s why we usually talk about propeller aircraft as being &quot;power producers&quot; rather than &quot;thrust producers&quot;.  Propeller horsepower is much easier to reason about, and more relevant to the performance of the aircraft, than torque.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any electric-powered turbojets&#x2F;turbofans beyond the prototype phase but they would theoretically have better static thrust properties by virtue of not being props rather than any particular property of electric motors.')
