I used the regular AirPods (with no issues) for a year before getting AirPods Pro, which I then used for a couple months before the increasingly bad audio issues made them completely unusable. I ended up buying a new pair of the regular AirPods and, again, no issues.<p>I read somewhere that it was an early-batch problem and that it&#x27;s been fixed in newer iterations of the Pro, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to spend money on them again just to find out. The AirPods Pro are the only Apple device I&#x27;ve ever been totally and completely disappointed with. The regular AirPods remain one of the most unambiguously-<i>good</i> Apple devices I&#x27;ve bought.')
