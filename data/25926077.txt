Also some random other allegations that didn&#x27;t stick.<p>- police investigation of defamation (because they reported the scientific misconduct and some other misleading statements used by the head in sales for a research-related product)<p>- the university now expects them to contact the head of the ex-research group to clarify questions of authorship<p>- the head meanwhile continues as before')
