A valid email address and a name is sufficient to contribute to the Linux kernel.<p>All changes to The Linux kernel are getting publicly reviewed, so the hard thing is passing this technical review if you want to introduce a backdoor.\nIf people know you, based on previous contributions, the review could be less hard, so it could make sense to build up a reputation before. In the Linux kernel not the company builds up the reputation, but the individual engineer who contributes. If this is a Huawei hardware it could be easier for an engineer with a Huawei mail address to get changes integrated, because people assume he known the driver and hardware well and people trust claims like, &quot;this can not happen because the closed source firmware takes care of this&quot;.<p>If the Chinese intelligence agency wants to integrate a backdoor into mainline Linux it would be easier to just build up some own fake identities and use them. It probably would be easier to just analyze the Linux kernel and use bugs introduced by other people.<p>The NSA also contributed to the Linux kernel, look for contributes from a nsa.gov mail address.')
