It worked until I installed a usb-c thunderbolt dock.  Signal didn&#x27;t seem to make it through.  This must be the same bug.<p>To work around it I have to use a second hdmi cable directly connected.  It defeats the purpose of having the single dock cable that I was hoping for when I bought it.  :-&#x2F;<p>Good news though.  Maybe when 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo :) comes out I can finally get rid of the second cable.')
