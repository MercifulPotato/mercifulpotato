It doesn’t matter whether it’s loaded on desktop or mobile.<p>My story, simply put, is frustration with Jupyter notebooks. I wanted something much easier to work with, i.e. load a small dataset, run a function and visualize results. An environment where I can manipulate code &amp; data and immediately see feedback.<p>I was motivated to create an environment that:<p>* runs a reactive Python, cells are not executed top-to-bottom, but topologically; therefore there’s no hidden state, i.e. whenever you change a variable, all cells that depend on that variable will be automatically recalculated<p>* runs entirely in the browser: a) there’s zero provisioning &amp; setup b) rich visualization libraries<p>* stores notebooks as plaintext files, as little metadata as possible, I do want my research to be versioned in the most native format<p>* empowers the experiments and exploration<p>* ultimately, has a (subjectively) friendly UI<p>It’s an early alpha version, but I am happy to answer any questions. Thank you!')
