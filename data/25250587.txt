As I mentioned, it&#x27;s a tool.<p>But the biggest reason I use Wordpress is I can&#x27;t handle the friction of treating my website like code. My author hat <i>hates</i> programming and needs a faster feedback loop than flipping back and forth between different windows to see what&#x27;s happening.<p>Being able to click Edit, fix a typo, and hit Publish, <i>without any other steps</i>, is what I need.<p>That&#x27;s before I get into all of the features Wordpress supports. I installed the JetPack plugin and now I have mailing lists, analytics, monitoring, and a bunch of other things with No Extra Work.<p>For any website, the complexity has to go somewhere. If you&#x27;re a programmer with simple needs, an SSG is easier than wrangling an angry kraken like Wordpress.')
