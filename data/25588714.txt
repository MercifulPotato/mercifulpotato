They feed you up with some basic 2 pills they give to whoever is sick of anything. As far as I could notice, those were some stimulants with the end goal to have you back on duty as soon as possible.<p>Even if you get sick, like legitimately sick and get treated, you end up with a mafia-style talk with your manager about &quot;your recent performance&quot;. If you keep yourself off the sick train for the next months, you will get a pat on the back and a good review, where the &#x27;recent performances&#x27; one from previously seemingly never happened. \nTruly disgusting practices.')
