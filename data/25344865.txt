This gives full transparency to stakeholders while making awesome protocols like Gitcoin more accountable. We snapshot data every 10 minutes. store on IPFS (backed by Filecoin) along with cryptographic proofs on Ethereum (via Matic). The UI allows you to view changes and independently inspect audits.<p>You can search for any grant and we should have audits that go back to a few days. All new grants are automatically added and we are hoping to make more improvements that will allow end-users to better understand changes to complex information such as the CLR prediction curve, etc. Meanwhile, do let us know what you think about it, suggestions or critiques, on your Discord:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;WkYeZK3hC8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;WkYeZK3hC8</a>')
