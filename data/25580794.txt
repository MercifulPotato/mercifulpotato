I think this is the only way to prevent willful blindness. Otherwise the profit motive of the whole will always override the morality of the individual.<p>We should also improve whistleblower protections so that instead of just relying on hearsay and vague accusations we can actually have solid proofs of wrongdoing. Unfortunately, especially in tyrannical dictatorships like China this is very unlikely, given that even a &#x27;democracy&#x27; like the US is  struggling with those.<p>That said; I don&#x27;t that China as a whole is a developing nation anymore. There are big chunks of the country that might still be &#x27;developing&#x27;, but as a whole China is very much an industrial superpower.')
