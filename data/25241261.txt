Just because racist-motivated murderers exist and are problematic, does not mean Floyd was murdered with racist motives.<p>You demand I defend the cop&#x27;s actions, just for my interpretation of the case does not align with your interpretation. You call me a racist and a liar. You can&#x27;t even direct quote me, so you put words in my mouth, and then call me disingenuous (I never said &quot;died from an OD&quot;). You are debating from very bad faith, and debating poorly at that. And I don&#x27;t think you even realize that, nor the damage it does to the debate, working together to a solution, division, and growth of the &quot;silent majority&quot;, who is starting to get fed up with this childish I-never-fell-off-a-skateboard Twitter-follower activism.')
