Let&#x27;s consider this for a second.<p>Having some kind of backup would probably be easier than breaking whatever encryption they&#x27;re using, and something like this would be a &quot;weakest link&quot; scenario, so anything you put would probably decrease in security.<p>Besides that, don&#x27;t really want something a technician can just bring to you, because anything like that can be stolen or sold, so you were probably gonna have to tow it anyways.<p>I have no clue if that&#x27;s anywhere close to the actual decisions, but it&#x27;s not super hard to come up with a thought process that leads to the conclusion that the possible inconvenience of being even more stuck than usual when your car is stolen in a place where you don&#x27;t have cell service is better than the security reduction of having a backup anti-anti-theft mechanism')
