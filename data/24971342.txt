You cannot force economic prosperity out of instability and disunity, so it is very strange to ask how creating more stable&#x2F;unified nations or autonomous regions is economically helpful.<p>This obviously does not apply to all sub-Saharan countries - there are many that already had or have managed to forge national identities of their own. I am speaking for those of us who are unevenly yoked and know it.')
