We need legislation for this. End of story.<p>(If a company goes bankrupt or decides to end a service entirely it&#x27;s a bit more complicated... but perhaps part of bankruptcy proceedings should be to give priority to pay a competing service a reasonable &quot;maintenance fee&quot; to provide continued digital access to the same titles wherever possible.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Credit_CARD_Act_of_2009" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Credit_CARD_Act_of_2009</a>')
