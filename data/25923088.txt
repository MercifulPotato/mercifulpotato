IMO, &quot;clean&quot; is a poor word to use when evaluating code quality, not because there is no clean code like the author says, but because clean is an undefined subjective judgement call. What do we _mean_ when we say clean? Easy to debug? Follow? Maintain? Extend? Predict? These are more objective qualities and can be quantified. I think using more precise language instead of &quot;clean code&quot; results in ... uh.. cleaner code? lol')
