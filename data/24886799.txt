But at least you don&#x27;t have to get a mortgage to afford a degree.<p>I think it&#x27;s precisely because of recent communist history (in 1989 99% of population was equally as poor) that the private universities couldn&#x27;t overtake the public ones. Not enough rich kids to make a whole university out of them - so instead the trick was to pass exams well enough to outcompete the other 49 candidates for a place at the best public universities.')
