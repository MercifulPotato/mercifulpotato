Item(by='Kosirich', descendants=None, kids=[24907933], score=None, time=1603781940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886440, text='I agree with nordic people in the comments about the overpromotion of nordics and nordic concepts especially related to well-being, lifestyle ect. People in the south of europe also have a concepts that describe the importance of &quot;going for some fresh air&quot;, &quot;importance of taking a walk to think&quot; ect.\nThat being said, there are differences that are noticable specifically in behavior during bad weather, where bad is defined as cold and rainy. In the south, you don&#x27;t go out during cold rainy weather, you just don&#x27;t. Why? I think it is because the weather, even during winter months, will be frequently good and is much nicer to be outside when the weather is good (as in dry). So obviously a behavior that encourages going outside even during bad weather will naturally arise in the North. Getting your kids wrapped (literally) in rainproof suit and taking them to an example amusement park or a town event even during light rain is completely normal.')
