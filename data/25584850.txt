Item(by='dllthomas', descendants=None, kids=[25590099], score=None, time=1609355292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584697, text='The two most commonly referenced uses are safe mutation and better resource management.<p>Safe mutation because when I have the only reference to a thing, the rest of the system shouldn&#x27;t care whether I change it in place or make a new one.<p>Better resource management because you can be sure opened files are closed exactly once and that nothing tries to use a file after close, even where a bracket pattern doesn&#x27;t fit  (or fits much more loosely).<p>In both cases, you&#x27;re not doing anything you couldn&#x27;t <i>do</i> before, but it lets you do it safely.  People speak of performance because (especially in Haskell) mutating without being confident nothing else can see is sufficiently full of footguns that the community happily (... and rightly, IMO) pays small performance penalties for security against them.  This lets us remove those performance penalties in more cases.<p>There&#x27;s some room for the <i>compiler</i> to notice that something is only referenced in one place and safely convert some things to mutation; again this doesn&#x27;t strictly need linear types, but linear types may let us do that reasoning locally instead of it requiring whole program analysis.')
