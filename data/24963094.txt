That seems to be a kind of magic number where, for gross margins below that, you probably don&#x27;t have a viable (small) business, in general.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve had discussions with people in one of my hobbies about this.  It&#x27;s a collecting hobby, so, being involved on the dealer side consists of obtaining inventory, marketing it to collectors, and selling for a profit.  I&#x27;ve been told that you should always have at least a 30% gross margin on inventory, unless it&#x27;s stuff you want to blow out because it&#x27;s been sitting too long.  In practice, what this means is you buy at somewhere between 60-75% of retail, normally (you can afford a smaller margin when you already have a client lined up to buy the exact thing you have, but that&#x27;s not the typical case for a lot of dealers).')
