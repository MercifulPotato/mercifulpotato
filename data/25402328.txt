So for any given time-like vector field, you&#x27;ll get an energy conservation law. In case of Friedmann cosmology and chosing cosmological time as said vector field, you&#x27;ll get a term proportional to HÂ² which picks up the change in energy.<p>However, you won&#x27;t be able to make this into a covariant expression: Gravitational energy-momentum can be expressed in terms of pseudo-tensors at best...')
