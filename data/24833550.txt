Needs to be pretty independent of everything else.<p>Some random web store or something like Kickstarter? The only reason I care about those accounts is to track orders or for the convenience of not having to re-enter credit card info. The risk of losing my Apple account because ??? and dealing with recreating those accounts is negligible.
