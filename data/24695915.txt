Item(by='diarrhea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601975000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24691783, text='&gt; If the schema is consistent between rows, and it turns out a test result is made up of several rows because the test is composed of several stages, I would leave it as is until reporting time.<p>In that scenario, indeed no action seems to be needed, because each row <i>is</i> one observation: every test stage is an observation. So it would seem to make sense.<p>One could then argue that each patient deserves their own table (observational unit).<p>But as other commenters pointed out, this is all speculation.')
