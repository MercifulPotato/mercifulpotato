The BBC did experiment with multicast in the past, but CDNs seem to be a more scalable solution ironically.<p>However in this specific case, the pictures actually left downing street via multicast (SDI form camera into encoder, MPEG-TS over multicast to the studio, back to SDI to get encoded on whichever output chain it is - Terrestial, Satelite, Cable, online)<p>Indeed the standard to replace SDI (2110) is built around multicast, broadcast certainly uses multicast a fair bit.')
