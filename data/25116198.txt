Any dishonesty would be noticed, because everyone has the same phone book.<p>Contrast with getting a phone number from $large-company, be it Yelp, Google or otherwise. The only thing stopping them from selling this privilege to an intermediary is their reputation, and clearly where Yelp is concerned, this isn&#x27;t enough.<p>One could argue that Google has been exploiting this since the creation of AdWords: they will happily sell the right to advertise on a search for your exact company name to a competitor, a nice income stream which verges on extortion.<p>It&#x27;s even possible to deliver personalized dishonest results; applications including search engines know who you are, and can lie to you and only you.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to be &#x27;mechanically dishonest&#x27;, but no question that contemporary technology makes it easier and more lucrative.')
