Why shouldn&#x27;t TripAdvisor be allowed to inform their customers? Why should the hotel not use the law of their country to sue an individual?<p>Give me a break, most hotels have some bad reviews which, when the hotel is actually good will be drowned in good reviews. TripAdvisor could say that they are alligators in the pools for all I care, they are a private entity...')
