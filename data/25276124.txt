If think JSP that compiles to a bunch of Servlets filled with print statements is bad, you really have to look at the rest of that stuff; because it gets a lot worse :-)<p>The stateful design, which fills up templates with a bunch of hidden html-input fields, in order to open web-pages in the same &quot;state&quot; as you left them and all sorts of other crap.<p>You also need to look into Portlets, which &quot;splits&quot; up a web-pages into seemingly stand-alone components. These are then combined into horribly complicated Servlets as you deploy, where http paramters are namespaced with some random _portletId=ls√∏jfksjo1920 things in order to figure out which parameters goes to which &quot;part of the web-page&quot;. Again, all of this is so bad, you&#x27;d think it was a joke; but it was Java&#x27;s offering for web-development, and a huge number of people CHOOSE that technology in the early 2000&#x27;s.')
