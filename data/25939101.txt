Many doctors thought it was some form of complicated asthama or something but couldn&#x27;t figure out what exactly was it.<p>Then my parents put me in an breathing camp (yoga retreat kind of thing). I was there for six months and we were convinced there that breathing is life. Breathing is the most important thing in and for life. And slowly, the condition disappeared.<p>The condition was more of an impediment in the brain blocking the breathing command when I got upset unlike some incurable damage to the lungs. Just teaching and reminding us to breath every second for six months made things a lot better.<p>If there&#x27;s no such camp&#x2F;retreat in your country, you could try India.')
