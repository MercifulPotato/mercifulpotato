They use JSON as a base transport layer that can be streamed into an HTML renderer. They explicitly target SSR&#x2F;SSG as use cases for this, and they’re actively working with Next.js for a reference implementation.<p>I suspect (though they didn’t say so outright) that their choice of a non-HTML layer is because they want to continue to provide core functionality as renderer-agnostic. They do mention React Native as another use case. Presumably the same could be said of renderers targeting e.g. CLI, or smart TV APIs.')
