There is no vulnerability (assuming the obvious assumptions about how foo and do_stuff work and are used) until the compiler introduces one.<p>0: For example, you count the fact that someone can DDOS the machine it&#x27;s running on as a vulnerability in any network software. Which is somewhat resonable in some contexts, but not the context of compiler bugs.')
