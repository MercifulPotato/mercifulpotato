I can’t get a warrant for your dining room then go upstairs into your bedroom to explore. Now, if a cop saw, say, drug paraphernalia in the kitchen while looking for something else, that’s fine, but they can’t go on random searches (also why they can’t search your car for no reason).<p>That idea extended to civil procedure and phones is that the discovery process for a civil case would be for things related to the lawsuit of which your personal phone might not be. They could certainly request it, but a good lawyer would argue that your personal phone has no connection to the work phone (of which the lawsuit is about) as evidenced by the fact that you <i>have</i> two phones (you <i>intend</i> to separate the two matters). Separate profiles on the same computer (phone) would be harder to argue.<p>It’s not a clear cut matter and would certainly depend on how the judge is feeling, but if there’s a <i>possibility</i> of keeping your personal and work life separate, why not do so? Don’t put all your eggs (data) in one basket (phone) and the like.')
