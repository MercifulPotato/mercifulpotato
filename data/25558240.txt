It doesn&#x27;t fully solve the problem though, it&#x27;s more useful for visits and online purchases.<p>You couldn&#x27;t get paid straight into it, so you need to get paid into your home account, then transfer in dollars, then convert them into local currency, so you&#x27;re still doing two forex transactions. Better than one for each purchase, but will not ideal. Also, it&#x27;s still not a real local bank account, so all the problems wrt government and bills still apply.')
