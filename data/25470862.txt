I was a TL (happily not one now). I&#x27;ve moved to a smaller company and I&#x27;m liking that. I have accumulated about half of my retirement fund (I&#x27;m not expecting to live much past 60 due to health issues, so I need retire early or die working). My goal for the next 10 years is to establish the &quot;retirement&quot; phase of my life. Accumulate enough money, lower my CoL and build infrastructure to keep me fed and entertained for the next 30 years. I have a backlog of &quot;things I really want to do to but nobody will pay me for&quot; that I hope to be free to work on until I die.')
