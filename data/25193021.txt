It&#x27;s running at a loss now to grow and be profitable later. That could be by driving out your competition, or it could be like facebook, where a gazillion dollars went in before the ad money came online. The story they tell themselves it the latter.<p>The ecosystem it creates, however, doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s the former or latter. It drives out competition because VC&#x27;s can make up the difference in a lack of profit.')
