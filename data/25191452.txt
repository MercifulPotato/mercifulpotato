That&#x27;s why I give a damn. It is currently effecting me. I had no need for that before corona virus, I do need one now.<p>Bucks county is issuing it in 15 minutes. Philly does a whole interview process which goes beyond a basic NICS check and they have chosen to be poorly staffed for a very long time.<p>Again, they set up a complicated process for applications, then shut it down, all of which is of their own (the cities) volition.<p>It&#x27;s not reasonable delays. There are people who don&#x27;t have their appointment until December, 2021. more than a year out.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s all really arguing something that should be moot - A persons right should not depend on the government service choosing to open its office.')
