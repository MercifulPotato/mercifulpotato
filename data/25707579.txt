Not to mention in the first case it&#x27;s truly lossless, and in the second case it&#x27;s... well, not bad.<p>For F1 image, if you compare 20KB JPEG vs 18KB AVIF, there&#x27;s no doubt AVIF is better. But if this picture is the content of page, not some useless decorations, I&#x27;d rather be served with 70KB JPEG in this example, it isn&#x27;t really a close competition. So I wonder if 40-50-60 KB AVIF would look as good or better than 70 KB JPEG. Then it would be impressive. Otherwise, it isn&#x27;t really a drop-in replacement and I wonder what the correct use-case strategy should be.')
