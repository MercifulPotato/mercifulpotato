A fact is an occurrence of something in space and time and can be verified through our 5 senses in an empirical manner, which is also the basis of modern science.<p>For example, it is a fact that I&#x27;m currently sitting on my chair, writing this comment. However, answering the question &quot;why am I writing this comment?&quot; is deeply subjective even for me to answer. And yet, many people would consider it a &quot;fact&quot; that I want to sound smart, for example.<p>The language that we use also affects our understanding and models our environment. The previous example can be a fact for all of us only because we have a shared view of &quot;what a chair is&quot; through culture and language.')
