AI is just a set of the many tools humans have created.  The biases can be both positive or negative.<p>It is like people who talk about human rights while ordering bombings of children far away. The ethics of AI is similarly flawed. It might solve some problems here but might inadvertently or deliberately accentuate others depending on your perspective. It is a sense a cost&#x2F;benefit solution where we may never even be aware of the costs but just the benefits (those who incur the costs may not have a voice or be muzzled).<p>I am all for AI by the way. I simply see it as a tool. It is up to societies to formulate acceptable policies and measure the costs and benefits.<p>Humans were good and bad before AI and I see nothing changing there.')
