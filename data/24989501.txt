It&#x27;s the working class who is suffering. Look around you, homeless people everywhere. This is digital Rentier Capitalism, which enriches the ruling classes, and parasitally sucks dry the working class.<p><i>&quot;[R]entier incomes from ownership and exploitation of assets are continuing to grow, sucking up ever more of global income. And the state is accentuating these two mega-trends by throwing more subsidies to the rentiers while cutting benefits for the precariat, and while the silicon revolution is channelling more income to those who own the robots, creating a perfect storm of economic insecurity.<p>A way out of this approaching impasse would be to create a new income distribution system in which more of the rent is captured for society, and used to buttress the precariatâ€™s living standards. In 1936, John Maynard Keynes predicted the &quot;euthanasia of the rentier&quot; before the end of the 20th century. It did not happen. Now is the time to do it. One way would be by building up democratic sovereign wealth funds through a levy on various forms of rent, which are neither morally nor economically justifiable.&quot;</i><p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-precariat-populism-and-robots-is-basic-income-a-political-imperative&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-precariat-populis...</a>')
