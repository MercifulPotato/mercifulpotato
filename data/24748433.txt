Most good pandas code of course doesn&#x27;t look like this, but it&#x27;s regularly unavoidable, hence &quot;There are use cases where either representation is preferred&quot;. Without specifying our use case, it is meaningless to talk about &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot;.<p>For 3) there inherently is no optimal solution to &quot;a problem with large performance-correctness tradeoffs&quot;, additionally users do not care only about speed, for a <i>huge</i> number of applications, absolute reproduction of precision may be the difference between a good simulation and data science quackery. We saw elsewhere in the thread that Julia&#x27;s float parsing code at least presently handles certain syntaxes incorrectly. Ignoring performance, this is criteria for deciding whether a solution is fit for purpose at all.<p>The overall point otherwise makes sense: most DS folk don&#x27;t and maybe shouldn&#x27;t care about this stuff, however this is HN, and elsewhere in the comments there are plenty of examples of people who do.')
