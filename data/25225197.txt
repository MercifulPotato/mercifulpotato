I didn&#x27;t say anyone was. The only way I can see how this might fit as a reply to my comment would be the implication that it&#x27;s okay to throw accusations around, and accepting accusations as automatically true, just because the accusation is not of a crime. That&#x27;s exactly what we <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> do. That&#x27;s my point and I for one am not gonna start doing such anytime soon, and I also try to keep contact with people who do that at a minimum.<p>For that matter, I would love if you elaborated on how an accusation must <i>surely</i> mean that a wrongdoing actually happened instead of replying with uncharitable interpretations of my comments.')
