Before the pandemic, I had a development job in the neighboring city.<p>I&#x27;d take a 2 hour commute each way, and when I got home, I&#x27;d immediately collapse, sleep, wake up, and head right back to work. I didn&#x27;t check my phone, my voicemail, my email, or call anyone. Just sleep. I rarely ate.<p>I listened to a lot of death metal during that time.\nThe pandemic hit, and I lost my job, then my apartment. I moved into an apartment with my elderly mother with dementia.<p>I still do some contract work for the old company, but I struggle with the bare minimum required to keep my old boss happy. Working at home is a fucking nightmare.<p>The loss of my decent paying job hosed my bankruptcy eligibility, so now I get to keep drowning in debt I have no means to pay off, while I try to find a way to get things back to normal.<p>Yeah, like many others here, I usually wish I could just die already. Sadly there are people who would be devastated if I departed. So, here I sit.')
