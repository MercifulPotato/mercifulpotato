Based on a HN comment? That&#x27;s just uncalled for... Or is it trying to recruit random HN readers? In that case, how is this at all related to the topic?<p>Like in any group of humans, it takes a certain perspective and tone to communicate your ideas effectively - doubly so if you want to engage in &quot;new ways of thinking&quot; with others. The comment in question is lacking that (in my - subjective - eyes). I don&#x27;t think &quot;I wonder if&quot; is misplaced on HN, but I would concur that (as you hinted at) a certain way of articulation is rewarded.')
