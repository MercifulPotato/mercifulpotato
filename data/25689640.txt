I am also still confused as to why Trump himself has been the target of all these tech&#x2F;social media platforms. As far as I can tell he has not incited violence - imminent or otherwise. Yes he has made exaggerated&#x2F;false claims about the election, yes he has not condemned the criminal acts of the capitol rioters, but as far as I can tell he has not encouraged or incited violence. And each time I have asked this question of friends or on HN, I&#x27;ve not received a substantive answer.')
