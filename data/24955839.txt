Item(by='LockAndLol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604184592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952843, text='&gt; Where is the right place to draw the line between your state&#x27;s civic values, and respect for traditions that are not strictly yours? Are you bound to honor cultural traditions that are outside your laws and norms for civic rights and presence?<p>The line is drawn exactly where the law is. If a culture or tradition doesn&#x27;t adhere to it, then it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed. Either you live in a country and respect the law or you have to deal with the consequences - no exceptions. We should all be equal before the law and there shouldn&#x27;t be any exceptions for voluntary actions of a group.<p>Culture and traditions do not supersede law. They are impediments to all kinds of progress, scientific, educational, social or otherwise, and that shouldn&#x27;t be acceptable.')
