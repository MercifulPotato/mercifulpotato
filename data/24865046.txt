But we had no kids.  Once we had a kid suddenly there were many new issues such as  trying to carry the baby seat to&#x2F;from the metro.  Suddenly a car was more inviting and this wold be great for that application.<p>When the kid is older things can change; we later lived in a city with plentiful bike lanes and it was great...except in the snow.')
