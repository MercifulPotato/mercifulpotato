The real fiery debate comes on the discussion of said validity, which of course is where Red&#x2F;Blue&#x2F;Grey disagree. The groups and how they self segregate is interesting, but in the end a sideshow symptom.<p>Given that date context though, it seems like Scott probably deserves a chance to directly respond to that issue, which I don&#x27;t read enough of SSC to know if he has but would assume has been approached in some manner, even if not with a full piece.<p>That said, there were some useful nuggets and concepts in here even though I think the conclusion misses a broader issue of 2020. For the time it was written, I think it covered most common thought on the matter and synthesized well.')
