Everybody can write javascript clients to send GETs and POSTs to any company&#x27;s back-end server!<p>Making it a single button that enables a different theme that a professional designer somewhere has signed off on is a much better user experience for almost everybody when compared to the &quot;write your own CSS&quot; option. Even if you automate it with a browser extension, you&#x27;re still giving that extension read+write access to the site, hopefully it&#x27;s trustworthy!')
