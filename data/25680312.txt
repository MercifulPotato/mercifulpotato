That doesn&#x27;t exist. No Police Department in the US will just let you walk away after they just kicked you out of a building that was violently stormed if you just refuse to identify yourself.<p>In this case it&#x27;s even more bizarre and out of the ordinary. The police executed a kettling maneuver but <i>didn&#x27;t even try to identify the individuals</i>. They don&#x27;t train police officers with the ACLU &quot;how to act if you are being detained manual&quot; dude, it&#x27;s the other way around, they train them to try to dissuade you from committing property crimes by actively trying to make you not exercise your rights and identify yourself.<p>Being in the Capitol while it&#x27;s on lockdown is enough evidence to get arrested if you can&#x27;t produce a bagde or something. Letting this people walk out is completely unjustified from the usual DC Metro procedures.')
