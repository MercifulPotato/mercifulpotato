But IMO it&#x27;s not possible to generalise completely, both because people&#x27;s psychology varies so much and also because what people mean by &quot;depression&quot; varies so much (and yes, in &quot;people&quot; there I include psychologists and psychiatrists, whose approaches to diagnosis vary enormously in my experience).')
