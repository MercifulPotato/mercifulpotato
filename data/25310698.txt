What they can&#x27;t do is however to ignore opponent research that conflict with their propositions. This is precisely what Jeff Dean is talking about in his second letter, you need <i>opponent processing</i> to overcome self-deception and bullshitting.<p>You can&#x27;t have opponent processing when you omit relevant research, try to steamroll the review process, throw a tantrum when your paper is found lacking, and ask names to further your agenda through social engineering.<p>It is not onto me to prove if and why I disagree with the conclusions, it is onto the paper to prove that their assumptions and methods were sound to begin with, if they want their conclusions to be taken seriously. And they were not.<p>&gt; but this renders any future research from them irrevocably tainted -- from now on, it&#x27;s no more than Google PR.<p>On the contrary, this move increases trust in Google research and it would have lessened if they were to buckle under activist strong-arming.<p>If folks think this was a sign of broken research machinery, they are free to ignore all future Google research, at their own risk for competitive disadvantage.')
