I have a large format photo quality inkjet but one cartridge is empty and the other two are dried out. Would cost me over $100 to refill it and I just don&#x27;t use it enough to keep the cartridges fresh. Not worth buying new cartridges for it. My B&amp;W laser is fine for most things, the few photos I want printed are easily done online on choice of media and size, and if I decided I <i>really</i> have to print in color at home, I&#x27;d replace my B&amp;W laser with a color laser printer.')
