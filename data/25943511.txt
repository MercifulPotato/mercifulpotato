Equities going down is not a problem for reasonable investors. You just buy more for cheaper prices according to your schedule and wait. You still own the % of your companies. It&#x27;s not worth less just because you can&#x27;t temporarily sell it. It would be like saying that price of your house is fluctuating from 0 to 500k depending if there is a potential buyer today or not.<p>Stock market crash is only a big problem for leveraged over commited entities, very small inconvenience for people beyond accumulation phase (as they may need to sell very small % of assets in coming months) and huge opportunity for everyone else.<p>Stocks crashing is fantastic for a little guy.
