Something like CRC32, siphash, etc. are much faster than a hashing function meant to be cryptographically secure. They just don&#x27;t have the same constraints. This xxHash claims it &quot;successfully completes the SMHasher test suite&quot; which is good in the same way that a PRNG passing randomness tests is good but not necessarily cryptographically secure.<p>The table on the page you linked also says in the notes whether an algorithm was meant for cryptographic purposes, and indeed all of those are at the bottom by quite a margin.')
