It&#x27;s fast enough for 99.99% of the apps with minimal tuning.<p>* Yes, if your project is very big and macro heavy, it can take some time, but startup times have improved. In any case, I BARELY need to restart my development JVM. I have one currently running that I haven&#x27;t restarted for 1 week+.<p>* Depending on what&#x27;s your cup of tea, there&#x27;s emacs&#x2F;CIDER or IntelliJ&#x2F;Cursive. They both work well. IntelliJ&#x2F;Cursive is an excellent IDE combination. I use it every day.<p>* Java interop is very straightforward, not sure what you mean. Sure your code might not be all pure anymore, but that&#x27;s the price for solving actual problems.<p>* Good java libraries have wrappers. A ton of original Clojure libraries as well. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cgrand&#x2F;xforms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cgrand&#x2F;xforms</a> for example allows you to easily do things that I can&#x27;t even imagine doing in an imperative language.<p>* Static vs dynamic typing: don&#x27;t want to get into that.<p>* &quot;Clojurescript isn&#x27;t the same language&quot;. I use both Clojure and ClojureScript every day and as far as Clojure-only code is concerned, it works in both languages 99.99% of the time. One case you can encounter issues is if you do something host-specific, like dealing with numbers. That&#x27;s by design. Clojure embraces each host, does not try to reinvent it. When you just use pure Clojure data structure manipulation, it works the same across both languages and works like magic.')
