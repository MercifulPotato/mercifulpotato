The most interesting part here to me is the osquery improvement you contributed since that exposes a situation which became more nuanced than it used to be.<p>I&#x27;m entirely supportive of anything which spread the word that you really want to make sure you confirm that FileVault is enabled. My objection was to the title wording which made it sound like some promised functionality wasn&#x27;t working was a distraction.')
