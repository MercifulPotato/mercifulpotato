Making profit is not necessarily healthy, <i>generating value and capturing a fraction of that value as profit</i> is though.<p>Our system is complex enough at this point where you definitely can and do have entities that are capturing more value than they are delivering, and that is immoral (imo). In that light, profit definitely <i>can</i> be evil.<p>However it is certainly not always evil, and I don&#x27;t think AWS&#x27; actions qualify in this case. They are delivering value to their customers, and they are capturing a fraction thereof.')
