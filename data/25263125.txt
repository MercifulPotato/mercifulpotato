Signal has always prioritized fighting mass surveillance.<p>Getting individual devices hacked to recover its content is already outside of what I’d consider “mass surveillance”.<p>That is, even if you don’t use disappearing messages, you’re much less likely to have your conversations slurped up into some PRISM aggregator type machine by using an e2e communication channel like Signal, in part due to its forward secrecy capabilities.<p>That said - no harm in fighting targeted surveillance as well. Wether it be from a 3 letter agency, a phone thief, or an overzealous personal relationship.')
