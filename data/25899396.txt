I&#x27;m not going to shed any tears for this guy when people have gotten similar sentences for small amounts of certain drugs.<p>A 12 year sentence is nothing in America, but hopefully his treatment in prison is humane and he has all the access possible to resources for education, health, and eventual contribution to society. It won&#x27;t be though, of course, since the US prison system has fostered a brutal environment that causes recidivism, mostly arising out of American hatred of the poor and of dark-skinned people.')
