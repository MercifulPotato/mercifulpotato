The rest (fire; theft, fixing my car if it was my own fault, hail, etc) made up the balance.<p>My car is worth $4k tops, so I cancelled the rest. The odds of a total loss are low, so a $500 or $1k deductible combined with the likely scenario of a $2k-$3k repair bill made it very meh to bother paying another $400&#x2F;yr for.')
