Item(by='aidenn0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610423448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739325, text='&gt; This information will piss off one side a whole lot, and the other side not at all. Is this information non-neutral?<p>Of course reporting just this information is non-neutral.  You are specifically picking facts that back the policies of one side over the other.  That&#x27;s obviously non-neutral.  If you are a weather-service, it might be apolitical, but as a general news organization it&#x27;s hard not to read that as political.<p>&gt; Could I make my editing neutral by also including the occasional statement that Trump won the election in a landslide?<p>I mean if your firehose of all facts includes &quot;Trump won the election in a landslide&quot; then sure, but I don&#x27;t think you honestly believe that to be true.  I suppose you could report on members of the house claiming this to be true?  It might make more sense to e.g. report on perverse incentives setup by entitlement programs (to go with the climate-change theme, how about how tax-breaks for clean-fuel vehicles disproportionately benefit the rich?)')
