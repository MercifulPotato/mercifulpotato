Does the smaller pool change membership (because it can&#x27;t see the larger pool) and continues on it&#x27;s own?\nWhat if the smaller pool has a cold start and has no idea about the larger pool?<p>My point is that there needs to be some consensus on pool size to decide what constitutes a majority vote.<p>Implementations can make reasonable assumptions and rules for this, but afaict it&#x27;s not covered by the protocol itself.')
