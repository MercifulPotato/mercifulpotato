Pure functions are easy to reason about, easy to test, have predictable performance and are well suited for concurrent applications. IO is crucial for a useful application but it forces you to sacrifice some guarantees.<p>What I like about Haskell development is that the compiler enforces this separation, so when things misbehave you can just focus on the IO components. I think this would fit well into the paradigm rust had for marking variables as &quot;mutable&quot;.')
