I feel like most of the countries at the top present tech levels could not really absorb the kinds of infantry and mechanized losses that would ensue if they tried to have an actual ground war. Guided rocket artillery, cruise missiles, airstrikes, etc. seem capable of killing infantry in numbers that would not be politically acceptable. This is to say nothing of the losses that could be inflicted with strategic weaponry (either nuclear or non-nuclear) in a total war. This is part of why I don&#x27;t expect any future direct wars between world powers.')
