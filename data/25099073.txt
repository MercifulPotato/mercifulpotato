I think I focused too much on my career that it left me with little energy for anything else.<p>I was finally starting to figure things out and get where I wanted to be in life at the beginning of the year but then the world got flipped upside down and it&#x27;s been a rollercoaster since.<p>I almost want to say I was happy working from home, having more time for myself and my hobbies, but I was still looking forward to going back to the office because it brought back a (small) sense of normalcy and it definitely did.<p>Problem now is that I&#x27;m possibly days away from putting in my 2 weeks for a new SWE job in a sector that I&#x27;m super interested in and working with much cooler tech, but I&#x27;m scared. I&#x27;m extremely comfortable in my current role and it&#x27;s very stable for the time being. I have no idea what the new role will be like - stress, long hours, etc. I know it&#x27;ll be WFH for at least a few months to start, which I&#x27;m not looking forward to. I&#x27;m scared to leave my comfort zone in the middle of all this, and I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;ll be terrible for my mental health going into the winter.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t exactly the thread for this.. but I don&#x27;t know where else to talk about it.')
