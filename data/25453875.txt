In 1918, people were arrested for leaving their homes without masks on, regardless of whether they were known to be infected. In 1918 San Francisco, people were <i>shot</i> for leaving their homes without masks. A few people being arrested in 2020 for much more serious behavior — breaking quarantine while knowingly infected with COVID — is a pretty far cry from that.<p>That&#x27;s not to say nothing happened; obviously there were lockdowns, and private businesses were forced to close or reduce occupancy for varying amounts of time depending on the state governments. But individual private citizens were extremely lightly policed in comparison.')
