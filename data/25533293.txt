According to Wikipedia &quot;The Spectator is politically conservative and supports the Conservative Party&quot; .<p>Being openly &quot;conservative&quot; means biased. Although they are entitled to their opinions it is good to be aware that they have a (conservative) bias. They do not try to be objective, they try to be conservative.<p>And what is &quot;conservative bias&quot;? It of course means conserving the status quo, conserving the power of the rich and powerful, conserving inequality. That kind of thing is what I think ethicists should be studying.<p>Note that to the conservatives, since by default they want to conserve things, don&#x27;t want change, they don&#x27;t want ethicists snooping around asking questions about what if anything might be unethical about the existing power-structures. No Sir :-)<p>So it seems to me that for a conservative magazine to criticize &quot;ethicists&quot; is very self-serving for them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Spectator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Spectator</a>')
