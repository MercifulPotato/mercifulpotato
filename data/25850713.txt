That&#x27;s the determining factor here. The Great Suspender was well-regarded in certain circles, and even fairly well-known (I&#x27;ve never used it but I&#x27;ve heard of it). But even it apparently wasn&#x27;t above compromise. To be reasonably safe, an extension has to either be a) so well-known that they&#x27;d never be able to get away with silently adding malware (because someone would notice, which to be fair is what happened here), or b) tied to a major brand that wouldn&#x27;t want to sell out to some shady firm, on PR grounds alone.')
