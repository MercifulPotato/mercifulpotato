The connection is unpredictably unstable and I personally reject any belief of a &quot;tuned cable system&quot; existing. It&#x27;s all a mess. And by design since DOCSIS auth is done on the CPE (modem), the device is not trusted and you cannot use your own unless the ISP [is forced to] allows it and whitelists it.<p>So DOCSIS is hell.<p>GPON is ... depends. The technology is great, but some ISPs can and will ruin it because they&#x27;re greedy and shortsighted. Someplaces you can get a bridge CPE (ONT) that does have remote access but doesn&#x27;t allow configuration, someplaces the ONT itself is fine (i.e. HG8245 series for which too you can disable TR069 interface and CWMP and change the passwords - which I did), but someplaces you just get the &quot;DOCSIS over fiber&quot; experience, with hostile ONT in your home network the ISP uses to make your existence miserable.<p>Personally, DSL is fine for me. I am so used to low speeds (~20&#x2F;2 Mbps) when I am in the village (since march due to COVID, working from home), I have started bonding [0] DSL and LTE for around 95&#x2F;45 Mbps and that is fine for me.<p>So, I&#x27;d rather stay on tried-and-true, stable, low ping DSL, than muck around with DOCSIS and fear any rain or wind.<p>For GPON it depends on the ISP, but the technology does not dictate any remote management requirements except OMCI which is not concerned with &quot;higher layer&quot; configuration such as WiFi or router features.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;milankragujevic.com&#x2F;openmptcprouter-true-bonding-of-2-wan-connections-for-cheap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;milankragujevic.com&#x2F;openmptcprouter-true-bonding-of-...</a>')
