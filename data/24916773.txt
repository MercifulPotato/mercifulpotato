I hated that thing so much that I went to my local arcade parts dealer, bought a stick and buttons, built a plexiglass housing and circuit board (designed in Deluxe Paint) in the electronics lab at my high school, and cannibalized that horrible Epyx joystick for its plug. Best decision I ever made! SOTB and Turrican were so much nicer with an arcade stick. I even added toggle switches to reroute one of the buttons to &quot;up&quot; (since many games used up for jump).<p>I still have the buttons and joystick, though the home-built plexiglas housing didn&#x27;t fare so well over the years.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytecellar.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;a2000.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytecellar.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;a2000.jpg</a>')
