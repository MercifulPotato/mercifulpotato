It is an inevitable consequence of technological progression. Your comparison between advertising commercials and songs of a favorite band is a very poor comparison and doesn&#x27;t make any sense. It makes as much sense as comparing your favorite beer to having to split a bill at a restaurant i.e. a completely invalid comparison.<p>It would be more like saying &quot;kids these days have no idea about waiting for a dial-up modem&quot; which would be true.<p>Or the prior generation saying &quot;kids these days have no idea about the excitement of having a pen pal and waiting weeks for a response&quot; which would also be true.<p>Or saying kids these days don&#x27;t know the sense of accomplishment of being adept at reading a map. Also true.<p>Or kids these days don&#x27;t appreciate having to memorize a friend&#x27;s number and having to speak to their  friend&#x27;s mom first. Also true.<p>Or kids don&#x27;t appreciate how when you used to travel to a foreign country for vacation, you were 100% gone and unreachable from your contacts back home. Also true.<p>Every generation feels this way. I don&#x27;t see why anyone should get upset at this truth.')
