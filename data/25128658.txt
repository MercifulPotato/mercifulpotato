I personally prefer the limited options. You focus more on the content of your comment than making it look pretty.<p>The only thing i really despise about hn&#x27;s formatting is the code blocks or whatever they are, the one on mobile that vanishes off the side and you have to scroll horizontally to read everything. I really can&#x27;t stand when people use those for quotes.<p>Other than that though, hn&#x27;s formatting makes everything uniform and fairly easy to read through. There&#x27;s no fancy nonsense getting in the way of things.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s part of why those code block things piss me off, they&#x27;re probably the fanciest piece of formatting you can do and all it does is obstruct information and make me waste time while reading.')
