Both are constantly accused of racism and&#x2F;or white supremacy and yet I see none of either.<p>The 8th post on the homepage is this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patriots.win&#x2F;p&#x2F;11SK7JKMbx&#x2F;guess-what-my-favorite-thing-to-&#x2F;c&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patriots.win&#x2F;p&#x2F;11SK7JKMbx&#x2F;guess-what-my-favorite-thi...</a>, and the top comment is a list of racial slurs for Asian&#x2F;Chinese people. There&#x27;s a few other threads that include similar lists, as well as comments making fun of Asian&#x2F;Chinese people in general.<p>I saw a few slurs for gay people as well.<p>I found all this in 5 minutes, so I&#x27;m surprised you haven&#x27;t seen anything even though you browse it &quot;on a regular basis&quot;.')
