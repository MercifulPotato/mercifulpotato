Item(by='jng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604008339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933605, text='Google recently opened up a full 130nm ASIC design platform, including core cells, tools, etc... Google it, can&#x27;t remember the name right now. They&#x27;ve even committed to manufacturing silicon for free for a few select open source &#x2F; open hardware projects. I guess that&#x27;s going to turn into some kind of low-cost shuttle in the near future. That&#x27;s probably the biggest movement towards democratizing ASIC design the way that JLCPCB and others have democratized PCB manufacturing (and assembly, as you mention, although with a quite restricted selection of available parts). Kicad democratized PCB design and it&#x27;s being successfully used for many projects these days.')
