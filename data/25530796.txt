If say 75% of the specimen would be female, being a male would yield <i>on average</i> thrice as much children compared to a female, so it would be evolutionary beneficial to be male.<p>The only species where the ratio is different are those where sex is determined with different genetic mechanisms. For example, in hymenoptera (ants and wasps), males are born from unfertilized eggs, which results in a 1:3 ratio between females and males.')
