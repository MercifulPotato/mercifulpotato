My understanding is that the DaVinci surgical robot also allowed them to be more precise with how much tissue they removed as well.<p>Hopefully the medical community can get a better sense of when it&#x27;s appropriate to use such technology but it would be a mistake to dismiss the benefits because of misuse by some surgeons.')
