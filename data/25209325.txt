The thing is we used to eat almost nothing before competitions (I once lost 8kg in 2 weeks leading up to the nationals, from already 8% bodyfat), and once the season was over we would binge eat (still not gaining much weight though because we continued training).<p>For a long time I did not have a being saturated feeling and could eat until vomiting. It&#x27;s a bit better now, however I still need to do sports (road cycling mainly) 3-5 times a week as otherwise I gain weight because I eat too much (and I generally don&#x27;t eat crappy food, just a lot). The upside is, if I had a period where I gained weight because I was not training enough, I will quickly loose it again when getting on a training regime.<p>However, weight trainingdefinitely do not burn enough calories, I notice that when in winter when I go to the gym much more. I think the whole weights training for loosing weight has been pushed by the gym industry largely. Do cardio and HIT and you will burn calories much more quickly.')
