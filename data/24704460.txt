Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=[24708439], score=None, time=1602034918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697638, text='&gt; We need to rather argue that the moral cost and side-effects of public surveillance far outweighs its usefulness.<p>The argument I make is that it is more cost effective to develop a society where one does not need to commit crimes to get by in the first place. Law enforcement is reactionary and can only punish when crimes are already committed. While we shouldn&#x27;t get rid of law enforcement, because crime will always exist, let&#x27;s look to societies that have low crime (and societies that have high crime) and see what we can learn from them (and improve upon). Such policy is far more advantageous for citizens.')
