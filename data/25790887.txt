It&#x27;s where home directories of users were placed. Now that it&#x27;s been relegated to storing user-usable programs &amp; data it makes sense to me that it&#x27;s separate from say &#x2F;Users, but I suppose it could be aliased to something like &#x2F;UserProgramsAndData for verboseness and clarity to newer users. But regardless, &quot;User System Resources&quot; is a fairly useful phrase, it&#x27;s there to separate their system resources (programs &amp; data) from their personal resources (which should be in their user directory).<p>But, a system _does_ have users. Those users _do_ have programs. There&#x27;s a hierarchical relationship. I&#x27;ve been following along with your comments in this thread and I just don&#x27;t follow what you&#x27;re getting at here.')
