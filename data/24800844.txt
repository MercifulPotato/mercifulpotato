Yes there are inconsistencies in it. One thing to remember when looking at the inconsistencies is that the bible itself is a collection of separate books that for the most part are telling unconnected stories. The new testament is more interconnected as it is several of the disciples accounts of Jesus&#x27;s life but the old testament is books by separate authors throughout time.<p>Depending on what you mean by learn. If you are trying to understand Christianity, so might get a better idea but maybe not. From what I remember as a child going to church, each season would have a section of the bible that the pastor would pull from and there was not much variation on the theme from year to year. i.e. Easter being rebirth, pulling from Mathew, Mark and John.<p>But to say there is nothing to be learned is rather harsh, it does try and set out guiding principals and morals for people. From the old testament 10 commandments to the new testament &quot;do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;. It has some nice poetry in it in places, it has some epic tales such as David and Goliath and it has some really crazy stuff such as Revelations.')
