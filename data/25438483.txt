When teams are doing overtime it means some bad management happened somewhere. Either someone under-estimated the scope and was never adjusted &#x2F; communicated, or someone couldn&#x27;t keep promise of not changing things as a result the developers and final product suffer.<p>Software projects are very difficult to estimate. Especially when you are building &#x27;one of a kind&#x27; products. How do you give an estimate of something you&#x27;ve never built. You may know how efficient your team is at building a past product but you do not know about the upcoming problems you will face when building something new.<p>After working on a project for sometime you have a better idea and give better estimates however pinning &#x27;deadlines&#x27; on a &#x27;one of a kind&#x27; product never works out.<p>This is just another one of those cases. They should have just released the PC version first, and the other consoles could have come later. It would have been a better release for everyone and a better product.<p>Having engineers work overtime also is generally quite bad. Engineers are humans they get tired, when they&#x27;re tired they make more mistakes. I guess it shows very clearly in this game all the &#x27;mistakes&#x27; the developers made.<p>How long did they spend making this game? And to rush it at the last minute to hit a &#x27;deadline&#x27; and to have an outcome like this. Was it worth it?')
