Item(by='logicchains', descendants=None, kids=[24677991], score=None, time=1601802102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677317, text='&gt;What all these have in common is a desire to create irreproachable systems. Like math, like physics. In practice, they created religions. Religions are irreproachable too. The way religions become irreproachable is by banishing heretics. That&#x27;s what the &quot;secular&quot; rationalist philosophers did to. Rand was famous for her banishments.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about using mathematical, logical approach to find the &quot;most correct&quot; philosophy. As Wittegenstein noted in Tractatus, the &quot;most correct&quot; approach is:\n&quot;To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions&quot;.<p>Rather I&#x27;m talking about using formal methods to analyse existing systems. Identify their axioms, identify the deductive rules they permit, and determine how consistent they are. Maybe even formally verify this in a proof assistant. Then it&#x27;d be also possible to e.g. explore what different systems can and cannot prove (somewhat akin to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reverse_mathematics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reverse_mathematics</a>). An example kinda along these lines is Lawvere&#x27;s work on modelling Hegelian philosophy as modal type theory: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;Hegel%27s+%22Logic%22+as+Modal+Type+Theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;Hegel%27s+%22Logic%22+as+Modal...</a>.')
