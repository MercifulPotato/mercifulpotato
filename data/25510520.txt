In a month, that 3% pittance becomes 10%. Also, it does not seem that the company has no value at all, if it is primed to make money. The extrinsic value on the 40% is worth negotiating over and not giving it up and walking away. Nobody should do that unless there is gross misconduct or negligence involved.')
