It&#x27;s the same as telling people who want to fight global warming to buy recyclable containers (when we know that most of the damage comes from companies and not individuals) or telling people who are concerned about ocean pollution to use reusable straws or not to use paper bags (when fishing nets are actually responsible for &gt;50% of ocean pollution and straws are less than 1%).<p>This is actually a tactic that climate change denialists push for (accuse people of not doing enough personally so they don&#x27;t go after the real source of the problem and blame themselves instead)<p>It&#x27;s a milquetoast argument intended to defend the status quo by attacking the people that want to change it.')
