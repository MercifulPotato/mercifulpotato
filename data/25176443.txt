They knew they couldn’t encompass the full breadth of these frameworks in many years to come, so why not allow easy access to underlying implementation details, to allow fine tuning for those that want&#x2F;need it. Really dumb decision making, but that seems to be a lot of what Apple is doing in the last few years.')
