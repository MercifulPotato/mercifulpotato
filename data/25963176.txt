I do however believe we should vaccinate the most at risk groups, then be more generous with the UK production facilities for the EU&#x27;s more at risk groups whilst slowing down our efforts for our own less at risk ones (which includes me). It&#x27;s the humane thing to do.<p>That said, my sympathy for the EU (as an opponent of Brexit) has been diminished by their attempted bullying behaviour.<p>They initially wanted the UK in on their EU procurement. Unlike the EU members of the grouping we were to be excluded from any say in the vaccines chosen, the quantities, the pricing, the manufacturing, and the distribution. No say on anything; take what you&#x27;re given. They left us with no choice but to do our own deals.<p>We did those deals faster and with less guarantees at that early stage, fronted virtually the whole cost of the AstraZeneca UK production, accepted liability rather than insisting (as per the EU) that the vaccine makers did, and paid much more, just to get a faster agreement (and we still had the same teething issues the EU are facing now; we weren&#x27;t special in that regard). Despite all that risk, up front cost, higher prices, and accepted liability, the EU is now demanding that the instant they approve the vaccine they can dip into the supply that has cost the UK far more than most people realise we gave up in order to get that swift delivery.<p>The EU stumbled by not realising the urgency last year, then stumbled again by badly insulting the UK with the EU procurement &quot;offer&quot; terms which forced us to negotiate separately.<p>I have a great amount of sympathy for the EU people (I may not be in the EU any more, but I&#x27;m still European) but none of this is the doing of the UK - who are simply carrying on using the vaccines delivered - and the first &#x27;shot&#x27; at actual vaccine nationalism has been fired not by the mad brexiteers but by the EU with their Northern Ireland border statements and not-export-control-really new &#x27;monitoring&#x27; and &#x27;agreement&#x27; position.<p>I really expected coming into this year to find myself part of a massive UK villain state facing a more reasonable EU. I didn&#x27;t foresee a desparate EU attacking a UK just going about it&#x27;s own business.')
