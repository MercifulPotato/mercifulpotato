I play csgo (an older, but still very popular game) on a 4k display. my gpu hovers around 40% at max settings, while a couple cpu cores are constantly pegged.<p>it is hard to find benchmarks to show this however. the reputable sites mainly focus on 1080p because this is where the difference between cpus is most visible. doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a meaningful difference at higher resolutions, it just isn&#x27;t as good a way to show what they are trying to show in a cpu review.<p>&gt; There is zero reason to be upgrading between generations unless you&#x27;re just burning money.<p>agreed, the speedup is almost never worth such a short upgrade cycle, especially for consumers. but this is moving the goalposts given the thread&#x27;s context.')
