It&#x27;s weird this FUD is still spreading after all this time, after all the debates the community has had already.<p>AGPL does have restrictions, and it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s preference as to whether they&#x27;re good or bad, but there has never been an intent to forbid businesses. If anything it&#x27;s the recent RedisLabs&#x27; modules license and the SSPL-style licences that do it: they explicitely contains the wording to indicate that the product can&#x27;t be used to create a similar product and offer it as a service. Heck, the SSPL says (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mongodb.com&#x2F;licensing&#x2F;server-side-public-license" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mongodb.com&#x2F;licensing&#x2F;server-side-public-license</a>):<p>&quot;If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the terms of this License&quot;<p>The AGPL tells you that <i>if</i> a user asks for the source code, you must give it to them and them only. The SSPL says that the source code must be publicly available to <i>all</i>, at <i>no cost</i>. It was created specifically to prevent competitors to run MongoDB as a Service. Surely if they had to change it&#x27;s because the previous license <i>did</i> authorize competitors to do it. Wanna take a guess what the previous license was ?')
