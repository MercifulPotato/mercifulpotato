Anything else is a total shitshow.<p>It all goes back to  generations of developers assuming that a pixel is an RGB triple of bytes in the range 0..255 in the sRGB colour space. Millions of lines of code have been written when &quot;images&quot; are &quot;byte[]&quot; or &quot;struct {r: byte; b: byte; g: byte} []&quot; or the equivalent.<p>First of all, there&#x27;s an implicit assumption by most programmers that this is a linear colour space. It isn&#x27;t. The (127,127,127) pixel colour is <i>not</i> 50% grey! Not even close. Even Adobe Photoshop made this mistake.<p>Second, monitor manufacturers like to stretch colours to the maximum (native) display capability, because it makes them stand out more in the shop. Everyone wants the monitor that makes the colours &quot;pop&quot;. Unfortunately, this means that with modern wide-gamut monitors, skin tones are so stretched that everyone looks like they&#x27;re in clown make-up.<p>Third, Microsoft is the laziest company you can possibly imagine. They will not lift a finger to do anything other than the bare minimum, which then they will never touch again unless forced to at gunpoint. Hence, Windows had colour management <i>technically</i> added to it back around the year 2000, in the sense that it has a handful of colour management pieces that never do anything unless explicitly invoked by applications such as Adobe Photoshop. Nothing has changed since, other than a new &quot;HDR mode&quot; that blurs text, turns the brightness down, and is only suitable for gaming in a dark room.<p>Fourth, the 10-bit-per-channel displays required for HDR were sold only to professionals, so of course NVIDIA and ATI milked this market for all it was worth. Until <i>very</i> recently, 10-bit output was available on most consumer cards but disabled in the drivers. You had to buy the Quadro &quot;professional&quot; cards with identical chips, but different drivers. As you can imagine, practically nothing in Windows (or Linux) can output 10 bit, other than a handful of video viewing apps. Web browsers certainly can&#x27;t. Even games that do compositing with 16-bit buffers output 8 bit only unless they were explicitly made for HDR. Even those <i>still</i> refuse to output 10 bit SDR or wide-gamut SDR even if it&#x27;s available.<p>Fifth, because of the <i>deliberate</i> hardware limitations and the completely uncalibrated $150 budget displays most people buy, support for anything other than sRGB and SDR was pointless in file formats, so <i>nobody bothered</i> to lift a finger. Not the standards bodies, not Microsoft, not Linux, not anyone[1].<p>As of 2021, it is impossible to do any of the following in the general case:<p>- Send someone a HDR still image file.<p>- Send someone a HDR video and expect it to work in anything other than the YouTube app on a handful of platforms.<p>- Send someone a 10-bit or better file and expect it to actually deliver a benefit<p>- Send a wider-than-sRGB file and expect it to display correctly, even on an sRGB monitor. Expect clowns or zombies, not proper skin tones.<p>(I wrote a similar rant back in 2020, and 2019, and 2018, back all the way to 2010. This will not change in 2022. Or 2023. Or...)<p>1] Okay, I tell a lie: Apple did actually make all of the above work! Nobody else though. Right now, <i>within the Apple ecosystem only</i>, I can:<p>- Send someone a 10-bit, Display-P3 image and it&#x27;ll display perfectly. Better colour, calibrated, smoother gradients.<p>- Send a wider-than-Display-P3 image and it&#x27;ll also be correctly displayed, not stretched unpredictably like it would be on a PC.<p>- Send a HDR video in 10-bit Dolby Vision as a chat message and it&#x27;ll work.<p>Etc...<p>Everywhere else though, no chance.')
