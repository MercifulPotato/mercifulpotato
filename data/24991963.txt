That’s in fact my point - policies matter more than attacking Trump’s character.<p>As for Guns, you’re just wrong.<p>Biden tweeted about banning assault weapons repeatedly, even at times when it was absurd - e.g. in response to two police officers being shot with a <i>pistol</i>.  This has absolutely been echoed in conservative circles, and is an accurate reflection of his stated policies on his website.  Kamala Harris is also one of the most fervently anti-gun politicians on record.<p>As to “Gun owners favor gun control” - if you believe that you are just misinformed.<p>The <i>only</i> gun control that gun owners (or the population as a whole) favor is background checks, and even this gets weaker when the actual implications of the schemes are explained.<p>It simply isn’t fear mongering.<p>All of the things that gun owners fear are in fact being demonstrated in California.<p>I think these are stupid policies that don’t save lives, and have definitely helped Trump both in 2016 and now.<p>I pick gun control because it is so ineffective, and it’s easily substituted with better polices if you want to save lives.<p>I.e. you can change this policy without betraying democratic values.')
