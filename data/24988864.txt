What did you expect to happen? Let&#x27;s say they did not terminate your accounts but sent a thank you letter, would that be satisfactory?<p>I&#x27;m interested in why do security researchers or bug hunters do this kind of work for free. It really devalues the proposition long term imo, but I don&#x27;t have a horse in the race. My POV is megacorps with bottomless pockets and armies of highly paid engineers miss these critical security issues all the time, and the best reporters can hope is chump change (if not abuse).<p>edit: Even more specifically I&#x27;m wondering why can&#x27;t the security community work together, denounce the current practice of exchanging bugs potentially worth $$$ for ~nerd cred? Make some high profile disclosure if that is what it takes to take the work seriously. Wouldn&#x27;t it work out better in the long run?')
