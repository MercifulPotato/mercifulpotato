It has to be niche. It can&#x27;t be broad like &quot;web development&quot; or &quot;web design.&quot; More like web development for automotive suppliers who use Magento for large B2B orders.<p>Doesn&#x27;t have to be tech related. For example; M&amp;A tax issues, defending age discrimination lawsuits as a small business, investment advice for American expats in Europe, increasing crop yield for soybean production, etc. etc.<p>If you don&#x27;t see blog posts from a consultant or company who sells to that niche, look up the google search traffic for the specific phrase you used, and if its significant, then you&#x27;ve discovered a business idea.<p>You can bet in the next 10-20 years every single one of those niches is eventually going to be filled and the competition is only going to get worse. The best time to start is now.')
