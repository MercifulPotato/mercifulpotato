I work at Facebook on data compression.<p>The libraries we maintain (1) are responsible for a non-trivial part of Facebook&#x27;s overall compute footprint, (2) should basically never fail of their own accord, and (3) have pretty good error monitoring. So my team is operating what is effectively (among other things) a very sensitive detector for hardware failure.<p>And indeed we see examples all the time of blobs that fail to decompress, and usually when we dig in we find that the blob is only a single bit-flip away from a blob that decompresses successfully into a syntactically correct message. I can&#x27;t share numbers, but, off the top of my head, I think it&#x27;s the largest source of failures we see. It happens frequently enough that I wrote a tool to automate checking [0].<p>So yes. It happens. Pretty frequently, in the sense that if you&#x27;re doing xillions of operations a day, a one-in-a-xillion failure happens all the time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;zstd&#x2F;tree&#x2F;dev&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;diagnose_corruption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;zstd&#x2F;tree&#x2F;dev&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;diagnose_c...</a>')
