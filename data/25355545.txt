If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can&#x27;t understand it.&quot;<p>I think about this all the time. In my area I see a lot of programmers who don&#x27;t do a great job at writing optimal code but it&#x27;s not because they are lazy or stupid but because they cannot understand something they cannot see. This is why some kind of appropriate visual idiom for efficient core usage and time spent is a necessity in any project that cares about efficiency. I still don&#x27;t think we have found the best visual idiom but we have to keep trying to make obvious visually, the way a computer really works.')
