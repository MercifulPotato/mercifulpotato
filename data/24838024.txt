C and Zig are very barebones, close-to-the-metal language. D has garbage collection, classes, templates, exceptions, built-in dynamic arrays and hash tables, and on and on and on. The &quot;Features Overview&quot; page makes me go cross-eyed [1].<p>Yes, you can turn many of these things off or ignore them and just use D as a better C, but the same could be said of C++ (for some definition of &quot;better&quot;). Or most languages, really, if you squint enough.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;comparison.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;comparison.html</a>')
