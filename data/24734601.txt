That province happens to have the laxest rules in the UK about disclosing the actual sources of donations.<p>* 11 May 2018, Leave.EU was fined by the Electoral Commission for &quot;Failure to deliver complete and accurate pre-poll transaction report and post-poll spending information&quot;.<p>* 17 July 2018, Vote Leave was fined by the Electoral Commission for &quot;Failure to deliver a complete and accurate spending return; failure to provide documents on time.&quot;<p>* 24 October 2018, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office found that between 2007 and 2014, Facebook had broken the UK data law then in force, the Data Protection Act 1998, and applied £500,000, the highest penalty allowed under that Act.<p>* 1 February 2019, Leave.EU was fined by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office for sending over a million emails to subscribers without consent.<p>* 19 March 2019, Vote Leave was fined by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office for sending 196,154 unsolicited electronic messages to people.<p>These are just some of the crimes that have been investigated and where the evidence hasn&#x27;t been hidden by either deleting data, or perpetrators hiding behind donor secrecy or &quot;national security&quot; excuses.  Is it really that hard to imagine that a journalist might genuinely be motivated by trying to bring this law-breaking to the attention of the public?')
