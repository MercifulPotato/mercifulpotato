And I like its UI a little more; its tabs, for instance, are native macOS tabs. Firefox and Chrome both make up their own stuff.<p>As far as &quot;least standards-compliant,&quot; I understand that when it comes to supporting progressive web apps, Safari has largely dropped the ball, but in day-to-day practice there just aren&#x27;t many sites that I have trouble with on Safari.
