It was like 4 abandoned houses and it looked (from Google Maps) like no one had been through there in years.<p>[0] A machinegun manufactured after the passage of the 1986 Hughes Amendment is non-transferrable and can only be possessed by law enforcement agencies or dealers (SOT) with a &quot;demo letter&quot;. Dudes effectively were LEOs in a non-existent town and bought machineguns that otherwise couldn&#x27;t be owned by individuals.')
