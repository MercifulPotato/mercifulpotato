F.ex when used as a tool for manipulation.<p>UBI, some argue, may address a large source of such fears.<p>Especially in a highly creative group, such as I imagine the hn-audience to be, this may be a strongly felt belief. I think it’s quite natural that it’s a promise that would trigger a bit of zealotry in that group.')
