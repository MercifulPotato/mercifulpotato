But the usual financial construction for a betting market where you can take both sides is the same as for a law firm, or a share dealer, all <i>your</i> money held by them is legally separate from <i>their</i> money so even if they get into horrible debt problems their creditors have no possible claim to your funds and you just get it all back in a few weeks after the paperwork is done.<p>It&#x27;s clearly not as truly safe as government bonds or insured savings where the government is ultimately on the hook to make you square - but it&#x27;s pretty safe. I wouldn&#x27;t put next week&#x27;s rent money (if I rented) on &quot;Trump lost the election&quot; at PredictIt. But money put aside for the new car, for next year&#x27;s vacation or for a birthday gift in February? No sweat.')
