I guess if it&#x27;s like Python&#x27;s &quot;import&quot;, it does.<p>Changing the grammar could still be considered static parsing, as long as the change doesn&#x27;t depend on the values of variables at runtime, e.g. your argv array or something.<p>I recall Larry Wall saying that Perl 5 was at times confused about the language it was parsing, and the goal was to fix that in Perl 6.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with it, but yeah that claim could be wrong, or at least un-nuanced.')
