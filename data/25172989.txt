Scantegrity II [1] uses pretty simple systems. A particularly nice thing is that casting your vote just involves filling in a bubble on a paper ballot--no electronics is involved at all in the voting booth. Machine counting just uses the simple optical scan counters that are an old and reliable technology.<p>It also provides receipt freeness [2].<p>About half of all districts in the US already use the optical scan counters, which means if we switched to this half the districts would not need any expensive new equipment. All the mathematical&#x2F;cryptographic magic is in how the ballots themselves are printed and in the pens used to fill the bubbles.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scantegrity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scantegrity</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;502.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;502.pdf</a>')
