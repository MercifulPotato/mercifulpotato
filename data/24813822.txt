That is a recent development, but I feel like it is an essential privacy feature now.<p>But Mozilla is failing, that much is true. And they just killed off their most promising blue sky initiatives like Servo, so I no longer see a future for them at the moment. If they moved to foster a type of open cloud ecosystem, along the lines of OwnCloud, that would be an interesting direction, but I don&#x27;t see that happening either since I don&#x27;t see much vision at the top... even though it would dovetail with Firefox Sync, Lockwise, VPN, and other Mozilla initiatives.<p>I am passively looking for other browsers now, however, since I have lost faith in Mozilla.')
