Then one day I mentioned that to someone and they balked and just said &quot;Only?&quot; I said that&#x27;s fair isn&#x27;t it? They said I should be doing at least 20% minimum. Ever since then I&#x27;ve just stopped going to places that require tipping. I just hate it. I hate knowing when to tip, who to tip, what if someone else sees me tip something that might be too low, someone balks at how much I tip. I just hate it all around. This is why I never if at all go to places that tip. I like to stick to places where I know what I&#x27;m gonna spend the moment I place my order. I don&#x27;t even care if I gotta drive myself to get my order. I just hate dealing with tipping culture in general. It places a cultural onus on me that places me in a situation that I want to avoid entirely.')
