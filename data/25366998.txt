Item(by='dkobran', descendants=None, kids=[25367983], score=None, time=1607556504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363484, text='Except this is fact-based article. The issue at hand is that there are widespread claims being made that are completely baseless. They are not substantiated by facts. Videos that are making claims without any evidence are not equivalent to an actual scandal&#x2F;controversy that is backed by evidence.  In other words, the claims being made in this election will not be presented in the same format of the article you shared because no one can point to any actual widespread election meddling or vote tampering. I really am blown away why this fundamental distinction is so hard for people to grasp. I can make any false claims about anyone or anything. This does not inherently make something controversial and give it credence. If on the other hand my claims were not fabricated and have merit, then they may result in a scandal&#x2F;controversy.  It seems like you believe because this is being said over and over again that it somehow deserves attention or is credible.  That&#x27;s a really unfortunate position.  You cannot will facts into into existence.<p>&quot;Wrong is wrong, even if everyone is doing it. Right is right even if no one else is doing it.&quot; â€• Saint Augustine')
