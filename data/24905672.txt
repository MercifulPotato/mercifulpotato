How about: nobody in your house&#x2F;dorm unless they live there, &#x27;outdoor beer gardens&#x27; only, limit 2 beers. Have a &#x27;dance party&#x27; in a big open parking lot to break the social malaise. Otherwise threaten expel students who break the established rules for putting other people&#x27;s lives at risk.<p>They were thinking &quot;My risk from COVID is exceptionally low, as is the risk of everyone I live with.&quot;  I don&#x27;t understand why this seems crazy to anyone.  More college students die from suicide every year than would die if they all got COVID (in the US, assuming that current mortality rates hold).  Many colleges are even self-contained, in a way, because they&#x27;re a &quot;college town&quot; wherein everything revolves around the college.<p>If there were a single group of people that I would say were in a good demographic to be out of quarantine, it would be college students.  They&#x27;re unlikely to die from the disease, they&#x27;re far less likely to live with someone in a risky group, and they&#x27;re old enough to make a decision on whether they want to quarantine or not.  They&#x27;re also unlikely to overwhelm medical services, given the rate that they&#x27;re asymptomatic at.')
