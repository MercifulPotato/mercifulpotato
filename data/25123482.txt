You don&#x27;t bash them with the intricate model of the world that you have developed at an age when they are not ready for it. The police are the good guys, the criminals are the bad guys. Sure, there are places where it&#x27;s the other way around, but you don&#x27;t really go about telling them about corrupt police departments or authoritarian governments when they are three years old. The goal is to build a mental model that is a good and usable first approximation of the world that they live in. There will be plenty of time to get into the details and edge cases later on.<p>Similarly with git, you can very much give someone a good and usable first approximation that lets them be productive with it quickly, and then go deeper as needed.<p>If, however, your normal git workflow involves using a lot of git features that were originally implemented to solve certain edge case situations, then this is not really git being complicated. It&#x27;s people making it complicated for various good and not so good reasons.')
