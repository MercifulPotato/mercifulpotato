That&#x27;s it. One time, never actually in practice.<p>They are still 100% terrible with this nonsense about not being allowed to link to or even <i>mention</i> alternative forms of payment, but let&#x27;s focus on what they actually do that&#x27;s bad, rather than what we imagine they might like to do in alternate realities.')
