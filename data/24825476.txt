A popular leader enacts policies which prevent multinationals from extracting the resources of Bolivia (including a lot of lithium, used in batteries), the leader is then pushed out in a coup which is supported by the US intelligence community and the western business interests (look up the OAS).  And Musk tweets support for this coup and then deletes the tweet and people defend this like it’s a joke.  Maybe he was high when he tweeted it but there is clearly some truth behind his “joke”.')
