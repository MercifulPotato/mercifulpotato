Copyright lasts for an absurdly long time, the DMCA which makes it illegal to circumvent copy protection is a threat to general-purpose computing, damages if you lose a copyright case can be astronomical and bankrupt anyone, copyright trolls sue people using stuff instead of using the copyrighted material to make anything themselves, etc.<p>Copyleft and the AGPL are a judo move that uses the strength of the copyright system against it. If enough stuff were under a strong copyleft license, maybe corporations wouldn&#x27;t be so enthusiastic about the copyright system. Maybe they would rediscover the benefits of the public domain, since copyright expiring would also liberate copylefted content + software. Perhaps they wouldn&#x27;t actually help reduce copyright, but they might not work so hard to stop efforts to do so.<p>I believe that the path to a stronger public domain leads through copyleft + the AGPL. Put your software in the public domain by reducing the power of copyright law, by shortening copyright term length, by reducing the number of things covered by copyright, by putting <i>everything</i> in the public domain, not just the software you control.')
