Item(by='futurehero', descendants=None, kids=[24805302, 24811498, 24805252], score=None, time=1602882800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804805, text='A community is a collection of individuals, each of whom may or may not feel pain in response to something that happens to less than 0.002% of Americans, and generally as a result of the deceased individual&#x27;s own behavior. Collections of individuals do not experience pain as a collective. Many, if made aware, would still not care, because they manage to keep themselves out of jail, and barring that, manage to refrain from assaulting the correctional officers charged with maintaining order within the correctional system. Call them callous, but theirs is a way of being in the world that is no less valid than one that holds every individual&#x27;s life worthy of special protection from the consequences of their unforced errors, and where these might be attributable to mental illness, there is a rational argument for putting the space and resources consumed by the mentally ill to better use. One wouldn&#x27;t fill a spaceship full of mentally ill occupants where every individual&#x27;s actions contribute to or harm the survival of the others, and it is not a huge leap to see the earth as a ship and the survival of it&#x27;s occupants as far from guaranteed. It is straight forward to infer that that which increases net prosocial behavior within the species need not be resisted.')
