I&#x27;m guessing the network in the car game doesn&#x27;t need more than one layer and two outputs (acceleration vector), but that is besides the point.<p>The technique being demonstrated is the ability of GA (or maybe particle filters), to find &quot;optimal&quot; weights for a network given whatever simulator. This is always interesting, especially when done with graphics like this.')
