I never really understood the appeal of just &quot;getting them working&quot;, which seems like fixing up a classic car and not driving it. But seeing how they are still in production is interesting to me. About 15 years ago I was at a cable access station and they were still using an Amiga; I think it was for captioning. HD did it in, I expect, but it was neat to see it getting use in the 21st century.')
