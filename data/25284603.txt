If you have good points corrective votes will happen.<p>That being said, while Apple is strongly anti-consumer (in everything except for privacy), Facebook is orders of magnitude worse in more regards than merely celebrating choice. Definitely a great second contender, but the world would be genyinely better place without Facebook.')
