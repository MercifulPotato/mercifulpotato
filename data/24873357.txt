But as soon as async&#x2F;await was in, we allowed them in the codebase.<p>So now the codebase is a mess, with some functions being callback style and some others promises, stiched together we promisify functions. Im hoping in a 2-3 years time frame all our callback style functions will be eventually phased out during small refactors and rewrites.<p>This migration plan is the only method i found that enables projects to move from A -&gt; B without spending massive times rewriting the whole project and yet keeping up to date with technologies so they wouldn&#x27;t need a rewrite every 10 years.')
