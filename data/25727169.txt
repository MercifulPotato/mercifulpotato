By contrast, Haskellâ€™s static type system, in conjunction with compile-type time checking, acts as an invaluable pair-programming buddy that gives instantaneous feedback during development.<p>the reason they &quot;find that the compiler feels like an annoyance&quot; is because their first exposure to Java &#x2F; C++ is in school where they have an assignment due for tonight and the compiler won&#x27;t stop banging pages of errors about std::__1::basic_string&lt;char, std::__1::allocator&lt;char&gt;&gt; and what the fuck is that shit I just want to make games !!11!1!<p>In contrast Haskell is often self-taught which gives a very different set of incentives and motivations.<p>As a mostly C++ programmer making sure that I get compiler errors as often as possible by encoding most preconditions in the type system is one of the most important part of my job and make the language very easy to use when you use an IDE which allows to click on an error and going to the right place in the code.')
