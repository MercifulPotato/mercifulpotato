It works great.<p>I try about every day to use Linux on a desktop for day to day work. It is dreadful when you install it, and then a pain if you want to use office files to a greater extend, connect to Exchange etc.<p>I constantly have problems with my cursor.<p>So I give up and I go back to Windows 10. They work consistently for me, are fast enough and I have all the software I need.<p>The choice is simple, but still I diligently try on Linux.<p>As for servers, I never use Windows because I do not feel they ate made for servers\nBut others do it successfully so why not.<p>The only thing I really miss from the MS world on Linux is their Active Directory that manages users, computers etc. and is so tighly bound with the OS.')
