Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607055698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298748, text='10 years of experience here<p>Early this year I got good at these problems and the ones I would actually encounter, above the average (based on time to solve, efficiency), as well as the system design interviews and I honestly think the behavioral interviews too, but decision makers just do not want to pay me over $180k. Whether thats salary at a Series B, C or midsize company or big tech companies whose total comp would be closer to $400k alongside a slightly lower cash comp<p>I questioned my competency, how I come across and everything. I subsequently let recruiters push me at the $125k range and I got a lot of offers. It was like a totally different and endearing experience, just like I had seen earlier in my career at those and lower comp ranges<p>So instead I created and sold some digital currencies for 7 figures<p>I think I would still like the validation of doing a year or two in the big tech circuit, especially because I could earn the shares and write calls on them without risking my prior capital, while being less likely to incur liability or bring attention to myself like in entrepreneurial endeavors<p>But I really hate that people are not able to value my contributions accurately. In fact I dont think they are valuing that at all, it felt like people were expecting a different kind of person: more stereotypical unsociable programmer at the higher comp and experience ranges. But regarding experience I also did a resume variation with less years of experience.')
