At least with an income tax it&#x27;s, hypothetically, only in the case of profit.<p>Wealth Tax is kind of like mandatory quotas. Income tax is like sharecropping.<p>Consumption is like sharing your goods consumption with society (think Potluck)<p>Vices is actually a disincentives structure for things proven to be societally disastrous or distasteful<p>And of course the devil is in the details entirely, because loopholes and policy can change it entirely.')
