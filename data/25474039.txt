You are still manually writing tons of boilerplate, you still cannot express something as simple as List&lt;int&gt; (and the JSR for that is on its, what, 8th iteration? for a problem that existed <i>since before C# existed</i>?), there is no async&#x2F;await in 2020 when even C++ has figured it out, the new module management system is a joke that solves zero problems and almost seems like it was <i>only</i> invented to modularize the JRE...<p>It&#x27;s got a few bells and whistles, although I can&#x27;t think of a single one that wasn&#x27;t stolen syntax and all from C# at least two years after the fact, except for the aforementioned modules. But &#x27;var&#x27; is the only thing I can think of that&#x27;s actually improved the Java experience since lambdas. They&#x27;ve committed to a six month rolling release cycle without actually having anything to put <i>in</i> the releases.<p>That said, Java devs think C# is slow, C# devs think Java is slow, and people who are neither think both are slow. It is no longer 1995 where bytecode is interpreted; the slowdown relative to C++ is 2.5x-3x for both. Any leftover &#x27;slow&#x27; opinions are bordering on superstition at this point.')
