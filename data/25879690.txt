At this temperature the nuclei of the atoms behave almost classically. There are some important quantum effects between the electrons, but their mass is like 10000 smaller. The effects are small in the electrons in the lower levels that are close to the nuclei, but in the valence band they can be very important. Specially in conductors where the electrons are very delocalized, but this is not a conductor.')
