So good they they’re reference displays for calibrating movies in Hollywood apparently.<p>It’s well made, it’s one centimeter thick, and while the smart features still work, I only seldom use Netflix (because it’s 4K, but there is hardly ever anything I want on Netflix.) All the rest goes through Kodi (which can also play YouTube without ads from my phone) and my receiver for airplay or Tidal.<p>The TV works just fine if not connected to the internet and I use nextdns on it to block all the telemetry along with a firewall rule to not allow any other dns.<p>There are no ads anywhere in the menus, it’s got tons of video calibration options, turns on in two seconds flat, and the menus are fast (although I never need them)<p>But I think they only sell in Europe now, they’ve left US and Canada.')
