For services such as movers, doctor’s, etc. I often use the reviews on Google maps. Word of mouth is probably best of all though.<p>Some general advice:<p>If you’re buying a product always buy via a credit card as you have greater protections and can always issue a chargeback if all else fails. Also, if you’re a victim of fraud and your credit card gets maxed you will still be able to make rent &#x2F; mortgage payments as your checking &#x2F; current account won’t have been exposed - plus credit card companies are motivated to help as they are the ones liable for the transactions.<p>For services, insist on payment after delivery. That way the provider is more motivated to provide a good service so they get paid and recoup their costs, and if it goes tits up you can withhold payment rather than having to try and get a refund.<p>If you can’t afford a reasonable worst case scenario, get insurance.')
