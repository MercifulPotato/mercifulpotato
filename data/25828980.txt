I remember writing a column on the algorithm for Dr. Dobbs Journal back in the 1980s.  There are lots of bit twiddling techniques that use XOR.  Henry Warren&#x27;s Hackers Delight is a good reference there.  And, of course, Don Knuth&#x27;s AOCP has lots of information.  Volume 4A, available as a fascicle, has a number of XOR algorithms.')
