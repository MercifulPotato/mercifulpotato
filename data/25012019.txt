Item(by='LockAndLol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604704348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006589, text='&gt; In the case of Finland, it is made clear by advertising from semi&#x2F;official sources (like this website), if not explicitly but very heavily implied, that you can move here and get by fine with English.<p>Imo, that&#x27;s just an excuse. I live in a country that has fantastic English speakers, don&#x27;t even plan on staying here longer than 3 years and still took the time to learn the language (probably B2-B1 after 2 years). Sure, it&#x27;s understandable that not everybody wants to do that, but it should be obvious to any foreigner that you lock yourself out of a multitude of jobs by not learning the language.<p>The only reason I&#x27;m saying this is because the top comment listed learning the native language as a negative, which imo it really isn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; If I had lived in France for as long as I have in Finland (not even a full year), then there is no question that my French would be at a much higher level than my Finnish is now.<p>That may be true for you, but definitely not for others. There are foreigners living in France that can barely count in the language. I&#x27;ve seen and heard that first hand. Some extreme example have been in the country a decade. It really depends on where you move to, where you work, who you surround yourself with, and how motivated you are.')
