It would suit them very well to be able to reliably tie it to other information (hence all the tracking pixels and so on) but the Container prevents that.<p>I mean, one of my Facebook friends is named say &quot;Norman Le Plum&quot;. I&#x27;m very confident that isn&#x27;t what it says on his birth certificate, and indeed when his friend request arrived I actually ignored it until I found someone out of band to tell me who &quot;Norman&quot; was, but in a sense Facebook know exactly who Norman is, he&#x27;s a disembodied red skull who is still really into skateboarding and Steamed Hams.<p>What use that is,isn&#x27;t clear, and presumably one day advertisers might conclude the answer is &quot;No use whatsoever&quot; and Facebook will go out of business. Meanwhile I read funny Steamed Hams variants, people complain about their jobs, and while I&#x27;d rather it didn&#x27;t exist at all, if it must exist at least it&#x27;s trapped in a little box where it can&#x27;t taint everything else.<p>Now <i>Google</i> probably knows way too much about me, but that&#x27;s quite a different problem.')
