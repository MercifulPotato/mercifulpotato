The only thing that changes really is the framing of the issue and the motivation.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at people being criticised because they&#x27;re not writing characters of their own skin colour or sexuality, or &#x27;staying in their lane&#x27; with their culture, or because their own experiences don&#x27;t conform to some expectation (like the author criticised for describing slavery but not how it was in the US), then you&#x27;re still looking at segregation and oppression, but approaching it in a way that is falsely empowering. It is still massively authoritarian and oppressive and extreme, no matter how virtuous people think the left wing is, and it&#x27;s certainly not liberal. There&#x27;s just nothing good about being at the extreme end of anything.<p>But that aside, and with the crowds on twitter, I just wonder what it will take for people like that to be happy, and not perpetually angry. So much aggression couched in seemingly kind language.')
