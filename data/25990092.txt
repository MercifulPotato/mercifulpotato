Many places I&#x27;ve worked, those employees stay long after hours pulling out board games, video games, etc.<p>But there&#x27;s another (probably larger?) subset of employees who like casual conversation, coffee, drinking, little 5 minute chats in the kitchen, and who have little to no interest in games.
