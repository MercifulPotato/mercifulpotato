As others have mentioned, it is largely caused by this attention economy (as I&#x27;ve heard Tristan Harris of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.humanetech.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.humanetech.com&#x2F;</a> call it) - where the apps most used today are made to be addictive and consume our attention as much as possible.<p>I have been working on a more intimate, less addictive, social media and messaging application that I hope can be part of a trend of new apps that help solve this problem. I believe one of the features in current apps that makes them so addictive, for teens especially, is the endless stream of content they have access to - they can view hours and hours of videos from celebrities they don&#x27;t personally know, content creators they have never met, brands, etc. If we can scale back the endless stream of content (which leads to doom-scrolling), that might be one approach to helping limit screen time without sacrificing the meaningful connection to friends and family that social media enables.')
