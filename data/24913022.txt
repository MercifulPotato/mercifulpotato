It&#x27;s a bit sad that there are so high differences between quality of schooling in the US. Having the right&#x2F;wrong friends can change entire lives, as can the teaching. That being said, telling kids they either start the next facebook or they are losers and have to take a loser FANG job is a bit bit overdone though... But I guess it all depends on perspective. If you are already in the upper class, you want your children to get upper class jobs and upper class success as well.')
