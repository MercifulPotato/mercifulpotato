Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25366382], score=None, time=1607552383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365957, text='&gt; I would argue that if a U.S. state has made unconstitutional election changes and thus has conducted an unconstitutional election then other U.S. states not in violation of the constitution have standing to dispute the election results with federal implications in accordance with the 12th Amendment.<p>The process you are talking about involves the US House of Representatives, <i>not</i> suing the states in SCOTUS.<p>The legal basis for claiming injury in the face of improper elections is the notion of &quot;vote dilution.&quot; However, vote dilution cannot happen in the Electoral College <i>by definition</i>. Texas gets 38 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College, and that is true no matter how tight or loose the voting restrictions are in Pennsylvania. The voting power of Texas residents remains unaltered no matter what the voting power of residents in Pennsylvania is. Texas&#x27;s brief did not persuade me that it had standing to sue (although it does appeal to vote dilution), and none of the other briefs have attempted to address the issue of standing at all.<p>That the House has had to decide the election is not unprecedented (it has done so on three occasions, 1800, 1824, and 1876, where it delegated its decision to accept the votes to a separate commission). What is unprecedented is a state asking SCOTUS to overturn the results of another state.')
