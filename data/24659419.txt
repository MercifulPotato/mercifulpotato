America needs to reckon with everything Trumpism has revealed about our country.  Him getting seriously ill or dying would let a lot of people escape that reckoning.  Not to mention that there is a non-negligible portion of this country that still refuses to believe the seriousness of this pandemic.  If Trump becomes seriously ill or dies, those people are likely to view this as some sort of assignation, coup, or assault on our country.  There could be real violence or prolonged civil unrest as a result.  I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of this country was for Biden and the Democrats to have a decisive victory in November, put Trumpism to bed, and force the GOP to reevaluate how they allowed someone like him to take control of their party.')
