(Mainly bitreverse and bpermute. Intel x86 only has permute (aka pshufb), but not the backwards version. BSwap can&#x27;t emulate bitreverse)<p>&gt; (it used to be that branches were super slow in GPUs, not sure where they are now).<p>Branches are fine. Its divergent branches (in both CPUs and GPUs) that are slow. A uniform branch will be branch-predicted on a CPU, while a uniform branch on a GPU will have all 64-threads (AMD GCN) or 32-threads (NVidia or RDNA) follow the instruction pointer.<p>There&#x27;s no slowdown with uniform branches, either on CPUs or GPUs. Both CPUs and GPUs do poorly on divergent branches, but GPUs do MUCH worse than CPUs.')
