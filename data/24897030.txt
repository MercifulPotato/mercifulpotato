Here are some thoughts:<p>First, the amount I learnt on a day-to-day basis from self-studying in my free time pales in comparison to the amount I learnt from a structured course ending with an exam, in which you have to commit to studying 2~4 hours of math every single day.<p>Second, classroom lectures mainly act as a structured table-of-contents for working through various textbooks. The problem sheets they distribute in the tutorials are very helpful, as is the discussion of problems that some students might have got stuck in.<p>Graduate-level math textbooks are fantastic, and the authors have poured 10+ years of their lives writing them. No online course with cute interactive video can substitute them. Having said that, there are some video lectures that can act as good motivation for studying a subject. For instance, Wildberger&#x27;s lectures on algebraic topology (find them on YouTube) are a great starting point for the subject.<p>You first have to decide on what you want to learn, by looking through various fields, and narrow your scope. Mathematics is a huge discipline, and you have to decide what you like, and work through the prerequisites in a disciplined manner.<p>I cannot emphasize the importance of working through exercises enough. All mathematics textbooks have exercises at the end of each section, a subset of which you must work through.<p>Having said all this, you might find the following site interesting: it contains a lot of unpolished notes from studying various math textbooks, but it requires a lot more work to be useful to a larger audience. Look through it, and pick something you like. On request, I might find the time to add some material.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artagnon.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artagnon.com</a>')
