By far the worst part about having COVID-19 for me was the psychological toll and anxiety of having a virus that the governments and media make out to be as if it&#x27;s as deadly as the bubonic plague, when in reality at least anecdotally for me and my friends who&#x27;ve gotten it, none of us experienced more than mild sickness, and all of us recovered within a week or two.<p>When I first got COVID19, I remember telling my girlfriend, and her breaking down in tears, having told me horror stories of young healthy people who died from COVID. I mentioned &quot;hey at least I&#x27;ll have the antibodies &#x2F; T Cells&quot;, and she responded that there have been cases of people getting reinfected, which may be true - but is certainly not the norm. You&#x27;re just more likely to see these horror stories being paraded around the news than the vast majority of patients who only experience mild symptoms and recover with no lingering symptoms.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss the suffering of those who&#x27;ve fallen seriously ill and died from COVID as that is obviously tragic, but at least in my experience, none of my 20+ friends I&#x27;ve spoken to (mostly in their 20s &#x2F; 30s) who got COVID got more than mild sickness, and all recovered after a week or two.<p>Were we all lucky? Maybe. But my point is, there seems to be an enormous discrepancy between how the governments and media are portraying this disease, and the reality of this disease. Dishonest alarmist journalism like this that tries to paint a narrative of a deadly disease without putting numbers in proper context, calling &quot;anxiety&quot; a mental illness during a pandemic, not properly controlling for the general context of the fact that we&#x27;re in a global pandemic with government lockdowns, travel bans, and people out of work is a serious problem that only exacerbates the general anxiety and depression of the public.<p>Of course people should know about the horror stories too, but we&#x27;re really not getting a balanced perspective here, which is a huge problem and has serious mental consequences.')
