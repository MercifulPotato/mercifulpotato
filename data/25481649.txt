Item(by='lrem', descendants=None, kids=[25482159], score=None, time=1608415303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480083, text='I&#x27;ve had none of the issues you mentioned, some 40-ish hours into the game. I don&#x27;t even get much in terms of visual glitches, other than sometimes a character&#x27;s rendering starting slow (first a bald head, then the headgear, then the hair). The thing that saddens me is the terrible AI, in all its manifestations: terrible enemies, terrible drivers and terrible wanted mechanics.<p>Edit: come think of it: I somewhat often get the visual glitch of foliage which should have been obscured being visible.')
