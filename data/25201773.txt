I&#x27;m mostly going off of what I&#x27;ve read online.<p>&gt; <i>One might equally say that the best place to learn to run a successful business (including a startup) is to work at a place with many successful large business divisions, each with their own P&amp;L.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. But even if it were, the point this piece is making is not that FAANGs are not the best place to learn how to run a business.<p>The point the chapter is making is that FAANGs are less likely to allow remote work &#x2F; other freedoms, so if that means a lot to you, you should not work at a FAANG. A quick check at levels.io can confirm this fact -- the vast majority of employees are on-site in a tech hub.<p>&gt; <i>While the skill of FAANG engineers varies, being at a FAANG provides an opportunity to learn from and network with top-tier engineers as well as the processes necessary to deliver quality software on a cadence at scale.</i><p>Whether or not this is an important skill depends on what you are optimizing for. I don&#x27;t need to be able to deliver software at FAANG scale if I don&#x27;t ever want to work at a FAANG.<p>While it&#x27;s true that knowledge does scale down and can make you a better software developer in other areas, I also make the point in the article it&#x27;s possible to learn about many of these things without sacrificing the freedom that you have to sacrifice to work at a FAANG.')
