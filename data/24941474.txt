Not just the imagery (which is obvious, I&#x27;m aphantastic), but my memories aren&#x27;t episodic at all. I have a sense of happened-after relations, but those are different from experiencing things one after another.<p>Somewhat related, while I can&#x27;t visualize memories I do visualize dreams. That would leave me to believe that dreams are fundamentally different (see also how the body has to seize many motor functions during dreaming, but we can use all of them during remembering).')
