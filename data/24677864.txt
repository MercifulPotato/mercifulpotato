You can&#x27;t formalize literally anything else in philosophy, at all.<p>This couldnâ€™t be further from the truth. There is a wealth of logics that have been developed and studied within philosophy, that aim to formalize various philosophical concepts. See modal logics, deontic logics, logics about knowledge and belief, and so on.')
