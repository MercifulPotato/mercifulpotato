I can&#x27;t find the link, but someone posted the CPUC minutes on the discussion of PG&amp;E&#x27;s budget.  It was a 900 page document.<p>It has things like &quot;PG&amp;E recommends replacing the chain link fence surrounding the substation located 10 miles outside Modesto, CA&quot;.  Then a comment by CPUC like &quot;We find this request unreasonable as the fence still prevents site access and has an estimated remaining lifespan of 10 years&quot;.<p>The way the minute read was PG&amp;E doesn&#x27;t make any decisions around where money is spent with the CPUC approving it.  But maybe it&#x27;s not binding?  Either way the CPUC is <i>deeply</i> embedded with how PG&amp;E operates.')
