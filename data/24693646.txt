No doubt they&#x27;ve run out of scavenging they&#x27;re willing to do, like upgrading a location to &quot;ADSL&#x2F;VDSL&quot; marketed as &quot;AT&amp;T Internet.&quot;<p>Which they are still offering with speeds that can go higher than 6Mbps up and all have 1TiB monthly caps.  Or since they have historical data, maybe the future scavenging is dedicated to maintaining their existing customers,  covering the usual old age failures, and nastier ones like DSLAMs getting destroyed by accidents, lightening, and natural disasters.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how exactly how they do their &quot;ASDL&#x2F;VDSL&quot; which I now use, but their old school ADSL in my home town when I and my family started using it a decade and a half ago was ASDL to the DSLAM, then ATM to a monster Cisco box 70 miles away.')
