Intel has no trouble maintaining a large enough workforce. They continually decided not to have parallel teams designing processors for their unproven 10nm and their successful 14nm nodes (or one team making a relatively portable design), even <i>years</i> after it was clear that 10nm was not going to work out as well as needed by their processor design roadmap. That wasn&#x27;t for lack of staffing or inability to afford enough engineers. It was management hubris.<p>(On the other hand, I&#x27;ve often pointed out that Intel&#x27;s attempts to develop two microarchitectures in parallel have always failed in the long run, with one project ending up woefully uncompetitive.)')
