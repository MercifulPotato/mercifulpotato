NASA had good results testing that with small optical trancivers.<p>Major cloud providers would perhaps have some presence on the Moon, so anybody could watch videos available over the Internet from local access points, no delays. Most communications at some point would also be local; talking with Earth will incur that unavoidable delay.')
