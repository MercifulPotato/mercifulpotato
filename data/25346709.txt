I have QC35s and they&#x27;ve never paired correctly with my iPhone. Part of that, I suspect, is because you have to use the stupid Bose app to pair your BT headphones. Why Bose doesn&#x27;t let you pair them using the standard system is beyond me.<p>In the end I only use the QC35s on my laptop which is a total disappointment.')
