NeurIPS needs to abandon this direction immediately or else its legitimacy will be in question. This will lead to the publishing authors affixing pandering impact statements to cater to the personal politics whims of those judging their work, and will also lead them to avoid risky exploration or challenges to the <i>political</i> status quo. The legitimacy of AI Ethics as a subject is in serious doubt already after the Timnit Gebru fiasco, but if NeurIPS wants to invite politics into the AI world, they should invite those writing papers on ethics to analyze othersâ€™ work instead of requiring such impact statements of authors who are focused on core technology.')
