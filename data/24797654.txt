Because they had a house close to my uni, I lived with them for a while as a student and it was horrible; I eventually got a little fridge in my room as simply everything was expired, and then some. They survived 2 wars and, although they had plenty of money, they knew (and wanted to??) how to live of nothing. So they bought or got (for free) only expired food. They also were very religious and that helped with the money thing; they both washed with cold water their whole life and the heating in the house (in the netherlands!) was generally off; there was ice inside my room as a student. I knew more (as in; yes they were weird to me but not so much for the generation) people who survived the 2 wars who could not shake this kind of thing even though after those events they made a good to great living.')
