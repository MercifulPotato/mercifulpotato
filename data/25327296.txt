Just like torrents it seems I have to at least be online at first until others start seeding it. And if all seeders go offline it will not be accessible?<p>I think p2p systems are powerful for bandwidth throughput like torrents and maybe video. But for content that needs high availability (like a code repo) it seems like central servers that keep the data alive are needed. And to me GitHub is exactly that... a central location that helps me keep my repo alive. I can easily just switch to another provider (gitlab) if I don’t like GitHub’s availability policy.<p>So I think radicle is a cool idea but git is already decentralized. I think a more interesting path forward is allowing other systems to follow git’s path. Maybe we need social networks to also have a strong decentralized foundation protocol like git which allows me to easily change which provider serves my social network data.')
