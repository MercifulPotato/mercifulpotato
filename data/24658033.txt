Item(by='smogcutter', descendants=None, kids=[24666087], score=None, time=1601604081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24657306, text='&gt; which usually, with most photos, is to losslessly convey the experience of looking at the subject of the photo, as it looked at the place and time the photo was taken.<p>That’s quite a strong statement, and one that I think many photographers would disagree with.<p>Snapshots aside, this severely understates the artistic choices a photographer makes. For one thing, black &amp; white and color read very differently to the eye, and offer different palettes for composition (although it’s not about photography, Scott McCloud’s “Understanding Comics” has a great exploration of the effects of b&amp;w vs color and is a fun read to boot). Basically all b&amp;w cinematography also gives the lie to this statement: it’s impossible to honestly argue that a colorization of, say, the stark expressionism of <i>Night of the Hunter</i> would be a <i>repaired</i> version.<p>The extent to which a photo is, or is even intended to be, a representation of “primary-source ground truth” is something we’ve been arguing since, like, Edward Said. I’m not saying images should <i>never</i> be colorized, or upscaled, or whatever. Obviously that’s not the case. Peter Jackson’s WWI documentary, as another poster mentioned, is a triumph. But it’s too complicated a conversation to dismiss by declaring, in one sentence like Moses coming down from the mountain, that the purpose of photography is the “lossless communication of information”.')
