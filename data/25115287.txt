I enjoyed it immensely. I don&#x27;t care whether its depiction of chess is realistic. The lead actress is superb in her role. Its depiction of addiction and depression was spot-on with my experience; many of the scenes gave me chills, particularly when the adoptive mother is involved (whether directly or indirectly).<p>Highly recommended: &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, 7-episode miniseries on Netflix.')
