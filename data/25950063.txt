There&#x27;s a list at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nolo.com&#x2F;legal-encyclopedia&#x2F;bankruptcy-exemptions-state" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nolo.com&#x2F;legal-encyclopedia&#x2F;bankruptcy-exemption...</a>. Basically you can keep stuff like the house you live in, your not-flashy car, household goods, tools of your trade, a small amount of personal property (if you own, say, a nice musical instrument or some jewelry worth $2k or whatever). As a general rule, anyone rich enough to have to sell property in a bankruptcy already has health insurance.<p>And please don&#x27;t take any of this as a defense of the current abominable US system. I lost my dad to complications of untreated diabetes because he didn&#x27;t have health insurance. What I&#x27;m saying is that people who should declare bankruptcy often don&#x27;t, because they think bankruptcy will ruin their life. It won&#x27;t. It protects you from predatory lenders and gives you a fresh start.')
