Maybe its true. But that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, it just shifts the blame. You can&#x27;t fix the people, because its a never-ending problem: move team or company and you&#x27;re back at square one. Good luck trying to change all the university courses to try and teach better practices.<p>So if you can&#x27;t fix the people, the only thing left is to take a long hard look at the tools and see if we can&#x27;t improve them in a way that encourages better code.')
