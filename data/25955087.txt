People who realized those were the suckers stomached selling while it wasn&#x27;t as high as yesterday but still astronomical.<p>The anger at Robinhood reminds me of when the government in Nigeria cracked down on MMM ponzi scheme. People were furious because they all assumrd they wouldn&#x27;t be the bag holders at the end. But here there&#x27;s been a full day to close positions so I&#x27;m fairly sure the people who aren&#x27;t doing it now wouldn&#x27;t have done it whenever the stock starting going down in other circumstances')
