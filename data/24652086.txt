When I first moved here I used GPS to get around because I moved here by myself and had never been here before. If I &quot;wasn&#x27;t learning&quot; when using the GPS then I&#x27;d still need it to get around, but I found I only really needed it for a week or so.<p>Of course, many people use GPS when they don&#x27;t care about learning how to get somewhere, they just wanna get there, thus the use case is different.')
