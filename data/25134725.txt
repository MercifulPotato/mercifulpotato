But electric cars don&#x27;t have a guaranteed real-world range of over 350 miles, the same as a tank of fuel, cost the same as petrol models, and charge as quickly as you can fill it with petrol.  If the latter was solved petrol stations could be converted to charging points in cities, reducing the need for on-street charging points.<p>And the charging requirements for all those cars, requires a massive investment in the national grid, practically doubling capacity if we ever get all 25 million registered vehicles electric.  Twice as many power stations than we currently have, twice as many wind turbines and so on.')
