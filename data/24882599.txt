According to the memo, Turatsinze suspected that a genocide against the Tutsis was being planned, and he said that &quot;in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1000 Tutsis&quot;.[110] Dallaire&#x27;s request to protect the informant and his family and to raid the weapons caches he revealed was denied.[110]</i><p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rwandan_genocide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rwandan_genocide</a>')
