And they bought Sistina for LVM.  As a result, they have been wedded to both XFS and LVM for many years now, because there is likely a combination of wanting to maximise their investment into these technologies and developing the in-house expertise to support them very well, and also in having a number of staff who are deeply committed to them and don&#x27;t want to change.<p>At some level, they must understand that both XFS and LVM are over 25 years old, and when compared with e.g. ZFS, are completely outclassed.  Their current efforts developing Stratis, which is an attempt to provide more ZFS-like functionality by extending XFS, adding LVM thin pools, and managing it all with an unholy complex combination of daemons, D-BUS and Python looks like a logical progression based upon what they have to hand in house, but a strategic mistake when it can never approach ZFS in functionality or reliability simply because these technologies can only be extended so far because of fundamental design limitations.  I&#x27;ll be morbidly interested to see what they can stretch XFS to do.  But I won&#x27;t be using it myself.<p>What I find really surprising here is that Linux in general, and RedHat in particular, don&#x27;t have a competitive filesystem to offer.  There is absolutely nothing which matches ZFS.')
