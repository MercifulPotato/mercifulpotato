If that artist is a smaller artist and is releasing their album relatively independently (very common these days), then their percentage earned can be 50% - 80% instead, leading to you paying the artist more like $5-10 USD for those album(s).<p>For streaming music, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re listening to the artists music in the USA (meaning your streams are worth the most). Let&#x27;s also assume an average song length of 4 minutes and an average per-stream payment to the artist of $0.003526648542 dollars since you&#x27;re in the USA[1]. In this world, if you listen to that artist for 3 hours a day, every day, for all 30 days in a month, then you will listen to 1350 songs from that artist and earn them ~$4.76 with all your listening.<p>So while it is <i>possible</i> that you could listen to an artist so much on a streaming platform that you give them more than if you buy an album, I wouldn&#x27;t call it super likely.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recordingconnection.com&#x2F;reference-library&#x2F;recording-entrepreneurs&#x2F;how-do-record-labels-turn-a-profit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recordingconnection.com&#x2F;reference-library&#x2F;record...</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igroovemusic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wie-viel-erhalte-ich-pro-stream-auf-spotify.html?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igroovemusic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wie-viel-erhalte-ich-pro-s...</a>')
