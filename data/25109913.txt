I keep using Windows<p>A counter-example doesn&#x27;t disprove a general point.<p>You&#x27;re describing a strong tie-in in your work environment to specific commercial software articles that are unavailable on Linux. This does not characterize most people (or even a large enough minority).<p>Now, you could make the argument that people interact with others using MS-Office documents, and that support for them in LibreOffice is insufficient. One could argue this both ways (as support has improved over the years and is by now passable IMHO), but that&#x27;s not the same as what you&#x27;re using.<p>In general, it _is_ true that people use the Operation System that came installed on their system. Most people are unable, or feel unable, to install an OS themselves and would not feel comfortable taking responsibility for choosing a different OS for their computing. Most do not even see this as a choice they are making.<p>Finally, the &quot;foreign ecosystem&quot; argument is circular. If you get a computer preinstalled with some operating system, and you learn how to use that, than other systems seem foreign. Few people get a Mac as a present then try to install Windows on it because it&#x27;s a &quot;foreign ecosystem&quot;<p>&gt; Doing a fully functional ports of software people use under Windows would&#x27;ve<p>It&#x27;s the commercial companies which sell this kind of software that can port it.')
