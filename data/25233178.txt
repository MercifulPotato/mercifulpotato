I have seen some comments (not in this thread, it was some time ago) that suggested that DFs allow the same as GA in practice, and everything GA does is adding an unnecessary geometric product, but exterior products should be enough (not my opinion, I can try to find the original comment if you want). I do not know enough to have an own opinion.<p>You obviously know more than me about this, so I will ask you a slightly different question: if I learn GA well enough and totally ignore differential forms, what will I miss?')
