The pdf draft (921 pages) and python code [1] of the first part are now available. The table of contents of the second part is here [2].<p>From the preface:<p>&quot;By Spring 2020, my draft of the second edition had swollen to about 1600 pages, and I was still not\ndone. At this point, 3 major events happened. First, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, so I decided\nto “pivot” so I could spend most of my time on COVID-19 modeling. Second, MIT Press told me\nthey could not publish a 1600 page book, and that I would need to split it into two volumes. Third,\nI decided to recruit several colleagues to help me finish the last ∼ 15% of “missing content”. (See\nacknowledgements below.)<p>The result is two new books, “Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction”, which you are\ncurrently reading, and “Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics”, which is the sequel to\nthis book [Mur22].<p>Together these two books attempt to present a fairly broad coverage of the field\nof ML c. 2020, using the same unifying lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory\nthat I used in the first book.\nMost of the content from the first book has been reused, but it is now split fairly evenly between\nthe two new books. In addition, each book has lots of new material, covering some topics from deep\nlearning, but also advances in other parts of the field, such as generative models, variational inference\nand reinforcement learning. To make the book more self-contained and useful for students, I have\nalso added some more background content, on topics such as optimization and linear algebra, that\nwas omitted from the first book due to lack of space.<p>Another major change is that nearly all of the software now uses Python instead of Matlab.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;probml&#x2F;pyprobml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;probml&#x2F;pyprobml</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;probml.github.io&#x2F;pml-book&#x2F;book2.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;probml.github.io&#x2F;pml-book&#x2F;book2.html</a>')
