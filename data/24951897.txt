The tenets go like this:<p>1) The ultimate realization of self driving will be successful, and will have profoundly positive impacts on society (e.g. safety, urban planning, ease and availability of transportation, economic)<p>2) The path to that ultimate realization contains many local optima traps<p>3) The only way to push past those local optima is by acquiring large amount of real world automated driving data, using systems in production<p>From a technical standpoint, I&#x27;m disinclined to disagree with them on the necessity of large amounts of real world system behavior data as a key ingredient.<p>Personally, I also think we (humans) have become way too culturally risk adverse. Or, to put the calculus another way: if I have a credible belief that I can save some number of future humans, what is the acceptable moral number of current humans to place at risk and&#x2F;or kill?<p>Imho, that&#x27;s a grave, serious decision, but not one to which the morally absolute is &quot;zero, always.&quot;<p>From a purely ethical standpoint (leaving legal aside), the crux would seem to be <i>informed</i> users. Not all Tesla drivers are likely capable of understanding the current SotA, and I&#x27;d <i>hope</i> (and expect) that Tesla&#x27;s phased rollout of the beta is informed by previous user interaction with assisted driving.')
