Fortunately they have not yet passed KYC laws that apply to many types of peer-to-peer financial activity, as the ones in force were designed for an era where electronic transactions were only intermediated by large trusted third parties, and largely exempt direct p2p transactions.<p>So this sudden opportunity to legally engage in financial interactions without the encumberance of 40 years of accumulated AML&#x2F;KYC laws that has arrived with the emergence of decentralized finance offers the opportunity to reverse the trend toward governments, at the behest of international organizations like the FATF, increasingly resorting to the warrantless dragnet surveillance of finance approach to combating crime, i.e. Total Information Awareness applied to private financial interactions.<p>Similar to how the internet forced governments to back off on censorship laws, cryptocurrency has the potential to force the political class to rethink current financial crime laws and liberalize people&#x27;s access to money. It has the potential to lead to criminal laws being limited to those that respect traditional due process and privacy rights, and the principles of freedom of association and presumption of innocence that free societies depend on.')
