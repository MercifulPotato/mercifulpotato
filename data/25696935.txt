The physical breaching and desecration of our temple of democracy must never happen again,” Senator Brian Schatz,<p>I would argue that those trying to secure the structure against invasion by the People are the ones desecrating the Temple. Like it or not what many hear call an insurrection, I call an unequivocal vote of no confidence by the governed and a call to action aimed at Representatives. Not to hide away behind locked barriers, but to listen, and take to heart the fact that people are <i>pissed enough to mobilize in the first place</i>. A call and voice message to the Rep is one thing. Repeated letters another. Putting in a physical appearance at an office yet another.<p>Pushing your way into and disrupting Legislative business is an unmatched attention grabber, and to be frank, I&#x27;m not willing to deprive anyone willing to drive to D.C. of the opportunity to have an impact, nor am I willing to accept only the well heeled should be capable of regularly exercising the advantage of exploiting proximity to Federal Representatives.<p>A person exercising Liberty, especially to the disdain of the majority, is the quintessential act of American patriotism and civil spirit. That foreign actors may have made use of the chaos is regrettable, but nevertheless, this is American government by design.
