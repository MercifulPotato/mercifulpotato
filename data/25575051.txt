Sooner or later we&#x27;ll want to do CPU intensive work in fibers as well, which in the current implementation will block all other fibers on the same thread. Like I mentioned in the article, I&#x27;d like to see work stealing between different threads as that would allow fibers to migrate away from threads stuck in CPU intensive work. An alternative way could be to adopt a model similar to Haskells lightweight threads, where the runtime forces a `yield` after N milliseconds (configurable). That would make sure that CPU intensive work would not block other fibers &quot;too&quot; much.')
