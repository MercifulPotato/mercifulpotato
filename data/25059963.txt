In my opinion, 2020&#x27;s polls were a lot worse than 2016&#x27;s, but because of Biden&#x27;s much bigger lead (in the polls and in key states), the polling errors did not cross the threshold to be &quot;wrong&quot; in the winner take all system.  Finally, there is an argument that even a Biden 75-25 call gives the correct outcome because each state is a winner take all system (with the exception of NE and ME, iirc). From a stats standpoint, the delta in that example make it very inaccurate, but from a model&#x2F;communication standpoint, getting each state &quot;right&quot; (in binary terms) is very valuable.<p>Trafalgar had completely different results than the rest of the consensus, and once counts are more finalized in non swing states (places like CA and NY take forever, but we don&#x27;t pay attention because they are always blue), we can accurately compare the polling and real results between different pollsters and polling methodologies.  Some experts have cautioned against using exit polls for this purpose (what is usually done for a quick read of polling accuracy), because exit polls are only measuring election day in person votes, and thus trend really red this year.  Trafalgar had unconventional methodologies like a &quot;shy trump voter&quot; bias where they arbitrarily shifted their numbers to the right, with weirdly consistent results of Trump +3 in a bunch of close&#x2F;blue states.  Perhaps there is more complicated justification of these numbers in the background, but I&#x27;m concerned that even if their deltas end up better than the &quot;normal&quot; pollsters, they are generating an inferior product with overbaked data.')
