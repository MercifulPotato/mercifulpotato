Something easy to flip on&#x2F;off when you move from home&#x2F;trusted networks to remote&#x2F;untrusted networks. With hooks for plugins to be written that let you write rules for flipping it on&#x2F;off automatically.<p>Instead of making the decision for people, make it a nice feature for then to use as they see fit. As toggleable feature, it could provide options for not just DoH but for VPN usage, TOR, maybe other things.')
