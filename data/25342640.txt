If you need a consensus algorithm, then it&#x27;s worth doing a survey of the literature beyond Raft.<p>Other Multi-Paxos variants are Viewstamped Replication Revisited, which has deterministic leader election for lower latency in the common case and thus no issue of split votes, and which I personally find easier to understand than Raft, also making less demands of the underlying hardware (i.e. VRR can do in-memory leader election, so you&#x27;re safe in the event of disk failure, corruption, lost writes, and misdirected writes, which Raft does not deal with).<p>For all these Multi-Paxos variants, you can also look at Flexible Paxos, which is a simple technique for making leader election quorums slightly more expensive (since leader elections are infrequent) in order to make replication quorums much cheaper (since they are the common case critical path). You can use Flexible Paxos to save 20% in the number of hardware nodes for the same common case failure tolerance. Flexible Paxos is a game changer.')
