In my experience they aren&#x27;t going for big company jobs now but are more geared towards joining smaller firms or starting something of their own. Co-working space is also a big thing there. Transport isn&#x27;t as bad as Bangalore. Hope the air is better and women&#x27;s safety increases as well. The food is the best in India - my biased take :)')
