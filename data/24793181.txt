Courses are wildly different, professors think wildly different. I would not want the software to shoehorn everyone into the same schematic. After all, in-person courses are organized in wildly different ways. You just have learn and communicate.<p>&gt; Zoom is shunned to its own tab rather than integrated with the calendar, causing students to constantly ask each other for the password for every session<p>That is a misconfiguration on your uni&#x2F;prof&#x27;s part. If they do it right, every calendar entry should a zoom link with the password included, resulting in one-click joining of class.<p>&gt; Everything (tests, midterms, homework assignments) is called a quiz, and it&#x27;s often unclear what is going to be graded or what allows multiple submissions until it&#x27;s too late<p>Are we using the same software? If you click on any assignment it clearly shows every one of these things at the top. I just checked in student view.<p>--\nI completely agree with your comments about notification settings. Also, the email system within Canvas is atrocious.')
