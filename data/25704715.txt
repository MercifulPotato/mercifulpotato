The data processing side allows you to select a single transformation and it applies it directly to the data and then let&#x27;s you download it.<p>The current version runs entirely client side in a js browser context.<p>Not sure if anyone finds any of that interesting :)...<p>I&#x27;m a little limited by the fact that UI isn&#x27;t quite my forte.<p>I&#x27;m on my phone at the moment so I&#x27;ll add some more details when I get on my desktop.')
