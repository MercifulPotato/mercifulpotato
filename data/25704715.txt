Item(by='Folcon', descendants=None, kids=[25704808], score=None, time=1610226248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='Been spending the last 2 years or so working on putting together a data processing and exploration tool.<p>Primarily allowing for the importing of csv files, though handle excel files to a degree (need to improve that).\nThe data exploration side basically allows the user to put together a stack of transformations which then get applied to the data which the user can then view the result of. The data processing side allows you to select a single transformation and it applies it directly to the data and then let&#x27;s you download it.<p>The current version runs entirely client side in a js browser context.<p>Not sure if anyone finds any of that interesting :)...<p>I&#x27;m a little limited by the fact that UI isn&#x27;t quite my forte.<p>I&#x27;m on my phone at the moment so I&#x27;ll add some more details when I get on my desktop.<p>EDIT: -----------------------------------------<p>So a bit more detail, it&#x27;s a bit of a long story to be honest, I was working on it with a friend of mine, him non-technical, myself technical, we were looking at it as a bootstrapped company, got a reasonable amount of consulting work from it, but not really figured out a space where there was enough repeat interest where I could really build out a nice specific solution and pursue product-market fit.<p>The goal was to provide non-technical people (who could at least use Excel), access to no-code machine learning solutions and data transformations. We realised that there was a lot of things that people like my non-tech friend wanted to be able to do, but just couldn&#x27;t use any of the existing tooling to do.<p>Over the last year we basically stopped working on it, but at the same time, I put a fair bit of dev work into it and I&#x27;m sort of trying to work out whether there&#x27;s something there, or if it&#x27;s a &quot;sunk cost&quot;. I&#x27;m sort of fine if it is? I just really want to know.<p>The tooling&#x27;s not perfect, a bit too much building to solve the problem our clients had at the time which didn&#x27;t make for a great cohesive product, but the thought process was get enough repeat stuff in that we can start focusing on a particular direction.<p>Now I&#x27;m sort of toying with putting some time in to cleaning up the code and trying to see if I can make something of it, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m kidding myself to be honest.<p>I&#x27;ve also been wondering if I should go the whole hog and just make it an offline tool with some online functionality. Porting it would be relatively trivial at this point, it&#x27;s written in Clojurescript so I could easily do an Electron thing or a native Clojure version that&#x27;s downloadable while still maintaining it in it&#x27;s current form without that much of a problem.<p>This question has been a bit of a fortuitous circumstance really because I was thinking of doing a proper writeup of the tool as a blog post and then seeing whether anyone had any decent suggestions, but I&#x27;d been putting it off a bit because I&#x27;m still not quite sure what I could say =)... So in the end this has been sort of a forcing function, so that&#x27;s at least something =)...<p>So without further ado, the tools:<p>- [Data Processor](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.guanxi.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.guanxi.ai&#x2F;</a>)<p>- [Data Explorer](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guanxi-upload.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com&#x2F;data-explorer-beta&#x2F;fast.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guanxi-upload.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com&#x2F;data-exp...</a>)<p>Data Explorer is CSV only, it was built really early on first and I&#x27;ve not really gone back and unified them.<p>I can do an overview as well of the tools as well if anyone&#x27;s interested?')
