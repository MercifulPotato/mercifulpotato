Imagine the addition of a currency attribute to the list of accounts. In Theory only the client and the SoR should be impacted but in practice all services in the middle are as well because they serialise&#x2F;deserialise and operate their business logic on this. Most often this business logic is just permission checking, routing, and aggregating.<p>Is there anything already which lets you deserialise in your view but allows the original body to be forwarded or aggregated. Of course we could pass around all original strings&#x2F;payloads but that would be complex and error prone.')
