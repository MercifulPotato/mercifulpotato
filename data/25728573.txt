Besides, as you mention if your rhetoric is that &quot;Democrats are stealing the election and want to destroy this country&quot; then ... what do you expect people to do? Sit peacefully at home going &quot;oh shucks, that&#x27;s too bad, what else is on TV?&quot; Never mind that rhetoric on various social media posting has quite literally been saying they will do something like this for <i>years</i>. I used to keep a list of these kind of things; but I got bored of it and I&#x27;m not sure if I still have it (but there are various reddit subs that are a good start).<p>Was I shocked? Yeah, but not because it was surprising. While the specific date and details of the incident are always hard to predict, even a casual observer could see that something like this was bound to happen from miles away. In some ways I&#x27;m relieved because I expected it to be far more deadly (which may still happen).<p>Can we <i>prove</i> that Trump knew what he was inciting this in a court? Probably not.
