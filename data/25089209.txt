The other way of framing it is that individual liberties are more valued than group securities in America. For example the individual liberty to own a firearm is (currently) more valued than the group security of not having firearm related deaths.<p>Group securities require giving up  individual liberties.<p>Hard to say which way is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;winning&quot;. America is divided on which way to move. One side optimizes for life over liberty, the other side optimizes for liberty over life.<p>You can see it happening right now with covid. One side cares more about preserving lives, the other side cares more about preserving liberties.')
