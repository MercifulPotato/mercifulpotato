Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604969782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040868, text='&gt;  I thought program analysis was just the attempts to infer&#x2F;check properties of the program.<p>It means to infer&#x2F;check a property of the program: not of its <i>structure</i> though (such as how many subroutines it has), but of its behaviour.<p>&gt; Nonetheless, the differences matter to people.<p>But when people speak of terminating languages they hint at being interested at far &quot;deeper&quot; properties (not compositional, less local) than those that can be checked with a simple type checker. I am not claiming that languages don&#x27;t matter, at least not here, only that termination doesn&#x27;t help program verification (of the &quot;deep&quot; kind).<p>&gt; The scientific norm is decidedly NOT assuming one way or another prior to evidence&#x2F;proof.<p>If you make a claim that variable X has an effect on observation Y then the scientific norm is that while we don&#x27;t know one way or another, the working hypothesis is that there is no effect, i.e. we give a preference to the assumption of no causal relationship between things. For example, we don&#x27;t know whether or not eating lettuce on sunny Sundays increases baldness in men, but the scientific norm is that the working hypothesis is that it does not.')
