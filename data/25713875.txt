What do you think?<p>You can load another thread by appending #thread_id to the end. For example, here is the graph for this very thread:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trungdq88.github.io&#x2F;hn-big-threads&#x2F;index.html#25713858" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trungdq88.github.io&#x2F;hn-big-threads&#x2F;index.html#257138...</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure why GitHub doesn&#x27;t load the page when the &quot;index.html&quot; part is missing, but I have to go now so I don&#x27;t have time to check it, maybe later.')
