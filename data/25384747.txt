You also don’t appear to own common misspellings, like mogeek.com or moejeek.com or mojeak.com or at least they don’t redirect to the main website.<p>Still, I hope it gains market share and usage and I hope in a few years you may have the funding necessary to rebrand it into a more user friendly name.')
