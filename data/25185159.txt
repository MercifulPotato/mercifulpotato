It is old is not a reason to change a technology, it does not look good in my curriculum should not be a reason to change a technology.<p>COBOL is better designed and less error prone to work with money that many newer languages. I would not code device drivers in COBOL, why should I code financial applications in Rust&#x2F;Kotlin...?<p>&gt; Being “stable” and old, though, can create a paradox — a curse of success. Because when code runs nicely without anyone needing to check up on it, eventually people drift away. They stop looking at it, stop inspecting it. And that means they stop understanding how, precisely, it works.<p>Maybe the problem is not the language but the engineering processes, or lack of, that plague our industry.')
