No additional background info or context.<p>In general the Playboy is not considered &quot;dirty porn&quot; here in Germany which at least in part can be credited to the student movement of the late 60s which among many things addressed sexual self determination. So by some, a woman deciding to be featured in the Playboy or even porn was not seen as degrading but rather the opposite.<p>What might further surprise people from other parts of this planet is that for example at supermarkets and stores, the section featuring magazines has your typical tech, gaming, glamour magazines right next to ones with boobs on the cover for everyone to see. You see this from childhood on, it is not something bad and horrible and you&#x27;re not taught that these women are desperate and couldn&#x27;t find any other way to make money to survive.')
