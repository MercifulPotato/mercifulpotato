On an AVR you you don&#x27;t even have to think about configs or clock trees.<p>I&#x27;m assuming fairly standard microcontrollers, but yes, from my experience as a lead for a proprietary RTOS that I ported to dozens of boards.<p>I&#x27;d say that AVR is the outlier here.  Nearly every more complicated core has clock configuration that&#x27;s finicky and needs to happen to bring the UART up.  Blinking an LED just needs a couple writes to PINCONFIG and GPIO blocks and a busy wait loop that isn&#x27;t optimized out.<p>&gt; UART is one of the best ways to debug and vastly superior to just blinking a led.<p>It is once you&#x27;ve validated that code execution is actually occurring.')
