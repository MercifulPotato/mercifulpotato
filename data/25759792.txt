After reading between the lines it&#x27;s often clear that the developers have not brushed aside a concern or ignored a request. Sometimes they&#x27;ve actually explained their side, but a user has not bothered searching and reading forum history, they&#x27;ve simply sprayed their keyboard into a text box with unreasonable and rude remarks.<p>If I get a terse reply that says &quot;We know this is a pain point, we&#x27;re working on it!&quot; then I take that in good faith and leave it be. But some find any reply an excuse to fuel their ranting.<p>There are definitely some areas, particularly those of principles, where the foundation makes a hard line clear. Even if this goes against what I think is best, I respect their clear message that this is their stance and it&#x27;s staying.<p>Lastly I feel your remark that the team could be nicer is flagrantly unfounded. I have never come across any user being treated unkindly and without the attention one can expect from such a skewed user:resource ratio. I&#x27;m dismayed you&#x27;ve taken something I wrote for good and blemished it with an unfounded reprisal.')
