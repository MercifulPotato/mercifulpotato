Item(by='8fingerlouie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609693810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621397, text='&gt; One more data point about BTRFS, is that it doesn&#x27;t support parity-stripe based redundancy models (raid5&#x2F;6, raidz{1..n}, etc), which makes it less interesting for a lot of people.<p>It does however support raid1 on multiple drives, and raid1c3 and raid1c4 for increased redundancy.<p>With Btrfs raid1, you can pool I.e 4 drives, meaning it will store 2 copies of each file on different devices. Itâ€™s not your traditional raid1. With raid1c3 it will store 3 copies of each file, and raid1c4 stores 4 copies.<p>So while technically not raid5, a 3+ drive Btrfs raid1 pool will provide almost the same redundancy. Think of it more like raid10.')
