I used Linux on desktop&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;server from 1995 onwards. I got a Mac Pro laptop 5 years ago (before the keyboard debacle) because I wanted quality hardware.<p>I&#x27;m running Big Sur and have been since the public beta. I also run iTerm2 and Macports and Firefox and Thunderbird. My editor is Neovim.<p>MacOS is still a BSD Unix underneath. I can&#x27;t think of anything I want to run on Linux that I can&#x27;t run on MacOS.<p>I also get a nice UI, native first class apps for all my various WFH chat&#x2F;video clients, MS Office for work etc.<p>Why exactly would I want to dual boot into Linux? What runs on Linux that doesn&#x27;t on MacOS?')
