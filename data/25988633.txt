Estimates of the externalities caused by a ton of carbon vary, but $150 is a reasonably median estimate.<p>So we can also say that every ICE vehicle receives a $10,000 subsidy for being allowed to pollute without having to pay to clean up that pollution.   What would GM&#x27;s income statement look like if it had that $10,000 per vehicle on it?')
