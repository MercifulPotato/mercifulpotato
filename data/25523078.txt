If you&#x27;re processing thousands of requests per second and each request gets its own thread then you will start to queue on thread spawning. Don&#x27;t forget that each thread gets its own stack taking up megabytes of memory.<p>The async concept has been used for decades in pretty much every product I&#x27;ve worked on professionally, from enterprise raid controllers to network protocol implementations and telephony software. An engineer I respect once told me that really it&#x27;s the only way to write services at scale, and anything else is just a step on the road until you reinvent it. He was probably exaggerating, but it is very important, and nearly ubiquitous.<p>Having used custom frameworks for async code in C and C++, it&#x27;s really refreshing to have it baked into the language and well supported.  It&#x27;s yet another arrow in Rust&#x27;s fantastic quiver.')
