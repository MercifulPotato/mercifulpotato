Code that does a simple &quot;is this pointer value inside the &quot;array_base + size&quot; range&quot; continues to work, because array_base has whatever tag malloc() handed out for that array, and so do the pointer values that the suballocator handed out. I think for MTE to break your code you would have to be doing some pretty weird stuff with pointer arithmetic (beyond just the usual &quot;technically maybe this is undefined behaviour but it works&quot; level stuff).<p>It&#x27;s always the case that some software that does things that are not valid-by-the-language-standard might break if run on a newer version of the OS or a newer system library version (remember the big flap about glibc memcpy() changing its behaviour when called for overlapping regions?). You don&#x27;t want to break lots of software gratuitously, but sometimes the tradeoff is worth making.')
