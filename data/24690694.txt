When a tool like this can actually &quot;compose&quot; a dataflow using cloud native components (lamdbas, messaging, storage) in real time, this has potential to be super powerful.<p>Think of, for example, Apache NiFi [1] but instead of the components being constrained to a single JVM execution, the components are realized as AWS or Azure services.
