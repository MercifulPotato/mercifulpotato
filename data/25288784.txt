Egregious!<p>The whole premise of this post makes no sense. He posted code on his site, that he wants other people to use, but they are forbidden from changing a single line. But he didn&#x27;t want it on github, because that means that Microsoft stole it.<p>It is lame that someone copied it without attribution. But it is a pretty minor transgression in the grand scheme of things. Certainly no financial harm done and nothing has been taken away. You can&#x27;t control bytes once they are out there.

Pick your battles, folks.')
