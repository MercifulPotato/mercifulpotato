I closed mine and I hope everyone else does too.<p>I read a comment on reddit recently that is pertinent. The prey in Africa, ie. wildebeests and buffalo, are extremely powerful. But a handful of lions make them scatter out of fear. But if the prey were more organized, they could trample every single one of those predators to the point where they could kill them off. It&#x27;s the power of organization that helps the prey defeat the predators. This is the exact same thing here. As long as a handful of billionaires tell the retail investor what to do, the billionaires will keep making money off of them.')
