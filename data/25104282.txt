It wouldn’t have the legal status of a person- although it might be one.  So we would probably use it for slave labor, as a pet, probably not as food although there are probably people who would do that too given the opportunity.  Certainly that’s how we treat other nonhuman animals.  Or they might escape and the gene might start to circulate in wild populations.  There’s no good way this pans out.')
