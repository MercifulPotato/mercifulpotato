No disagreement. <i>I&#x27;m</i> not writing anyone off.<p>Both are true at once though. There is such a thing as &quot;cultural centre of gravity.&quot; Ignoring what and why so much of society is outside of that is elitist by definition.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it is good that yahoo comments was (despite being large) was largely invisible and ignored. I&#x27;m just acknowledging that it was. That may be a terrible thing about society, but it still is.<p>HN case in point. If a good sized reddit getting shut down for whatever reason, HN would know about it. Yahoo comments (which was massive) got shut down, and it didn&#x27;t even crossed our consciousness. Bloggers didn&#x27;t blog about it. etc.<p>This is the definition of cultural visibility (relevance is more emotive, but harder to define). We don&#x27;t see much of it. That&#x27;s demographic. If Trump, Taylor Swift &amp; Elon Musk or even people they know were reading Yahoo comments, the cultural cache would be more like Twitter&#x27;s.<p>BTW, the thing I&#x27;m describing exists whether or not it maps to social or political demographics. Yahoo mail was irrelevant long before gmail actually passed them. Cool, in the know people were on gmail. Your auntie was on yahoo or hotmail.')
