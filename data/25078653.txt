Rays typically represent just a single sample, so the more probabilistic the projected image becomes (read &quot;unfocused&quot;), the more samples are required to capture it smoothly. This is compounded by the number of lens elements, the material&#x27;s index of refraction and other complexities. A single element lens adds a minimum of two additional ray&#x2F;surface evaluations for every sample of which their are many per pixel.<p>Also, as a separate matter many implementations optimize around the assumption that the projection from three dimensions to two is done in a uniform, undistorted space. For example the kind of projection that can be fully described by a 4x4 matrix. Changing that assumption loses those optimizations, and generally leads to substance abuse and mayhem.')
