During this past semester, I started keeping a Trello list of potential projects&#x2F;readings I could work on to consolidate things, but it&#x27;s still hard to pick from. The Git internals thing I mentioned was one thing in that list. Since I&#x27;m interested in open source software and the communities that form around projects, another idea I had is developing a &quot;book club&quot; where people meet and read the code and discuss the architecture of popular open source projects. I created a basic site for this a few weeks back, but haven&#x27;t advertised it since it&#x27;s not acceptable for public viewing yet.<p>The main issue for me is that my interests are a bit too broad. Should I learn web dev from my job by day, then try to implement an OS in my free time by night? I know I can&#x27;t learn everything, but yet it feels like there&#x27;s so much I really _do_ need to know to be a competent developer.')
