Google Photos really shines when you give up trying to organize your photos and let the AI take over. If I want to find a photo of my wife from 3 months ago -- I just tap on her face and it shows up, whether she took it or I did or her mom did, without needing to get everyone to collaborate on a photo organization scheme.<p>If I could get that from a self-hosted option, given Google&#x27;s... track record...
