People give free money to charity. Lawyers give free time to various causes. People give free stuff to Goodwill, a for profit company, and to Salvation Army (NPO). The volunteer to clean parks even though they&#x27;re already paying taxes that are suppose to cover that. They give gifts to neighbors. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with giving.<p>My open source is my way of volunteering to make the world a better place. Whether some for profit company uses it is irrelevant to me. Plenty of companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, ...) give back way more than they take and even though I have about 100-160 original repos on github my free output pales in comparison to the amount of stuff I take for free. Nintendo might give less today but lead by example and that might change. Though if it never changes it still doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.')
