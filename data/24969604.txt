We&#x27;ve only had one valid malware report in our 7 years of operation (zip embedded in a gif file, which I now know how to detect so it&#x27;s fixed).<p>There&#x27;s nobody at Google to contact, so I have no idea how to fix it. I used to have a friend at google I could ask for special help from (this made me feel awful), but they no longer work there, so I guess I&#x27;m just screwed until they actually get some sort of official support channel, or somebody at the company that sees this message (hi!) fixes it somehow (thanks!).')
