Is the difference that the messages are private rather than public?<p>We don&#x27;t expect telco&#x27;s to create filters or to independently moderate or to block the content of phone calls or SMS messages and basically legal mechanisms must be used to trigger any action against a subscriber.  I realize that this is largely due to the legal framework of a &quot;common carrier&quot;.<p>What I&#x27;m asking is, what would a &quot;common carrier&quot; look like for platform that had user generated content?  Perhaps it isn&#x27;t possible?')
