They lose money most of the time until that one time where they strike it big. As he describes in &quot;Random Walk in Wallstreet&quot;, he cleaned up his desk on the trading floor on Black Monday when his far OTM puts he bought for <i>pennies on the dollar</i> turned into double digit million figure. This is how he made his FU money and has been the subject of emulation by amateurs and professionals alike.<p>But then you look at people like Jim Chanos who shorted Enron successfully but have not been able to crush Tesla. Had he used options, he would&#x27;ve not only saved a lot of capital, he would still have his skin left in the game.<p>Not sure I undrestand your second question but I assume you mean near strike OTM vs deep OTM.
