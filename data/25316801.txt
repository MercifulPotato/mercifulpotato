Using heap allocated linked lists is rarely the way to go if you&#x27;re not developing for embedded.<p>However, if you&#x27;re developing for embedded you&#x27;ll probably want to be familiar with unsafe either way if you&#x27;re going to use Rust.<p>Regarding self-referencing: Rust encourages you to design differently, which I&#x27;ve found leads to nicer and more thought out designs most of the time. Not all algorithms are possible (or efficient) without it though, and for those you&#x27;ll have to use unsafe if you _really_ have to implement them yourself.')
