By taking a large and diverse group and simplifying it down to a single viewpoint (that&#x27;s not a tautology) then you&#x27;re setting up an out group to be attacked under a single characteristic. An example of this usually goes: &quot;Well, Christians believe the world was created in 7 days, and since we have good evidence the world wasn&#x27;t created in 7 days, Christians must be insane.&quot; You just took 2 billion different people, who are spread across factions with internal debates and arguments, and simplified them into a straw man that at most represents a small percentage of that slice.<p>Sometimes we do want to make broad statements. &quot;Kids like minecraft!&quot; is kind of wrong, but it&#x27;s kind of right and isn&#x27;t necessarily a straw man. It&#x27;d be more accurate to say something like &quot;About 70% of kids report playing minecraft&quot;[1], or we can keep to anecdotal evidence: &quot;all my nieces and nephews play minecraft&quot;. Those statements are generally correct. We still have some data problems - a kid is generally going to give you the answer they think makes you happier, and they&#x27;re probably pretty relaxed about half-truths to annoying uncles&#x2F;aunts asking them about gaming habits.<p>If our goal is to make truthful (as in, accurately representing reality) statements, then we need to be precise and avoid broad strokes when we describe a group.
