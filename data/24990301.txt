The reasonable ones act out against it, as you get with kids in schools who reject representations of authority from a society they are raised to identify as outside of, and they still get punished for disrupting it. The unreasonable ones use it as self-permission to be cruel, abusive, or even less-human to others.<p>The idea that you can be elevated and even purified by your own anger is probably the most seductive idea of all. I&#x27;d posit there is almost no direct brutality committed by anyone who doesn&#x27;t first think of themselves as a victim, and the person they commit it on is a symbol of their perceived bully.')
