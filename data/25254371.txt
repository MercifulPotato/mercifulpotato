All that stuff about &quot;Winners never quit...&quot; I should have quit.<p>I kept it going in part because I had personally backed a large loan, which came due all at once when we finally folded. That was a very, very bad day for me. I managed to salvage it -- part of the reason I was able to last so long was that I&#x27;d had some successes during the dotcom boom. I lost all of that.<p>I failed to fail fast, which is easy to say in retrospect, but I would have been equally tsked at if I&#x27;d let it go without trying harder. Beyond a certain point (a few years) it was clearly just inertia and depression, and bad advice I got from people I brought in to be CEO.<p>We quit for real when our solitary customer dropped us. They never really understood what we were good for -- a story that I never managed to tell really well, despite still believing in it. The world went in exactly the opposite of the direction we aimed at: high quality data with powerful semantic reasoning.<p>I did everything wrong, and was really bad at it, including knowing when to quit. My life is going great now, and I&#x27;m incredibly fortunate, but if I had two pieces of advice it would be &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Listen to your friends who tell you you&#x27;re being stupid.&quot;')
