I&#x27;d have thought code-compactness would still be worth carefully optimising for.<p>Well that&#x27;s partly why I&#x27;m still surprised, but I think for a lot of dynamic languages there&#x27;s such a huge volume of code anyway... that these little &#x27;mov&#x27;s are pretty insignificant.<p>Removing them would have a down-side - extra compilation time.')
