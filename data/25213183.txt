That is a bad system.<p>You cannot completely successfully codify something that is based on the vagaries of wishy-washy language, nor specific legal concepts like the intent of regulations or the context of prior judgements. Therefore, <i>improve the language: don&#x27;t give up!</i><p>Imagine if latitude and longitude weren&#x27;t invented because &quot;sorta over there a few days sail beyond the cape&quot; was too hard to quantify. This is the same ridiculous argument. It just so happens that there are also a vast number of ingratiated rent seeking and powerful people and corporations interested in the status quo: literally <i>all of them</i>.<p>I believe that as engineers and as optimists within the greater human endeavour, over time in all fields we should seek to create means of trust and means of precision: in our measurements, in our communications, in our analyses, in our references and in our collaborations.<p>We don&#x27;t need to fire all the judges. But maybe 90% of the solicitors and standard procedural lawyers, a large part of whose job is explaining to the average citizen what exactly is the done thing in some particular area or how exactly they can expect to be treated the hands of a system that cannot otherwise explain itself.<p>Also, in terms of community governance if it becomes crystal clear that a law is being abused through increased fidelity in the logging of police actions brought about by such a system, then the law can more rapidly be identified and repealed.')
