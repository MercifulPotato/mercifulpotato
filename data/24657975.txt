I&#x27;m a felon - and this makes sense to me. It&#x27;s your business, you should choose who works for you.<p>While it&#x27;s illegal in the US for most places to outright not hire you solely because you&#x27;re a felon, you&#x27;ll have a hard time actually proving that.<p>If you go by the numbers, felons are more likely to break the law again than folks that aren&#x27;t felons. You can argue up and down the _why_ around this, but that&#x27;s the numbers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree with it, but it&#x27;s your right to hold your opinion and run your business in a way you see fit.')
