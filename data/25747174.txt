Anyway, I don&#x27;t know the specifics of how Parler was moderated, so I won&#x27;t comment further on the matter.<p>What I do see is a company whose mission was not explicitly political, but whose clientele was largely composed of the faction who lost the most recent election losing critical infrastructure, to the point that their service is effectively dead, even as myriad other companies move to denounce the faction who lost the most recent election. That is disturbing.')
