Running a bunch of untrusted sandboxed code, retrieved asynchronously from potentially dozens of sources?<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s gonna be slow.<p>Replace all the Rails sites with assembly code running on bare metal if you like, it&#x27;s not going to change anything.<p>Ruby on Rails is plenty fast. You can serve up static pages in a few milliseconds. If they take longer than that, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re doing a bunch of work at the database layer or some other work outside of Ruby.')
