She&#x27;s saying that there is a sharp difference between consensual power and non-consensual power.  The fact that she uses the word &quot;power&quot; to refer to the former and &quot;violence&quot; to refer to the latter is not that interesting.  The distinction itself is what&#x27;s interesting.<p>I agree with her that there&#x27;s a distinction to be made between, on one hand, a group of people agreeing to follow a set of rules to accomplish some goal and, on the other, a slave driver forcing his slaves to accomplish that goal.<p>The idea that there is no real distinction here, that all power is based on coercion, was popular when she wrote the linked essay and it&#x27;s popular today (as evidenced by the replies here).  I used to think that way but I no longer do and, I have to say, it&#x27;s quite a relief.')
