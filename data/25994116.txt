Guilt because I feel I&#x27;m not performing up to expectations, that I&#x27;m doing very little to earn my (very decent) salary. Hopelessness because I fear this feeling will haunt me at any future job and that whatever job I may find the conditions will turn out to be worse than my current one.<p>I work as a technical support manager for a small company. The job is remote and I&#x27;ve been at it for close to 10 years now. I&#x27;m self-taught and was hired as a support representative but quickly took over a lot more responsibilities. My bosses are of the type that is very hands-off and were always very happy with my performance.<p>For many people this would be a dream job. Remote work with good pay with management that is easy to work with and a lot of freedom. But I just can&#x27;t do this anymore. The smallest things irritate me. Completing the simplest tasks feels like a huge chore. Total inability to concentrate and get things done.<p>A year ago I talked to management and we decided to hire another person to take over most of my mundane responsibilities and to move to a more managerial position. In this new position I haven&#x27;t been able to find the motivation to lead and complete any new projects.<p>I continuously think about quitting but fear that this lack of motivation will continue and I&#x27;ll either become jobless or end up doing the same thing at another company with worse conditions and worse pay. I believe I&#x27;m a very capable person but I am a 39 year old true generalist with no college degree or programming projects that I can present in my CV. It will be extremely difficult to get my foot at the door.<p>Looking for advice from people who faced burnout and were able to beat it in whatever way possible. Either managed to reverse the situation and stayed in the same job or you moved to a different job&#x2F;career which now makes you happy.')
