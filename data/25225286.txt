But still faces similar headwinds stagnation in many places and issues unique challenges to being spread out over many islands. Though, I still remain flexible and have my eyes out for others places that could be better in the future.<p>&gt; And what other countries do you think are in better shape than the US?<p>Overall I think SEA is pretty good as far as near future. Not really sure about anywhere else (besides nice island enclaves few on earth can enjoy like caymens, seychelles, etc.). There&#x27;s just a lot of convergence going on between areas globally in all aspects of ones life and I really think that with our current global communications infrastructure being able to enable different forms of organization, there are a lot of existential questions about what things will look like going forward: what most people will accept? what actors will exert sovereignty? how will the most indebted nation&#x2F;city states (and sub jurisdictions and corporates) deal with declining tax revenues&#x2F;cash flows in the face of not just mobile capital, but a mobile workforce?<p>Exciting times!')
