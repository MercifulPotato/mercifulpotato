Local street gangs sets have multiplied with the influx of people (many homeless), drugs, welfare and larger organized crime operations. Also recent policies decriminalized many acts and have led to rampant street crime in areas like SF and LA.<p>CA provides sanctuary status for illegal immigrants, along with driver licenses, free healthcare and other benefits paid for by tax-paying citizens. Traffic is terrible because of a lack of any other alternatives that are routinely defunded, destroyed and dismissed from high-speed rail to bus lines to ridesharing.<p>CA is now worse than before. It&#x27;s also worse than many other places. Just because 1 facet is better than somewhere else doesn&#x27;t impact the objective collective decline. Again, please name 10 things that have gotten better in CA over the last decade if you can.')
