Nassoura said the process starts by the victim calling law enforcement and then, &quot;The officer goes to the victim&#x27;s residence, places it (the sexual assault test) on the front door step, waits in the vehicle. The victim then goes to the front door gets the sample and they begin a zoom video call.&quot; That zoom video call involves a forensic nurse, the detective and a victim advocate. Once the victim&#x27;s statement is taken by the officer, the nurse is the only one that remains on the call. The victim then self-collects the sample under the nurse&#x27;s guidance and direction.<p>And to your point:<p>&gt; Moreover, further research will show you that the startup explicitly encourages survivors to visit a hospital or contact law enforcement if at all possible.<p>The problem is, this startup&#x27;s business model specifically relies on victims not visiting the hospital.<p>&gt; Ask sexual assault survivors what they would like to see instead.<p>They would probably want their evidence to be admitted in court, rather than raise reasonable doubt.')
