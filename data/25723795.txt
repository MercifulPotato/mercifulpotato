Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610333729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719991, text='&gt; If these things were as trivial as you think, then why doesn&#x27;t open source simply patent all the good new ideas now?[...]But this doesn&#x27;t happen. Ask yourself why.<p>Because they didn&#x27;t find the idea first.  I&#x27;m not sure what your argument is here?<p>Lots of patents do go to open source projects.  Is &quot;this&quot; a world where open source finds <i>everything</i> first?  If so I&#x27;m not sure how you got the idea that I was arguing that.<p>&gt; And, if they&#x27;re so non-trivial that open source, or Google, or whomever want them to be free, then the ideas are worth patents.<p>The fact that a patent could be worth money doesn&#x27;t imply that it should be granted.  If I could convince the government to grant me any patent I wanted, I would go patent every word in the dictionary.<p>&gt; You think it takes longer to implement a compression codec than to create it?<p>Most codecs aren&#x27;t made from scratch.  If you got rid of the network effects, there <i>definitely</i> would be &quot;constant new ones, each improving the last one&quot;.<p>In a world where implementations have to be nailed down and then it takes years and years to roll out, then creating a codec takes a very long time.<p>If implementation was as easy as normal software, you&#x27;d see organizations that put out a new codec every couple months, featuring the latest ideas and tweaks.<p>&gt; stuff about compression<p>I&#x27;m talking about the people working on h.265 and AV1.  They&#x27;re already working on codecs, so I know they can work on codecs.  If a bunch of people are useless at working on compression, well that sucks but it&#x27;s a sideline to my argument.')
