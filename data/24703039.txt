In a real economic shortage, prices are supposed to go up. If salaries are not going up, it is not a real shortage.<p>I think there is a shortage, so I&#x27;m proposing increasing salaries. Accounting firms are not competing with tech firms necessarily, they are competing with the market for accountants (lots of accountants go into other fields because they cant find work at a suitable rate.)
