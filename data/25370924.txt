Also, Russia was wining and dining Flynn. Remember the photos of Flynn at the Russian propaganda event? I&#x27;m sure that has nothing to do with Russia, right? No Russian motive there, right? Just, you know, forget about Flynn pleading guilty in court and then acknowledging guilt by accepting the pardon. You forgot to mention those extremely relevant points.')
