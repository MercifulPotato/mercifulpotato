There&#x27;s really no getting around that. And without that, you&#x27;re almost always going to end up with things turning into something along the lines of &quot;complete untestable spaghetti&quot;. Especially when you have junior developers involved. Hooks are no different, nor is the entire Javascript landscape.<p>In general these complaints are getting tiring and often feel like they are coming from folks who don&#x27;t have the appropriate level of experience or knowledge in a particular subject area to be making these generalizations. I don&#x27;t know what your level of competence is, but this line:<p>&gt; Look, I get that Redux was a pain in the ass with all the boilerplate, but how did we throw the baby (unidirectional data flow) out with the bathwater.<p>gives me pause, because Hooks aren&#x27;t meant to replace Redux in any way. There are hooks that maintain state, sure, but generally they&#x27;re meant to replace class component lifecycle functions. Hooks and Redux still coexist quite well.')
