A shade would eliminate temperature fluctuation. Naively I&#x27;d expect it should be practical for a very large, very lightweight telescope mirror to be built in situ in space instead of trying to launch and unfold one built on Earth.<p>I guess the big problem for that right now is that for humans to do the building, it&#x27;d have to be in low orbit, a less-than-ideal environment for a long-lived scientific instrument. (Just kibbitzing, am not a rocket scientist.)')
