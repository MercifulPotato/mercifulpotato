Item(by='mabbo', descendants=None, kids=[25210734], score=None, time=1606320422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208205, text='This isn&#x27;t good science.<p>Caballero went looking for a specific answer- a planet in the right place in the sky, with the right conditions- and found it. Therefore, this is proof the signal came from ET intelligence, right? But in science you should be going the opposite direction- start with the data and see what answer it leads to.<p>What&#x27;s more, there&#x27;s a big region of space the signal could have come from. Saying &quot;any planet in that cone is the answer&quot; isn&#x27;t fair. There&#x27;s just as likely to be thousands or millions more planets with equal properties further away inside the same cone.<p>A more fair experiment would be to say &quot;ignoring the specific direction the &#x27;Wow&#x27; signal came from, predict where it should have come from given the data we have&quot;- and then if you find an answer that aligns with the source of the &#x27;Wow&#x27;, then you&#x27;re onto something.')
