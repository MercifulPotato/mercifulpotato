The contract had run for many years, so could be cancelled any time with one months notice.  The new plan and contract was much better and yet a limitation played out doing this.  Ended up that the systems at the telco was unable to activate the new contract until the old contract had ended.  Whilst a new contract could be physically signed in a shop with a start date of the day of signing, and logged into the system.  The provisioning backed was unable to activate it until the old contract had ceased as you can&#x27;t have two contracts for the same phone number.<p>That I do believe is a case of - whilst some things can run in parallel, others are locked to a single dependant resource.<p>But every rule has an exception, it is with good design that you limit those exceptions impact.')
