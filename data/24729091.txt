I have previously considered using minio (too inflexible wrt to adding more shards &#x2F; replicas), a homebrew system based on something like ScyllaDB (needs code on top to act like a blob store) or S3&#x2F;B2 (too slow and&#x2F;or expensive wrt to transfer costs). Is anyone using this in production and can share a story of how stable and hard to run it is?')
