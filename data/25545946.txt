I want to buy their car because maybe I like the idea of an electric car and they seem to be well reviewed. I go through the configurator, then tick the box next to the option called &quot;Full Self-Driving capability&quot;.<p>In your opinion, in front of the court of law, would you consider that John Smith has purchased a car that has something called &quot;Full Self-Driving Capability&quot;, or not? In front of the same court of law - would you consider that Tesla advertises such a thing when presenting their cars?<p>&gt;&gt;Autonomous features are not called autopilot anywhere, ever.<p>You are absolutely correct, other car companies call this what it is - (adaptive) cruise control. Not autopilot.<p>&gt;&gt;&#x27;Full self driving capability&#x27; is a capability, not a feature that you can turn on<p>Well, but the website itself says that at the moment, as-is(not in the future!) the car will be able to autonomously drive from on-ramp to an off-ramp on the motorway - so.....that sounds like a feature to me? It even has a button for it! What is it about turning it on or off?')
