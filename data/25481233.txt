Besides that, procuring resources with your cloud provider is simply a matter of writing a yaml file. Not to mention the lack of an upfront investments and only paying for your resources you need instead of having hardware that you are spending money on because you have to have enough hardware to handle peak load. You would be amazed at the amount of resources you can buy at the cost of the fully allocated salary of one engineer.<p>And yes you can buy hardware. But can you run a data center in multiple regions? Besides that any cloud  provider  offers more than just a bunch of VMs. AWS alone has 260 services with an entire team of people keeping them patched and optimized. I don’t keep up with Azure as carefully. But this isn’t meant to be an Azure vs AWS comment. I just don’t know Azure.')
