Print media had &quot;journalistic integrity&quot; (i.e. was buddy-buddy with existing institutions) so you never got to hear about it when the police kicked in a black guy&#x27;s skull for no reason or when a construction project turned into a boondoggle handout for someone well connected.  It was also a time with less government.  People didn&#x27;t have to put up with (as much) bureaucratic run around in order to build a deck on their house or to open a business.<p>The reason there&#x27;s no faith in government these days is because there&#x27;s people telling us how that sausage is made and we eat so much of it we&#x27;re sick of it.')
