Item(by='feanaro', descendants=None, kids=[25115849, 25117807], score=None, time=1605554507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115675, text='&gt; I provided a counter-example to demonstrate that your statement was an exaggeration.<p>Which counterexample is that exactly? Your counterexample involving a store is incorrect -- the store&#x27;s email would still be authenticated for a smaller amount of time which would allow your server to verify that it is a valid email that came from the store&#x27;s servers.<p>EDIT: Since you responded with an edit, I suppose I should as well. Btw, you <i>can</i> reply to comments below, but you have to click on the comment&#x27;s permalink&#x2F;timestamp (the thing that says &quot;1 hour ago&quot;) first.<p>I didn&#x27;t see the comment you are referring to because it was a very high up ancestor. I only saw the comment I replied to which doesn&#x27;t mention courts nor third-parties, which is why I asked you for an explanation. Please don&#x27;t jump immediately to the conclusion that I did not read your comment.<p>Regarding the content, hamburglar&#x27;s sibling comment is spot on. Non-repudiability shouldn&#x27;t just be an afterthought. Accidental non-repudiability can have negative consequences itself. For one, relying on the kind of poor man&#x27;s non-repudiability that DKIM gives you leaves powerful central entities with the ability to forge email while convincing almost everyone that it is legitimate.<p>From reading everything that you wrote, I think that your thesis is that <i>email</i>, specifically, ought to be non-repudiable. That might be a worthwhile idea, but it should be presented as such at the forefront. If others agree that this is a valid and useful concept, then a non-repudiability mechanism could be added to email explicitly, just as DKIM was added. But don&#x27;t use DKIM for this, since it is a poor substitute.')
