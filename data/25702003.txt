Most times conflict then was not resolved in a court or kept on an Internet forum but through physical means, and when war or fighting is the conflict resolution method you learn to avoid it as the costs are so much greater. Today, so much of our society sits behind a keyboard and spews vitriol and hatred just to see what happens, and then polarizes people behind false walls and narratives, destroying what people strived so hard to put together over 200 years ago.<p>Sadly in the US, I think the lack of studying history for what it was and the reasons the founders fought for the laws and protections we have has doomed us to repeat so many of the same mistakes of times prior.
