Static typing really shines on larger projects with many developers. Starting out it&#x27;s probably easier to work on a smaller team on projects that members talk about rather than have types&#x2F;docs for working independently.<p>But definitely if starting on the JS route, get to TS whenever possible as there are many larger team&#x2F;project opportunities.')
