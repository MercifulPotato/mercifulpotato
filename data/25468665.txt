To top that off, &quot;adtech&quot; is inaccurate, ineffective, and overpriced. Just think about all of the lies people put into their profiles, and all the ad blockers people have installed.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t accept that &quot;adtech&quot; is cheaper and more effective on face value, and we certainly shouldn&#x27;t accept that the only alternative is to do mass &quot;brute force advertising.&quot;<p>e.g. look at what Tesla has done without spending any money on ads, they used Musk&#x27;s twitter reputation to amasse great publicity. This method, among others thanks to the open internet, is available to all creative marketers.')
