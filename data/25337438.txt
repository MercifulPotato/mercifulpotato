Every time the user puts some input into a text box the CAS runs. Depending on the input it may run as many as ~40k lines of code. There are no coherent lines upon which to split the CAS as far as anyone developing it can tell.<p>The CAS must run on the browser both to deliver on real time performance requirements and to keep server costs manageable (certain inputs will get even high end CPUs humming).<p>If breaking this SPA up is possible, it&#x27;s not apparent even to engineers with &gt;10 years of experience developing highly complex applications.<p>Other similarly complex applications run on the web, even if it&#x27;s unusual.')
