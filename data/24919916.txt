If at any point a carbon-emitting energy source is involved, there&#x27;s no way that the system is going to be absorbing as much carbon from the air as was emitted for the same amount of energy.<p>If we&#x27;re going to flatten the peaks of power availability with anything, it should probably be novel energy storage techniques so that the carbon that is output is not wasted, so the energy is actually used eventually for something productive.<p>We already have a carbon removal system that is viciously efficient and solar powered: it&#x27;s called a plant.')
