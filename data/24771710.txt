If you flip a coin and copy <i>that</i> bit, you will observe that those copies do not behave independently either. If you want independent bits, flip two coins.<p>Similarly, &quot;erasing&quot; a (qu)bit technically consists of performing a exchange operation between it and a known-zero bit. In typical electronic computers, this would generally involve diffusion-like exchanges between the voltage level in a memory capacitor (such as a FET gate) and that on the GND rail, which has a much greater effective number of bits and therefore will stay mostly zero, but eventually requires a thermodynamic expenditure of known-valued bits (aka negentropy) from some external source to maintain its voltage level &#x2F; bit zeroness. (This is rather simplified; there&#x27;s lots of other sources of known-zero and known-one bits getting depleted and replenished, and the exact accounting depends on how you interpret various physical states information-theoretically.)')
