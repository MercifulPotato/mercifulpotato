It’s helped me improve my flexibility, muscle tone, and my awareness of my body. What I mean by that last point is that I am more immediately aware when I experience back issues, now, and I also have a clearer sense of how to move and stretch my body to fix those issues before they become worse.<p>Yoga is great, and really doesn’t require any special equipment. You can try out a video and get pretty far without needing to buy mats, blocks, straps, Lululemon clothes, etc.')
