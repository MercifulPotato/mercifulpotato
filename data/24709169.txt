I own a pair of them. While they&#x27;re good boots for the price they do not deserve an A- score. They are not BIFL. The soles are glued making them not resoleable. The sole on one of mine has started coming unglued too.<p>The same can be said for the Victorinox Fibrox knife that has an A+ rating. I also have one of those. It&#x27;s a great knife for its low price but it does not deserve an A+ since it isn&#x27;t full tang and is very thin and easy to damage.<p>This is a common issue with &quot;BIFL&quot; discussions. People overrate something because they don&#x27;t understand that parts will wear out from use, something isn&#x27;t repairable, or they don&#x27;t have experience with a higher quality item.<p>Do you have any thoughts for dealing with this issue?')
