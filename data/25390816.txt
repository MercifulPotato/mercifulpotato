E.g., doom-emacs is a well-known emacs distribution; there nothing weird if 18% of <i>survey respondents</i> use it.<p>Whether the survey respondents are a representative sample of the general emacs population is a different question, and one which is very hard to answer given that we have no other data about people&#x27;s preferences in emacs.  Hopefully, the survey will become more popular with time, so we&#x27;ll see results approaching the &quot;true&quot; values.')
