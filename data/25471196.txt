At first it was a google spreadsheet where people left a blurb about their situation, along with their Venmo&#x2F;Cashapp&#x2F;Paypal links. The spreadsheet ballooned to over 1000 people in a few days. We then created this site, and more than have 7000 people signed up to date.<p>It&#x27;s a very simple site, essentially a list of people&#x27;s stories and payment links. There&#x27;s no qualification to sign up, so there may be some grifters. Since the site is intended for small donations ($5-10), we figured if someone is signing up, they need the money even if they&#x27;re not in a dire situation.<p>The &#x27;Resources&#x27; page is a nod to Hackernews itself, and was a fun challenge to build, though sparsely used.<p>We&#x27;ve since (nearly) automated a way for different communities to clone their own site on our subdomains (i.e your-community.leveler.info). If you&#x27;re interested in that, sign up or feel free to shoot me a message at sambyoung@gmail.com.<p>Happy to answer any questions - there was a lot of traction in the early weeks of Covid and it was an exciting thing to work on.<p>P.S You may disagree with the messaging on the site. For my own end, I just wanted to help people in need.')
