If so, then why do you hope to be wrong about it eventually disappearing?<p><i>&gt; the past dozen years or so of the information age have made it abundantly clear that simply having the truth on your side and making a rational case for it is not even remotely sufficient to counter the spread of misinformation.</i><p>Even if I agreed with this—which I don&#x27;t—the answer to this hypothetical reality is <i>definitely</i> not to start removing <i>actual</i> information.[1]<p>For instance, having tweets like that exist would be good counterevidence to all to apologia of certain bad actors that goes around, even here in HN.<p><i>&gt; Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure that free speech as a concept will be able to survive the information age</i><p>Usually the first ones silenced are the ones promoting censorship. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d usually say anyway, but it is pointless; I would be silenced eventually too and I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to be silenced, even if it happens to me after it does to the ones who are &quot;inadvertently&quot; asking to be silenced.<p><i>&gt; It seems as though any society holding it sacrosanct might be doomed to collapse from divisive pressure both internal and external.</i><p>Do you have historical evidence to back up this claim?<p>All in all, my hope is that we find easier, better ways for people to fact check, instead of removing data wholesale. Language is the basis of civilization, so restricting communication is not the way to go. Improving it is the way to move forward; it has always been so, I think.<p>[1]: And to note, I&#x27;m not saying that what was said in that tweeted article wasn&#x27;t an awful lie. The information is not the content, the information is the fact that it was said at all.')
