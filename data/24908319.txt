This is a question that I have been pondering for a while.  What made the Amiga &#x2F; ST &#x2F; Archimidies special was that all that computing horse power, for the era, was dedicated to a single &#x27;user&#x27; task. Today we have powerful hardware that doesn&#x27;t seem to live up to its potential. I have no data but one wonders how many cache misses of a foreground application are the result of a background application invalidating cache lines?  No, I have not totally convinced myself of the argument, but I do think, that when we look back at the golden age of the home computere, we should at least recognize that the operating systems in play were not the multi-user, multi-tasking leviathans of today; it was a simpler time and perhaps we could do with a little more simplicity in our lives.')
