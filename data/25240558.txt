The Bengal famine was caused by factors beyond British control, including the Japanese invasion of Burma and multiple natural disasters in Bengal which had a devastating effect on rice imports and grain production. The British failed to completely alleviate the famine, yes, but they did alleviate it partially by sending over 100,000 tons of grain to aid the region, and they would have sent more if shipping had been available (there was the small matter of a gigantic global war going on).<p>And of course if it wasn&#x27;t for the British then Bengal would have eventually been conquered by the Japanese, who had far worse plans for the area than anything the British managed.<p>Comparing Britain&#x27;s failures in Bengal to Stalin&#x27;s genocide is offensive, revisionist garbage.')
