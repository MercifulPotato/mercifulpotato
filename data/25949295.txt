Just a couple nitpicks (on Linux Chromium):<p>* Hovering over either button on the top right opens a menu. I&#x27;m pretty sure only the far right is supposed to.<p>* Needs an option to center the content for wide screens.<p>Have you considered adding support for loading files from the user&#x27;s Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox&#x2F;etc? It seems like many apps would benefit from this. I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of writing a JS lib to provide a common interface to all the big ones, kind of like how rclone does for the command line but for frontend apps.')
