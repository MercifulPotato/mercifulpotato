To me it references another concept in the Bible where works alone do not guarantee salvation, but only the blood of Christ. The distinction Paul was making here to the Hebrews was that the old testament rituals weren&#x27;t enough for salvation. James speaks more generally to all new testament Christians and explains that once you have living faith, the works will emerge naturally.')
