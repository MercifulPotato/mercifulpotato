And yes, the team was quite tight and focused, with excellent &quot;high&quot; quality communication (in that we smoked lots of weed together). More developers and artists and designers came in towards the end, after EA bought Maxis, but the original version had a much smaller team than any of the subsequent version.<p>It pains me to recall how crude and primitive it was even a year and a half before the release (check out the awful flamingo and telephone and fish tank graphics, not to mention the characters and animations themselves, like pot-bellied Archie Bunker always holding a cigar in his hand, and the naughty scenario description text @ 40:44) -- a whole lot of content and user interface and tuning was done at the very last moment:<p>The Sims Steering Committee - June 4 1998.

Before it was tuned, The Sims wasn&#x27;t missing any structure or content, but it just wasn&#x27;t balanced yet. But it&#x27;s OK, because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work!<p>&gt;In justifying their approach to The Sims, Maxis had to explain to EA that SimCity 2000 was not fun until 6 weeks before it shipped. But EA was not comfortable with that approach, which went against every rule in their play book. It required Will Wright&#x27;s tremendous stamina to convince EA not to cancel The Sims, because according to EA&#x27;s formula, it would never work.<p>&gt;If a game isn&#x27;t tuned, it&#x27;s a drag, and you can&#x27;t stand to play it for an hour. The Sims and SimCity were &quot;designed by accretion&quot;: incrementally assembled together out of &quot;a mass of separate components&quot;, like a planet forming out of a cloud of dust orbiting around star. They had to reach critical mass first, before they could even start down the road towards &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot;, like life finally taking hold on the planet surface. Even then, they weren&#x27;t fun until they were carefully tuned just before they shipped, like the renaissance of civilization suddenly developing science and technology. Before it was properly tuned, The Sims was called &quot;the toilet game&quot;, for the obvious reason that there wasn&#x27;t much else to do!')
