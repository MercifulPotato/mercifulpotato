That language refers to dollars being currency  “courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for any monetary debt”.<p>On the Parker Lewis article, it’s cute but contrived. A straw man. Bitcoin is backed by nothing. U.S. dollars are, similarly, backed by nothing. Saying they’re suspended by shared perceptions is technically true, but implicitly re-defines backing to a meaningless word.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Legal_tender" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Legal_tender</a>')
