Item(by='alextheparrot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601748887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24673106, text='&gt; Risk-related barriers (fear of liability and negative public perceptions) prevent landowners from beginning the burn planning process. Both resource-related barriers (limited funding, crew availability and experience) and regulations-related barriers (poor weather conditions for burning and environmental regulations) prevent landowners from conducting burns, creating a gap between planning and implementation [0]<p>My opinion is that this legislation does not go far enough to address the chronic disregard of action to inhibit these cataclysmic events.  I would much rather have the government over-correct and over-allocate instead of taking an incremental approach on this.  I do not want to wake up to months of awful quality air or see the forests that I have come to love so much be scorched more than is necessary.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41893-019-0451-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41893-019-0451-7</a>')
