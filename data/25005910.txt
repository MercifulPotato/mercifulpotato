You probably shouldn&#x27;t have built your project&#x27;s future on the assumption that it&#x27;s always available.<p>Ideally you should have your own testing infrastructure in scripts or test frameworks. And your travis file shouldn&#x27;t do much more than installing dependencies and running the stuff that&#x27;s under your control. Put all the logic into the stuff you can control - and next time you find out that your favorite CI provider is no longer nice to you you simply use another one, the migration should not take more than a few minutes.')
