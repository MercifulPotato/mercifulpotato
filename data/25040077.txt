C3 shows up nowhere in the formula, so there&#x27;s no non-volatile way to implement it.<p>The first argument to INDEX is a &quot;sqref&quot; (cell, range, or set of ranges) and INDEX will error if you try to reference a cell outside of the sqref, so use of INDEX doesn&#x27;t break the obvious dependency structure')
