I don&#x27;t mind having a special self-curated image where my in-scope browsing is tracked and analyzed. Now, I just have a separate browser (Chrome) for this - because it&#x27;s more straightforward and less error-prone.<p>Or a sandbox development &amp; local resource management profile where nothing but localhost and LAN addresses are allowed. And then block such access for any other profile - for security reasons.<p>Or allow, let&#x27;s say, Grammarly extension on a few selected websites (like HN), where all I write is public and I would benefit from machines aiding my writing without any privacy concerts, but don&#x27;t give it any chance to see my private correspondence.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not possible with containers, and profiles are quite cumbersome.')
