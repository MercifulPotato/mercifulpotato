You might be dancing close to the edge by using Facebook&#x27;s authorization to test their websites in an unauthorized way, which brings you back under the aegis of CFAA, but that seems a little far-fetched.<p>But whether it&#x27;s legal or not, it won&#x27;t work. Facebook will likely never do business with you again, but they&#x27;ll watch your Twitter account for the free bugs you&#x27;re promising to give them.')
