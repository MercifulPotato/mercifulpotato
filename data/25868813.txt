But seeing the numbers the Taycan puts down show it isn&#x27;t a humongous difference like in an ICE. Probably not worth the cost&#x2F;complexity as we see the Lucid Air can do qtr mile times in less than 10 seconds and soon upcoming Plaid Model S will have a possible quarter mile time of under 9 seconds and 200mph top speed.')
