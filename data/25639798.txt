How can this ever result in great things for the employee side?<p>Unless you&#x27;re the 1% with your pick of FAANG jobs and high 6-figure salaries, in which case you&#x27;re the exception everyone else should ignore because we aren&#x27;t you and a system where only the 1% can get desirable working conditions for most of their life, and everyone else deserves to suffer for not being good enough, is a bad system.')
