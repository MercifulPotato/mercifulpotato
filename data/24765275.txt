Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602595119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765192, text='I&#x27;m biased because I studied Poli Sci, I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m a pretty successful software architect and senior developer, and for a long time I had a big chip on my shoulder because I didn&#x27;t study Comp Sci (and barely graduated college at all if we&#x27;re being honest).<p>But your story shows the gulf that exists between Computer Science and software development. You needed to actually use a piece of software constrained by business requirements (not spinning up 250 servers), and when it didn&#x27;t do what you needed it to, you changed it. The fact that you failed a data structures class didn&#x27;t prevent you from refactoring and improving the code. The fact that that professor wrote code that performs poorly on good hardware doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that there was probably some novel CS implementation in there somewhere.<p>I know in the past I&#x27;ve gotten caught up on CS profs having terrible websites or programmers not understanding the intricacies of bubble sorting but I think it helps to keep in mind that they are two different disciplines that inform each other, and the gap is seeming to get wider over time.')
