Combine this with US investment market performance e.g. the S&amp;P500 over the last decade, and it is straightforward how someone with a good income might arrive at $2.5M in a relatively small number of years starting from zero.<p>Americans have notoriously poor investment&#x2F;saving habits, which obscures the fact that it is remarkably easy to accumulate liquid wealth in the US if you <i>are</i> a diligent saver. The median US household has enough investable income, after all ordinary life expenses, to accumulate a couple million dollars over a typical career. High earners can easily save 10x that amount.')
