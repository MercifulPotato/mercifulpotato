I don&#x27;t expect to become the next Zuckerberg and I think that&#x27;s the equivalent of telling kids they can make it in professional sports. I&#x27;m just content making a comfortable living building systems for someone else.<p>I think I could have made roughly as good of a living being a plumber, an electrician, or a welder! A good electrician around here makes 150k a year. I think the best career advice I heard was pick something you can stand doing and work as hard as you can at it, try and be as good as you can, not measured against someone else but for your self. If you pick a career where expertise matters and it has demand and you work harder and smarter than other people you will do fine.')
