Which sort of matches my experience.<p>I think it&#x27;s misleading to just look at Canon SLRs. SLRs are dying. Looking at the most modern mounts from all companies:<p>* Canon 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 R-mount: $200<p>* Fuji 35mm f&#x2F;2: $200<p>* Nikon 50mm $-mount f&#x2F;1.8: on sale for $500 (normally $600)<p>* Olympus 25mm f&#x2F;1.8: $300<p>* Panasonic 25mm f&#x2F;1.8 MFT: On sale for $150 (normally $250)<p>* Panasonic 50mm f&#x2F;1.4 L-mount: $2300 (although Sigma makes one for just $430).<p>* Sony 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 E-mount: $250<p>I&#x27;ve adjusted to 50mm for crop factor.<p>I think the Canon f&#x2F;1.8 50mm is sort of an outlier for low-cost in 2020. On the whole, prices have been creeping up (as has sharpness, AF speed, flare control, etc.). I feel like lenses are as expensive as they&#x27;ve been in decades.')
