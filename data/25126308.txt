X looked like ass. QT looked less like ass but had totally overloaded UIs. The differences were even starker on lower-res displays.<p>Also back then browser apps were a novelty instead of how most people interact with computers most of the time, and thus anything that wasn&#x27;t using a native toolkit stood out pretty bad. A few apps like MP3 players used it for their advantage, but I remember those as being mostly a confusing mess.<p>More importantly, font rendering has improved incredibly and most rendering looks the same across toolkits in the same desktop environment. Back then some toolkits supported antialiasing, some did not, some had godawful rendering that looked like crap, some couldn&#x27;t render certain symbols correctly, some didn&#x27;t have good hinting for LCDs, etc.<p>The reality is that very slowly most UI paradigms have converged into a few well-established patterns (no more multiple-window apps, no more focus-follows-mouse, no more deep right-clicked context menus, etc). So now the styling differences are more apparent but most UIs are functionally the same nowadays.\nThe same could not be said 15 years.<p>We have come a long way; despite the different looks, the feel is much more uniform, and there&#x27;s a better understanding of what makes for good UIs.<p>As I write this, I&#x27;m frankly quite thankful that we have reached this state of good-enoughness. Spending hours looking into GTK themes and different fonts was fun, but in a frustrating way in which no exact font-icon-theme combination was entirely satisfactory.')
