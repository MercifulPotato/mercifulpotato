Here&#x27;s the advice and tips that resonated with the group:<p>- Don&#x27;t start by asking &quot;Will you be my mentor?&quot; or &quot;Can you review my skills and give me feedback?&quot; It&#x27;s a big investment of time and effort, if they don&#x27;t know you.<p>- Instead, ask one or two thoughtful questions related to their expertise. Many people are happy to help, especially if it only takes 10 minutes of their time.<p>- If they don&#x27;t respond, don&#x27;t let that discourage you. Sometimes it&#x27;s a numbers game: reach out to enough people and you&#x27;ll find a connection.<p>- How to reach out the first time? There&#x27;s a lot of ways you can try. Comment on an article they wrote, or email them about it. Engage them on a thread here on HN. Reply to them on Twitter. Attend an online event where people are speaking about the topics you&#x27;re interested in.<p>- Most importantly, <i>follow up</i>. After they respond or you get to talk to them, send a thank-you summarizing what you learned and what was most helpful for you.<p>- Better yet, send another thank-you a month later with how their advice helped you: what did you do with it, and what was the result? People love to hear how their advice helped. You&#x27;ll stand out from the crowd and they&#x27;re more likely to continue engaging with you... and that&#x27;s how the longer-term relationship can get started.<p>If you find this advice helpful - I&#x27;d love for you to reply here and let me know what worked for you!')
