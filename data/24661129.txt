They&#x27;re my go-to for 90% of just holding something in place for a moment (e.g. when drilling a hole with two pieces aligned).<p>You want a good pair of parallel clamps or pipe clamps too, for when gluing stuff, which can hold something precisely for a long time with a lot of pressure, but most of the time, you want something fast.<p>I also recommend a few clutch-style bar clamps, since a lot of time, you&#x27;re reaching over something.')
