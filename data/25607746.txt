With their common enemy being the Chinese government.<p>Steve Bannon opposes China because he believes in a cyclical view of history, and the next cycle, the &quot;fourth turning&quot;, is likely to feature a war with the Middle East and&#x2F;or China.<p>Guo Wengui opposes China because he thinks they will kill him for corruption.  To be fair, you don&#x27;t get as successful as he did in a corrupt environment without being corrupt yourself, so China probably has reason to kill him.
