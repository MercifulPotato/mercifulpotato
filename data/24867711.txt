Ideally on an encrypted device which will keep&#x2F;maintain the indexing.<p>Shifting the burden of indexing e-mail (and decrypting&#x2F;encrypting the at rest) on the client willing to achieve this?<p>Edit:<p>The webmail&#x2F;imap&#x2F;pop provider would only have to receive an e-mail and use a client provide public key to encrypt the mail and let it rest.<p>The webmail client could (in browser) or through their app do the decryption&#x2F;indexing locally. Could be done with an extension.')
