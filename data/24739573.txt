Prior to that I designed at the TTL level. I&#x27;d spend months working on some project, thinking in terms of logic an timing, and eventually we&#x27;d have boards made. We&#x27;d stuff a few prototypes and set them up on the lab bench to commence debugging.<p>Every time at this phase I&#x27;d suffer the existential horror the first time put an oscilloscope to the circuit -- the clock wasn&#x27;t square! Signals would ring, and other signals which hadn&#x27;t transitioned would sometimes bounce a bit. Setup and hold times could be pretty well estimated, but it was still an estimate. Then there were phantoms that might appear on the scope or real issues that would not show up on the scope because the probe lead was enough to make what was measured not the same as what was actually going on.')
