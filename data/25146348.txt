At most you&#x27;ll have two in the same part of the sky.<p>The earth&#x27;s surface area is about 200 million square miles.  If you have 20 thousand satellites, that gives you ballpark 100x100 miles per satellite.  Roughly 100 miles of separation, 350 miles of height, very easy to isolate just one.<p>With this many satellites, if you had a ground station every 300 miles, it would have to connect to about 10 satellites.  It would need 200Gbps of fiber, which isn&#x27;t hard to do.  You&#x27;d be using less than 25 terabits per second across the entire continental US.  That&#x27;s less than a single undersea cable.  No colossal bandwidth necessary, even at unreasonable numbers of satellites.')
