If the society does decide to move to this system, then it will be a mix of remote and local studies. I have mentioned this somewhere else on this platform that the model of Open University is what is both achievable and sustainable. I have some experience working with Open University of the state of Maharashtra(MOU) in India. Their model of remote education has been working for decades now. The way the MOU works is by setting all the policies, courses(and content), syllabus, exams etc but delegates the delivery to its local chapters and&#x2F;or franchisees. Students can visit the local chapter&#x2F;franchisee for meeting with local instructors and or other students, if required or if they want.')
