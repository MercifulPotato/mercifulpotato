Why should it generate shocky torque that can damage the rubber grommets?<p>This was not the generator speeding up beyond its tolerances. From what I understood from this article, it sped up slightly (still safely within its tolerances), but the difference in frequency made it out-of-phase with the power grid. Once it was connected, the misaligned electromagnetic field instantly tried to align the shaft (and match its rotation speed); that&#x27;s where the sudden torque came from.<p>(This Wikipedia article has a description of the procedure using an older instrument: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Synchroscope#Process_of_Synchronization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Synchroscope#Process_of_Synchr...</a>)')
