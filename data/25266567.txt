Solve protein folding.  We just &quot;solved&quot; that, though for what I have in mind, we need more.  We need to be able to, from a bacteria&#x27;s genome, determine enough of the expressed proteins to find what that bacteria is vulnerable to.<p>Then, last step:  Given a bacteria with a particular DNA, from the proteins, find an antibiotic that will kill it.<p>My vision is for doctors&#x27; offices to be able to take a sample, somewhere local be able to do the DNA sequencing, and if there&#x27;s no known effective antibiotic for it, send the sequence data to a supercomputer at CDC that solves the protein folding problem, and from there derives a new antibiotic that will be effective at killing that bacteria.  I&#x27;d like the whole process to take no more than hours.  Even better if there&#x27;s somewhere local to the patient that can take the CDC&#x27;s output and synthesize some of the new antibiotic.  (And, of course, the new result goes into the library of known solutions to known bacteria.)')
