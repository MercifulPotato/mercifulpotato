For a start, the poll question is extremely broad, I doubt anyone believes there was “zero” fraud. Secondly, this is a complex issue, with many possible definitions and magnitudes of fraud, you can’t neatly square it away as “a clear lie.”<p>The answer selected by 81% was &quot;Enough to influence the outcome&quot;. That is not broad, and the answer avoided was &quot;Not enough to influence the outcome&quot;, which would encompass potentially thousands of cases of fraud.<p>It&#x27;s entirely within the scope of &quot;clear lie&quot;.<p>&gt; Thirdly, as I said, the election was notably unusual and sketchy, so expecting that everyone should agree as if it’s a simple, clear-as-day matter is ridiculous.<p>And as I said, it wasn&#x27;t, and the onus is on you to provide any support for your assertion.<p>I&#x27;m not expecting everyone to agree, I&#x27;m saying media should not care if everyone agrees and report the facts regardless of hurt feelings and stop catering to audiences.')
