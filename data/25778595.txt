Data is effectively state.<p>As application engineers build increasingly &quot;stateless&quot; code (e.g. pure functions, serverless deployments, etc), that state gets pushed elsewhere. Someone has to manage the queues, file versions&#x2F;locations, logs, databases, configurations and so on. That is all &quot;data&quot;.<p>State management is a tricky problem even in a single-threaded application. It&#x27;s doubly so in distributed systems, where state can be inconsistent between all the moving pieces. This is the source of endless data integrity issues. I think data engineering is a great way to get some exposure to all of this.')
