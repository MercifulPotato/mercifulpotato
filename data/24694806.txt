Types are erased at runtime. They don&#x27;t exist in the bytecode.<p>I work with bytecode on a daily basis (I develop a commercial Java obfuscator) and this is untrue. You may be thinking of <i>generic</i> type parameter erasure, but even then special interface methods are generated by the compiler so that no lowering to java&#x2F;lang&#x2F;Object happens too soon.<p>In non-generic code, the types remain and are strongly enforced. Methods have descriptors that restrict parameters to certain types (you can get a VerifyError upon loading the class if you&#x27;ve generated code with a type confusion), there is a &#x27;checkcast&#x27; instruction to ensure that a stack values is a certain type, and a ClassCastException is thrown if a cast is impossible.')
