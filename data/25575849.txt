I also know that women&#x27;s happiness has only declined over the past several decades despite what we are told are great strides towards women&#x27;s liberties and opportunities. The women around me are under incredible stress due to the opposing pressures of a society that wants them to work and &quot;be strong&quot; and their own biological clock telling them to reproduce before it&#x27;s too late. Just look at the statistics on anti-depressant and other drug use amongst women. You&#x27;d have to be crazy to think this is healthy.<p>You cry misogyny but it&#x27;s you who is killing them. This isn&#x27;t what women want. They don&#x27;t want to go to work. Who the hell would?')
