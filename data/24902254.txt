Also, most residential real estate in developed countries is owned by boomers, and the oldest boomers (right now, this year, in 2020) are entering their final years (age 75). I think even within 5 years most mid-tier cities in the developed world that aren&#x27;t hopelessly supply-constrained will see huge drops in residential home prices.')
