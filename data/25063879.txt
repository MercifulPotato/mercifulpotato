Maybe it&#x27;s just because I have few photos<p>I use it all the time.<p>I wanted to recommend to a friend a restaurant I&#x27;d visited in San Diego, I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of it but I knew I&#x27;d taken a picture of the food there.<p>&quot;Food San Diego&quot; and all my food pictures from my trip to San Diego pop up. Tap more info, boom, map appears with the restaurant name on it.<p>If I wanted to remember what year I went to San Diego, well, I&#x27;d either search in Google Photos, or in my timeline on Google Maps. (which is another way to find the name of the restaurant!)')
