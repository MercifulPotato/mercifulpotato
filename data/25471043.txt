And as they do, it&#x27;s helpful to evolve your perspective towards them alongside it.<p>Mobile phones started off as simply ways to call people. Are they not much more than that now? Would approaching them with only their original perspective be as helpful today?<p>No. The perspective has completely changed. Now, the more accurate one would be to approach them as full-blown computers.<p>&gt; <i>HTML is a single-root hierarchy whose only primary job is to display text and maybe some images. That&#x27;s it and it pretty much sucks even at this job.</i><p>While HTML and CSS started in the ways that you&#x27;ve described. That&#x27;s not what they are for now.<p>&gt; <i>Saying that CSS and HTML are meant to be used together to construct and architect pages is some serious re-writing of history and evolution of CSS and some impressive mental gymnastics.</i><p>I&#x27;m not <i>rewriting</i> history. I&#x27;m re-framing the CURRENT perspective of these technologies, in a way that is much more helpful. What use does framing HTML and CSS from the perspective of their origins have?<p>How does this help you create with it today?<p>With modern considerations that are more in the realm of architectural thinking than they were before?')
