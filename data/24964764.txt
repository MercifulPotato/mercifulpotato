The moment you have to write an algebraic proof where variables are multiplied together you&#x27;re in the realm of nonlinear arithmetic which is undecidable for example, and writing proofs is hard.<p>Mainstream languages contain the proof complexity by limiting what you can express e.g. it&#x27;s trivial for the computer to prove &quot;String = String&quot; and &quot;Dictionary = HashTable&quot; as part of type checking.')
