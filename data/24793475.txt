It means today, both a robot as before, and also, a person who is unwilling or unable to have a normal conversation. Real people are &#x27;bots&#x27; too today, when they don&#x27;t actually talk to other people but only parrot the same points repeatedly. They may as well be robots as far as we can tell from their text online.<p>&gt; 10 people accused of being bots because the accuser can&#x27;t cope with people who disagree with them.<p>If those 10 people aren&#x27;t really talking, though, then I would consider them bots too. If they are stating one point, over and over, and refusing to listen to others or change their minds about anything, then...they&#x27;re bots.')
