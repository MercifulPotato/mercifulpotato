The SNES was sold as a specific unit with specific licensed cartridges, and has a well known set of expansion chops shipped in cartridges.  I think it&#x27;s pretty well understood that because of this when someone says &quot;on the SNES&quot; they mean using the existing hardware, possibly plus existing chips shipped at the time.  The idea conveyed is that this could have been done at the time if only the expertise and effort were put into it.<p>Sort of like the Commodore demo scene.  What they can accomplish with the original hardware is amazing.  If they were relying on additional hardware to do so, it&#x27;s less interesting (but may still be interesting, and an accomplishment, as this is).<p>A more accurate title based on how people might think of this might be &quot;SuperRT â€“ Hacking SNES hardware to support realtime raytracing&quot; (and even then you&#x27;re going to get people assuming it&#x27;s all original hardware).')
