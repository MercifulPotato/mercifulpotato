It&#x27;s a standard instruction set.<p>Can you create a single build for all ARM chips for the same OS? If not, its all the same. At work we&#x27;re using binaries built for XP that work without modification on W10. No doubt, its a testament to the massive backwards compat. effort by MS, but also from Intel. This is a massive, massive benefit to actual customers who just want to keep running software that they purchased&#x2F;developed&#x2F;commissioned on the replacement hardware when their current hardware fails. ARM&#x2F;M1 brings a lot of benefits too, but as always, each person has to decide what they&#x27;re willing to give up.<p>&gt;The M1 has been out for a month and we already have hundreds&#x2F;thousands of natively compiled binariesâ€”and Windows and Linux are up and running.<p>Assuming the vendor is still in business, you have to rely on the good faith of the vendor to gift you the new version for free.<p>The OP raises very valid points, I don&#x27;t know what is &#x27;utter nonsense&#x27; about it. It&#x27;s only tech, not a tribal war :)')
