It has been nothing but videos I&#x27;ve already watched (about 90% of what I saw came from my playlists and subscriptions) and videos that have nothing to do with what I&#x27;m watching right now.<p>So I did the following:<p>- installed a plugin that redirects me from Home to Subscribtins page, effectively disabling the Home page completely<p>- deleted all history from YouTube<p>- disabled all possible tracking and data collection<p>The recommened videos on the left of the video player are a lot better as a result. It sucks that these mostly focus on the author of the video but scrolling down usually reveals new content. It&#x27;s not as good as what it used to be in the late 2000s but it&#x27;s far better than the default settings.')
