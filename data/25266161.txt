But don&#x27;t expect this to be cheap in the short run. In the long run it will be cheap, because the alternative is a disaster.<p>Seymour Papert&#x27;s position was: we need children to spend time with computers, and this is going to be dirt cheap.<p>The whole debate was not whether or not children need to be exposed to computers, but whether it will be cheap. David Shaw&#x27;s points were that hardware depreciates faster than Papert&#x27;s projection (1.5-2 years instead of 5) and that sysadmin costs are much higher than hardware costs (Papert said there&#x27;s no need for sysadmin, the kids can do it themselves). On both counts I think Shaw was right in 1995.<p>Where are we 25 years later? All kids are exposed to computers, if anything they have too much screen time. And the sysadmin costs have plummeted; for NYC for example [1], out of a total annual budget for 2020 of $26.9 BN, only $36.6 MM are earmarked as &quot;Prof. Services -Computer Services&quot;, or 0.14%.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;council.nyc.gov&#x2F;budget&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;54&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;040-DOE-Expense-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;council.nyc.gov&#x2F;budget&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;54&#x2F;2...</a>')
