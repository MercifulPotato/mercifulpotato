Extraterrestrial resources (asteroids, the moon, solar power, local resources on Mars) are more accessible. And it&#x27;s underappreciated that for what you do need from Earth, launch can get much cheaper&#x2F;cleaner after enough development in space, just as an elevator system gets more efficient with a counterweight.')
