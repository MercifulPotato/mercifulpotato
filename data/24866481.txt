It was part of our work positioning entrepreneurship around clean energy.<p>We worked with the college press office to draft our press release, and in it we made the claim that it was the first wind turbine on a school campus in the greater Boston area.<p>Well one of the bigger papers picked up the story and the press office ended up getting a nasty voicemail from some parent at a private high school in some Boston suburb. The parent wanted our school to know that HIS kid&#x27;s school was the first to put up a wind turbine.<p>This actually worried our little team because we didn&#x27;t want to say something untrue. But the pr person explained that this &quot;first to do X&quot; type of thing is a very common press tactic and it is not unusual to have your claim disputed.<p>And that second, &quot;greater Boston area&quot; is not really a narrowly defined term.<p>This was something of a relief and we sort of had a running gag about the PTA dad with sour grapes about our wind turbine from then on.')
