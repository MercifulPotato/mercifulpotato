The difficult task is understanding when that control is a reasonable response to the crisis and when the crisis is an excuse to assert control. This is not an exclusive choice, both types of efforts can be going on simultaneously.<p>We seem to have become numb to the large numbers that are now thrown around as part of defining public policy.
