In one they cooperate to see that the company succeeds...and in the other they seek to drive up the cost of doing business to the point that shitty products are extremely expensive (GM, Ford).<p>Unions used to be for protecting the workers and ensuring that companies were getting the very best skillsets when hiring.  Now they protect the lazy, promote the well connected and drain efficiency from businesses.  Longshoreman are the most shining example of how to destroy businesses...Port of Portland is now shuttered because they intentionally slowed down work to the point of forcing companies to go elsewhere.  ILWU was hit with a $19M judgment because of the things it did in Portland.')
