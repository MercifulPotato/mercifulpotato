However, I can point a link to Montgomery county election workers filling in the circles on absentee ballots [0]. I unfortunately can&#x27;t prove it to you, but I saw a confirmation that my friends grandmother&#x27;s absentee ballot arrived. The only problem is that see has passed away a few years ago.<p>&gt; But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening, isn&#x27;t it?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m understanding your double negative. I see that the election appears to be for the most part fair and that the questioning of the results are permitted within the legal framework.<p>&gt; who lost the election<p>That is the question.<p>&gt; hallmark of free and democratic elections, to have top military brass feeling the need to address the public to make it clear that they aren&#x27;t tasked to obey the president, but the constitution?<p>It is it is. The fact the the top military leaders (not sure exactly who you are referring to) are able to freely exclaim that the follow the constitution, not a former president, is the Hallmark of democracy. Can you imagine what would happen if the Soviet milliary leaders demanded that Stalin hold a free election and that if Stalin lost and didn&#x27;t step down, that he would be removed by force? Those leaders would either be executed or there would be a coup. I don&#x27;t see any execution or coups goin on in America.<p>[0] The original has been censored from Google, but here is the county&#x27;s response. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;md-politics&#x2F;ballot-fraud-denied-montgomery-county&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;aee4de64-13dd-11eb-bc10-40b25382f1be_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;md-politics&#x2F;ballot-frau...</a><p>Filling out someone&#x27;s ballot, for whatever reason, doesn&#x27;t spark integrity.')
