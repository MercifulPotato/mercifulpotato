When dealing with vendor qualification questionnaires, you can tell the small and large businesses apart by whether they want SCIM support or not.<p>It&#x27;s my experience that SSO makes your customers very &#x27;sticky&#x27;, and keeps IT and compliance departments happy. You blend into the suite of tools they use. I&#x27;ll never forget the first time I saw a client&#x27;s Okta portal with our app sitting next to Outlook web access, Zoom and Salesforce.<p>This client has only ever increased the number of seats and usage of our software.<p>From my point of view as a SaaS CTO we&#x27;re happy to pay extra for SSO (i.e. Slack) but not at &quot;contact us&quot; level pricing (for example, Smartsheet)')
