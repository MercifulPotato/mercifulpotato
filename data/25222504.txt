Item(by='iso1631', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606415954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221746, text='The easiest way to replace petrol tax would be to simply charge with the MOT. Road taxes in general raise about 10p per mile driven (including petrol, VAT on petrol, and VED, but excluding VAT on new cars, which is a significant amount - about £10b a year based on 3 million cars a year at £20k a year)<p>It would work as &quot;You&#x27;ve done 10,000 miles since your last MOT, you have to pay your £1k tax bill&quot;. Travel abroad and you could register the mileage when you leave and when you get back easily enough. Final bill on scrapping or on SORN.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t allow the differential road pricing that tracking fans want, and wouldn&#x27;t work in Ireland, but would work in GB right now.')
