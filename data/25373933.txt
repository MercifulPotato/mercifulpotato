Item(by='prucomaclu', descendants=None, kids=[25374091], score=None, time=1607610069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373625, text='&gt; Don&#x27;t be ridiculous. No other president has ever tried to overturn the results of an election like Trump.<p>He&#x27;s trying to overturn the election, yes.  Through the legal system.  Isn&#x27;t that the way these things should be handled?<p>If his case does not have merits, it will be thrown out (as it has been).  A lot of people think it does has merits (right, or wrong).<p>The intention is not to disenfranchise anybody.  His stated belief (right, or wrong), is that people were already disenfranchised by the fraud that occurred, and is seeking to remedy it through the legal system.<p>Simply pursuing this course of action does not make him a bad person.  If you have evidence that his stated belief is disingenous - and he is indeed trying to disenfranchise people - I would be keen on seeing this.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s total bullshit. No it certainly isn&#x27;t &quot;unquestionable&quot;, and you have no proof of that whatsoever<p>To clarify, I said &quot;to me, it is unquestionable&quot;.  I understand you and many people think differently.  The point of the original post is that we should try to be able to have constructive discourse on this subject - there is a huge group of people who think differently from you do, and they feel just as justified in their opinion, as you do.<p>If you want some good examples of the election laws that I feel were broken (in a meaningful way), read Texas&#x27;s lawsuit (first 36 pages primarily):\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasattorneygeneral.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;images&#x2F;admin&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Press&#x2F;SCOTUSFiling.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasattorneygeneral.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;ima...</a><p>If you have read Texas lawsuit and think its total BS, I would be very interested in understanding your reasoning.  Reach out to me at prucomaclu [at] yahoo.com.  I am genuinely curious why these claims are deemed to have no legitimacy and would like to improve my understanding of this subject.<p>I don&#x27;t expect anyone to agree with every single point that Texas is making.  But I&#x27;m just not sure how a reasonable person can dismiss it in its entirety.')
