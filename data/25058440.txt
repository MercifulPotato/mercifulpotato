The MBP only uses the dGPU for external monitors. The problem is that the dGPU driver&#x2F;firmware&#x2F;whatever is broken so it runs at a minimum of 8W even when there&#x27;s no work to do, overloading the thermals.<p>The 2019 16&quot; MPB made this problem far worse, raising the minimum dGPU to 18W, making external displays almost completely unusable for more than 1hr at a time unless you put the laptop aside in an external cooling solution (stand and fans) where you can&#x27;t ergonomically use the integrated keyboard.')
