I&#x27;m 24 years old.<p>I fell in love with web dev back in 2013. But I never launched anything or got anything into a launchable state.<p>This year I started reading Rework, and it helped me to stop overthinking things. It gave me the &quot;Launch Now&quot; and worry about the rest later mentality.<p>While reading Rework, I built Beonrails. Beonrails is a  tool to close deals with people. It&#x27;s pretty young. Only about two months old as of mid-November 2020.<p>I made it for people like me who like working alone and don&#x27;t want to bother with preparing fancy proposals or lengthy contracts.<p>I&#x27;m a very simple-minded person, and complicated things turn me off. So in Beonrails, you only create a deal. The web app will generate the proposal &amp; contract for you.\nThe contract&#x2F;proposal gets generated based on whatever information you add to your deal. If your client accepts your deal, then your deal is locked, and you can no longer edit the contract&#x2F;proposal for that deal.<p>It doesn&#x27;t do project management or invoicing. I believe other tools do these things better than what I could potentially implement at the moment.<p>There are many other proposal building software out there. But I like the simplicity of Beonrails and how everything is wrapped up around one thing, a deal. So I can only think about the deal, and the other elements (proposal&#x2F;contract) will be ready for me to use when I need them.<p>I&#x27;d like you to try it out and leave me some feedback. And if you find it useful and have an audience (that might benefit from it) to please share it with your audience.<p>Have a nice day.')
