(DC motor controllers are simpler, but I don&#x27;t think DC motors are used in any modern commercially-produced EV.)  This generally requires some amount of software.<p>The motor generally has current and voltage and RPM and temperature limits, and the motor controller keeps everything within those limits.  But the motor controller isn&#x27;t there just for that reason, it&#x27;s there because the motor couldn&#x27;t function without it.<p>DC motors are different; those you could just literally replace your gas pedal with an on&#x2F;off button and wire it straight from the battery to the motor.  Not that that&#x27;s a good idea.')
