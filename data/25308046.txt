If I walk into a manager&#x27;s office and demand 2x salary or I walk and the response is &quot;we believe you are fairly compensated,&quot; you&#x27;re now in a rather uncomfortable situation.<p>Which is of course not to say you can&#x27;t have a more measured negotiation. But it can be hard to walk back from give me X or I do Y, especially if there isn&#x27;t a lot of middle ground between giving you X or not giving you X.')
