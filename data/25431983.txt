Why not an API where you send it the search query and then it returns the results? It could have a variety of return options including using a ranking of the API publisher&#x27;s choosing or you could ask for something raw, and innovate with an even better or more suitable ranking based on your specific needs.<p>In the end, the point would be to make Google closer to what it was at the beginning -- just input and output. No ads on top of it, no bundling with other offerings etc. And if the publisher&#x27;s ranking remains as good as it should, then surely some will be willing to pay not only for the raw data, but the ranking as well.')
