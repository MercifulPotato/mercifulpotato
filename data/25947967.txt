Email operates on 100s of different clients (and operating systems), and you get people replying-to-all by mistake, and fat-fingering sensitive data to random recipients (which is possible in Signal, but not nearly as bad as e-mail where e-mail can exist in any hostile environment it wants, unlike Signal which has a user which is more <i>careful</i> about what he&#x2F;she sends).')
