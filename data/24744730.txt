My guess is that the political opposition that <i>does</i> occur is often in response to minor inconvenience rather than the actual morality of the issue.  That is why opposition to mask wearing can get so much traction.    Or why people get angry about cyclists.  The political justification comes after the fact.<p>So if a plan doesn&#x27;t inconvenience anyone and doesn&#x27;t trigger identity politics it will probably be ignored by most people.')
