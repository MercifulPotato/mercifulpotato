I mean the thing we call &quot;reasoning&quot; towards which we can draw our awareness.<p>This is in some profound way, quite dumb. It seems smart for all sorts of reasons: in particular, it is furnished with concepts that have taken millions of years of cultural evolution to develop.<p>An ape, such as us, absent this cultural context would seem precisely as dumb as it really is: very dumb indeed.<p>We misattribute our reasoning with these concepts for their inherent intelligence. This intelligence, which we might call conceptualization, is not a congitive process. The real intelligence is animal intelligence, it&#x27;s the bedrock of our cognition which is always outside of it; and cannot be observed from within.<p>&gt; Thus, a &quot;body&quot; is just a part of the AGI,<p>Not at all. A body is just the place the world changes. It&#x27;s the thing in direct causal contact with the world; whose effect is a kind of painful restructuring. eg., the bike rider learns to ride a bike not by &quot;evolving his cognition&quot;, but by the structure of his muscles changing.<p>(Indeed, by his eye swirling differently in its socket).<p>It is this restructuring which is an essential aspect of conceptualization (whose <i>effect</i> we see in consciousness).<p>I strongly suspect that this kind of restructuring is necessarily organic: it is <i>growing</i> differently given the impact of the world. I am open to other systems which can evolve their physical structure in this way, certainly, i do not think sand qualifies.<p>re Political Correctness<p>Correctness = straightness, fit\nFit = environment-body &quot;matching&quot;<p>Political = other bodies wanting from me, my wanting from them<p>political correctness = criteria for the fit of my body with other bodies as we want from each other<p>In being a criteria it is a &quot;concept about a concept&quot; and therefore its heavily on the psych-side of psychomotor, ie., it is a kind of regulating mechanism on reasoning (specifically, reasoning about my fit in an environment of people).')
