As I understand it, the EU interfered in its member countries&#x27; contracts, delayed them 3 months, delaying the EU supply chain from starting.<p>Ridiculously, from what I can see, in the contract the EU specifically stated they could only supply a few early doses from the UK in 2020 (because after Jan 1 the UK is outside the EU and they are not permitted to use non-EU production) and have then been trying to make spurious claims they&#x27;re supposed to divert UK doses nearly a month afterwards.<p>Sorry to say it looks like EU Commission incompetence layered on some more EU Commission incompetence.')
