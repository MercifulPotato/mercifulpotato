Write more code? I don&#x27;t get it. Let me waste the time on a ludicrously arcane syntax where I spend half the time looking at every bracket trying to understand if it&#x27;s a control character in that particular context, because the ego trip I get from mastering this ridiculousness is HUGE!<p>(Yes, I understand regex syntax. I&#x27;ve been able to explain the phrase &quot;zero-width negative lookbehind assertion&quot; for the past twenty years. I inhaled the Friedl book and got utterly high on the idea that the awesome power of regular expressions - which are genuinely great in how they ease flexibility in accepting input - is entwined with their completely inhuman syntax. But I was wrong.)')
