Although I would argue that even if it is, the warning is enough for you to establish consent to be lied to, so it&#x27;s not actually harming you. Real censorship is different.<p>Of course, the real problem with censorship is that whoever ends up in charge of it, automatically gets immense political power - including the ability to suppress opposition to censorship, thus perpetuating the arrangement. I would argue that the only reason why we haven&#x27;t seen more abuses of that yet is because the Internet infrastructure was not originally designed to make such large-scale censorship easy, and as this changes more towards centralization, censorship will be more pervasive and more oppressive, as well. Countries where the government could mandate infrastructure tailored to censorship (e.g. China) are a good example. Now, some argue that, so long as functioning democracy is retained, it doesn&#x27;t matter, because any such censorship in a democracy would be majoritarian in nature, and thus it&#x27;s a fundamentally different and justifiable case, but one only has to look at historical moral panics in various democracies to see the flaw in this argument.')
