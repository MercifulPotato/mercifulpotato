Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=[25105937], score=None, time=1605469122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103167, text='&gt;Do you think the author of the AP article would react to feedback about it this way?<p>I have no doubt, regardless of the validity of the &#x27;feedback&#x27;, you can certainly bully the author or the news agency into pushing any narrative you want. All you have to do is frame this story as &#x27;dangerous&#x27; and pushing &#x27;misinformation&#x27; or &#x27;undermining faith in vaccines&#x27;.<p>&gt;By replying repeatedly to people providing context not in the article, you&#x27;re indicating that reasonable people can&#x27;t disagree with you regarding what&#x27;s &quot;good-faith context.&quot;<p>The question I posed is why one cannot have a regular fact-driven news article without pushing some other larger narrative (that has tenuous connection, AT BEST, to the actual story) and the &#x27;good-faith&#x27; context that OP provided is ... pushing a larger narrative that has NOTHING to do with the actual story. I mean, he&#x27;s trying to link it to a COVID-19 vaccine, which has NOTHIG to do with this polio vaccination effort. In other words, why is it critical for a story about Sudan to argue against American anti-vaxxers or opinionate on American COVID-19 policy, or other political goals you&#x27;re trying to push in America.<p>So what I meant by &#x27;good-faith context&#x27; is context that is directly linked to understanding the facts detailed in the story, not context for larger narrative that pushes other policy and political goals. This article is actually quite good - it communicated an issue with polio vaccine and provided a larger and historical context of vaccine efforts in the region, and how it is viewed by public health authorities and the WHO. I got the gist of the story.<p>&gt;I think more context comparing this polio vaccine to other polio vaccines is relevant and valuable, in part because of the general rise in unfounded fears of all vaccines.<p>What if the general distrust of authoritative sources and news media stems from precisely this kind of reasoning ... that you need tell people what to believe, play down or omit any countervailing facts and preferably tie it to national politics and policy as much as you can (for completeness).<p>Let me turn it around on you: how is it that you are able to read this story and frame it in your mind within the larger context of vaccines, but others aren&#x27;t? Why do you need to the writer to editorialize and push a point of view? You clearly understood that this polio outbreak does not mean all types of vaccines are dangerous.')
