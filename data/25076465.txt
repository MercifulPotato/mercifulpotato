Which is why so many folks are talking about loving the Apple app store in the thread about the recent Epic case that also popped up today. Although I&#x27;ll note it&#x27;s interesting that originally those threads seemed about evenly divided on the topic, and currently the pro-apple, pro-dictatorship voices seem to be getting mostly downvoted.<p>Regardless - I&#x27;d strongly recommend everyone out there to consider free and open software, on devices that you own (and you don&#x27;t own a device if you don&#x27;t have root access).  Open source just keeps getting better - We happily re-implement the ideas and products generated by these companies, but we care about you - not the bottom line -because we <i>are</i> you.')
