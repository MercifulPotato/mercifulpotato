A lot of people will turn it into a competition and be more concerned about creating a following rather than spreading truth and fostering healthy discussion.<p>Sure, I&#x27;d take a Fediverse over a Facebook or a Twitter any day; lack of corporate control and the ability to run your own instance and federate are just plain better from a &quot;health of the internet&quot; perspective.  But that doesn&#x27;t solve the social problems inherent in any community where people most don&#x27;t know each other personally and don&#x27;t have to interact face-to-face.')
