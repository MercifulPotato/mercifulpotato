CDDL is a weak, file-based license similar to the MPL. It is generally (though not universally) believed to be incompatible with the GPL. (Which may or may not have been intentional. Again, accounts differ.) In any case, the Linux kernel along with Red Hat for its distributions won&#x27;t incorporate ZFS code for this reason. The fact that it&#x27;s Oracle that owns the copyright doubtless doesn&#x27;t help.<p>FreeBSD is BSD licensed of course and that&#x27;s considered compatible with CDDL given that CDDL is file-based.')
