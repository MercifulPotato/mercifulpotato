You get the degree, and then you get a job, and begin the process of learning how to actually use what you read. Like first creating an entire software product, and then later making it actually work for a customer.<p>Rather than taking 2-4 years to learn how to write the software, and then 2-4 years to learn how to make it work for customers, why don&#x27;t they do both from day 1? Why aren&#x27;t universities just mock companies where you build fake products for fake customers, and teach you the theory as you need it? By the end you&#x27;d be an expert at working with teams as well as algorithm design.')
