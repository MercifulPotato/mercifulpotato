GOFAI didn&#x27;t work, hence the winter. If it did I&#x27;d think otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s true that you can, in some places, merge the two. The significant majority of the time, this just makes your ML system worse in the long run, per The Bitter Lesson. Occasionally—<i>very</i> occasionally—your problem is fundamentally simple, so something brittle like AlphaZero works, even though we&#x27;d still rather shave the fixed-function parts off with MuZero and the like. But it&#x27;s no coincidence this is reserved for simple, thoughtless problems (like brute-force move search) and kept isolated from the thinking, as intelligence needs generalization and abstraction, and GOFAI doesn&#x27;t generalize or abstract.<p>&gt; And of course, one of the most widely used and well-known type of machine learning approach used to this day, decision trees<p>Though decision trees live a healthy life in data analysis, alongside things like k-means clustering, they&#x27;re obviously not AI.<p>&gt; Of course, most people today know &quot;ML&quot; as a byword for deep learning, or at best statistical pattern recognition (if that).<p>‘Statistical pattern recognition’ is just name calling devoid of real criticisms. I can ask GPT-3,<p>&gt; a = [&quot;fitness&quot;, &quot;health&quot;, &quot;heart&quot;], b = [&quot;lifting&quot;, &quot;curls&quot;, &quot;squats&quot;], c = [&quot;running&quot;, &quot;jogging&quot;], so what is b.append(&quot;pushups&quot;)?<p>and it&#x27;ll happily answer<p>&gt; b.append(&quot;pushups&quot;) returns [&quot;lifting&quot;, &quot;curls&quot;, &quot;squats&quot;, &quot;pushups&quot;]<p>or I can give it the Loebner Prize questions which it can almost ace, or I can test it on 10-digit addition and it gets 60% right (with thousands separators, but still suffering BPEs), or I can ask it to do quirky tasks like shuffling letters, or ask it to write sentences with novel words and find that it understands nuanced differences between the definitions...<p>You can scream ‘but it&#x27;s just statistical pattern recognition’ all you want, but the criticism doesn&#x27;t mean anything if ‘statistical pattern recognition’ includes this level of generalization, reasoning and algorithmic sophistication in natural language with scaling curves that assure us the best is yet to come.')
