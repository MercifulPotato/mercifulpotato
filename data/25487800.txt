There is a social reason though: if you point out that there is no need to build scale (yet), you are pointing out that the business will not achieve overnight success. Even if it&#x27;s true, it kills excitement and is therefore not something that people want to hear. Who wants to realize that what they&#x27;re spending large amounts of time on (and possibly even neglecting other things like health, sleep and social contacts) will not even make all their financial dreams come true? Much easier to not think too hard about it and keep on doing what everyone is doing.<p>So, building out scalable infra is signaling that you too believe in the company and are preparing for the moment (any time now!) that &quot;webscale&quot; is needed. It&#x27;s showing that you are part of the team.')
