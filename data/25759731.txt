I tried to link my Toshl (a budget app) account to my bank, to import automatically my movements. I saw that they were using Plaid, and I found that weird. I went to search the page you linked, and I still didn&#x27;t know how was it connecting to my bank. I used an &quot;application password&quot; with limited permissions from my bank to use with Plaid, and funnily enough it didn&#x27;t work. In fact, my bank locked my account because Plaid tried to login through the regular user interface with a wrong password several times. It was only then when I saw in forums and such that what Plaid does is to scrape HTML.<p>When you use Plaid, you don&#x27;t get the impression that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing. We&#x27;re used to dialogs to &quot;give permissions to an app&quot; that don&#x27;t share our user&#x2F;password with anybody. Plaid purposefully emulates those dialogs and gives you the impression that you&#x27;re just logging in with your bank, instead of explicitly telling you &quot;we will store your user and password and use that to log-i with your bank&quot;.')
