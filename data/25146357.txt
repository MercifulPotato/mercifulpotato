Likewise many of the big apps which exist on iOS. The vast majority of software on iOS is small niche tools which are either fun to use or useful tools.<p>Apple knows this and they know they need indie developers supporting their platform.<p>I realize there are a fair number of situations where it doesn&#x27;t seem that way. But there are a lot of times such as this where it&#x27;s more than clear they do.')
