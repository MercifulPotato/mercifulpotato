But... is it really so wrong to be glad that <i>someone</i> is trying to arbitrate this?  Parler was a persistent host to exactly the kind of violent rhetoric that turned into Wednesday&#x27;s coup.  At some point we have to make a call and shut stuff like that down, right?<p>I mean, yes, it sucks that the overlap between &quot;conventional republican politics&quot; and &quot;rhetoric inspiring real life violence&quot; is so high.  So surely there is some friendly fire here on speech we&#x27;d like to keep.  But... I don&#x27;t see why Amazon should be responsible for letting this fester like it has either.')
