Meanwhile the embodied energy of an ebike or escooter is tiny by comparison, can in principle be powered by renewable energy, and the difference in energy footprint is so huge that I would be very surprised if it doesn&#x27;t earn itself back long before the expected life-time of the car ends.<p>On top of that there&#x27;s reduction of traffic congestion and air pollution, and less pressure to create infrastructure (like parking space) for cars. All of which is the kind of externalized cost that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> actually externalized if you&#x27;re a government.')
