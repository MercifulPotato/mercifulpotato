For example, everyone wants a bunch of free money - should the Assembly pass a ton of bills that write blank checks with no budget changes to back them up?  Everyone loves artificially low property taxes for existing residents, and that&#x27;s been an unmitigated disaster for the state.  The Assembly&#x27;s job is to pass bills that positively benefit California as a state and as a society long-term.  Sometimes that means certain groups will not be happy with the bills.  It is extremely dubious to claim that Prop 22 is definitely a good thing for California and a strong society.')
