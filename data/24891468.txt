The fact that you have to carry propellant with you anyway seems like a big factor in favour of traditional rockets, where the fuel becomes the propellant. And burning the hydrogen way hotter seems like a big engineering problem - rocket motors already run at temperatures which pose materials science problems, increase that a few thousand degrees and you might as well say we should run the spaceship on fusion power.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that the physics works, and it&#x27;s important to note that say a 2x gain in thrust-to-mass ratio would lead to enormous advances in trips out of Earth&#x27;s gravitational well (10x? 100x?) due to the tyranny of the rocket equation. But I&#x27;m curious whether this is the 2x gain of replacing oxygen+hydrogen with hydrogen, plus a big complex reactor, or the millionfold gain of replacing hydrogen fuels with uranium.<p>Edit: TFA says twice the specific impulse, and presumably that&#x27;s the optimistic estimate. But still very good!')
