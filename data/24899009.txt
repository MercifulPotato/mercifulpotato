I have&#x27;nt done this myself, but what I have in mind, a script that:<p>* Syncs torrent&#x2F;magnet to remote (scp or syncthing) to your vm&#x27;s torrent daemon&#x27;s incoming folder<p>* Produces a new .torrent file that is added to your local client, with only the single peer. Ensure that PEX and DHT are disabled.<p>For this use-case you needn&#x27;t care as much about leaking, as long as you take care of the above.')
