I originally adapted it from a paleo recipe that I can&#x27;t seem to find again, but I&#x27;ve made enough changes to make it my own. (Because of the aquafaba, and arguably the potato starch, it&#x27;s not paleo after my changes.)<p>- 3&#x2F;4 cup potato starch<p>- 1&#x2F;4 cup coconut flour<p>- 1&#x2F;4 cup almond flour<p>- 3&#x2F;4 tsp baking soda<p>- 1&#x2F;4 tsp baking powder<p>- 1&#x2F;4 tsp salt<p>- 1&#x2F;4 cup olive oil<p>- 1&#x2F;4 cup water<p>- 3 tbsp aquafaba<p>- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar<p>Mix dry ingredients in a bowl. Add oil and water, stir. Add aquafaba, stir.<p>At this point, it should stick together but still be somewhat lumpy. If it does not stick together, add more water, but be careful--don&#x27;t add enough water that it becomes smooth!<p>Add vinegar, stir, and spoon individual biscuits onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Should make 7-9 biscuits. Cook at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes.<p>These biscuits are excellent with olive oil and vinegar. They reheat well, and have a crumbly texture that reminds me of Southern-style biscuits.<p>The flatbread recipe is similar, but with no baking soda or vinegar, and the flours replaced with 1 cup tapioca starch and 1&#x2F;3 cup coconut flour. Some extra olive oil helps too, and maybe some oregano.')
