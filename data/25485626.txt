And my anecdata can only confirm that it&#x27;s beneficial.<p>This is why I am so excited about the idea of working remotely using AR glasses. Just imagine going hiking through the mountains while checking your emails or being on a conference call – only taking breaks to type out some code on a portable keyboard.<p>Regardless of the cognitive performance boost this would give you, it would also mitigate a lot of the health issues we humans have started accumulating since we started sitting down all day.<p>Of course Einstein also famously claimed to have only moved to Princeton for the walks home with Gödel [1].<p>[0] I found this news item in a pinch, but I&#x27;m sure there are many studies to substantiate the claim: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;walking-vs-sitting-042414&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;walking-vs-sitting-0424...</a><p>[1] I would have to do some digging to find the original phrasing (Einstein is often misattributted), so take it with a pinch of salt. But there is an entire book who&#x27;s title alludes to this :\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;When_Einstein_Walked_with_G%C3%B6del?wprov=sfla1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;When_Einstein_Walked_with_G%C3...</a><p>(the book is great btw)')
