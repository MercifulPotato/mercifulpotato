Drugs have never been more accessible or cheap and that trend is likely to continue.<p>I think the government should legalize all drugs so they can control the drug markets and take them away from violent criminal organizations.

It gets bigger as time goes on. Better to have it under the control of government and taxed&#x2F;regulated than underground under the control of cartels')
