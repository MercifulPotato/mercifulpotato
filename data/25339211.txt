Even if that piece of wire used as an antenna here were capable of loading the pin up to its max output, it&#x27;d be something around 0.004W - and in reality it&#x27;ll likely be an order of magnitude or two lower than that. That&#x27;s at least 8 orders of magnitude less power, and even allowing for the inverse square radiation power pattern, this this is only gonna be detectable at single digit meters in all likelihood.<p>This _is_ a bad idea, spectrum noise and interference  wise, but it&#x27;s unlikely to have enough power at either its intended transmit frequency any of its nasty harmonics to make it outside the rooms it&#x27;s in. You probably might not want to take this to hospital with you, or on that camping trip near the radio telescope, but I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about firing this up in my home workshop...')
