There are an estimated 12,000 wolves in Europe now, far more than in the US. As shown at the Yellowstone national park, the reintroduction of wolves has influenced the behaviour of their preys, not daring to graze everywhere anymore, hence allowing wilder vegetation.<p>Scotland could start bringing back wolves too in order to manage naturally the deer population. But this plan meets resistance from shepherds who can&#x27;t efficiently protect their herd. There is no serious consideration of releasing wolves into the UK countryside.')
