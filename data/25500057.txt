For example:<p>If I am accused of killing a man, and I am proven innocent, I cannot be accused of killing THAT SPECIFIC MAN again. If I was to go and kill a man, I cannot claim &quot;but I was already exonarated for killing a man&quot;. Because it is not the same crime. DJ is all about being prosecuted for _the same instance of a crime_ more than once. Not that once I broke a law, I cannot break it again in the future.<p>This can apply to civil cases if a judge dismisses the case with prejudice, which means that this specific case cannot be put to trial again. Sometimes a judge dismisses the case without prejudice which indicates that the judge felt there was a case, but not enough supporting evidence yet. If a case is not resolved, it goes up the chain of courts, eventually a court may reject the case, in which case a lower court&#x27;s ruling takes hold. If a case is resolved I cannot go to trial for that same case again. Nor can I use the exact same evidence for a new case. Or rather... I can but it will get dismissed with prejudice.<p>There is technically nothing stopping me from filing cases against you which were already resolved to harass you. But after like 2 times my lawyer&#x27;s license will be revoked and possibly I will have a case against me for obvious harassment forcing me to cover any legal expenses. Overall courts really really don&#x27;t like it when you act in bad faith, even if not criminally.')
