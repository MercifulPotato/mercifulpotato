It has been called the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of backups[1].<p>What you should probably be doing is:<p>1) using &#x27;rclone&#x27; to move data between clouds[2] - either downloading it back to yourself or migrating it to a new cloud that you prefer.<p>2) using &#x27;borg&#x27; to initiate, or replace, existing backups with encrypted backups that only you hold the key to.<p>As you may know, there is a cloud storage provider with this half-page privacy policy[3] that explicitly supports <i>both</i> borg and rclone[4] and has those tools built into their environment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stavros.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;holy-grail-backups&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stavros.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;holy-grail-backups&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rclone.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rclone.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;regulatory&#x2F;privacy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;resources&#x2F;regulatory&#x2F;privacy.html</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;products&#x2F;rclone.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;products&#x2F;rclone.html</a>')
