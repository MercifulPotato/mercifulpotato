They can charge 1000$ on their own website and not pay a penny to Apple if they just don&#x27;t link to their payment system in the app.<p>Secondly: My main issue is that the article is misleading the public to think Apple forced them to monetize a plan that was free. That is the farthest thing from the truth it can be. You are allowed to sell free apps and services on iOS.<p>Whether the app is free&#x2F;paid or a service on top of the app is paid is not really Apple&#x27;s concern. The concern is directing users to an external payment system.')
