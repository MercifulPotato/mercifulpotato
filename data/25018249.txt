This can be done by (partially) tying wealth to employment and reducing inequality. Indeed, in a hypothetical society where most companies are mostly worker owned, then the owners of the company do not have that much of an incentive in hiring climate change, because ultimately if the company folded and they changed domains they would not lose that much, and the cost of climate change is bigger relative to their stake since everyone&#x27;s stake is lower.<p>Another part of the answer will be government, unavoidably. Hopefully, a less unequal economy that has a lot more worker ownership will allow for much more democratic government, as it will be much harder for any individual to have the resources to exploit government directly or indirectly.')
