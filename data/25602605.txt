Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=[25602764], score=None, time=1609501805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602440, text='Look at how the law is formulated: &quot;A food delivery platform shall not X without Y.&quot;<p>X is the action the law allows or prohibits.<p>Y decides whether the action is allowed or not.<p>If &quot;authorization to take orders and deliver meals&quot; exists, then they can deliver.  If &quot;authorization to take orders and deliver meals&quot; does not exist, then they cannot deliver.<p>&quot;take orders&quot; does not appear in the law anywhere else.  It&#x27;s only in the phrase &quot;authorization to take orders&quot;, and in that context the law is <i>only</i> checking if that authorization exists.  This particular law does not say when taking orders is allowed or prohibited.  This law does not care if a platform is taking orders.  It cares about whether the platform delivers, and it cares about whether the platform has &quot;authorization to take orders and deliver meals&quot;.<p>-<p>Edit: Pretend for a second the law said &quot;A food delivery platform shall not arrange for the delivery of an order from a food facility without first obtaining an agreement with the food facility expressly authorizing the food delivery platform to own puppies and deliver meals prepared by the food facility.&quot;<p>Would that law have any effect on whether the food delivery platform can own puppies?  Nah.  The restaurant has to say &quot;you are allowed to own puppies&quot; before the platform can deliver, but that law is not imbuing the puppy clause with any other power.  It neither allows nor disallows actual puppy ownership.<p>-<p>So my main point is not that a platform should get cheeky by trying to take orders but not deliver, or something.<p>It&#x27;s that even if they&#x27;re not taking orders, this law blocks them from delivering.  If they don&#x27;t have the authorization, they can&#x27;t deliver, end of story.  The restaurant didn&#x27;t say they can have a puppy, so they can&#x27;t deliver, and it doesn&#x27;t matter whether there actually is a puppy.')
