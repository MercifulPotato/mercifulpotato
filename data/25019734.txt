You didn&#x27;t vote for the president, you voted for what your state will try to vote for in December. Unfortunately, state representatives in the presidential election are not universally required to vote along the state election result, and while rare in the past, the current administration is clearly not above bribery and criminal endeavours to get what they want, when they need it.<p>(Of course, if that&#x27;s news to you, then you&#x27;re probably not in the US right now)<p>Biden is PROJECTED to win the White House, because that&#x27;s how US elections work. It looks for all the world that he&#x27;ll win, but he <i>might not</i> depending on the electoral college: you don&#x27;t win because the most people voted for you. That&#x27;s not how elections work in the US.<p>And before someone goes &quot;what are the odds&quot;: this isn&#x27;t 2016 when people still pretended to honour the system. We have 4 years of established corruption, exploits, and literal criminal behaviour to draw on. Until elected by the electoral college, Biden <i>has not won</i>. And remember that many states merely put a monetary fine on being a faithless electors: it&#x27;s not even illegal. $1000 to pick the guy who&#x27;ll pay you back bigger, instead of who the state voted for? Scandalous! But also: entirely legal.')
