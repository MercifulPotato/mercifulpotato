Item(by='Kiro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605688937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134030, text='&quot;We also of course have more traditional links in the search results, which we also source from multiple partners, though most commonly from Bing (and none from Google).&quot;<p>This refers to the actual search results and if they used their bot for that I don&#x27;t see why they would say &quot;multiple partners&quot; instead of &quot;multiple partners and our own crawler&quot;. The fact that they don&#x27;t have their own index is such a common &quot;complaint&quot;, and this page is often referred, so if they really used their own bot they should have added that a long time ago.<p>And it&#x27;s not just a legacy page they have forgot to update. It keeps being updated. In 2019 it said:<p>&quot;We also of course have more traditional links in the search results, which we also source from a variety of partners, including Oath (formerly Yahoo) and Bing.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that back in 2014 the page looked like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20131202065705&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duck.co&#x2F;help&#x2F;results&#x2F;sources" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20131202065705&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duck.co&#x2F;h...</a><p>Here they talk about their own indexes getting bigger but at the same time admitting that &quot;it seems silly to compete on crawling and, besides, we do not have the money to do so&quot;. Completely understandable but also interesting that the current page doesn&#x27;t mention their own index at all. Maybe they used to have a goal to build their own independent index that has now been dropped?<p>All in all, I think it&#x27;s safe to presume that their own crawler is only used for Instant Answers etc since that&#x27;s the part of the sources where it&#x27;s mentioned. Or at the very least used to such a small extent in the actual search results that it would be disingenuous to even mention it as a source.')
