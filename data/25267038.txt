The Baseball Data team is tasked with analyzing the data captured on the field.  With the launch of Statcast in 2015, MLB began tracking ball and player movements for each and every play. This role will involve combining our various data sources with video in near real-time to further our understanding of what is happening on the field. Potential projects include broadcast graphics powered by camera calibration, and developing a machine understanding of the game by leveraging our ball tracking and player tracking systems.')
