Item(by='keiferski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605027710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048109, text='Hi HN,<p>A few years ago, I was watching a video on David Goggins and got an idea: what if I paid someone to follow me around and make sure I followed my Schedule and To-Do list, to the letter? If I said I would run every morning, this person would <i>make sure</i> I did it. And so on. After looking into the research behind accountability, I became convinced that this was something I wanted to do.<p>Of course, hiring an actual human being, even a non-Navy SEAL, to physically follow me around is prohibitively expensive. Software apps and to-dos lists also never quite worked for me, as there is no &quot;human element&quot; and my MacBook doesn&#x27;t care if I fail. So, I tried to make it work online (via Slack) with a friend. We were each other&#x27;s accountability partners and promised to post daily updates on our progress.<p>Needless to say, that didn&#x27;t work either. It&#x27;s hard to enforce commitments with a friend, especially a close one. And relying on a single point of failure is also not ideal; when my friend stopped posting daily updates, so did I. The whole thing collapsed in less than a month.<p>And so, I came up with Exemplar. The idea is simple: it&#x27;s a community of people that help each other accomplish their goals, all kept in line and on track by the Exemplar team (me, for now.)<p>I function as a guide: everyone has to do accomplish their own goals AND motivate other team members to accomplish theirs, but I hold it all together and make sure nobody has fallen behind.<p>HOW IT WORKS<p>You can read the full explanation on the site, but in short:<p>Each goal is on a separate channel on the Slack Workspace. For example, the <i>#lose-weight</i> channel is all about losing weight, the <i>#side-projects</i> channel is for people building side projects, the <i>#writing</i> channel is for writers, and so on. Right now, there are over a dozen channels, but users can suggest new ones.<p>When you join a channel, you must share your <i>Goals, Deadlines, and Methods:</i><p>- Goals - <i>What</i> you want to accomplish<p>- Deadlines - <i>When</i> you want to accomplish it by<p>- Methods - <i>What</i> you&#x27;ll do to accomplish it<p>Then, it&#x27;s up to you. On Slack, we&#x27;ll have frequent check-ins, where you&#x27;re encouraged to share your progress. If you don&#x27;t check-in for awhile, I&#x27;ll ask you publicly in the channel - social pressure is powerful stuff.<p>In addition, there is an Elite plan, which is a one-on-one accountability service from the Exemplar team. I&#x27;ll message you directly via Slack, WhatsApp, or email and make sure you are following your plan. You also get access to the community channels too, of course.<p>I&#x27;ve also written a FAQ:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exemplarhq.com&#x2F;faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exemplarhq.com&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a><p>It answers questions like:<p>- Why is their a monthly fee?<p>- Why does accountability work?<p>- Can&#x27;t I just use a friend as an accountability partner?<p>In the future, I hope to continue adding new features, have meet-ups, and so on. The big, long-term goal is to build a global, ambitious community of awesome people.<p>There is a one month free trial for the Basic plan. You can get $25 off the Elite plan with the code LAUNCH.<p>--<p>Any suggestions or feedback would really be appreciated. Thanks!')
