And so your cancer chances are roughly the integral over time of the concentration of the carcinogen within you?<p>For either of these vaccines even if some part of the delivery&#x2F;packaging mechanism, such as the lipid enclosure, is carcinogenic, you are only getting a small amount and only getting two short exposures. It seems like that would make the cancer rate from them so low as to be almost impossible to detect.')
