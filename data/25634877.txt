It does have a decent claim at &quot;store of value&quot;. But, where is the &quot;intrinsic value&quot;? You claim two of them:<p>1. ability to independently verify the money supply<p>2. being able to transfer money across political boundaries without censorship<p>I don&#x27;t understand either, to be honest:<p>1. You can verify the supply of other things (e.g. company shares) at an independent body. I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s true for &quot;money in circulation&quot;, too. Ok, the verification is not distributed, but is that distribution so valuable? Or do you actually mean &quot;The supply is naturally-limited and nobody can easily produce tons of BTC out of thin air&quot;? Then, yes, BTC has that property... but, tons of other things do! E.g. why not invest in amber, it&#x27;s probably one of the rarest things in the universe.<p>2. Transfer across political boundaries: is there ANY inherent guarantee? Say US decides tomorrow that trading BTC is illegal, how would BTC protect you from that? Using existing anti-money-laundering laws &amp; global institutions, you&#x27;d be effectively banned from getting back any value from your BTCs (or, doing so would expose you to all the associated risks).')
