If the serial number was derived from another, new bill, received from a local bank, then the odds are quite good.<p>If it is chosen by writing the serial number of a bill in your pocket, then circulating the bill by purchasing something.  The odds go up if you happen to stop by the banks a few days after that happened, or they go to zero if the bill was not fit for circulation and it was removed by the Federal Reserve.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a good chance that a random serial number is not actually valid.')
