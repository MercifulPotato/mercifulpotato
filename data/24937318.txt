It seems like your assigning motives to others rather than listening to what they have to say.<p>&gt; Instead they exercised the power granted by the CoC.\nIf you actually read the parent you&#x27;d know they explicitly did <i>not</i> follow the CoC. The CoC sets out a process very much like the one you described in which the enforcement team is actually supposed to have a discussion with everyone involved and get all accounts of what happened. The fact they ignored the CoC isn&#x27;t a problem with the CoC, it&#x27;s a problem with the human beings not following the process.<p>Dang could start banning people at random, that wouldn&#x27;t mean the HN guidelines are bad, it would mean dang decided not to follow the rules and has the power to do so.')
