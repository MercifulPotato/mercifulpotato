Since I do most of my testing on Linux and have an excess of SSDs littering my office, I&#x27;m well-equipped to participate in a thread like this.<p>I highly recommend reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;NewMaxx as the clearinghouse for consumer SSD news and Q&amp;A. I&#x27;m not aware of a similarly comprehensive forum for enterprise storage, where this thread would probably be a better fit.')
