Solar panels and batteries don&#x27;t last forever and would presumably require the same or similar supply chain as the microcontrollers. This is a cool project regardless, but in such a catastrophic scenario it seems easier to just give up on computing and go back to more primitive technology. If I can&#x27;t get a single thing delivered, I see myself collecting rainwater and gardening, not compiling Forth to an old Z80.')
