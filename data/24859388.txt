I use various tools that haven&#x27;t been updated for many years but have been easy to keep working as Linux userspace has changed. For closed-source things indeed it&#x27;s different.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m curious what this library could be.<p>The example was ffmpeg. You&#x27;re right that there probably aren&#x27;t that many examples of common libraries of that size. But Qt is a good example and why shouldn&#x27;t it be reasonable to use it and not have a burden placed on me to provide security updates? If I am writing an app and want to use something like libcurl, I would prefer not to have the onus placed on me to monitor and distribute libcurl security updates for the rest of my life, especially if this is just a hobby project. Suddenly I am taking on the role and responsibility akin to a whole Linux distribution, and all because I wanted to write some silly little app.<p>And even if I am that responsible, I as a user have to count on all the developers of apps I&#x27;m using to be just as responsible themselves. I mostly have no way to know whether they are, unlike the situation for example as a Debian user where they have a known track record and I can have some level of confidence.')
