Utilities like &quot;StatyFoccussd&quot;, &quot;ColdTurkey&quot;, &quot;LeechBlock, &quot;SelfControl&quot; have been extremely useful to me. On any day I spend some 10-15 mins in idle browsing, and after feeling bit jaded I set up a block for next 24hrs or so. In the interim when I make attempts to do idle browsing, I am blocked and I don&#x27;t go out of my way to fight those controls I have setup. It is quite possible for me to bypass the controls that I have setup on the machine which I have full control, but that simple message telling me that I am blocked acts as nudge to restrain myself.<p>As an additional datapoint, recent versions of Firefox doesn&#x27;t support the leechblock add-on, and my phone usage increased. But when the Leechblock control was working my phone usage was minimal.<p>May be my addiction is not strong enough, but the utilities that enforce devices limits do help.')
