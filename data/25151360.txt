When the device manufacturers start being really evil and using certificate pinning for their DoH servers you simply don&#x27;t buy those devices.<p>When the only devices available in the market for a given function end up being &quot;evil&quot; you either implement the functionality yourself or you just live without.<p>It&#x27;s that or legislation (which will just become an arms race of manufacturers trying to work around the legislation).<p>I do without. No &quot;smart&quot; devices for me or my family. It&#x27;s working so far. I about the eventual future when no major appliances, vehicles, etc, will be available without &quot;smart&quot; features implemented in an owner-hostile manner.')
