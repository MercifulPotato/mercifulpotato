They do not solve the same problem and have different longevity profiles. If I&#x27;m spending $500 on tape storage, it&#x27;s because I want something that will last a long time, something that portable hard drives tend to have issues with.<p>LTO5 onward supports LTFS, which exposes the tape to the OS as if it were any other removable storage, with the one proviso that deleting files doesn&#x27;t reclaim space unless the entire tape is wiped.')
