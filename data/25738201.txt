If he&#x27;s willing to drag the entire country I can only imagine what he would try to do to a company that defied him, Trump is an abuser. While any of these companies could have taken action, I understand to some extent why they did not. It doesn&#x27;t make it right, doesn&#x27;t mean I condone their lack of response, but I can see why a company did not go heads up with this person and waited for the appropriate time to take action.')
