A friend and I joked about their ceo wearing a t-shirt that had something to the effect of &quot;I love music&quot; on it. Which IMHO no-one that deeply likes music would wear. He also made snide remarks about how musicians should adapt to their platform wrt to publishing more music more often (instead of adapting Spotify to the needs of the musicians)<p>The story I linked also has a similar feel, the music is basically avant pop and neo soul, and instead of forwarding this cluster to someone with a musical&#x2F;cultural background, a techbro comes up with their own label that comes off as basically &quot;it reminds me of my favourite thing&quot;.<p>From the outside it seems they are really only approaching it from a purely technical point with a subconscious arrogance, ie they are adding the value not the musicians.<p>Their programmers probably make more money than most musicians on their platform and that&#x27;s frustrating as fuck.')
