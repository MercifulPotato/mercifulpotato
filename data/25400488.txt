If all those features were integrated in the shell the\nuser is more or less stuck with the whole package.<p>Which is also one of the reasons I prefer using Vim over Emacs;\nI can embed Vim in any terminal multiplexer of my choice and\ncombine it with various terminal programs. Every single part\nof that environment is easy to understand and easy to replace\nwith another program or script. It&#x27;s less homogenous and\nconsistent, but I am fine with that tradeoff. As one might guess\nI am not a big fan of IDEs.')
