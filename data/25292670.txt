It served them really well, and that they run quite lean in terms of hardware. But they&#x27;re built on Microsoft tech ($$$), and moving things to a traditional database=datastore cloud architecture would require a substantial change. Does anyone have resources they can point me to on the wisdom or folly of keeping this logic-in-database approach? It seems like the tradeoffs in the different approaches are all about where the smarts are, and whether you can horizontally scale those smarts. Does that sound accurate?')
