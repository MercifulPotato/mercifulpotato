Item(by='lukeramsden', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609613178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614361, text='&gt; I feel like they missed opportunities to replace Craigslist as the de facto online classifieds and to offer a payment system like Apple Pay. Perhaps these are only obvious in hindsight<p>I think they&#x27;re trying to rectify both of these exactly. I don&#x27;t know about in the US but here in the UK, Facebook Marketplace is pretty much now the de facto online classifieds site, at least for everybody I know. As for payments, they seem to be struggling more, but that is, I assume, one of the purposes of Diem (formerly Libra).')
