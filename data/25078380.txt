In theory, Cairo should give you accelerated OpenGL rendering, PDF rendering, GDK rendering, PNG rendering, Win32 rendering, etc behind a &quot;convenient&quot; PostScript-like interface. Thus, when these devices gets new features Cairo must also be updated to exploit these new features.<p>That was the <i>theory</i> behind Cairo. In practice it never worked out and Cairo wasn&#x27;t able to fully exploit hardware accelerated rendering. Cairo was very complex so it wasn&#x27;t easy for the maintainers to keep all the various backends up to date.')
