Slightly more complicated are the &quot;smoothed&quot; mosaics (from Minitel 2, IIRC) but they offer diagonal lines (and complement PETSCII and ATASCII symbols also introduced in version 13).<p>I expect 2x4&#x27;s to be available for version 14, but it&#x27;ll be a while.<p>2x3&#x27;s (and 2x4&#x27;s) are kind of funny, because you still won&#x27;t be able to use more than 2 colors per cell, so it works for cells with two colors but that can be subdivided in thirds (or quarters). Finding a best fit for a cell and a mosaic is not a trivial job.')
