If you have one person representing tens of millions and another person representing a small city (~150k people), and they have the same vote, it&#x27;s not meaningfully &quot;representative&quot;. Saying &quot;it&#x27;s a representative democracy&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the fairness of the system.<p>&gt; I agree with the way it was designed.<p>Because it favors you. It would be a bad system even if it was the other way around (i.e. it favored the other side).<p>&gt; It prevents big states like California and New York from calling all the shots.<p>I&#x27;m still to hear a good argument for why it&#x27;s <i>better</i> for small states to call shots instead.<p>&gt; I agree with the forefathers. You do not. Simple.<p>I&#x27;m fine with that. They were as fallible as anyone else and could not have foreseen that their system might have flaws. There&#x27;s no need to deify them and think that <i>everything</i> they did was right.')
