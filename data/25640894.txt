Therein lies the danger of monopolies.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m disappointed that no micropayment schemes have taken off yet.  I&#x27;m perfectly willing to contribute a few pennies to every site that I visit, but there&#x27;s no good way to do that today.  Instead, every time I read an interesting news article that gets forwarded to me by any of a couple of dozen separate paths, I end up at a different news site that I don&#x27;t have a subscription to.  Should I really have to have 100 subscriptions to news sites that I only read 1 or 2 articles from each month?  Some entity needs to aggregate this into a single convenient $30&#x2F;month subscription.  Ideally it would be standardised and be added on to my monthly internet bill (IETF standards ftw).')
