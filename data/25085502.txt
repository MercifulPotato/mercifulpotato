But admitting to a mistake is <i>good</i> – assuming people already know about the mistake, it&#x27;s <i>good press</i> to do so. (Especially if you&#x27;re <i>revealing</i> the mistake to them, when they haven&#x27;t already seen the mistake; if half of your mistakes are “oh, I messed up”, versus the same number of mistakes but they come out in newspapers first… which is going to look better for you?')
