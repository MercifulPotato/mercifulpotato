Is crowdsec faster&#x2F;lighter?<p>another question regarding backwards compatibility... eg porting fail2ban configs, action scripts, jails etc. I guess it’s not going to be a drop in replacement, but are there any porting efforts, recipes, scripts, docs to help with the transition?<p>sorry for the crappy formatting, but using my mobile atm and couldn’t wait to ask :)')
