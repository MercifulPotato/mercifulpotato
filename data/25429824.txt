Apparently ignoring the links as well.<p>Apple is one of the most common examples of planned obsolescence, so much so that nations (France especially) have recently gone about to sue and create laws to oppose their practices. So I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re using that example and also adding that it&#x27;s a large company like that is relevant <i>in any way shape or form</i>. The entire point of planned obsolescence is to make more money ffs. If anything, <i>that</i> is some strange mental gymnastics.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no point in me continuing to spend time refuting your mental-gymnastics&#x2F;weak-objections to science.<p>You haven&#x27;t spent a single minute refuting anything in any thread I&#x27;ve replied to you in. It&#x27;s all just hot air from you, every single time. If it doesn&#x27;t fit your free market narrative, like planned obsolescence this time, you just ignore it or dismiss it with extremely shallow cherry-picking.<p>&gt; As it is, you&#x27;re discounting Economics as a generally opted social science being used to manipulate the public for the interests of a capitalist elite,<p>Not really. I am however disagreeing with the notion that the &quot;free market&quot; objectively leads to the best outcome possible, so history should stops with free market Capitalism. That no more progress is possible. That a much more equal economical system, and thus society isn&#x27;t possible - &quot;because free market economics have said so!&quot;. And I do think that the field of economics is biased towards the current status quo due to the incentive structures that are present in that field, among with the fact that the current system is what is the core of what is actually studied.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re making these extreme conspiratorial allegations without having studied economics for yourself.<p>Yes. Most do. I disagree that it&#x27;s some &quot;extreme conspiratorial allegations&quot; think it&#x27;s very reasonable given the circumstances of that field.')
