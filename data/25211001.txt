Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606322012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209590, text='&gt; Iâ€™d like to do some angel funding of new concepts in private consumer healthcare that go around the system. Medical hacker stuff. For instance, you can buy an imaging ultrasound system from China for roughly the cost of a single ultrasound appointment. I think micro-MRI is achievable under $10k, mostly a problem of data analysis. X-rays of course could be very cheap if people could be trusted not to abuse them. DIY blood and urine testing could be nearly free.<p>The challenge here isn&#x27;t technological. As you point out, there are a lot of things you could do, but I&#x27;m not confident that the relevant lobbying groups won&#x27;t just pay off the government to ban whatever it is you want to do.<p>Corruption is more or less open the minute it gets too complex for the average person to understand, and healthcare regulation falls squarely into this bucket.  Name some protectionist, anti-patient, cost-increasing move the &quot;Patient Protection Act&quot; and half the idiot voters out there will support it. Specifically, the half of the country reflexively inclined to support any positive-sounding regulation instead of those reflexively  inclined to oppose it (most voters&#x27; brains consist almost entirely of these &quot;reflexes&quot;)')
