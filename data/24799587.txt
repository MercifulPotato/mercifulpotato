Let’s take your example of the face masks. You (scientists including) call stupid whenever people aren’t wearing the masks. Others (also including scientists) might say that wearing a mask is stupid (because it’s weakening your immune system).<p>Another example. If you’d be living in the Middle Ages and there would be a growing group believing the earth wasn’t flat, you’d be called stupid. Now, it’s the other way around.<p>Either way, stupidity is very subjective when applied at an intellectual level.<p>At a more practical level, stupid would be a child that just heard their parents say not to touch the furnace but still touches it and burns itself. One could call it stupid, but it’s also a way of learning, exploring and getting experience.<p>So even at this level, &#x27;stupid&#x27; is subjective')
