Of course politicians know how string together two sentences with nice sounding words to convey any meaning they want. But Ron never said a homeless of one colour is more homeless than any other colour. A hungry of one colour more hungry of any other colour. But if you want to put your words into any other person, that&#x27;s the start of a theocracy.<p>Many stuff about the climate change, are almost any other religion. And of covid too. Ron says many times hair raising stuff for the newly minted religion of the atheist left.<p>P.S. i personally eat the bark of the pine tree every day almost all day, specifically for climate change. If we make it economically viable to plant big trees in cities, because people will be benefiting from them as a food source, then climate may reverse in no time. But it may not be man made. And meat production is the worst for the climate, i am a vegan for years.')
