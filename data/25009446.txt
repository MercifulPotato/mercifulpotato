Item(by='Corazoor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604684442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008184, text='&gt; The word &quot;stoic&quot; has since come to mean &quot;unemotional&quot;<p>Only in colloqial use, and mostly among people who don&#x27;t bother to look up words they don&#x27;t know.<p>The (Oxford) Dictionary still says: &quot;enduring pain and hardship without showing one&#x27;s feelings or complaining.&quot;<p>When people infer meaning only by context(i.e. learning words only by how other people use it) it is easy to miss part of the original meaning. &quot;Hardship&quot; in this case.<p>It is a common occurance in language, and at some point the dictionary has to change accordingly. But if it&#x27;s a word that only exists to convey a more specific meaning than another word (&quot;unemotional&quot;), it does not suddenly lose that meaning just because people are uninformed about its proper definition.<p>Which is to say, the terms the ancient stoics used do not pertain to different concepts today. If so, we would lack the necessary word to describe that philosophy and would need to invent a new one.')
