You should be running your own authoritative DNS, it&#x27;s not hard. The only thing that can really happen to you is your registrar pulling your domain name, so you need to have a bunch registered piratebay-style. You should also own your IP space but that can be a bit pricey -- but once you own it it basically can&#x27;t ever be revoked and you can advertise it to whoever you wish.<p>2. I sincerely doubt Let&#x27;s Encrypt &#x2F; ISRG would blacklist a domain name for cert issuance. Even if they did there&#x27;s a whole lotta roots in the trust stores, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d find an issuer happy to make you a cert for a fee.<p>3. I deal with T1&#x2F;T2 carriers in $dayjob and I promise they don&#x27;t give a triangular shit about what you push through their pipes, given the constant stream of phishing&#x2F;spam&#x2F;ddos&#x2F;malware they&#x27;re happy to carry as long as someone pays the bills.')
