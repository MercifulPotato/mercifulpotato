Our history with Native Americans is not a morally uplifting one. It is also not a genocide. Given your apparent ignorance you may be surprised to know that of the hundreds of native American tribes, the vast majority were warlike and raped, enslaved, and pillaged their enemies. That’s how war works. For example, I live in Seattle. Do you know who owned slaves? Chief Seattle.<p>Also... I would like you to explain why you think I am trying to control the world by pointing out a historical fact? I assume by providing ahistorical facts yourself you are also trying to control the world?<p>Finally, I am exceptionally interested in how you know this didn’t affect me. It affected my immediate family, from brutal enslavement to torture and death. I don’t see how that matters, though. Am I to understand that one is only allowed to criticize things in which one has a personal stake? If that’s the case perhaps you should rethink telling me how to live my life, and what I’m trying to do.<p>P.S. Valley Forge Rocket is a super great name, BTW')
