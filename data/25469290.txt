For the record, Iâ€™m staying at home and I wear a mask. Save your accusations for those who actually advocate for behavior you disagree with.<p>My point is entirely that the perception of risk has had a huge impact on compliance for social distancing and mask wearing. The fact that 99% of those infected survive (age dependent) has had a negative impact on compliance. If this had been a pandemic with a higher CFR, then compliance would have been even higher. I have an extremely hard time imagining there being an anti-lockdown movement for an outbreak of Ebola, for example.')
