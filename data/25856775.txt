There definitely <i>are</i> more avenues than before.  But almost none of them pay any money.<p>Streaming has removed most small bands&#x27; way of making money, by selling CDs directly to their fans.  Most of them will just stream it, and won&#x27;t realise the tiny amount of revenue this generates for the artists.  Paying the artists you actually listen to - rather than slicing the cake up into infinitely small slices - needs to be looked at.  Most people assume their money goes to who they listen to, not the artists who everyone listens to the most.')
