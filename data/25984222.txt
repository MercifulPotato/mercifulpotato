It has a much nicer UI than NoiseTorch, supports a number of effects besides noise cancellation (if desired), supports auto-start, supports custom models (but has a good default included), doesn&#x27;t require a sudo password and doesn&#x27;t burn CPU if your mic isn&#x27;t being used.<p>The support in PulseEffects is new but has been working well for me. I have had zero issues and don&#x27;t even think about it anymore.')
