These cycles are measured using EEG devices but all the major SmartWatch vendors are adding predictive machine learning algorithms to generate the equivalent sleep cycles using optical heart rate data.<p>Continuous sleep cycle tracking might provide crucial insights related to optimal health.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41575-020-0340-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41575-020-0340-6</a>')
