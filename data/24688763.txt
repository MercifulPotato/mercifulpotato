Or well, not so much the complete history, but I do go looking for which commit introduced a particular line, what message went with that change, and what else changed with it.<p>Of course, that only works <i>after</i> you leave proper commits. The reason people don&#x27;t do that is because you only look at your commit history if you&#x27;ve kept it useful, but if you&#x27;ve never looked at your commit history because it&#x27;s not, you don&#x27;t know the benefits of keeping it useful.')
