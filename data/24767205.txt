Item(by='lostcolony', descendants=None, kids=[24767265], score=None, time=1602607119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767111, text='As I mentioned elsewhere, your use case likely mitigates the network failures. A given user is likely talking to only one node; you aren&#x27;t getting writes to one, reads to another, let alone conflicting writes across nodes. Nor are you dealing with anything where inconsistencies create real problems, such as dealing with real world money (your users are more likely to go &quot;Urgh, I thought I had enough X for that! Guess I have to go farm some more&quot;, not &quot;WHERE THE HELL IS MY MONEY?! I DEPOSITED $1k LAST NIGHT, WHERE IS IT !?&quot;). Nor have you solved your core problem better than an eventually consistent system would have (though possibly in a more energy efficient way, per your claim).<p>There&#x27;s also a bit of irony asking &quot;what do (I) think&quot;, and then objecting that my comments are made &#x27;without arguments&#x27;. No, there are pretty clear arguments, to which your only response is &quot;well, I have operated a successful MMO&quot;. I never said you didn&#x27;t, nor that a DB that handles partitions incorrectly can&#x27;t be useful (hell, I&#x27;ve written production systems reliant on Mnesia in Erlang, which in the event of a netsplit just...splits, and stays split, because it fit out use case). Just that your claim that &quot;CRDTs and Paxos like protocols don&#x27;t make any sense&quot;, and that just doing what you did is sufficient for any distributed system, is reflective of you, not of reality.')
