Item(by='javajosh', descendants=None, kids=[25610287], score=None, time=1609554493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609348, text='Hey, thanks so much for introducing me to the term &quot;akrasia&quot; because it works perfectly to describe a phenomena that happens to me as well. And my solution is similar, if admittedly much lower tech (I comment&#x2F;uncomment lines of my etc&#x2F;hosts file to switch modes).<p>But it was the rest of your post, describing the way in which you&#x27;re environment has morphed with you over the years, and how you&#x27;ve been able to really dial in your computing experience...it&#x27;s so striking! There are few people who can say the same. I certainly cannot. I have personally gone through perhaps 3 complete redos in my adult life. But it&#x27;s disruptive and bad, and I have to admit I feel some envy that you&#x27;ve been able to maintain a single coherent thread of evolution for so long. You must move around incredibly smoothly - I&#x27;d be curious to see a video of a few cycles of a build-test-debug cycle with your setup. I would also be curious to know how your file-system is organized. <i>That</i> seems to be the most difficult problem of all!')
