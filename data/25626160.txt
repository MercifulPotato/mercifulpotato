Item(by='sirlantis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609715334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623388, text='A too short or complete lack of an alternatives section has become red flag for me when reviewing proposals.<p>I often scroll to the alternatives section first thing to see whether at least a few alternatives were honestly evaluated. Too often I just find some bullet points with abstract URLs (without any summary for the reader) and a statement that they would not be as great as the proposed solution - or no section at all.<p>It becomes impossible to provide constructive feedback at that point. It leaves me with the dreaded “Have you considered Alternative X, Y, Z?” or a passive-aggressive “Could you do an unbiased research of alternatives against the requirements?”<p>Even though the alternatives section tends to be towards the end of the document it doesn’t mean that it should be filled out at the end.')
