It&#x27;s still evidence that the repository was intended to facilitate copyright infringement. The problem isn&#x27;t the words of the readme but what those words imply about what the authors of the code intended.<p>If they instead had released it and then said in a public forum &quot;check out my cool code for copyright infringement&quot; (but had a totally blameless README) that would be used as evidence in the same way.')
