Throw all the anti-maskers in jail?  Post law enforcement outside their houses to force them to quarantine? In fact, while the state technically has legal authority to get people to comply with mask mandates, they don&#x27;t literally have the ability to do so.  So, I would argue that the state doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;power&quot; to do anything here at all, or, at least that it hasn&#x27;t been demonstrated to date.')
