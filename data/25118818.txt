What makes deep fakes explainable and DKIM unexplainable?<p>If the journalists interests do not align about DKIM, how come they align about deepfakes?<p>I&#x27;m not saying journalists have any integrity. I&#x27;m just wondering why specifically for DKIM a &quot;throw the baby out with the bathwater&quot; solution is advocated, whereas for things like deep fake it isn&#x27;t -- where the underlying truth is the same: &quot;You can&#x27;t trust what you see&#x2F;hear&quot;.')
