Of course, tautologically, each new wave of tech has some differences in demographics, and old people are slow to learn new paradigms, and generations differ, BUT ultimately we have no idea if&#x2F;when there will be a new wave and how different its users will be. It might very well happen that the demographics donâ€™t change as much, as the programming profession is already one of the most fragmented and eclectic, and attracts people whose primary virtue is manipulating logical abstractions.')
