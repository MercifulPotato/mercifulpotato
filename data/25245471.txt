We start by going in one direction i.e. liberalism, then we realize that some pieces of authoritarianism might be good for a problem we currently have, so we water it down a bit.<p>Fast forward 50-70 years, we realize that the balance has swung too much to one side so we try to do a sharp turn. That action causes an overcompensation which is when revolution and violence happen. Finally we end up back at some sort of liberalism and the circle begins anew.<p>I see it as a result of generation gap. We don&#x27;t know the value of something until we lose it. Right now the public doesn&#x27;t value freedom of speech as much as it used to so we are right on track to have it more limited.')
