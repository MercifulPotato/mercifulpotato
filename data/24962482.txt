I think a lot of times more junior folks thing more senior folks know things, when actually they just spend a lot of time researching things. But I&#x27;ve found it hard to describe how to do that. It&#x27;s much easier for me to describe how some technique &#x2F; algorithm &#x2F; API works than to describe how figure that out from first principles. But it&#x27;s much more important to learn how to figure things out than it is to learn any specific thing.')
