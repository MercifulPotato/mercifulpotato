Shared mutable state and multiple ownership via automated reference counting are legitimate patterns in a system programming language, and using Rc, Cell, RefCell, etc. enables these patterns in a way that preserves memory safety. That&#x27;s pretty close to ideal, especially when compared to what you often see in C&#x2F;C++.')
