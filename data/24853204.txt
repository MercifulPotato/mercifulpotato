Pumping heat up is effectively compressing this time horizon - resulting in a difference in rate of heat added.  Now if that geothermal energy was replacing nuclear or fossil fuel use, then it might be a wash.  But as soon as that energy replaces hydro, wind, or solar (which don&#x27;t add new heat to the atmosphere - just use heat already there) - then we would increase the rate of heat energy being added to the atmosphere.')
