Find out what it really is and the rest of the puzzle will be easy to assemble. That induction is related to magnetic induction and is similar to how a solenoid induces current in another solenoid.<p>But as we know, studying that effect is a big no no, and the treat of being called a heretic (or crackpot) is how scientists are kept away from psychiatry.')
