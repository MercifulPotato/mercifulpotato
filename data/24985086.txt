But it is an additional tool. I much, much prefer the written word for communicating ideas about code and technical concepts. I cannot stand videos about programming topics, and I&#x27;m frustrated by how frequently they&#x27;re the definitive source on a topic. They do not feel as effective for me.<p>While I understand why others might like videos, I really hope they stop catching on so hard.
