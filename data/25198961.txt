They&#x27;d been saying that they just &quot;aren&#x27;t good at math&quot; for so long that they couldn&#x27;t bring themselves to try. If you could convince them that they could do what you were asking them to do, it was pretty straight forward to walk them through the math itself.<p>My wife is a special education teacher now, and experiences the same phenomenon.  She has students who really do struggle, but for a lot of them, it&#x27;s just a matter of convincing them to actually look at the problem and the tools&#x2F;patterns they have been taught.<p>Is is incredibly destructive when people (including teachers) present math as some sort of black magic that they won&#x27;t touch with ten foot pole.  There are a lot of students out there for whom math isn&#x27;t necessarily immediately intuitive, or who simply had a rough school year at the wrong time and fell behind.  When those students hear others dismiss mathematics it validates them doing the same, and the next generation looses one more potential scientist.<p>As you may have noticed, this is an issue close to my heart.<p>&#x2F;end rant')
