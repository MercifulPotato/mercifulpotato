I used to do that ages ago with Ruby on Rails, and that worked very well. We still had our complex reporting queries in SQL, and that was no problem. The point is that if you use an ORM, your database needs to be optimised for that ORM. Bolting an ORM onto an existing database is a recipe for disaster.')
