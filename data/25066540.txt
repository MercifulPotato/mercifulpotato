The vision for Config.ly is slightly different than what I think you described. In my mind there&#x27;s &quot;ENV VAR&quot; which are secrets and has things like Doppler or many of the other things mentioned here.<p>I view Config.ly as being useful for _anything you&#x27;d put in a class variable_. For example text copy or styling. And if you put it in Config.ly instead of hardcoding, you can avoid deploying which can be slow (e.g. for iOS it&#x27;s days) -- and potentially even avoid having developers do the work altogether.<p>Does that make sense or do you view it differently?')
