I’m assuming you are talking about setting up a Synapse server, not the Element web client.<p>I’ll admit, the documentation isn’t perfect. But it’s pretty good, and they should be able to set it up. There’s a few things I think could be more explicit in the docs, but even a mediocre set of sys-admin skills should be able to fill in the gaps.<p>I’m not an IT guy, or a sys-admin.
