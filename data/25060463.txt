Consider two VPNs, one of which promises never to misuse client-side IP data, while the other refuses to store that data in the first place. If both VPNs are infiltrated by a bad actor, the one that doesn&#x27;t store data can guarantee slightly more privacy than the one that keeps data but promises not to use it.<p>Similar case: I think it&#x27;s interesting to note that German usage of Tor dropped off when the Snowden revelations took place, while many other countries experienced greater uptake. Perhaps they recognized that Tor may not be as secure as it&#x27;s claimed to be -- especially considering who initially funded it.<p>If you want an encryption product&#x2F;service to be truly secure, you can&#x27;t buy it on reputation alone. You have to think about where it came from and how it works.')
