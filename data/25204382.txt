Garfield was never funny for me as a kid. Never.<p>Are you comfortable sharing roughly how old you are? Or the era of Garfield comics you were reading, if you weren&#x27;t getting them via a newspaper. I&#x27;m interested because I really liked Garfield as a kid, but now find it depressingly, cynically formulaic and boring. Obviously I was much more easily pleased back then, but I think there was a certain period when Garfield comics were significantly more vibrant and creative and varied than the rut they eventually settled into. I&#x27;m not sure whether the end of this period coincided with Davis farming out the creation of the comic to a sweatshop; my guess is that it predated it, but I don&#x27;t know the exact dates.<p>edit: I&#x27;m not sure if it literally made me laugh, though, even as a child. I think I (somehow) enjoyed the world and the characters more than the punchlines. I read them in books rather than in a daily paper, which helped; an unfunny strip didn&#x27;t have to bear any weight, you could pass right over it, take in any narrative&#x2F;character development in a few seconds and move on.')
