Everyone who sat out of the market since 2011 loudly shouting about a bubble (I know more than a few of these types)....have a ton of regret and what&#x27;s more... they&#x27;re paralyzed by loss aversion, fear, and cling to P&#x2F;E as justification they&#x27;re doing the right thing.<p>If you can&#x27;t draw out painfully obvious trends over the next decade and invest against those, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. Sure if I buy $AMZN at $3k today, it might drop to $2k next month. But I will bet <i>a ton</i> of money it will be far, far higher at the end of this decade.
