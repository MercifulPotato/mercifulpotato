Everyone is deluding themselves otherwise. Nearly everyone with significant power is nihilistic. Without god (and even if there was a god) there are no morals. All we have is genetics. Morals are just bias.<p>Using nihilism as a negative descriptor is funny when nihilism as a philosophy isn&#x27;t against or for anything.<p>Reality is of course uncomfortable for most people which is why I&#x27;m getting downvoted :)')
