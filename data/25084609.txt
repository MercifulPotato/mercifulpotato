Item(by='artursapek', descendants=None, kids=[25085800], score=None, time=1605287827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084449, text='The tragic thing is, it&#x27;s much easier to measure &quot;coronavirus deaths&quot; and &quot;coronavirus cases&quot; than it is to measure the price we pay to minimize those things. It&#x27;s your typical case of over-optimizing for a single KPI and losing the bigger picture.<p>The measures we&#x27;ve taken are deteriorating society in more subtle ways, and there are deaths and suffering indirectly caused by these measures. They are just not easy to sum up. How many people have killed themselves because of the lockdowns and economic problems? I know of at least one. How many people in third world countries are starving as a result of it? I&#x27;ve read millions. How many families are being torn apart due to increased divorces? These kinds of effects pay out their harm over longer periods of time, and in less obvious ways. We aren&#x27;t tracking those on a widget on TV.<p>Because the pro-lockdown, pro-authoritarian case is so much easier to back with clear and obvious numbers the government and media are able to easily manipulate the population, most of whom won&#x27;t consider the trade-offs, into conformity. This is so sad to watch.')
