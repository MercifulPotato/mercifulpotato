The differences were that he didn&#x27;t have the locker room talk (that I know of), and he didn&#x27;t have the dictatorial tendencies (that I know of).  But he was an insurgent from outside the party (he wasn&#x27;t a Democrat, though he may have joined the party in 2016 for his run).  In the same way, Trump wasn&#x27;t really a Republican.  (He did join the party, but somewhat recently.)  Yes, I realize that this is degenerating into No True Scotsman, but both were outsiders who tried to hijack the parties.  Trump succeeded, Bernie failed because the Democratic Party manipulated things and the Republican Party let things happen.<p>The groundwork has been laid, on both sides.  And the Democrats got raked over the coals for tilting the scales against Bernie, so they might not do it next time.')
