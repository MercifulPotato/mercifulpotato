Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604121267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948593, text='&gt; Just so you know, you&#x27;re effectively complaining that people care about you too much<p>I&#x27;m sure <i>someone</i> cares, but the majority of such folks? Nope.<p>I was once watching a crappy move, but it had one gem in it. The protagonist had lost the use of his leg in the Civil war, and he sought compensation for it, and received a lot easier than expected. Throughout the movie, he keeps wondering why it was so easy to get the money - he expected a fight. Towards the end, the revelation hit. They didn&#x27;t pay him because they cared about him. They did it because they wanted to feel better about themselves. They did it so that they could walk away feeling tall.<p>And so it is with most advice: They do it because it makes them feel like they&#x27;ve done a good deed, and who knows - someone may even benefit from it? If they didn&#x27;t, then no harm done.<p>That last sentence is quite wrong, though.<p>After hearing this, I got fairly good at figuring out who is trying to help vs who is trying to walk away tall. A little extra engagement with the person can usually reveal this.<p>I&#x27;ve learned from enough experience - both in giving and in receiving advice - that when you try to help someone, you should take on the burden on yourself. It becomes your responsibility to understand the pain points of the other person, know what he&#x27;s tried, etc. This is exactly what random advice typically isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s well known that saying &quot;I had a similar problem&quot; and talking about it is not empathizing[1]<p>One of the worst jobs I had involved a very knowledgeable person who would try to give advice whenever I was stuck. His advice often didn&#x27;t work because he didn&#x27;t understand the problem well, and made assumptions, etc. Every time he tried to help it was a huge time sink - to the point that I would mention my problems only when he wasn&#x27;t around. Not exactly analogous to this situation, except to point out that this person never really understood the burden of helping someone. When you help someone, work with the person till the problem is resolved (or till you can&#x27;t help). He failed as a teammate because of this.<p>(For those who recognize the movie - yes, I am taking liberties).<p>[1] Seriously - this is standard advice you&#x27;ll find everywhere: When someone tells you their problems, do not respond with how similar your problems were - took me years to understand why.')
