I loathe to be overly negative since I realize I&#x27;m probably not the smartest person in the room so I might have overlooked something, but...<p>1) My findings are that you can&#x27;t ever predict future stock performance based on historical data, no matter how many tests&#x2F;trials&#x2F;algorithms you run. The reason for this is because we, as mere mortal humans, just simply can&#x27;t predict the future -- no matter how much we try to obfuscate this fact with math and data science, unless you&#x27;re modeling every single thing that&#x27;s happening on the planet at the same time and have created a singularity or something, you just can&#x27;t. This means there is always something potentially lurking around the corner that can absolutely destroy your returns. Now, can you have success in the short&#x2F;medium term? Maybe. You have a chance to come out a winner in Vegas too.<p>2) The difference between simulated trades and real trades is actually quite significant. Every real trade you make on the market, no matter how small and&#x2F;or insignificant you think it is, actually does have a real impact on the market. This is where I find it typically goes sideways when people come up with algorithms based on historical data. An analogy for this is voting -- you might feel that your one single vote doesn&#x27;t matter, but the fact that everyone voted is everything. You can&#x27;t easily simulate this as far as I can think of.')
