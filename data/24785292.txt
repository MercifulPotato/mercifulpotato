It uses maven to build. I have it under git version control with git submodules. I don&#x27;t have to context switch in Eclipse. I can do all of that without leaving the IDE at all. I can start a project, download all the dependencies, hover over methods to see javadocs, and I even have a terminal tab if I need anything like npm on the command line. All without leaving Eclipse.<p>The fact that you can do the same thing in your tool of choice, IntelliJ, further refutes the author&#x27;s point 2. You and I arguing about which we prefer is beside the point being made by the author.<p>Elegance is subjective. The fact that there is a &quot;huge community of existing developers&quot; means Java is objectively more approachable to more people. Yet another way to look at it as elegant.<p>I don&#x27;t smoke. You&#x27;ve reinforced my points in favor of Java.')
