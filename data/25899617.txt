After I drive it home, I plug it in. Except when I&#x27;m lazy, it&#x27;s basically never below a couple hundred miles of range remaining.<p>Rolling blackouts wouldn&#x27;t really cause an issue, and when I&#x27;ve experienced blackouts, it&#x27;s never been a problem. When the power is on, the car would charge back to the limit I set (I usually keep it at 80% charged to preserve the battery, which is still nearly 250 miles of range). When the power is out, it&#x27;s anyway very rare that I drive hundreds of miles in a day and actually <i>need</i> to charge — and as other posters have mentioned, you could hit up a charging station that isn&#x27;t in a blackout at that point.<p>When I owned a gas car, getting below 50%, or even below 25%, was completely normal. So I can see how if you&#x27;re used to gas cars, it would seem worrying that there might be a blackout: how do you &quot;refill&quot; if you&#x27;re low? But the truth of electric car ownership, at least in my experience, is you basically never go below 50% charge in daily use. So the idea that you&#x27;d likely get stuck at some point because the power went out just isn&#x27;t really a concern.<p>IMO assuming you have home charging (either a garage in a house, or if your apartment building offers chargers) — which to be fair is a reasonably big if — electric is much, much more convenient than gas. You never have to stop at a gas station equivalent in your day-to-day life, since you just plug the car in when you get home, like you&#x27;d charge a phone overnight. You barely need to do any maintenance, because the moving parts are so simple. And electricity is much cheaper than gas.<p>For people without access to home charging, I think EVs are currently more annoying than gas cars. But not because of blackouts: it&#x27;s just because charging to full is considerably slower than filling a tank of gas. If you&#x27;re not able to have it charge at home while you&#x27;re asleep, regularly hitting up charging stations and waiting is annoying.')
