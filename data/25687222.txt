Item(by='nathansmith2017', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610127234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25683586, text='So, lets assume this is price manipulation is true.\nIf they print tether, and buy BTC&#x2F;USDT on an exchange than someone else has to go long the other side (USDT&#x2F;BTC). When 600 mil of USDT was printed and was used to purchase 600 mil of BTC&#x2F;USDT, then who purchased 600 mil USDT&#x2F;BTC.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense that people who want to cash out of BTC at a certain price level will cash out through USDT because there is no exchange to redeem USDT to USD directly. You have to cash out through USD&#x2F;BTC or USD&#x2F;ETH.<p>There are arbs traders who maintain the peg the USD&#x2F;USDT, but arbs traders will always attempt to have a net 0 position, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for them to hold tether either. Defi flash loans like AAVE and byz offer 0 collateral loans. If they are not using flash loans, then they will post collateral with USD (as this is presumably how they want profits) to short whatever ticker they need to short for the arb play.<p>If bitfinex and tether keep printing tether, someone is holding all this tether. A lot of this is probably held in defi liquidity pools and AMM pools, but the total reserves in these exchanges (Compound, curve, dydx...) is far less than the 600 million printed.<p>Perhaps the same institutions printing are the last holders, but Why would tether and bifinex hold their tether if it is truly a scam? I am confused as to who the last holders of tether are, if people are swapping tether for BTC and BTC for USD. Most people that buy tether (other than people supplying liquidity pools) do so to swap to another token for a real potential of gains, since Tether will never gain in value significantly with a 1:1 peg.')
