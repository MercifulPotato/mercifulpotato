For the Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech vaccine, the numbers were lower: Severe side effects included fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2%).<p>Typically these will be included on the official government sites once the vaccine is approved, so we should see it shortly.<p>As for long-term side-effects, none have been found. Long-term side effects (so things that may occur within a month or two of the vaccine, but last a long time) are <i>extremely</i> rare. You can really only say there have <i>likely</i> they&#x27;ve occurred in two different vaccines in the last 50 years, and even those were a tiny, tiny percentage (Like 0.001%) of the people vaccinated. Keep in mind billions of vaccines are given annually.<p>Long-term effects the are delayed in occurring past two months have never been found in the entire history of vaccines, so you won&#x27;t find any data on it.')
