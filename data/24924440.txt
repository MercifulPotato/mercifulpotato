I didn&#x27;t realize they were soliciting submissions for those. That&#x27;s a cool idea, I&#x27;ll look into it, thanks.<p>I&#x27;d probably have gotten the Moonlander if it was available when I got the ErgoDox, especially because of the thinness. Having slightly fewer keys wouldn&#x27;t bug me too much though... it would be easy to move some functionality I&#x27;m using now to a different layer. If I had one, the easiest adaptation would probably be to move PgUp&#x2F;PgDn&#x2F;Home&#x2F;End to my arrow layer on both halves, which I&#x27;ve actually been thinking about anyway.')
