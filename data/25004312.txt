Shouldn&#x27;t the purpose of schooling (especially higher education) be <i>learning things</i>, and not maximizing your score on arbitrary measurements of &quot;performance&quot;? I think it obviously should be, but that&#x27;s not the game, because its non-trivial to measure and counter to the raison detre of the system at large. The very phrase &quot;Competitive School&quot; is a perversion.')
