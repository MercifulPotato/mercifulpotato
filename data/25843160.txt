In our case this is largely due to the lack of face to face whiteboard discussions, being unable to have two or three people look through a bunch of code or design together, the ad-hoc conversations and face time with colleagues. It now takes far longer to thrash out thorny technical and design issues than it did in 2019.<p>With revenues falling last year, my company decided to slash salaries and close several roles. This obviously led to a much greater workload for everyone else, and people getting increasingly burned out.<p>As the exodus continues, the senior management decided to pivot towards building and selling more features to increase revenues, instead of taking a look at how to stabilize the teams and stop the blood-letting, hence more pressure on the remaining engineers to deliver features, leading to much lower quality, more bugs and more pressure.<p>The situation can be salvaged, though, if we are able to get real about the situation with the engineering teams, scale back our commitments and hire for some key roles where people resigned last year.')
