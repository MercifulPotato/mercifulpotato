Item(by='formerly_proven', descendants=None, kids=[25450078], score=None, time=1608151688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446474, text='&gt; The main cross platform open source offerings are GTK and Qt.<p>Not really. Gtk UX just isn&#x27;t an acceptable standard outside Gnome and seems to have approximately ~nil cross-platform share apart from GIMP and perhaps one or two more apps. There are really only two cross-platform toolkits that enable an acceptable level of UX: Qt Widgets and wxWidgets. wx has a smaller and generally more limited selection of widgets and some quibbles (awkward APIs, poor rich text support, docs aren&#x27;t that great), while Qt Widgets is more on the &quot;does it all&quot; side of things, but that means it&#x27;s less simple. E.g. a model-backed list is pretty darn simple in wx, but wx is also quite limited. Meanwhile Qt requires you to understand a relatively large model API and more code for basic models, but on the flipside it&#x27;s also much more powerful. For anti-bloaters, Qt has a larger binary size than wx. wx has a bunch of stuff that only works on one platform or the other and there are a number of behavioral differences as well, since it mostly wraps an underlying toolkit. Qt tends to have largely uniform behavior and features across all platforms.<p>FWIW all of these (Qt, wxWidgets, Gtk) are LGPL.')
