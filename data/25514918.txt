So, the best thing to look at is the chipset, and its specs.<p>The best example of this is the scam called &quot;enterprise servers&quot; whose only distinction from no-name OEM ones is that &quot;enterprise server&quot; name, and 3-4 times bigger price. They are all made of sometimes 1-to-1 identical motherboards, chassis, and other components.')
