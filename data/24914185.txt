Why? There are already open source  versions for synthesis and PnR , and while functional they are very far off the &#x27;terrible&#x27; EDA tools everyone rags on Xilinx for. The reality is SystemVerilog is a huge language, and already an open standard yet no open source project supports it fully, so I don&#x27;t believe for a second if bitstreams were opened we&#x27;d see a load of top class tooling appear for synthesis and PnR. The reason is if it has not happened for the first (and arguably easiest) step in the chain i.e. System Verilog, they why would it happen for the others?')
