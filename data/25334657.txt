Earning a SF wage but living elsewhere is great.  But there is a flip side to this coin.  As employees realize they can work from home, employers also realize they can have employees work from home.  They will soon realize they don&#x27;t need to pay SF wages.  Those who convert their in-office jobs into work-from-home are a covid oddity.  Those who will be hired in the future on the assumption that they will always work remotely will likely face much lower wages.  I predict a race for the bottom.')
