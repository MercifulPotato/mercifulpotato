I figured out pretty quickly that for every physical interface I replaced, I still needed a manual override. For example: I could have eliminated wall switches when I was seeking to automate my lights based on presence and time. Instead, I chose some Zigbee wall switches that used an internal relay. Even if the house turned the lights off, you could still walk over to the wall and turn the light on. In infrastructure automation I generally have the same sort of concept just for different reasons. I imagine Tesla needs something similar.<p>Edit: Just did some further reading and manual overrides are present in Teslas. It&#x27;s safe to say Dr Awan didn&#x27;t know how to use it, or didn&#x27;t think to use it in a panic. Education and accessibility sound key here.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;teslas-electric-cars-might-not-green-think&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;teslas-electric-cars-might-not...</a>')
