In my definition, the idea for Google was: &quot;Get advertisers to pay for a free information portal.&quot; That idea doesn&#x27;t seem much different to &quot;Advertisers pay for a free newspaper&quot;, which was common practice at the time. Similarly, &quot;Advertisers pay for free classified ads&quot; was common, too, but it&#x27;s how Facebook started out. &quot;Pay for a car ride&quot; = Uber also doesn&#x27;t seem that new. Or how about &quot;Rent out rooms for money&quot; = AirBnb.<p>In my opinion, all of those are ideas that aren&#x27;t really new. But they were executed in a new way and that made all the difference.<p>HomeAway was already well-known and successful at the time when AirBnb was founded. But the latter reached more potential landlords, due to their specific execution.<p>I remember using AltaVista for years before I ever heard about Google. So their business idea and business model wasn&#x27;t new. Their initial execution was incredible, though.<p>And before I heard of Facebook, I was using MySpace, which was kind of the same basic idea, but pretty badly executed. Until 2 years after the iPhone came out, MySpace was actually larger than Facebook. So my guess would be that it was Facebook&#x27;s superior execution of their mobile experience that crowned them.')
