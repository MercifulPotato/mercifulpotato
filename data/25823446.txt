Many people posting here work for startups using micro services (for which Go is a decent fit) and for companies close to the whole Docker&#x2F;Kubernetes ecosystem, which is based on Go. So naturally they assume Go is huge.<p>My anecdata kind of tells me that Go is reasonably big, but it&#x27;s not yet near .NET and Java, worldwide. But it could get there in a few years, I&#x27;ve seen&#x2F;heard about some enterprises adopting it.')
