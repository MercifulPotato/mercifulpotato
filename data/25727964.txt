When the images to merge are represented as a graph of connected pixels, you can use the minimum cut algorithm to try to find the lowest energy path that cuts across both images<p>This minimises the differences between the images along the seam so they appear to blend together<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cc.gatech.edu&#x2F;~turk&#x2F;my_papers&#x2F;graph_cuts.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cc.gatech.edu&#x2F;~turk&#x2F;my_papers&#x2F;graph_cuts.pdf</a>')
