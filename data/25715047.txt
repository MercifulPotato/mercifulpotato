Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610289967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704201, text='&gt; We should be far more worried that Twitter gave the president a free ride for so long<p>Twitter has given and continues to give people just as or even more deranged than Trump free rides. They don&#x27;t care, because either a) they agree with those people or b) censoring those people could give them bad publicity and could hurt their ad revenue.<p>Meanwhile, people like Trump get banned all the time because their politics are okay to ban according to the advertisers&#x2F;investors&#x2F;media&#x2F;population Twitter wants to please. Trump himself stood this long because, even if the people twitter wants&#x2F;needs to please hate him, his tweets made them money—even from the people who hate him, who nonetheless hang onto his every word—by virtue of being the president of the USA and thus having far more reach than the usual &quot;right wing nutjob&quot;.<p>Twitter waited until now to ban him because in their calculations, I presume, losing less than two weeks of money that Trump&#x27;s insane stream of thoughts might give them is compensated by the good publicity of this making them look righteous in front of everyone else.<p>Sadly it works, even here in HN everyone forgets the usual narrative of &quot;these corporations are evil, let&#x27;s break them down and&#x2F;or regulate them more heavily, and, for the love of God, let&#x27;s stop their sinister spying on us&quot;, and starts defending these monopolies like no tomorrow as soon as they censor&#x2F;ban someone they don&#x27;t like. Even if it&#x27;s a completely meaningless gesture like this one.')
