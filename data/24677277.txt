This tech was also was supposed to suffer from burn in problems.  And in fact, just recently I noticed that the Ubuntu screen that manage this TV&#x27;s content with was starting to burn in where the Icon array is along the top.  So, what I should have done in the first place, I did now, which is make that icon automatically hide when the mouse isn&#x27;t near.  And now, about three months later, that burn in image is now imperceptible.  The screen&#x27;s colors are still as fabulous as they were in 2010 but the 720p aspect is starting to feel like a hinderance but one of the best buys I&#x27;ve ever made.')
