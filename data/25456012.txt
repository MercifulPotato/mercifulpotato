Microsoft has had a long-standing relationship with the DoD (and the NSA especially) and their Azure-on-prem offering has been around for almost a decade. AWS-on-prem is still new and even if it can be pulled off flawlessly there&#x27;s not the track record of managing issues without calling in AWS employees. The content on JEDI will be far more highly classified than whatever is on AWS&#x27; us-gov regions... sufficiently classified that &quot;mere AWS employees&quot; won&#x27;t be allowed to touch the systems once they go online.<p>One nice &quot;feature&quot; of JEDI is that it&#x27;s not a ten year lock-in for the Pentagon.  It&#x27;s certainly possible that five years in the bean counters in the five-sized puzzle palace could conclude that they made the wrong decision and pivot at that time... and that AWS will eventually be the winner even if they don&#x27;t get the contract for now.')
