Apple removed the T2&#x2F;integrated it into the M1 and didn&#x27;t lock down things any further. If they were going to lock it down, this would have been the time for it, given there&#x27;s no Bootcamp for Apple Silicon. Yet Apple specifically allows you to sign custom kernels offline on Apple Silicon Macs.<p>People also seem to be convinced that the T2 was a &quot;locking down&quot; measure, while all that&#x27;s really missing is a Linux driver to interface with the T2. Surely Apple doesn&#x27;t care at all about actively supporting Linux (and publishing specs), but they also don&#x27;t lock this down.<p>The only support I see for the idea that Apple will &quot;lock down Macs&quot; is that for some reason they&#x27;re irrationally hell bent on turning Macs into iPads. I don&#x27;t see how that idea holds up if you inspect it closely though.')
