I didn&#x27;t research the temp requirements that deep myself yet. Instead I worked from what I read online and in the press. Which is also the way it works in Germany. Now I am intrigued so, I will see what I can find.<p>EDIT: This really is frustrating. Either I am unable to google stuff or there really is no data sheet on the Biontech vaccine available online. All I found is nice pictures and text without numbers at Pfizer&#x27;s website and second hand interviews of Biontech CFO saying the vaccine can be stored up to 5 days in a fridge. Real transparency doesn&#x27;t seem to be a thing with everything Covid-19.')
