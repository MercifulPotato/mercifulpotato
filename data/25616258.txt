In addition the virus hit at a point where farmers couldn&#x27;t sell their crops and earn enough to buy seeds and fertilizer for the next year[1] China was also badly hit by the African Swine flue, resulting in a loss of 40%(!) of the Chinese pigs[1] which of course is not great for the pork prices.<p>You can also see [2] but note that this is by a former political prisoner so it is biased. This article [3] says that the answer is that China is not facing a famine nownow, but may do so in the future and the the leader is running the campaign because most of the food is imported.<p>They all seem to unanimously agree that prices have gone up, in some cases (pork) dramatically so (but the increasing prize of meat will not a famine make).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;salgilbertie&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;28&#x2F;china-food-crisis-rising-domestic-prices-and-large-import-purchases-send-a-signal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;salgilbertie&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;28&#x2F;china-f...</a>  \n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moderndiplomacy.eu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;is-china-on-the-brink-of-a-food-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moderndiplomacy.eu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;is-china-on-the-brink-...</a>  \n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;international&#x2F;516607-another-famine-coming-china-struggles-to-meet-basic-food-demands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;international&#x2F;516607-another-fam...</a>  \n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;china-food-security-and-geopolitics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;china-food-security-and-geop...</a>')
