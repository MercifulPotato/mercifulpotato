All &quot;commitments&quot; are constrained by some undefined or impossible exception. Defining &quot;unduly&quot; would be even considerably easy compared to finding a definition for what could be meant by &quot;harm humanity&quot; or be &quot;for the benefit of all&quot;. The last constrain is nonsense in itself actually, or does &quot;all&quot; except Microsoft who would not benefit if they wouldn&#x27;t got an exclusive contract? Not to mention all the people who will lose their jobs as those jobs will be replaced by AI eventuallyâ€¦ They didn&#x27;t say &quot;all equally&quot; which would make at least some little bit sense.')
