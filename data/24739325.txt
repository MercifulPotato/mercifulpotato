It is almost always cheaper to go with a cheap MVNO plan and pay for your phone outright, you will come out ahead instead of paying $80-$100 a month with a major carrier while getting a &quot;free&quot; phone with the caveat you have to stick with them for 2 years. Its all engineered to get you to spend more money, if you look at the prices on MVNOs you will realize you are getting scammed - I pay $10&#x2F;month for my minimal cellular plan through redpocket and getting more data only costs tens of dollars more, it doesn&#x27;t come close to tmobile&#x27;s prices.')
