Going after any of the top 5 companies in the S&amp;P500 is going to negatively impact the stock market.  Ergo, I also doubt we will see any anti-trust activity originating from this administration.<p>But this conversation is a bit irrelevant since the current administration probably has less than four months left in office, which is not enough time to put anything together. I don&#x27;t expect a settlement from anyone either, so we are looking at several years worth of investigations and subsequent lawsuits, appeals, etc.')
