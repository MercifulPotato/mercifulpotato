It&#x27;s very likely that looking only at this 3 commits will help you find the issue because they might be part of much bigger branch which would otherwise be squashed to one huge commit with enormous diff.<p>I much more prefer to require that PR&#x27;s branches are always merged without fast forwarding. So there is always merge commit for PR. Then you can actually display list of this commit with &quot;git log --first-parent&quot; and they should always build because build server verifies it.<p>Unfortunately &quot;--first-parent&quot; doesn&#x27;t work for &quot;git bisect&quot; now, but it finally will in the next git release!
