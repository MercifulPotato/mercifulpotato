Why don&#x27;t you put in the work to find a solution instead of demanding others do it for you?<p>Besides, plenty of work has already gone into proposing solutions to monopolies, it&#x27;s more likely that you just don&#x27;t like any of them. What must be done now? To me it seems the best thing is for you to come up with a solution you like, since only you know best.')
