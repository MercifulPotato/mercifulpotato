A 2WD Tundra or F150 with King Cab style 4 doors is only a couple grand less than the Cybertruck. A year of gas savings puts you ahead of the game in the Cybertruck.<p>With the Hummer at $110,000? All that goes out the door. You can buy a loaded to the gills gas guzzler and pay for 10 years of gas and still have $10,000 in the bank.<p>Ultimately the Cybertruck is the sort of EV which <i>might</i> hit mass adoption. The price is decent, Tesla has the brand to carry it, so long as the truck delivers on it&#x27;s promises, I can see the Cybertruck being a huge hit. The Hummer is destined to ship a few thousand in the first couple years, then gather dust in showrooms.')
