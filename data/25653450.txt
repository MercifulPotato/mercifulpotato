It does sound like the frontend codebase is organized in a way that you hate, but maybe not necessarily a shitshow. I&#x27;d say give it time, and maybe try to make friends with one of the frontend people, to perhaps gain insight why things are done the way they are.<p>Eventually if you bang your head on this enough it should become less frustrating, though you will probably always hate parts of it like the super DRYness. And I&#x27;m with you, clever code sucks. Some frontend people really like the golf, I don&#x27;t know why.')
