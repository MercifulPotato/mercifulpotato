Item(by='vosper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603412597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864686, text='It&#x27;s Typescript for the immediate future. It&#x27;s where the resources are (Microsoft, etc), it&#x27;s where the type definitions are for the libraries you want to use (don&#x27;t underestimate this one!), and it&#x27;s where the developers and jobs are. For a lot of people it&#x27;s a big enough step up over JS (while still being very familiar) that it&#x27;s more than good enough.<p>Elm, Purescript, and Reason will likely all remain niche, or die off. Some developers will springboard from Typescript into these languages (but probably not Elm, sadly I think it&#x27;s doomed, and not for being a bad language) but most people will I think be fairly content.<p>Perhaps something will come out of leftfield, but I can&#x27;t see something like Rust-with-better-ergonomics taking that much mindshare from Typescript. A JS dev can start with Typescript today, in their existing codebase, and be productive either immediately, or within a few days. It&#x27;s pretty hard to beat that, though I&#x27;m sure there will be niches for the various other compile-to-JS or compile-to-WASM options.')
