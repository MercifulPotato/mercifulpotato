I think the basic obvious progression is that the client side has shouldered more &amp; more responsibility, that architectures have shifted away from being server side, &amp; few folk have figured out how to make the server relevant. it does a tiny bit of business logic &amp; mostly just crud operations on data. trying to do like we did, keep rendering &amp; a lot of the client state on the server- it wasn&#x27;t helpful, was a bad way of doing things. these choices of languages became irrelevant as the client side rose in prevalence, capabilities, &amp; yes too, somewhat, performance, but mainly I chalk it up to a long long struggle to find suitable architectures. I don&#x27;t think this is fair accompli, that it&#x27;s all decided, but server side needs to radically change it&#x27;s game if it wants to become relevant again.')
