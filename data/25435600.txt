Even if I can get to my parent&#x27;s city, I can&#x27;t get to their house (without walking many km). Since there isn&#x27;t good transit (and never has been), they need a place with plenty of space to store a car, and there is no downside to getting way out where transit is hard to serve since transit doesn&#x27;t serve the types of places they go anyway.<p>The fix is not easy. But building taj mahal type trains isn&#x27;t helpful. (simplistic trains might be - using the lower cost to build more is useful).  Those of you watching local politics need to scream &quot;NO EXTRAS, only the cheap reliable system done fast&quot; at all local meetings to counter those asking for beauty.')
