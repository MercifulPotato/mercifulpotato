(I don&#x27;t know the answer to this question).<p>Every multinational company of a sufficient size is going to have &quot;an office&quot; in a major developed country.<p>The question to me is whether or not that office is employing more than the minimum required for the company to sell products in that country. If your &quot;office&quot; is just local sales and support, some lawyers for local legal issues, etc, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a strong case.<p>Do they do substantial R&amp;D there? Are there new products that come out developed by &quot;Microsoft Paris&quot;? Etc.')
