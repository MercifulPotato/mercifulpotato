I have a Pixel 4 and have been pretty unimpressed with it as a phone and with how buggy Android seems to have become. I&#x27;ve also, over the past few years, started to dislike their stuff more and more. Having to use G Suite for work, as a user and an admin of it and supporting users (though I don&#x27;t actually suport them directly myself), puts me off their stuff too.<p>Google no longer makes good products, but they think they do, and change thewir stuff on the assumption that they are improving it when they are not.')
