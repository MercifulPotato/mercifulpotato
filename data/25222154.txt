Item(by='jeffbee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606413418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222044, text='Maybe sourcegraph just doesn&#x27;t exploit the real power of language server indexes, but the C++ language server seems pretty impoverished compared to Kythe. If I ask sourcegraph to find all references to absl::string_view::string_view(const char* str) it instead finds the substring `string_view` in any context, which is quite a useless result. Kythe gives me the actual call sites of that function signature and not the other forms, and Kythe knows the difference between absl::string_view and std::string_view.<p>Is it just a case of the visible implementation being a bit behind the ultimate capability of the system?')
