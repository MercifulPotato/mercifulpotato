I&#x27;ve been using NoScript for years now, and that forces me to explicitly whitelist any domain used for scripts on a website. Once you start looking at what major websites do, you start to understand the problem. Most of the newspapers on the web, for example, often employ 20 additional script domains on top of their own - for anything from analytics, to tracking, cookie banners, ads, adblock detectors, Hotjar, Taboola, and so on.<p>We often (justifiably) argue that deep learning, as it&#x27;s done today, is something unsustainable for the environment. I wonder if anyone has ever measured the impact of running tons of non-functional scripts on the web pages rendered every second by billions of devices around the world.')
