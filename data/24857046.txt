Dooes anyone know where can I read up on the design decisions that lead to this? This seems to introduce tons of implementation pains (statefulness, cache invalidation, &#x27;polymorphic JSON&#x27;, ...) while only seemingly benefiting a shorter wire format - but that&#x27;s such a weird thing to optimize for.<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s this [1], but it only makes me ask more questions. The only rationale I can see from that document is “it would seem silly and wasteful to force all developers to push all of their keying information in every request”.
