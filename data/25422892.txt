So while the assertions are being collected it also collects OLD() values which then can be tested at the called virtual method in its ENSURE() clause.<p>OLD is a complicated mechanism to implement in C++ because it requires saving current variables at the same time deferring the code to be executed.<p>Using the OLD() and ENSURE() (along with the other) clauses together, is described as subcontracting where subclasses &quot;require less&quot; and &quot;ensure more&quot;, given in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Object-Oriented_Software_Construction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Object-Oriented_Software_Const...</a> (first edition).')
