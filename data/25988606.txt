Null character in strings, as weird as it sounds like, happens in real life. It just happens.<p>The pattern I have seen the most is logs. More often than not logs may embed binary chunks, which may contain the infamous null character. However, the whole log itself is a string. For example, this happens on web server logs (binary data tends to be attack attempts).<p>Because (obviously) this doesn&#x27;t happen on PostgreSQL databases, I have experienced this while migrating from either Oracle or MongoDB to PostgreSQL. Nulls in both. One on logs, the other one as part of a user name (!!!). But still there.<p>PostgreSQL must support this. It is long due and required, specially to help database migrations. The author is clearly on point.<p>I actually raised this topic in 2016: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;message-id&#x2F;5aa1df8a-96f5-1d14-46fd-032e32846c71%408kdata.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;message-id&#x2F;5aa1df8a-96f5-1d14-46f...</a> But the conclusion was on the lines of &quot;it would be too complicated, closing as WON&#x27;T DO&quot;.')
