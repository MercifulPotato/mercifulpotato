It&#x27;s very hard to put my finger on it and come up with a coherent thesis, but so much of what they do is utterly pointless, yet somehow necessary. Take a walk through the City and you&#x27;ll see grand buildings, but there&#x27;s nothing going on in them. It&#x27;s all just an illusion. The company I worked for had drones in call centres in out of town business parks in other parts of the country. The people working in the city were engaged in just completely wasting their time. We could also see into the Swiss Re building from up there. Nobody was inside. It was practically empty every day (this was before lockdown).<p>But yet it all seems necessary to build trust. Is it proof of work?')
