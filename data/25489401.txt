The original allowed you to jump to any level through its title screen, so you could skip hard levels, or play them in any order you want.  The Championship game, however, had 50 levels that you could only play through in order, and only after you had beaten the prior level.  As my brother and I got stuck in one of of the lower levels, this was very frustrating since we had no way of enjoying the higher, more advanced levels.<p>Somewhere along the line, we figured out that you could start the original game, go to the level-jumping screen, <i>remove the 5 1&#x2F;4&quot; original floppy disc and replace it with the one for the Championship game</i>, and then enter the level you wanted to play.  The original gameplay would load the Championship level as if nothing was out of the ordinary!  I only think this was possible because the two games shared so much code structure.  It gave me an idea of how the memory vs disc model of the game was operating.  But I don&#x27;t think it would be easy to  do today since switching the floppy discs was so instrumental to making it work.  Maybe today you could do kernel dumps or swap the in-memory vs disk binaries, but we were just kids not advanced computer wizards.  Hurray for analog hacks!<p>By using the trick we were able to enjoy all 50 of the Championship levels at our leisure.')
