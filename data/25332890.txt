The induction method was 32 percent faster and consumed 57 percent less energy. [1]<p>We have an induction cooktop, and it’s amazing how quickly it can bring liquids to a boil.<p>The only thing I can see that gas has over induction electric is durability. You can slam pans down without worry of breaking the cooktop. Useful in a commercial setting, but at home I’d take induction over gas any day.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.treehugger.com&#x2F;which-more-energy-efficient-cooking-gas-or-induction-4858206" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.treehugger.com&#x2F;which-more-energy-efficient-cooki...</a>')
