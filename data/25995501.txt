I&#x27;ve been doing that the past few years and loving it. One of the things is that I get to (have to, in fact) choose my projects, so the clients I say yes to are ones whose projects I am interested in at a level beyond just &quot;you&#x27;ll pay me&quot;. They also tend to be in my specialties (UI, graphics, C++, iOS, in my case). I find that I learn a lot more, too, because generally the projects last about 6 months, and inevitably they use things I don&#x27;t know about. In the past few years I&#x27;ve learned: TypeScript, WebGL, WASM&#x2F;Emscripten, CMake, &quot;github workflow&quot;, pybind, basic Ruby, basics of physically based materials (PBR) rendering, new UX patterns, how to convert Bezier curves to renderable line segments, basic image processing with OpenCV, Dear ImGUI, and vector graphics with OpenGL. I did not know any of these when I applied for the contract in question (in fact, a contract I thought was going to be a C++ or at least C# contract ended up being TypeScript, which was a tad scary for a day or two), but they start to accumulate and make me even more valuable. I think being a generalist as a contractor is an advantage, it gives more areas where you can demonstrate &quot;I did this&quot;. I also think clients value age in a contractor more than employers do in an employee, because you can show a long list of similar things you have delivered and it&#x27;s clear that you have experience successfully solving problems like yours.')
