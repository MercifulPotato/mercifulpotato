Item(by='adamlett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607697009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385583, text='When it comes to audio quality and red wine I am completely unable to appreciate the quality differences over a certain minimum threshold, which is quite low (at least as measured by <i>price</i>). Maybe I would be able tell the medium level stuff from the very high end if I was allowed to compare them to each other in an undisturbed environment, but if I then had to guess which was the more expensive, I would likely get it wrong a good chunk of the times. I usually tell people that my senses are just not acute enough, but secretly I suspect that <i>most</i> people who claim to be able to appreciate the differences that I am unable to, really aren&#x27;t either and are at best just experiencing the placebo effect. The fact that you report to be disappointed by the audio quality of the HomePod, a product that a lot of reviewers praised first and foremost for its audio quality, does nothing to relieve me of this suspicion.<p>Who knows whether or not I am right or not? What I <i>am</i> quite certain of, is that I&#x27;m not likely unique when it comes to not being able to appreciate the small differences in quality that cost the most. Which is to say that for me and a lot of other people, it seems pointless to get hung up on whether one pair of very good headphones sound marginally better than another pair of very good headphones. Unless you&#x27;re working in a studio as a sound producer, at a certain point the audio quality simply ceases to be the most important attribute of a pair of headphones. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true that you can get a pair of wired IEMs that sound better than the AirPods Pro, but even if it is, it&#x27;s irrelevant, because the AirPods Pro sound <i>fine</i> to most people who buy them.<p>Through the years I&#x27;ve owned several different brands of headphones in the price range $100â€“$150 that I bought because reviewers claimed they were extraordinarily good value for the money when it came to sound quality. And maybe they were, but I&#x27;ve hated most of them for getting mostly everything else wrong: Wrong length of wire, wrong placement of microphone and buttons, and just horrible build quality.')
