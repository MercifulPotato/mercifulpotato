Commits seemed to suddenly stop April last year, and I&#x27;d be very surprised if the <i>actual</i> Signal Server that&#x27;s running in production hasn&#x27;t been updated over such a long period. Would be very happy to be proven wrong here, or to be pointed in the direction of anything that might explain the lack of activity.')
