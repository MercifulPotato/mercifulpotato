That&#x27;s a pretty significant chunk, suggesting both migration and mixture happened, and not diffusion or replacement.<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhm.ac.uk&#x2F;our-science&#x2F;our-work&#x2F;origins-evolution-and-futures&#x2F;human-adaptation-diet-disease&#x2F;cheddar-man-faq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhm.ac.uk&#x2F;our-science&#x2F;our-work&#x2F;origins-evolution...</a><p>&quot;When we look at genetic variation in modern British people today, we find that – for those who do not have a recent history of migration – around 10% of their ancestry can be attributed to the ancient European population to which Cheddar Man belonged. This group is referred to as the western European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. However, this ancestry does not relate specifically to Cheddar Man or the Mesolithic population of Britain. Well after Cheddar Man’s death, two large-scale prehistoric migrations into Britain produced significant population turnovers13. Both of these migrations into Britain represented westward extensions of population movements across Europe10-12. In both cases, these migrating populations intermixed with local people who carried western European Mesolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry, as they moved across Europe. When these populations arrived in Britain they already had some hunter-gatherer ancestry derived from this mixing with local populations. Therefore the majority of western European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers ancestry that we see in modern British people probably originates from populations who lived all over Europe during the Mesolithic, which was carried into Britain by these later migrations.&quot;')
