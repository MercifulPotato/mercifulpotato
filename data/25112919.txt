Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605540842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100421, text='&gt; Fish farming, especially for valuable species, still has a huge carbon footprint, requires a non trivial amount of agricultural land, and often uses wild-caught fish to feed the farm. So we&#x27;re back to square one.<p>Isn&#x27;t most of that only true for carnivorous or omnivorous fish?  I knew there were problems with finding small fish to feed the bigger fish, but I was under the impression that herbivores and filter feeders could be raised sustainably.  I.e. farming tuna would be extremely difficult and costly to the environment, but you can farm things like tilapia and catfish fairly sustainably.<p>They aren&#x27;t fish that a lot of people are excited to eat, unfortunately.')
