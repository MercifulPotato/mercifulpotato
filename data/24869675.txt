There’s not a dynamic language in existence with better tooling than JavaScript. You open up a js file in vscode or webstorm or whatever, and the typescript language server kicks in so you get type hints for all your code. If you switch to typescript it’s a whole other level of type safety.<p>Also, it seems like your comment could be generalized to include all dynamic language runtimes, not just Nodejs.')
