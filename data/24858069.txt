And when a side &#x27;MAY&#x27;, experience says, they almost never do, unless it makes things simpler for them. And having to store extra, global data is something no-one really wants to do.<p>Not to mention handles introduce state, not allow for statelessness: not only the AS now has to keep a global state across all endpoints that may serve a given request, but also the client must keep a local cache of resource -&gt; handle(s). Retry&#x2F;restart logic has to be implemented, cache clearing logic must be implemented, state has to be kept between restarts of both sides, etc. This is definitely stateful.')
