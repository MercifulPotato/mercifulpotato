This is a very general notion, but it was mostly influential in Milner&#x27;s style of theorem prover. To this day, most proofs in HOL systems such as HOL4 and HOL Light are just combinations of tactics.<p>That tactics could potentially be used in Haskell is just a reflection of the fact that Haskell&#x27;s type system has a connection to propositional logic, where Milner&#x27;s tactics become a mechanism by which to come up with a program (solution) matching a type (goal).<p>There&#x27;s nothing buzzwordy about this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ui.adsabs.harvard.edu&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1984RSPTA.312..411M&#x2F;abstract" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ui.adsabs.harvard.edu&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1984RSPTA.312..411M&#x2F;abstra...</a>')
