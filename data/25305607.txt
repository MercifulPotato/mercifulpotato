Furthermore most proteins were measured in crystallized (i.e. not their natural) form, so the resulting static structure is likely not representative (even less if parts of the protein are &quot;moving&quot; to perform their function). So it would be quite naive to assume that from now on you can just throw a sequence into the black box and the right structure comes out.')
