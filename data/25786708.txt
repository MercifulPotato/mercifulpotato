If the effect is real, I would expect it ought to be trainable. I would expect conditioned subjects to perform better than naive.<p>But I am not being cheeky when I say I&#x27;ve read more rigorous ESP experiments. At least this has a vaguely plausible biological mechanism?<p>&gt; Cryptochrome forms a pair of radicals with correlated spins when exposed to blue light.[50][51] Radical pairs can also be generated by the light-independent dark reoxidation of the flavin cofactor by molecular oxygen through the formation of a spin-correlated FADH-superoxide radical pairs.[52] Magnetoreception is hypothesized to function through the surrounding magnetic field&#x27;s effect on the correlation (parallel or anti-parallel) of these radicals, which affects the lifetime of the activated form of cryptochrome.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cryptochrome#Magnetoreception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cryptochrome#Magnetoreceptio...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ganzfeld_experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ganzfeld_experiment</a>')
