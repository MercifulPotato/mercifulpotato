Item(by='elmo2you', descendants=None, kids=[24743725], score=None, time=1602352985, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740177, text='Even more, Apple has assigned itself powers that in most (sane) countries are a strict monopoly of governments (and preferably only after going through a legal system&#x2F;process and strictly regulated).<p>Especially Apple&#x27;s attempt&#x2F;request&#x2F;demand to remove things silently goes way beyond what any company (or citizen) should ever be allowed to do to speech of others. Whether this doxxing is justified or not, that&#x27;s up to courts and certainly not Apple. Censorship (while debatable if it ever should be allowed in some cases or never) should always be a monopoly of a state (which should be legally accountable) and never commercial entities.<p>I&#x27;m honestly a bit surprised, that so far I hear few governments protest, about how a commercial company basically usurped powers that are supposed to be limited to governments only. Such powers belong only there not just by habit or by convention, but also because this an important aspect of the legal order in any state of law. That is, at least for any country that has signed and ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<p>As appalling as Apple&#x27;s behavior might be (and I certainly hope they will pay dearly for it), it&#x27;s not particularly surprising (anymore). But the silence of governments on this behavior, that should worry more people a lot more.')
