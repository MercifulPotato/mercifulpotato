I was in the sales and service industry, I was realy just a couple years into it, still 17, and had sold a beefy system for gaming to a guy who was a NASCAR fan. The day I was supposed to deliver it I dislocated my kneecap. I cslled him, let him know, and came home from the ER with him in my driveway waiting for me. When I got out of the car in the leg brace, he said &quot;Oh thank god your&#x27;e hurt! I thought you were trying to rip me off!&quot; I will always remember that game for reasons unrelated to gaming. :D')
