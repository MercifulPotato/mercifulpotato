It passes the first criterion: time tested. Not so much the second of having been previously impossible, because Erlang could and does run on yesterday&#x27;s hardware.<p>Erlang isn&#x27;t theoretical. It&#x27;s practical engineering. It works because message passing is what distributed systems have to do and at scale portions of a distributed system will become unavailable.<p>There are very specific problems that require more detailed engineering like Lamport Clocks and Raft Consensus Protocol. But not the general case. The general case is &quot;being good enough&quot; as is the nature of engineering.')
