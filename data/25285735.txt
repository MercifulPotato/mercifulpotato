Then we&#x27;ll say &#x27;The only way to prove we are wrong would be an insane global 0 way multivariate test of all possible colours!!!&#x27; and she&#x27;ll _insist_ on it. Then we build a tool and run the test and point at the results every time she tries to make us change it again. And we can offer to run the tool for _everything else_ she micromanages us about in future too!&quot;<p>Googler #1: &quot;Brilliant! So, do we build the tool and run the test? Or just make up the results and present them to her?&quot;')
