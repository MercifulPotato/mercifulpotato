Item(by='gwright', descendants=None, kids=[25667046], score=None, time=1609975804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25663237, text='If we are at the point that we have to have &quot;evidence&quot; (in the legal sense) that fraud has occurred in order to resolve the outcome of an election, then the water is under the bridge. Voting process and procedures should all be designed to build and strengthen transparency, to fortify the process against actual fraud and vague assertions of fraud that can&#x27;t be trivially disproved.<p>We find ourselves in a situation where the processes have been constructed in such a way that there is suspicion about the outcome and logistical difficulties at disproving what should be <i>by design</i> trivially disprovable, this just creates a terrible feedback loop of mistrust. The argument that we don&#x27;t need better controls until actual widespread fraud can be proved in a court of law seems mistaken to me. We need the controls to keep us from getting to the point where a forensic analysis is needed to discern what happened during an election.<p>I realize that there are legitimate concerns that better voting controls can result in &quot;voter suppression&quot; but our haphazard approach to voting controls and process transparency has left us in a place where large numbers of people are suspicious and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any effective way to counter those suspicions in part due to the haphazard controls.')
