That&#x27;s a bit apples and oranges.<p>Humanities are meant to have some redeeming value and some rigorousness even when you can&#x27;t apply the scientific method.<p>History, literature, philosophy, and anthropology are all good examples of valuable humanities where there is some grounding in logic and facts. Gender studies on the other hand is just an ideology with very little basis in reality, and little grounding of any kind in facts and logic. You could call it a religion of sorts, but it would be insulting to religions which at least have a richness of tradition and culture and philosophy behind them.')
