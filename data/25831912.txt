And all 3 I can watch whenever I travel. The TV&#x2F;Radio Tax is about €18!!! and I can only &quot;enjoy&quot; it in Germany!!! Not only that, the quality of programming quite bad, and to make it even worse, I am forced to pay for it when I don&#x27;t even watch it. When I moved to Germany it just blown my mind.')
