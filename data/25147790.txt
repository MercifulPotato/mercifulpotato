They try to put &quot;cyber defense&quot; in as a military expect, even if the job description suggests that it&#x27;s actually just police work and therefor should count in the 2%. We also frequently claim that foreign aid should be counted as part of our NATO contribution, because it prevents war. While that may be true, Danish politicians should and do know that the 2% for defense was never meant as anything but pure military expenses. Claiming that we don&#x27;t need to spend as much as 2% of GDP isn&#x27;t the point, we promised our NATO partners that we would. If 2% is to much, then work to change the NATO rules, don&#x27;t just ignore them.<p>The US is absolutely right to be upset that it&#x27;s NATO partners isn&#x27;t fulfilling their part of the deal and instead rely on US tax payers for their defense.')
