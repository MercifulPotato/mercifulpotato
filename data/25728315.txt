But generating additional types for SomeDataType like ViewSomeDataType etc - my gut feeling tells me these should be implemented trough type classes instead. New data types shouldn&#x27;t be generated for cases like this.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve only looked at the docs of IHP, but this was what it looked like it was doing.')
