In the USA, if you can find a willing and gullible publisher [0], you can write a book about just about anything. The actual things that you can&#x27;t publish [1]  are very specific: You can publish a recipe for how to refine uranium, for example, just not in enough detail to allow anybody with a few million dollars to start their own nuclear program.<p>But, more importantly, we live in today. &quot;full P2P blockchain&quot; and &quot;underground communities of intellectuals&quot; are word salad; if you want to publish without restrictions, Bittorrent has been around for over a decade and is generally not blockable, and Sci-Hub is an aboveground rebellion of intellectuals against the publishers.<p>You&#x27;re whining because a DNS registrar, and one of incredibly poor reputation for what it&#x27;s worth, has chosen to stop hosting a violent hate group. But your own personal ability to publish, and indeed their ability to publish, has not been curtailed. Rather, their ability to use the resource of the DNS registrar to spread their hate is what has been removed, and that was a privilege to which they were not entitled under law.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vanity_press" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vanity_press</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Born_secret" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Born_secret</a>')
