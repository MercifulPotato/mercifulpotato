Not my lane. At an uneducated guess, I would say that it&#x27;s probably a more common topic of &quot;safe AGI&quot; press articles than actual research. Dunno though.<p>It&#x27;s too theoretical. When technology is theoretical, we tend to personify it.  If we imagined an automated hotel in the 60s, we&#x27;d probably imagine a humanoid robot standing at reception. In the 2000s, that image would have been a screen at reception. Today, it&#x27;s an app that also unlocks the door and there is no lobby.<p>My guess is that by the time AI can be programmed via abstract ethics, it will have upended so much that its just hard to reason about from our current position.<p>I hope &quot;AI ethics&quot; are focused on stuff that&#x27;s applicable now.')
