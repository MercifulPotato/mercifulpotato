It was essentially a CS minor with some different classes on networking, security, system administration, hardware, project management, etc. I would say I&#x27;m better off career-wise because I did that instead of Computer Science. I was even almost not considered for a job because of it, and I turned out to be a really good fit for that job!<p>That said, and admittedly I have gravitated to niches that might be more computer science-y niches at points in their hype cycles where lots of research was being applied, but I have occasionally wished I perhaps <i>also</i> had a stronger academic basis in computer science. In distributed systems, people are still writing new schedulers, and I wish I had taken that operating systems class when you had to write one. I don&#x27;t always understand what my colleagues are talking about with some of the newer functional programming features popping up in languages. Stuff like that.<p>I do agree there&#x27;s a disconnect between what universities deliver and what people expect of them (paths into academic research vs. career preparation) and I think a Bachelor&#x27;s degree is overhyped for that. But I do think you&#x27;re understating the role of CS theory and fundamentals in high-level software engineering. Just because you don&#x27;t use many of the lessons does not mean they haven&#x27;t improved your ability to think, and the general base of knowledge on which you&#x27;re able to build.')
