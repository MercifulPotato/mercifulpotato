Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=[24723288], score=None, time=1602182974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24721641, text='&gt; <i>Well, the generally-accepted term has been &quot;salesman&quot; for over a hundred years</i><p>Who cares? Did your ancestors coin the term or something? You can keep writing &quot;salesman&quot; whenever you write things yourself. &quot;Salesperson&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem at all offensive, and I think it&#x27;s bizarre to nitpick such a trivial and irrelevant aspect of the article. It reads to me like political virtue-signaling since the article has nothing to do with the gender of the traveling agent.')
