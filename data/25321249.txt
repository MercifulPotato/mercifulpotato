Which is why it was pumped in their face 24&#x2F;7 to keep them angry at the other group of plebs, and distracted from the professional looting. The proper response was to demand a pause to the finance that was actually responsible for threatening their businesses and families. Instead they fell right into the trap of thinking that being unable to pay rent is a character flaw.<p>&gt; <i>Leaders need to understand that people react on a emotional level to things and if you are asking for someone to make great personal sacrifices you need to be above reproach when making those requests.</i><p>Ends meet should have never been a sacrifice anyone was asked to make. This isn&#x27;t a failure of leadership, but rather outright corruption by the plutocrats. Continually lowering interest rates over the past two decades to keep The Line going up, and then no relief for people squeezed in the debt vice when a hiccup occurred and the calls came due.<p>&gt; <i>Again if Trump conducted himself in a more socially acceptable way and spent more time considering how his words and choices appeared to others, I suspect this new vaccine would encounter less resistance.</i><p>The problem with Trump isn&#x27;t just a lack of presentation, but that he&#x27;s an empty conman. Covid is back with urgency and yet he&#x27;s focused on his latest con of &quot;stop the steal&quot;. Given his constant politicking and general rejection of expertise, being skeptical of corruption at the FDA is completely understandable. The problem runs much deeper than a lack of leadership - it&#x27;s a failure of institutions.')
