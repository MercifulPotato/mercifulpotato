(They do do other things too! But billions in home owner subsidies...) The main incentive of course is they then have cheaper power bills for not much outlay.<p>If you rent, nearly nothing. You&#x27;d have to have a generous landlord or luck out on a house someone has already done and then moved from. The latter will admittedly will become more common over time.<p>If you live in an apartment, nearly nothing. While it is technically possible to put solar on the roof the extra complications of body corporate make it largely a non-starter. Besides, in truely large apartment buildings the roof top space is tiny compared to the number of apartments so the benefit is minimal anyway.<p>So for now, only standalone homeowners get this benefit. And while I am not sure, I suspect reducing homeowners customer costs shifts the cost burden for the grid slightly more to others.<p>I just want the government to fund society wide infrastructure to benefit <i>everyone</i> in society...')
