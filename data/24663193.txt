I own a Samsung TV since 2016. I think they may have pushed 5 firmware updates since then.<p>There is no way I can be convinced that Samsung needs to increase the price of TVs by 20%. Also, if that&#x27;s the difference, why can&#x27;t I just pay more and opt out? And why are other users in other countries not being shown ads?')
