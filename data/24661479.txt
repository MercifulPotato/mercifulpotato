The only meaningful interpretation of the proposed `isVowel` function is O(1), unless you want to accommodate arbitrary definitions of what characters are considered vowels.<p>Remember that O() is concerned with asymptotic behaviour as the input grows - for a constant set of vowels to check against, the running time does not grow and the function is therefore O(1).<p>An O(n) function can absolutely be part of an O(1) function.<p>To the authors point, Big-O describes asymptotic growth and for small values of n, O(n^2) may perform better than an O(1) function. You also need a definition for `n`. What would you define as `n` for the `isVowel` function?')
