Everyone flocks to YouTube because they can find all the content they want, their favorite content creators, and their friends. YouTube is super popular because of network effects and inertia. Everyone is there because everyone else is. It&#x27;s also free to use (minus the ads, which most people are fine with), and convenient.<p>Twitch&#x27;s niche is gaming. YouTube is just as big a player in the gaming realm, and it crushes everywhere else.<p>The only way to create a competitor is to have large nation states (China) block YouTube inside their borders and force everyone to use a domestic platform.<p>The only way YouTube is going to be dethroned within the next one hundred years is if management goes to shit and a huge series of massively catastrophic failures occur that permanently break the site. If Google kills YouTube, in other words. I&#x27;ll leave the exercise of calculating the odds of that happening up to you...')
