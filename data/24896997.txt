Based on your description it could be lots of things.  Off the top of my head there&#x27;s: aspergers, depression, or result of abuse (dissociation, etc).<p>Did your friend actually ask you for help?  Or did you just decide on your own you needed to &quot;make him&quot; feel things to your satisfaction?  Why would you feel like &quot;insisting&quot; on more contact from someone than they want is a healthy thing to do?  Frankly your second paragraph sounds awful.')
