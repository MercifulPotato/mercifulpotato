Then you either accept the offer letter as it is, or walk away. Asking for the detailed contract (called 就業規則 in Japanese) will always end up losing your job offer, because you have no legal right to see the contract before you join the company.<p>Some companies are so hostile (and this is the norm in my experience), that even very valid questions along the line of &quot;Do I get severance pay if I am forced to retire?&quot; or &quot;How do stock options work?&quot; will end your job application process right there because you will get labeled as overzealous.<p>Also, Japanese law doesn&#x27;t require to state in the contract the exact position that you are hired into. So you will often get hired with the job description: &quot;engineering team member&quot;. Of course HR will tell you mealy-mouthed or mellifluously that you are a senior&#x2F;principal engineer and&#x2F;or a manager, but none of that will hold any legal water in a lawsuit since your contract doesn&#x27;t say so.<p>If you ask me, Japan and the US, some of the largest economies of the world are constant labor right abusers and the UN and other nations simply turn their head when this ever gets brought up.')
