What surprised me was how many extremely obscure sites came up before ones that get hit tens of thousands of times a day. Quite difficult to figure out &quot;popularity&quot; without collecting data, so I would bet that this will be a large issue. I feel like making an opt-in anonymous &quot;you are allowed to collect data on which result i click for a given query&quot; would be nice. I would certainly use it.<p>Overall, I think the name isn&#x27;t too catchy, but it&#x27;s nice and unique. You definitely need a logo or something more identifiable. For now, the light green &#x2F; lime tone is not that nice to look at, I think a more &quot;boring&quot; grey-tone or something blue would be nicer.<p>Nice work! Looking forward to this becoming a big deal!')
