Bought my first $1k jacket (Paul Smith). It took me a while to work up to that but I had mental list of features I wanted (belt, pockets for hands, flip up collar, certain style) and this one had them so a friend pointed out it would last years so $1k not really that much divided by years of use. It developed a whole in the pocket within 4 weeks of purchase as well as the hanger loop in the collar broke in the same amount of time. I&#x27;ve never owned a jacket that broke that fast.<p>Similarly I talked myself into Rimowa Air Salsa suitcase $699 vs the &lt; $150 stuff I&#x27;d always bought previously. It was lighter than other so can fit more loot. Two flights later a wheel came off. Took it in for repair at Rimowa, next flight it came off again. Took it in again. Worked for a few flights but next time it came off Rimowa couldn&#x27;t fix it in time for my return flight so they forwarded me to a local fix it shop at my expense. They fixed that particular wheel better than Rimowa (screw instead of glue) but a few more flights and a different wheel came off.<p>Similar issues with Schott jackets.<p>So at least for me, expensive brand != quality. It just equals expensive and possibly in a style I like.')
