I have another account that I used to use. I have definitely learned alot, but I can&#x27;t specifically tell you what I&#x27;ve learned. I think HN and reddit is good for giving you perspectives. You often come across thoughts and ideas that are completely different from your way of thinking. It&#x27;s more of a feeling you take away, rather some hard knowledge.<p>HN is also good at introducing you to different topics you haven&#x27;t heard of before. However, it&#x27;s up to you to do research on your own if you want to learn more about it. I wouldn&#x27;t say HN is great for deep learning, but it is great for getting an idea of the general landscape. GraphQL, GPT-3, and PG essays are some things I came across here before anywhere else.')
