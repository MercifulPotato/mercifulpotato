Item(by='m_mueller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611027418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825390, text='&gt; Commercial and industrial areas are also likely to be green on this map.<p>IMO this is a big mistake by US zone planning. Having lived in Japan for a while, the ability to live in any zone and let the market figure it out has big benefits. Rents are comparatively low, even in Tokyo. We were able to live 10min from my campus as a family of 3 for $1k&#x2F;month. There are small commercial centers everywhere in walkable distance, even 1h away from the center by commuter train. Everywhere you go there is life, people to meet, things to buy, festivals to attend, conversations to be had.')
