It seems like any function which takes a collection and returns a collection would have to maintain some local state.<p>For example, if you want to take a list of integers and return a list of those those integers plus one ([1,2,3] -&gt; [2,3,4]), that new list needs to be built up in memory somehow before it is returned, no? Sure that process might be hidden behind a generic `map` function (something like `map(lambda x:x+1, [1,2,3])`), lambda, but then you just have the `map` function building up the new list. Or if `map` returns a generator (so you don&#x27;t need to construct the whole return list first), you&#x27;re still storing some local state to keep track of which element of the input list you&#x27;re currently processing.<p>What am I missing or getting wrong here?')
