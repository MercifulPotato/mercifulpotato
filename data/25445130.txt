Google and to a lesser extent Apple both have a huge lead in this space. Amazon is one of the few companies that can afford the massive capital cost to create this kind of service.<p>I am curious about the quality though. It seems like they&#x27;re just reselling from 3rd party data providers. Hopefully, we see this forcing price cuts to Google&#x27;s Maps API at some point, but I think it will be a while until they reach parity in data quality.')
