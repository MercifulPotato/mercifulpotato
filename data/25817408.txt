At least it tries hard to get there, but seems largely successful on this route by now. Of course the whole &quot;cloud native&quot; Google monoculture will become the same burden as Windows is because the same vendor lock-in mechanics apply here. MS also didn&#x27;t mind in the past which kind of PC vendor (~ cloud provider) you buy form as long as your were running Windows (~ Kubernetes) on that box.')
