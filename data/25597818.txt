Is this done differently in Germany?<p>It should be. The due dates are all listed on the webpage<p>And some libraries even send reminder emails before the due date<p>But that is how they got me. I got used to their reminder mails, and then - &quot;Our mail server had a failure and now you have to pay 60â‚¬&quot;<p>&gt;I like the app but I believe people won&#x27;t buy&#x2F;subscribe to an app that helps you only if you forget to return a book in time. Most people will believe they will return it in time and won&#x27;t invest in this type of &quot;insurance&quot;.<p>I wish someone had told me that before I wrote it<p>But there is also the secondary feature of keeping a record of read books. I read a lot of incomplete series before I had it, and now I want to read the rest of the series, but I do not remember what the series was.<p>&gt;You could&#x2F;should look whether university&#x2F;free libraries are interested.<p>They are the worst. They have much less patrons than public libraries, and almost never answer emails. I think I might have gotten email PTSD from them.<p>&gt;Hope you enjoy working on it.<p>I enjoyed it  13 years ago.  But not anymore.')
