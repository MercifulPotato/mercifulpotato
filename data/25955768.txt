Item(by='docdeek', descendants=None, kids=[25956891, 25956264], score=None, time=1611914504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955510, text='Isnâ€™t there an option for GME to issue new stock priced below 200&#x2F;300&#x2F;400 which can be bought up by the short sellers? That would relieve their short position, allow an influx of cash for  GME, and the only ones that would be hurt would be people who bought at a high price hoping to hold out for an even higher price.<p>Not an expert or even a participant in this whole thing, but it seems to me that if there is a short squeeze (as i understand it after a week of reading the news) that is only bad if there is a limited amount of stock. If GME release new shares and the hedge funds buy up those new shares at a lower price than the WSB 300&#x2F;400 buys, that could be bad for the WSB crowd.<p>NB - Not at all sure this is possible, or that GME would want to sell their stock for 100 when there are buyers at 300&#x2F;400.')
