Everything from scratch, now with Typescript.\nAnd then I was trying flutter and it was great but also, like Angular, half-assed and not there.\nThen I had a period of writing everything in plain JS and embedding that in SSR pages served by Go.\nNo reactivity :(\nBut great SEO :)\nNow I found quasar, the promise is write once, deliver on all platforms.\nI prefer Angular to Vue but it doesn&#x27;t have anything like Quasar and the Material components are lacking. vuex-orm, despite being new has more functionality out the box than ngrx-data.\nIf you go SSR with JS there is a huge performance impact vs Go (read cost in hardware).\nAnother downside of quasar is since it&#x27;s all just a Webview on mobile you can&#x27;t use grpc to communicate.\ngrpc-web uses base64 encoding on the payload, which makes it useless.\nYou can&#x27;t use nginx on the front with grpc-web.\nBut then again I can make it work with a RESTful backend and a websocket notifier.\nI would love reactivity on the frontend but SEO is more important. \nAdsense doesn&#x27;t monetize Angular sites, says they have no content.\nSo IDK...\nOn the backend I write monoliths. Go is powerful enough to serve about 400 million visitors on commodity hardware, a single server.\nI had a cluster of 3 but it was too much effort maintaining them. Every now and then something would break.  Ipsec or whatever. So I got rid of it.\n1 server with raid10 and daily backups.\nLike I wrote Go wins on the backend. \nThe frontend wars are undecided for me yet.\nI&#x27;m just one guy so I&#x27;ll go with quasar and vue for now, despite my love for Angular.\nAlso Angular is Google as is Flutter. And with Google you can&#x27;t be sure they won&#x27;t arbitrarily just end support one day to the next because Google&#x27;s CEO felt like it today.\nI would love if Svelte had the tools. \nReact, I tried getting into it but since it&#x27;s so popular there are also many half-assed libs.\nTake their material ui. Yeah it looks nice on the outside but when you&#x27;re about to use it boobytraps everywhere. Maybe one time I&#x27;ll make the jump from vue to react idk. Maybe one day there will be something like Quasar for react. Idk.')
