And simply connect it to my 20 year old Hifi system. I fail to see why using a y dongle for connecting a headphone plus the charging cable would make my life better.<p>I like the form factor, too. I guess the only other choice would be an iphone SE.<p>I once spend a few bucks on a new battery. Otherwise, it is a perfectly fine phone, used (too) many hours a day by me for years and it‘s still almost pristine. It just works.  I don‘t see why one should throw it on a dumpster. If it was a bit faster and had a bit more memory it would be the perfect phone.<p>But if they come with an upgrade, have a headphone jack would be the killer feature.')
