Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=[25951072], score=None, time=1611873350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950191, text='This sounds very plausible, but: I don&#x27;t remember any cases when I&#x27;ve ever heard of specific platform stopping trade for specific stock just for volatility. I&#x27;ve heard about the cases of trade stopping when something clearly going wrong - like market crash, or bot-driven feedback loop, or such. And this usually then comes for the whole exchange or all exchanges the stock is listed on, not just a handful of platforms. That of course doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t happen - just that I haven&#x27;t heard of it. So is such thing common and does anybody have examples of such things happening in the past - I understand it may not gather as much press as this one but somebody should have mentioned it somewhere? Is it indeed a routine thing that got overhyped, or is it an exceptional thing trying to hide behind a routine procedure?')
