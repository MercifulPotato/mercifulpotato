Growth curves are often sigmoid shaped, meaning, exponential until they&#x27;re not. The exponential is often great for modeling growth trends up until the plateau, but it&#x27;s hard to know when the corner will turn.<p>Exponentials are also well motivated by differential equations... (Say, if you&#x27;re modeling growth of IOT devices based on word of mouth.) Polynomials with degree 1+epsilon, less so.')
