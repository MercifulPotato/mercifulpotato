I used a WiMax wifi router up until a few months ago. I only got rid of it because of covid; I&#x27;m not out of the house much. It was under $10 a month for almost unlimited usage (mine was supposed to throttle after 10GB used in 3 days but in practice it didn&#x27;t). While slow (generally 10Mbps), it was nice to have always-available internet without worrying about finding coffee shop wifi or using my limited smartphone data for tethering.<p>This news is about dropping support for a specific WiMax chip. It shouldn&#x27;t affect many current users who would be using a discrete wifi device that connects by wifi or USB.')
