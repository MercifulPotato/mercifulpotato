Online violence, including gender-based violence, is often anonymous. Anonymity can protect people who need it, but it also protects people who use it to harass.<p>That said, people don&#x27;t seem to need anonymity, and are perfectly happy to make threats under their own name or easily-pierced pseudonyms. Online threats aren&#x27;t taken seriously in the US, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s no better in Indonesia.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to see the knock-on effects if law enforcement took action in the easy cases. Perhaps it would make people less likely to make them; perhaps they&#x27;d simply make an effort to make their cases less easy.')
