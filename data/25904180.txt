Item(by='mcv', descendants=None, kids=[25904322], score=None, time=1611588295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903952, text='&gt; France is doing the same thing and Google is fine with it.<p>Is it? Several countries have proposed laws that they hoped would force Google to pay for links to news sites, and every time, Google&#x27;s response has been to not list those news site. And if the law didn&#x27;t allow that, they just left that market entirely.<p>The simple fact is that most sites in the Web like being found through search engines. If news sites want to be paid money to be listed, then the only obvious result of that will be that search engines won&#x27;t list them.<p>I keep getting surprised by countries trying the same thing over and over again. In the end, you can&#x27;t force a company to do business. It has to be attractive for the company to do business.<p>I don&#x27;t like Google&#x27;s dominance in search and advertising any more than anyone else, but these bizarre laws trying to extract money from them seem very ill-advised. But if Google is forced to abandon a country, there will still be other search engines available.')
