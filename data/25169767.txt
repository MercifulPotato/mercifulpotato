Right now, trying to report that image captions aren&#x27;t saved on articles, using Firefox, I find absolutely NO way to leave this feedback. The only feedback allowed is a &quot;Was this page helpful to you, Yes&#x2F;No&quot; followed by a &quot;Thank you&quot;.<p>This is a general trend on the big platforms, but hey, we are talking reporting bugs here. Isn&#x27;t it best-practice to provide a good feedback facility anymore?<p>PS. I get there should be <i>some</i> friction to filter out low-quality responses, and being non-anonymous will serve to withhold trolls.')
