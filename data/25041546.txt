Adult IQ is not strongly influenced by educational attainment; in fact, twin and sibling studies confirm the converse relationship. If you have a high IQ you are more likely to have high educational attainment, but attending a high-value school will not raise your adult IQ from what it would otherwise have been (based on other predictors).')
