Consumer SSDs are optimized for burst performance rather than sustained performance, and almost all use SLC write caching. Depending on the drive and how full it is, the SLC cache will be somewhere between a few GB up to about a fourth of the advertised capacity. You may be filling up the cache if you write 20GB in one shot, but the drive will flush that cache in the background over the span of a minute or two at most if you don&#x27;t keep it too busy.<p>The other good strategy to maintain SSD performance in the face of a heavy write workload is to not let the drive get full. Reserving an extra 10-15% of the drive&#x27;s capacity and simply not touching it will significantly improve sustained write speeds. (Most enterprise SSD product lines have versions that already do this; a 3.2TB drive and a 3.84TB drive are usually identical hardware but configured with different amounts of spare area.)<p>If a drive has already been pushed into a degraded performance state, then you can either erase the whole drive or, if your OS makes proper use of TRIM commands, you can simply delete files to free up space. Then let the drive have a few minutes to clean things up behind the scenes.')
