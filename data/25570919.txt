They have crammed so many touchpoints on to the map that it is impossible to touch anything of value - I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have somehow managed to select an entire county (something I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever intentionally done) on my iPhone instead of a POI, which then zooms out to show me the whole county and removes all of the POIs I was looking at in the first place!<p>Is this a problem for others as well?')
