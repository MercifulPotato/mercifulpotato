It contains an additional component, so that you can smell it easily, because a gas leak near the open fire in the heater is obviously very dangerous. Yet I can remember two or three leaks, that were covered in the media. Nothing in 40 years in my circle of neigbhours, friends, or family. Therefore, I am convinced it possible to create natural gas distribution systems without considerable leaking. Perhaps, that depend on the organisational maturity of the country we are talking about. But it seems to be possible.')
