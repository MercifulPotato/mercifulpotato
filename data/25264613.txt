The gist of it is we went from ~40hr a week of work outside the home at the household level to ~80 (obviously those numbers aren&#x27;t exact because not all households are a married couple and the are people who are self employed, etc, etc).  But obviously the home stuff is still getting done so the net amount of work being done is increased (less productivity gains from technology).  Just google &quot;women in the workforce  macroeconomic impact&quot; or something like that.<p>Whether this is a net positive or net negative is basically boils down to whether you think people are better served working outside the home or better served doing household things.<p>Also, all your comments are dead by default.
