Sorry that happened to you.<p>I&#x27;ve been an engineering manager, for a time, and I used Gitprime to track stats.<p>It was never used for performance reviews or in making promotion decisions or anything.<p>What it was used for was to manage upwards and demonstrate to the upper management how decisions affect the team, to indicate when we needed to spend on hiring and had room to onboard new people, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t see metrics as &quot;surveillance,&quot; unless they&#x27;re used that way. They can be used for good. But I think as you and others have pointed out -- it requires context and transparency: you can&#x27;t just rely on metrics for reporting on a person.<p>Tech managers: <i>you need to bring your people up, develop their skills, and pay attention!</i> Metrics are useful but only relationships bring context.<p>(I eventually returned to engineering as I didn&#x27;t find I enjoyed management much)')
