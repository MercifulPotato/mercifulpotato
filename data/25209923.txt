I&#x27;m not overly aware of the issue facing ethnic minorities in the UK (I live in Scotland where it&#x27;s almost entirely white with some small asian communities, which isn&#x27;t to say there isn&#x27;t racism just few people to discuss it with personally) but from reading around racism in the UK is very different to the US. Despite this we&#x27;ve adopted BLM views wholesale, including call to defund the police.<p>I fully support discussing racism in the UK and what we can do to counter it but I don&#x27;t get why we&#x27;re discussing it as if it&#x27;s the exact same situation  over here with the same solutions. This might to a symptom of London centric-ness where there is far more ethnic diversity and therefore racism.')
