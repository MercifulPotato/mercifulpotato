They need to see previous packets in the session to extract keys, state, etc.<p>This is done by having front ends which direct raw packets to backends based on which session they are a part of - the obvious one being the tcp 4-tuple.<p>The backends then don&#x27;t each have many sessions to look after - perhaps tens of thousands each.  That means they can keep many kilobytes of state.   Each time they get a packet, they process it by updating the state.  Certain state transitions (eg. The completion of a credit card transaction in a finance feed session) will trigger another event to be emitted, which goes through the same system again, and might go into another extractor or be persisted for analysts to view.')
