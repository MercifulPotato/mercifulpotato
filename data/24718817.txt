I get that they&#x27;re of the &quot;money at any cost&quot; ethic, but a lot of decisions (or lack thereof) have been downright imprudent.<p>These last minute decisions are likely reactive to something, whether or not it&#x27;s actually reactive to the debate comment that this writer thinks triggered it. My (uneducated) guess is that its more related to stuff happening on the platform itself.<p>In any case, the creepiness of fb just keeps rising. Maybe they&#x27;ll end up exploding the whole thing.')
