Crocodile tears.<p>I know this is probably the wrong audience here but I’m getting fed up with whining from companies who have dubious funding models based on trading something less honest and more invasive than money for gain. Operating like this is an existential business risk when regulation and platforms are heading in the direction of privacy and data security so get over it. Come up with a product which is worth throwing actual money at not proxy money, advertising, tracking, data collection or invasive crap. If you can’t do that, bugger off.')
