Or limit their speed of uploading or downloading or whatever limitation to the point it is not useable?<p>It is the same with Mobile plan&#x27;s Unlimited Data. 20-30GB are fine. Carrier even put up with 100-200GB per month. Because that is the average Data used for Home Broadband. But when carrier said they stop providing services to said customers because they were using 500 or even 1000+GB per month you really cant feel sympathetic to those people.<p>Some argue why not just but an arbitrary number instead of unlimited. But consumer <i>wants</i> unlimited so they dont feel they are limited. I know that sounds stupid but it is the default consumer behaviour.')
