Item(by='epsilonclose', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606609028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25241239, text='Thanks for the answers. More questions if you&#x27;re feeling up to it:<p>Will there be any sort of requirements to &quot;demonstrate progress&quot; to the funders (even if that means the results of a failed experiment or some sort of open lab notebook)?<p>Does all research need to terminate in a paper (as opposed to, say, tooling)?<p>In fact, how does accountability work in this system? Do researchers need to provide a provisional timeline? Research can fail or take unexpected turns away from the initial goal, and this may or may not make funders nervous. I guess this might be a way of asking: are participants funding people, or are they funding projects?<p>Will there be requirements to make all papers produced freely available? All source code? Is this at the researcher&#x27;s discretion?<p>Suppose something profitable, or merely patentable, comes out of a Strato funded stint. Do the funders have any stake in such an outcome?<p>This sort of thing excites me, so I do hope you find some sort of success.')
