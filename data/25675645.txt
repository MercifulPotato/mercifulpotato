Slow, sure, but not <i>that</i> bad.&quot;<p>No, not my garage at home, I was referring to the parking garage two blocks down the street. Which is why, when Nissan offered to do it for free, I had them rip out the GPRS cell radio that wasn&#x27;t useful anymore when AT&amp;T turned those frequencies off. As parent points out, it wasn&#x27;t that useful to begin with; not if it&#x27;s a crap shoot whether it works or not.')
