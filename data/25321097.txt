Through my whole career writing C++, that language has been in the way due to all its idiosyncratic behavior. One spends so much time trying to figure out a way around some crazy boiler plate code requirement in C++ only to realize that no, it simply isn&#x27;t possible to do it in a sane way in C++.<p>Switching to Swift I felt almost everything worked as it should. It was almost a bit boring not having to deal with all the usual crap that C++ would give me. I am willing to be you can write any C++ system much better in Swift. C++ would probably have a performance edge, but in 95% of cases not enough to be worth dealing with an ugly language like C++.<p>&gt; C++ will continue to see a lot of usage as long as it is difficult or impossible to write code in other languages that is functionally equivalent to C++.<p>I would challenge you to give me any language construct that is indispensable for a particular type of program which cannot be done more elegantly in another language and with less headache.<p>I cannot think of a single feature in C++ which I have ever missed in any other of my preferred languages.')
