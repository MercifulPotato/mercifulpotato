You can have a decent Twitter (or even Instagram) experience if you don&#x27;t follow toxic people. Twitter is mostly a mirror of our behavior, the company itself isn&#x27;t really actively evil.<p>On the other hand you can&#x27;t really escape Google as they are actively trying to insert themselves into everything. And Facebook is a bit of both, toxic communities and trying to be everywhere.')
