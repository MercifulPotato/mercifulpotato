Nor any call for authorities of some unknown nature to clamp down.<p>Just the point that the &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; doesn&#x27;t function very well when those in it are not acting in good faith. Qanon may be a footnote in ten years. The Tea Party <i>is</i> a footnote from the last decade. The Klan has gone down to footnote several times and been revived each time. (Although the current incarnation has gotten rid of the name and the outfits. Yay, progress!) I remember the 9&#x2F;11 hysteria, and I remember checking on my Moslem friends about the free speech they were receiving. Anyway, and yet, here we are.<p>Blind faith in the marketplace of ideas doesn&#x27;t work any better than blind faith in the invisible hand of economics.')
