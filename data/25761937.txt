With compiled languages that really prefer to statically link stuff written in that language (rust, go, etc) it&#x27;s really not feasible.<p>In FreeBSD Ports we have a very pleasant solution for packaging rust apps. You just run `make cargo-crates` and paste the output into the makefile â€“ boom, all cargo dependencies are now distfiles for the package.')
