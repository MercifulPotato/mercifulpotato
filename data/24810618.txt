I live in a state that ostensibly had “extreme” lockdowns and whole cities and communities decided themselves exempt from the orders with zero consequences.<p>It’s also impossible to stratify people on the basis of health in the US because not everyone is cognizant of their health status or risk factors, certainly the government has no insight into these beyond the crudest levels. Age also doesn’t really work because the lack of social safety nets mean older workers have to remain employed or rely on younger cohorts in order to survive.')
