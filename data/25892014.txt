For example, the top comment on the other Brexit-related article on the HN front page right now is about how logistics companies are pulling out of the UK because it&#x27;s just too much hassle and gave this as one reason:<p>&quot;For those who believe the market will fix it: Well paid drivers no longer exist. The last time he has seen a local work as truck driver was in mid-2000 and meanwhile salaries have dropped to ~â‚¬700 and less therefore only some Eastern Europeans can justify that working as a driver still makes sense for them. There is not much wiggle room left in terms of just paying better salaries - even smaller freight-forwarders are asking themselves whether it continues to go there (at least for now).&quot;<p>Think about that. A job which used to pay enough for British people to live on had its pay driven down so much by EU rules that the only people who can afford to do it are Eastern Europeans living in countries with much lower cost of living. (More specifically, by the requirement that people living in those low-CoL states and with licenses issued by them be able to compete freely with local drivers for deliveries.) In this case, the Brexit-related change that&#x27;s fucking with businesses is literally the removal of the direct, casual reason why some people are unemployed in Britain - and the response has been to insist that it didn&#x27;t happen, that those people were just brainwashed into thinking the EU was the reason they didn&#x27;t have work.<p>(The Eastern European countries with lower cost of living don&#x27;t seem to be doing all that well in many ways either after joining the EU, which is probably partly why they continue to have such low cost of living in the first place.)')
