Closing the lid reportedly also makes a huge difference.  We may be using different definitions of &quot;overheating&quot; but generally what I saw was a laptop which advertised it could handle FOUR 4k displays but it could only do that while being loud and slow.  Looking at updated reviews it seems like it&#x27;s only certain configurations that lead to this problem.  Nevertheless I saw reviews, they looked bad, and I held onto my money, and bought a solution with better cooling.<p>I have strong hopes the m1x will just support a ton of displays out of the box and just work in a compact package.  If they released a 14&quot; that could support more than 2 displays I&#x27;d freaking faint and wake up weeping with joy that my dream computer had arrived.')
