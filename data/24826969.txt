Item(by='izacus', descendants=None, kids=[24828859], score=None, time=1603119686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826882, text='&gt; Can someone with knowledge on the subject help clarify?<p>Installing apps silently (as an app store) requires so-called &quot;Privileged&quot; Android premissions currently. Privileged permissions are only attainable by apps that are preinstalled on Android distribution - which means that Samsung&#x2F;Huawei&#x2F;other stores can get it, but it&#x27;s not available for apps that aren&#x27;t part of original OS distribution.<p>So the playing field isn&#x27;t level for ALL the potential Stores - Google gives these privileges to the OEMs that built the devices and them only.<p>Android 12 will add a mechanism to get these capabilities but it&#x27;s currently not clear how (whether it&#x27;s a permission on first run, or whether it&#x27;s going to be available to a single app like the SMS related permissions).')
