Low interest rates actually inflate the prices of risk assets (stocks, bonds, real estate), greatly benefitting those who already own them.<p>New entrants have to buy houses at higher prices, which net net washes away the gains made from lower interest. Early movers during the transition may get lucky, but in aggregate, this is true. Think of how a bond works. Interest rates and bond prices are inversely correlated. Lower interest rates = higher bond prices = lower future returns. Its the same for Real Estate.<p>Also Re: your points about immigration--again, its counterintuitive, but you are also mistaken here. The market for talent is not a zero sum game.<p>Immigration allows for increased productivity in the global economy because talent is able to go where it can be best utilized.<p>That talented engineer would be wasted in Albania, because Albania lacks the capital, talent, and opportunities to best utilize the engineerâ€™s knowledge. Albania loses nothing, but benefits greatly when that engineer moves abroad and contributes to making wireless networking accessible for all.<p>The global economy is not a zero sum game where somebody wins and somebody loses. This is often the hardest thing for people to understand about how the economy works.<p>And even if that weren&#x27;t true, yearly immigration as a percentage of population growth&#x2F;decline in most countries is <i>extremely low.</i> To attribute any of the social ills of a given country to it is foolish.<p>The world could become more productive and efficient if immigration happened <i>more</i> not less. Everybody wins when talent goes where it can best be utilized.')
