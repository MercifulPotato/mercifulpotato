This type of thing is totally pushed by the food industry, marketed directly to kids and tired &#x2F; busy parents.  Lets not pretend that people who aren&#x27;t obese are somehow more enlightened or virtuous, this is clearly a matter of food production, marketing, and environment (otherwise there wouldn&#x27;t have been a sharp rise in obesity right around the time all this came online).<p>I feel your story because I had a similar upbringing and even though I eat relatively healthy now, losing weight is INCREDIBLY difficult due to what I assume is a host of metabolic issues from all those years of poor eating as a kid.<p>Threads like this kill me because its a lot of lecturing about &quot;simple calories in calories out&quot;, and &quot;just don&#x27;t eat so much junk food&quot; like some kid who is 8 and getting served corn dogs and fruit rollups has any idea. Everyone at school is eating that stuff, the cafeteria is serving hamburgers, chips, choc milk and chicken nuggets.  There are soda and candy machines in the hallways for snacks, and everything you watch on TV is blanketed with advertising for junk food.')
