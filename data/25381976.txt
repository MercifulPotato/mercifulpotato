If many of them come from Enterprise Java, it makes total sense to me why the enthusiasm for Clojure is so high (in fact, that&#x27;s Rich Hickey&#x27;s background). Java is: boilerplate-y, slow to iterate with, hard to express higher-level concepts in, requires lots of ceremony (in everything from type definitions to the build system). Clojure is a direct response to the cries of Java devs: the polar opposite of all the things they&#x27;re sick of, without giving up the ecosystem that they&#x27;re comfortable with.<p>Whereas for me: TypeScript is concise enough, functional enough, and has the added benefit of static types and multi-paradigm features for when you need them. The primitives aren&#x27;t as good as Clojure&#x27;s, and immutability requires a library, but I&#x27;m not so traumatized by Enterprise Java that I feel the need to seek out the exact opposite of it.<p>Not to invalidate that perspective; I&#x27;m just wondering if the Java background explains the discrepancy between different people&#x27;s feelings about Clojure.')
