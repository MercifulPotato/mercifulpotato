They&#x27;re interconnected.<p>It&#x27;s not like Intel can make 5.4 GHz chips for days on. It doesn&#x27;t work that way. Ofcourse they can manufacture processors capable of some ridiculous 6.0 GHz (not accounting for power consumption)... but that would be 0.1% yield. You cannot run a factory like this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techspot.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2039-chip-binning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techspot.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2039-chip-binning&#x2F;</a>')
