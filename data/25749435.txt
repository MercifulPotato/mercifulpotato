They still exist, they still have Internet access, and they&#x27;re still filled with hate.  But at least they&#x27;re not on Twitter anymore.<p>And when AWS sees that they&#x27;re flocking to a hate site hosted on their platform, there&#x27;s no reason they have to tolerate it.  Sure, they&#x27;ll go somewhere else, and maybe the hate site will find a new hosting provider, but at least they aren&#x27;t hosted on AWS anymore.<p>If we have to play an constant game of Whack-a-Nazi, I vote we whack as many Nazis as we can.')
