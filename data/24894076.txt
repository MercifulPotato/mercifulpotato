It&#x27;s whether or not a real-world LISP code-base espouses these qualities.<p>Which I don&#x27;t believe it does, IMO the primary reason LISP isn&#x27;t mainstream is because it results in <i>less</i> readable code for humans (i.e. the primary objective of programming languages), it&#x27;s semantically the perfect minimalist language for a machine but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s optimal readability for humans. Other disadvantages include lack of typing &amp; poor tooling support. There&#x27;s certainly domains it excels at due to its intrinsic qualities but I don&#x27;t see it ever becoming a popular mainstream general purpose programming language.')
