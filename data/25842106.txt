The mass-media elite who dictate the prevailing narrative are telling the masses that it&#x27;s good to support BLM and Antifa, while it&#x27;s bad to support <i>the others</i>. Simple as that. &quot;It&#x27;s only bad if it&#x27;s not my group doing it&quot;.<p>There is nothing more <i>disgusting</i> than a person who applies ideals and values selectively like this, who doesn&#x27;t commit to the ideals themselves (gleaned from a related comment which I love [1]):<p>&quot;I was part of a news and current events Facebook group a few years ago, when WikiLeaks was primarily known for leaking evidence of the US Military&#x27;s abuses in the middle East.<p>Most of the people in this group were Democrats or otherwise on the Left. They cheered WikiLeaks and loved that it was exposing the abuses of a group they didn&#x27;t like.<p>Fast forward to 2016, and WikiLeaks begins publishing damaging information related to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign. The same people who cheered WikiLeaks as it published very damaging information about the US Military now condemned it because it was targeting someone they actually supported.<p>This was a major moment of clarity and realization for me. It showed me that those who are quick to use ideals to defend their positions (&quot;freedom of information is good, it exposes the US&#x27; crimes!&quot;) will just as quickly discard those ideals when they stop working in their own interest (&quot;WikiLeaks should not be publishing damaging information about Clinton!&quot;).<p>I was disgusted, because these people were so quick to use a moralistic position built upon high ideals to attack the US but they were themselves absolutely bereft of a true commitment to ideals. Within a few weeks the group&#x27;s attitude on WikiLeaks shifted from gratitude and respect to hatred.<p>When I pointed this out, I was kicked out of the group.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21899476" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21899476</a>')
