Other contemporary designs such as AMD’s Zen(1 through 3) and Intel’s µarch’s, x86 CPUs today still only feature a 4-wide decoder designs<p>This is one place where the 64-bit ARM ISA design shines: since all instructions are exactly 4 bytes wide and always aligned to 4 bytes, it&#x27;s easy to make a very wide decoder, since there&#x27;s no need to compute the instruction length and align the instruction stream before decoding.')
