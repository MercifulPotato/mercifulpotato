There&#x27;s far more to a Debian package than simply aggregating a bunch of files into a container and calling it a day.<p>Making sure it&#x27;s all correctly split into runtime, library, development, documentation, debug etc. parts, and ensuring that each part has the correct dependencies upon other packages in the system is a much more involved task.  But it&#x27;s this part that adds most of the value compared with simply building from source.<p>Making a &quot;package&quot; is easy.  But the real point of packaging is <i>integration with the wider system</i>, and that part requires actual effort.  Docker doesn&#x27;t even attempt it.  Docker is easy and convenient primarily because it pretends that problem doesn&#x27;t even exist.  It does the easy 10% of the job while ignoring the 90% of the work that takes the time and effort.')
