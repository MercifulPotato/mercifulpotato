I totally dropped it as soon as Discord became popular, not because I didn&#x27;t like it - but literally everyone moved over, I didn&#x27;t want to be left behind.<p>Totally can see how some folks out here value their data a lot more and want to keep things private! That&#x27;s where TeamSpeak will always thrive!<p>Here&#x27;s a little bit of a story-time anecdote: Back when I was in school, we used TeamSpeak to talk after hours, it was like the equivalent of people double (or 1.5x) my age spending hours and hours on the phone and their parents yelling &quot;GET OFF THE PHONE&quot;. \nIt was a win win situation because with ADSL (3mbps lol) I could be connected all day and not hog the phone line, additionally the in-built chat to whisper things was good enough that we could exchange links for funny images&#x2F;flash games etc.<p>The voice quality was never bad, it took a little server configuration to get it just right, and the ability to record your voice and the conversation made for some hilarious clips compilation throughout the years, sometimes we still share some of those clips to remember what it was like to have a squeaky teenage voice.<p>I spent thousands of hours on TeamSpeak and also tried Ventrilo&#x2F;Mumble - but I was defo a team TeamSpeak kid...Also I really liked the fact that TeamSpeak had a public servers list that we could just join when someone forgot to pay the bill for our own server. Yep we rotated...so it wouldn&#x27;t be the burden of 1 person paying for everyone!<p>Speaking of paying the bill, it was always just a couple of dollars PayPal&#x27;d over to someone who had a larger servers, basically sub-renting a whole room and subrooms...made us feel like adults paying our own bills :)<p>Thanks for allowing me to drive down memory lane!')
