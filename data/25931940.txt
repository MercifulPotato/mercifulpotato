Milgram&#x27;s answer is: for the &quot;teacher,&quot; there is no need to overpower the researcher (Milgram called him the &quot;experimenter&quot;) in order to end the experiment. The teacher can just walk away. (And then, if he sees fit, he can call the police or otherwise report the experimenter.)<p>Milgram was at pains to construct a situation in which there wasn&#x27;t even an implied threat from the experimenter. When teachers protest that they don&#x27;t want to continue, the harshest thing that the experimenter says is &quot;You have no choice; you must go on.&quot; Milgram wanted to see how obedient people might be when there wasn&#x27;t even an implied threat of force. (And he found that 65% of subjects were willing to deliver the maximum shock under these conditions.)')
