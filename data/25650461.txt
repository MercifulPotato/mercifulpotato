I want to write a paragraph. I can&#x27;t in many cases, and I need to break English or ruin the wording. So, it&#x27;s okay for the texting culture, I guess, but not for people who care about what they say and how they say it. I know many people bombard you on IM or Slack with tens of messages instead of writing a single paragraph. You think that&#x27;s okay? It&#x27;s a pity if you think so! No wonder people today are suffering from all kinds of attention disorders!')
