AIUI, the project got neglected or abandoned, so someone re-implemented it in Ruby to create AsciiDoctor -- same markup, different rendering engine.<p>Some like it, some don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t mind working with it, but I haven&#x27;t used it in anger. It seems pretty good. It&#x27;s richer and more expressive than Markdown, which is feeble and that&#x27;s resulted in multiple subtly-different, incompatible implementations.<p>It compares with RST -- ReStructured Text, another lightweight, human-readable plain-text markup format that&#x27;s used in several places.<p>The advantage of ADoc is that its model maps onto that of DocBook, so it&#x27;s possible to render ADoc into DocBook and then use it with established DocBook toolchains.<p>I mostly work in DocBook, but I don&#x27;t like it much. I personally find raw XML horribly wordy and it took me a long time -- at least months -- to learn to read it or write it fairly easily and fluidly.<p>ADoc you can learn in an afternoon and the source remains perfectly naked-eye readable.<p>The arguable weakness is that because DocBook is a tightly-specified format, you can formally validate a DocBook document. You know it will work and render to something, even if what comes out isn&#x27;t quite what you wanted.<p>Whereas you can&#x27;t verify an ADoc document. It&#x27;s possible to write something that looks fine but isn&#x27;t and which might produce wildly different output from what you intended. You just can&#x27;t formally tell (i.e. in software) if it&#x27;s going to work or not: anything will work and produce _something_.<p>An advantage for humans, but a big snag if you&#x27;re trying to automate making PDFs or e-books or something from it. In most cases, if you&#x27;re using some form of continuous integration or something, it&#x27;s preferable that it will stop with an error and tell you than for it to churn out something totally bogus.')
