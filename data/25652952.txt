It is very unusual for anything to come up overnight and being paged is the last resort.  If there was a sleepless night, we&#x27;d make sure you weren&#x27;t oncall anymore that week.  Oncall is about being available to be called within a certain amount of time, not being awake to keep an eye on things.  Software keeps an eye on things.<p>Nobody thinks a 24 hour oncall rotation is optimal, which is why companies distribute themselves throughout the world and simply have people at work somewhere 24 hours a day.  But even at companies like Google, it&#x27;s not always possible.  You have to balance working on a small team and moving quickly versus having triple dev-team redundancy.<p>Some other workarounds are:<p>1) Hire someone to be awake during off hours.  They won&#x27;t be around with the rest of the team, so probably won&#x27;t have the same understanding of the service that they are responsible for supporting.  Personally, I&#x27;ve never seen this work well -- both teams see each other as &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; and don&#x27;t really help each other.<p>2) Ignore all issues between 5PM and 9AM.  This is quite possible to do, and might be the right thing for certain companies.<p>3) Hope nothing bad happens, and when something bad does happen, call everyone on the team frantically hoping someone will be awake and answer your call.<p>Like I said, I&#x27;m happy with the balance I have at work.  I think it gives our customers the confidence they need to trust us, while giving engineers a decent work-life balance.  I&#x27;m just some random engineer; I didn&#x27;t start this company or force this upon others.  I chose it for myself.<p>I shared my experience because I think it&#x27;s relatively unique (with the OP&#x27;s experience of mandatory uncompensated work the norm), and I like it.')
