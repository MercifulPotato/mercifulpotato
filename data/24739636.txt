The Ebbinghaus curve itself is a very crude approximation.<p>See this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;languagelearning.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;3757&#x2F;which-srs-algorithm-yields-greatest-evidence-based-remembering" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;languagelearning.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;3757&#x2F;wh...</a><p>(I&#x27;m a language learner and an active user of SRS)<p>The notion of an outdated algorithm corresponding to worse or better results to me is neither here nor there. There&#x27;s evidence that the repetition interval itself is not the critical factor in retention. Empirically we know there are things that we remember with 0 repetitions (the vivid details of a traumatic event), while other things we struggle to remember even with SRS when there&#x27;s no emotional connection to what is being memorized.<p>When you&#x27;re doing self-hacking, you have to understand you&#x27;re working on a highly variable, complex adaptive system that defies optimality and exactness. Much of what is known are approximations.')
