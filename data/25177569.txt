I also lost time deciphering some clever metaprogramming.<p>It is more about the developer than the language though. I go with simple solutions no matter which language I use. I worked on some old code of mine last week (it was Python) and I couldn&#x27;t understand it immediately. I fixed a problem and I&#x27;ll rewrite part of it this week to make it clear what it does. It will also lower the chances of bugs.')
