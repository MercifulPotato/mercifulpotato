What a shocker.<p>Students who go to a selective school, often want to go to selective companies and continue to build their “brand” to maximize their success (or at least optionality).<p>It’s usually later on when people figure out what’s important to them and are confident enough to stray for the default path. For example, my current company is a well known one, but isn’t FANG. I chose there because I use &#x2F; care about the product, and the culture is pretty much exactly what I was looking for. It’s growing, I’m paid well, and I’m relatively happy.  I don’t feel the urge anymore to work for the hottest companies or what not.')
