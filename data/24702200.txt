We&#x27;re talking about where the word &quot;Viking&quot; came from. It clearly came from the Anglo-Saxon word, &quot;Wicing.&quot;<p>They appear to be the same word. That&#x27;s not an answer. I could tell you that the modern word &quot;laser&quot; came from the older form LASER, but that would be stupid. You&#x27;re trying to terminate the question before it&#x27;s even begun.<p>Note that in fact the modern word &quot;Viking&quot; is not obviously related to the Old English &quot;wicing&quot;; that term died out. Modern &quot;Viking&quot; is taken directly from later Norse by modern historians. Unless you&#x27;re claiming the Norse borrowed it from the British?<p>&gt; They weren&#x27;t writing it down &quot;retroactively&quot; but contemporaneously.<p>You are simultaneously arguing that<p>1. The British referred to Norse pirates using a term that looks like &quot;Viking&quot;, which we know because they wrote it down at the time.<p>2. The Norse, hundreds of years later, also had a term that looks like &quot;Viking&quot;.<p>3. We know the Norse didn&#x27;t use that term at the time the invaded Britons were using it, because they didn&#x27;t write it down.

In fact, interesting side note, the Norse of the time didn&#x27;t write anything down.<p>I could go on to conclude that they couldn&#x27;t speak. Or I could conclude that the primary sources <i>don&#x27;t have anything to say</i> about where this word first appeared, because it is closely related to an almost entirely illiterate culture.')
