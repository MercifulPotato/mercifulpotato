That said, Gore was hoisted by his own petard and not by SCOTUS. It&#x27;s important to remember that Gore did not wish to recount the <i>entire</i> state and <i>all</i> the ballots in the same way, but only in areas and ways considered favourable to Gore.<p>If Gore hadn&#x27;t tried that stunt, the process wouldn&#x27;t have dragged on until December, and the Court wouldn&#x27;t have been able to interfere. Even more ironically, later attempts to check the count show that all of the recounting standards Gore had actually asked for would have led to Bush winning; Only a complete and fair recount may have allowed Gore to win.')
