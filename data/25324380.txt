First of all, it&#x27;s not &quot;Europe&quot; but rather &quot;Euro-accounts&quot; (so no cross-currency transfers). Also not that fast - don&#x27;t work overnight, on the weekends, payments might take a day to arrive.<p>I just checked - paying 10EUR from my UK account to the EUR area takes 2-4 days (I&#x27;d need to pay 15GBP for an &quot;urgent&quot; next-<i>business</i>-day transfer) (same rate as TransferWise) whereas if I want to send 10kEUR I&#x27;d pay 250 GBP (!) for a &quot;no-fee&quot; (!!) transfer than with TransferWise (a.k.a. <i>scam</i>). Paying from EUR to EUR account (cross-border) costs about 0.1% (0.38 EUR fee to send 350EUR) which isn&#x27;t too bad.<p>Suffice to say, room for improvement.')
