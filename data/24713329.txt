If you are looking at a single instance where Monty got lucky and chose a goat door, then the probability that the door you have chosen has the car is 1&#x2F;2, and switching doesn&#x27;t change anything. This can easily be tested: just write a simulation that runs the experiment with Monty choosing a random door, and discard the instances where the game was &quot;ruined&quot; because he picked the car. In the remaining instances, both strategies will perform the same.')
