Just like some modern games will hold your attention for longer than others. There&#x27;s some retro games I still clock up a great many hours on.<p>Pac-Man and Tetris are still my favourite all time games. Doom 2 is still my favourite FPS. Soulcalibur on the Dreamcast is still my favourite beat em up. System Shock 2 is still my favourite survival horror. All of these games were released &gt; 20 years ago (30+ in some cases).')
