I was very excited about Rust at first, especially the ownership system, but after a while I saw that it was a cleaned-up C++ with <i>most</i> of C++&#x27;s problems (one of the most complex programming languages in software history; very slow feedback loop). Zig, on the other hand, seems revolutionary and a complete rethinking, from the ground-up, of what low-level programming should be. True, Rust is probably 100x more popular, but is still well below 1% market adoption, so we&#x27;re comparing two rounding errors in terms of adoption.')
