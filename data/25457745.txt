When submitting to HN the front page probably isn&#x27;t the best thing.  The blog post at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ethicalads.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;ethicalads-newsletter-november-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ethicalads.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;ethicalads-newsletter...</a> seems more interesting to me because you detail the number of ads, publishers, and revenue.  It&#x27;s much more likely to generate interest and discussion.<p>2. Classic two-sided market problem in that you need to attract advertisers and publishers to the network and there&#x27;s no incentive to take the risk of joining.  Any thoughts on how to make the network more attractive to publishers and advertisers?<p>3. Really like the focus on a niche audience (developers), at least as a starting point.  There&#x27;s probably an answer to #2 above.<p>4. Are there plans to increase the contextual awareness of the ads?  E.g. if the publisher is focus on front end tools (e.g. react) might be able to tailor the ads on that site to more front-end relevant advertisements.')
