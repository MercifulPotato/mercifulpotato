Not having your child in your life is one of the worst forms of torture a person should not be forced to endure.<p>&gt; Support the child as ordered by the courts<p>The courts are, as you said, obtuse and jaded. Not to mention very often biased.<p>&gt; Accept that and live your best life<p>You can&#x27;t, when you&#x27;re a good parent, you can&#x27;t &quot;live your best life&quot; if your child was torn away from you.<p>&gt; after all You don&#x27;t own the child<p>I&#x27;m trying to be charitable here, because the HN guidelines encourage steelmanning, but comparing &quot;wanting to have your child in your life&quot; with &quot;thinking you own your child&quot; is appalling, to put it mildly. I hope this is just very, very, unfortunate phrasing, because I could find no other way to read it.<p>&gt; This can be much easier on the child than witnessing constant bickering, accusations and pettiness between the parents.<p>Being separated from a parent can have even more dire consequences on the child. And there actually are studies on that.<p>&gt; might be wrong<p>You argued in favor of the extremely unfair status quo of the courts and tried to suggest it could be better for the child.')
