But I&#x27;m feeling like I should have some kind of contract to limit my liability (potentially).<p>Does anyone know of some kind of standard contract, perhaps some open source thing? I&#x27;m not asking for legal advice, I know I&#x27;ll be taking on any and all risk if I don&#x27;t have it reviewed by a lawyer. But if anyone could share something they like to use in their own work it would be much appreciated!')
