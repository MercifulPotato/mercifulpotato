Most trucks in the US already have something in the cab to handle signaling the driver to pull in to the weigh station, implying that adding tracking &amp; billing wouldn&#x27;t be too hard. We&#x27;re also starting to see GPS &amp; LTE in the trailers too, to fight theft, so that&#x27;s an easy integration point.<p>It&#x27;s a bit harder with cars, since there&#x27;s a lot less infrastructure to track usage, and people would rightfully balk at the invasion of privacy.')
