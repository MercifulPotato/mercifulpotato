Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604011565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936778, text='&gt; My biggest concern is that the &quot;they&#x27;re private companies, they can do whatever they want&quot; argument applies to ISP&#x27;s, too - they&#x27;re private companies as well. We&#x27;ve already seen Epik being &quot;deplatformed&quot; by PayPal (also a private company) for allowing controversial content to pass through their infrastructure.<p>This isn&#x27;t new or unique to paypal. The Credit Card companies and banks that underly pretty much every fancy modern method of money transfer have and do &quot;deplatform&quot; people. And they&#x27;ve done it for ages. Porn companies can&#x27;t use conventional credit card processors, and there&#x27;s a long history of banks and credit cards refusing to do business with certain companies (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deplatforming#Financial_services" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deplatforming#Financial_servic...</a>).<p>Whatever your overall opinion of deplatforming, the idea isn&#x27;t anything new or unique to twitter. ISPs were singled out (they aren&#x27;t anymore, net neutrality was rolled back, now your argument only applies to phone companies).')
