But saying that the author didn&#x27;t consider all aspects is disingenuous - they literally did, they just don&#x27;t agree with you.<p>Also, you talked about other uses like &quot;protocol and secure network&quot;. Aren&#x27;t these just features of the technology that powers BTC (e.g. blockchain)?')
