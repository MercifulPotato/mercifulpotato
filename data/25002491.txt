I doubt that the business case for that is strong.<p>Europe is much denser when comapared to US. You can do a lot within 300KM in Europe. Volvo openly states that the trucks are &quot;to be used for regional transport and urban construction operations in Europe&quot;.<p>The trucks in question and the possible range is very well suited to this kind of operation.<p>Also, there&#x27;s another important factor: Noise. Some European countries are more sensitive to noise than others. The Netherlands and Sweden comes to my mind.<p>These trucks will be a huge win on that front because a 44 tonne truck is not exactly silent, especially under load.')
