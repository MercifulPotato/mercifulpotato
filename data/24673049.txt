And as such, they lose a case.<p>But about that data...<p>See, I&#x27;ve always heard Facebook makes the largest part of its money by selling data about its users.<p>Is that not true? Or, even worse, was it wrong of me to assign value to articles and news stories that stated this? If so, why?<p>What about the reverse? Would there be those who consider it foolish to place stock in a statement that says Facebook does not sell user data, or sells it anonymized?<p>It feels to me like a deliberate attempt to move all conversation on the subject into the territory of &quot;you can&#x27;t really know for sure, so SHUT UP&quot;.<p>Get people to stop talking about it, by virtue of casting doubt on everything anyone says.<p>Meanwhile, Facebook keeps doing whatever it&#x27;s doing. Nothing changes.<p>Facebook could fix this problem by opening up about what it does with the data. But it refuses to do that. Trade secrets, I suppose?<p>Either way, it&#x27;s Facebook who&#x27;s handling the data, not us. As such, all responsibility falls on them, not us.')
