Lots of conversations go like:<p>Person A: &quot;If the system&#x27;s going to be configured with option X-&quot;<p>Person B: &quot;We just heard we&#x27;re definitely going with option Y&quot;<p>Person A: &quot;Oh thanks, so..&quot;<p>Nobody is served by person A going on that tangent with a false assumption, so a quick interruption is fine.<p>Of course needless or rude interruptions are bad. Maybe part of this should be that women should be made to feel more comfortable giving necessary interruptions like in my example.')
