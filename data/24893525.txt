The ones relevant to this are...  I don&#x27;t make eye contact and am largely blind to all but the most blatant nonverbal communication (ex: sobbing).  Additionally, I have a flat affect (don&#x27;t express emotions through facial expressions the way others do and have a monotone voice).<p>At my current work no one uses a camera, so there&#x27;s not even the chance of seeing facial expressions or making eye contact either direction, though presumably people notice my monotone voice.  I feel like this work environment has finally putting me on a near level playing ground with my coworkers.<p>I&#x27;ve never been &quot;liked&quot; so much by people, coworkers or otherwise.  Last week one told me I was the nicest person he&#x27;d ever worked with.  Normally people perceive me as uncaring due to my personality&#x2F;behavior quirks.  I tend to have less social needs than most people, but it&#x27;s still nice to be thought of positively rather than negatively.<p>It never occurred to me until reading the threads here that people would have feelings about these communication attributes they are missing out on.  I often forget that people communicate on more layers that I do.')
