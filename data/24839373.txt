It&#x27;s like two or three totally unrelated books mashed together. I felt like I was having a nice classic sci-fi read, then all of a sudden it&#x27;s wild and insane speculation about KKK-redux fundamentalists, and then back into normal sci-fi, only to be replaced by what was ultimately a pretty puerile fantasy novel. Really not sure how to feel about it. Could have been a lot better.')
