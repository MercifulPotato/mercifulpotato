The upload speed is actually very good - easily our highest bandwidth connection because we have to get hundreds of gigabytes of data a week to the North (mostly South Pole Telescope and IceCube). We also get some &quot;public&quot; capacity for the station which is about 5 mbps while it&#x27;s up.<p>Competition for use is still strong.
