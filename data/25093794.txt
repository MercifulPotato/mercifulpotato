We ban accounts that do that. You needn&#x27;t use your real name, of course, but for HN to be a community, users need some identity for other users to relate to. Otherwise we may as well have no usernames and no community, and that would be a different kind of forum. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=community%20identity%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=community%20identity%20by:dang...</a>')
