We do wash equipment to make sure that wet soils are not left in the nooks an crannies of our equipment, but the idea that we&#x27;d have a frame rot away from rust.. that seems like a 100 year timeline issue to me. Combine hoppers need to be cleaned out every season and do rot away, put that&#x27;s not a tractor frame.<p>The painting at issue always seems to be very cosmetic to me, painting the hood on a tractor doesn&#x27;t extend its life.. but it might increase its resale value!')
