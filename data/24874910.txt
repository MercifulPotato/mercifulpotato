Just because something is &quot;extremely unlikely&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that it didn&#x27;t happen to us. I.e. whomever this happened to, would ask himself that question. We may just be the ones it happened to.<p>Also: Why would they settle species from millions of years in their own past. If they wanted to colonize, they could start with their own life-forms.<p>Could be several things as well:<p>* We are a genesis project and they will simply come back later and settle in what we left behind (i.e. they let the ecosystem build for a few million years before trying out this settlement)<p>* They don&#x27;t want to create competitors<p>* We are a population bomb, i.e. they just sent out billions of probes trying to populate any given habitable planet, and they couldn&#x27;t just spawn themselves there and instead had to start from somewhere where a sustainable ecosystem would derive from')
