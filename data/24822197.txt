Also Europe is not like the US, where you can just build in a lot of unincorporated areas, so building a new luxury home out of sight of the castle on your property is most likely impossible as well. I&#x27;m not 100% sure about this, but my guess is that the presence of the castle might even devalue the land in a lot of these cases, ie you would pay more for an equivalent amount of &quot;empty&quot; land.')
