Things got a lot better there and I think a lot of the organized crime might have moved up north.<p>The construction industry is very clearly siphoning billions of dollars of tax money into organized criminals&#x27; hands. Every few years a given street gets torn up with a new excuse. And it seems to be consensus that it&#x27;s much worse these days than it used to be.. this year in particular I think something like one out of every five blocks downtown is closed off for &quot;construction&quot;.<p>Cops saying &quot;just don&#x27;t look into it&quot; regarding organized crime sounds about par for the course anywhere I&#x27;ve ever been though.')
