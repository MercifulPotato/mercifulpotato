It&#x27;s the same story as with every other vaccines. (Why does it have to be repeated <i>every time</i>?)<p>Very simple: If you want to go back to a normal life, you want herd immunity. You want 60+% of people vaccinated. NOT the 2-3% who are highly at risk.<p>Furthermore, please remember that, much like many other diseases, you can still suffer severe consequences from COVID-19, and you can still die from it, even if you are healthy.<p>Not wanting the vaccine because you have &quot;low chances of dying&quot; is like not wearing a seat belt because you have &quot;low chances of getting into an accident&quot;. Wear your fucking seat belt.')
