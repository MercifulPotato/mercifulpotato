No matter how they position their battery advantages everyone can easily copy them. They don&#x27;t have magic chemistry. Plus batteries are so cheap already it doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.<p>Every other car company has an EV, some with similar battery sizes. But no-one has infotainment and gizmos like Tesla has. This is where Tesla&#x27;s premium kicks in (asides from packing bigger batteries for no particularly good reason).<p>I&#x27;m looking for an EV for my parents in Europe and Tesla is basically 1.8x more for quite much better range and way better tech, but questionable build quality. Basically non-starter for now.')
