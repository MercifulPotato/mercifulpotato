Importantly, section 230&#x27;s shield, as written, only restricts liability where the provider is also the creator of the content, such as when it alters content received (because in that context, it is the creator of the altered content).<p>But Thomas has decided that the law really means that you either post everything you get sent (unless it&#x27;s illegal), or you don&#x27;t get to exercise any editorial control over what shows up on your website at all unless it clearly falls within the filterable catgories of 230(c)(2) (i.e., objectionable content).  But 230(c)(2) is just a safe harbor that explicitly delineates what is definitely protected provider activity, it isn&#x27;t meant to be an exhaustive list of what is protected provider activity.<p>In fact, if you look at all the cases cited by Thomas as being wrong and actually read the decisions...you find that they are logically sound and based on technical interpretations of section 230 as actually written and not what Thomas fantasizes in his head.<p>TLDR: it&#x27;s just Thomas being Thomas.')
