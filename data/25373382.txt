It&#x27;s possible to outsource IT administration to a local IT company and pay only for set-up and maintenance that is needed. Way less than 72k a year for many use cases.<p>Also, companies that employ bunch of developers can find a developer that has IT administration expertise and allocate some of his time to this. Still cheaper than 72k a year or employing someone full-time, if IT requirements don&#x27;t call for full time job.<p>It&#x27;s not just cloud vs full-time.')
