Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609522262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604593, text='Downpour.com, Libro.fm, and Audiobooksnow.com are my go-to&#x27;s (the last of these has a tiny handful of DRM&#x27;d titles, so check for a &quot;Downloadable&quot; symbol). Each of these has subscription memberships which you should take advantage of; you can cancel at any time, so I usually subscribe, buy, and cancel all at once when I want a book.<p>Google Play audiobooks are also DRM-Free, but tend to be more expensive.<p>I do also <i>occasionally</i> buy from Audible, when a book isn&#x27;t available anywhere else. You can strip the DRM with ffmpeg once you know the key for your account. But most audiobooks can be had natively DRM-Free if you shop around a bit.')
