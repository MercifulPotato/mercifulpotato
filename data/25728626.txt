I have a question. I own a 5 kW on grid setup for net metering. Works fine but now I want to use backups. I have two options,\neither lithium 100ah 48v which is expensive or 12v 200ah x 4 to make 48v. Cheaper but limited life because the home load would be on it entirely.<p>I dont know. The calculation of kWh checks out to be 100ah x 48v = 4800wh. And for lead acid 200ah x 12v x 2= 4800wh.<p>What do you suggest or is there something I am thinking incorrectly... space is not an issue BTW.')
