Assuming you&#x27;re talking about commit hashes, I&#x27;m not particularly worried about the threat of a someone crafting a commit with a malicious hash to my repo because I have much bigger issues than commit hash duplicates if someone malicious is able to commit to my repo. Given that, SHA1 is just as safe to use for my commit hashes as it&#x27;s always been; the fact that crafting collisions purposely has gotten easier doesn&#x27;t make accidental collisions any more likely to happen.')
