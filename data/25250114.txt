Used to develop on PHPstorm ( another Jetbrain ) product ( same software in the background ) and the slow startup&#x27;s, 2GB+ memory eating for relative small projects, crashes way too much, expensive as hell for what it does ( especially with the license change years ago ) ...<p>Eventually switched to Visual Studio Code and while people whine how Electron is memory inefficient, its like 1&#x2F;6 the memory usage of PHPstorm, with only a few features missing.<p>Even on a 32GB PC system, i barely use 16GB ( and WSL2 is eating up a lot with a lot of docker images. And its not really docker, just Linux cache eating up memory ). Not a issue on a Mac that does not need a VM like layer.<p>Its about priorities sometimes. If people keep upgrading their memory, developers&#x2F;companies simply push the responsibility to the clients and do not bother with spending time on optimizing.<p>If people start leaving software product on the way side for being just horrible inefficient messes, then maybe a bit of focus will come back to actually optimizing products! You will see Jetbrain change tune, when VSC etc keep eating its market share.')
