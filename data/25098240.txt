Particularly I am not claiming ethics of gene-editing or Eugenics in general, but that the public has no appetite for this as seen with the strong ethical claims against Eugenics.<p>By a &quot;non-binding eugenics guideline&quot; I mean something akin to &quot;ex-convicts should not produce&quot; or something, I mean there is absolutely zero state or national guideline that I know of that invokes arguments of eugenics, if you know of one then I am mistaken.')
