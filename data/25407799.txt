However, a good tool for controlling complexity is deciding what your system is going to do.  As I said in a sibling comment, consider method overloading in java: this is a real world feature, not uncommon in other languages.  There are arguments for and against it (I am against it.)<p>The implementation of it may be amazing code, but none the less it makes the java compiler and runtime far more complicated that it would be if the feature were omitted.<p>So, again, I agree with you, but I also agree with the articles point that choosing features carefully is an important tool in controlling complexity.')
