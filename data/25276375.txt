Item(by='xmodem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606917706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265546, text='&gt; I suspect that Apple will support x86 longer than it supported PPC.<p>Totally agree - I was surprised how quickly they dropped PPC support. The install base is so much larger now, and hardware refresh cycles so much longer that it&#x27;ll be necessary. Hell, they&#x27;ve said this transition will take 2 years - the Intel transition took them a year to go from no Intel macs to all Intel macs.<p>&gt; So, I suspect a minimum of 8 years support,<p>Not gonna happen. The Apple of today does not care about old unmaintained applications and definitely does not want to make computers for people to run Windows on.')
