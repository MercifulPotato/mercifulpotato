After 3 months of work, I have created a complete platform that simplifies link sharing and collaboration, allowing you to seamlessly share, save, and collaborate on links. I built it with Python and Flask, used Bootstrap for the front-end, and am using Heroku for hosting the site. There were a lot of technical difficulties I faced and had to wade through a lot of uncharted territories, but I&#x27;m super excited to finally launch SeeLink and get it out to the world! Also, let me know if you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions. Feel free to ask me any questions about how I built the site, and I&#x27;d be happy to answer them.')
