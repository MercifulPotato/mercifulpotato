Pragmatically, I cant. Could be the one brilliant or accidental play that the CCP made, they hold the majority of manufacturing. It&#x27;s not just about money. The covid lockdowns showed how dependent the world is on chinese manufacturing. Essentially the situation that every &quot;xenophobic&quot; warned about. Generally, it should be more of a centralized vs distributed discussion when it comes to manufacturing sourcing instead of a US vs China argument (or lowercase us, because I think other countries are in the same boat). But one is emotionally charged and gets clicks, and the other is a thoughtful form of discourse no one will ever listen to.<p>Until the rest of the G20 distributes their goods sources to both internal and other external locales, China won&#x27;t get a meaningful sanction anytime soon. The average &quot;moral&quot; person may say we should all do the right thing no matter the economic outcome... when push comes to shove, they back off that real quick. You can only calmly walk the high ground if someone bled before you to take that hill.')
