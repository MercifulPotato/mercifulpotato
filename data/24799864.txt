They are trying to get World of Warcraft or Fortnite pros.<p>First and foremost, I doubt many children who aspire to be Fortnite pros would have ever considered being a professional athlete in a past life. Aside from some <i>very</i> notable exceptions (e.g. Tyler1), those don&#x27;t seem to be intersecting circles very often.<p>Secondly, they&#x27;re just lofty aspirations. Most children have no more chance of being Fortnite pros than they do of being professional athletes. Does it really matter what childhood fantasy they choose to chase, outside of obvious exceptions (e.g. serial killer)?<p>I assume your counterpoint here will be about physical fitness, so I&#x27;ll just say: It&#x27;s obviously possible to be a healthy and fit professional gamer (see: well, I already said, Tyler1). It&#x27;s also obviously possible to be a pretty unhealthy professional athlete (see: The numerous ex-pros past and present suffering from CTE).<p>&gt; Before it was: principled, ethical, decent, proper, just, honorable, honest, good.<p>I don&#x27;t know where this is coming from. Professional sports has always been full of people like Mike Tyson and the Boz. Hollywood obviously has&#x2F;had people like Harvey Weinstein. Do I really need to name any &quot;unprincipled&quot; rock stars?<p>&gt; Now the main goals seem to be exploitation<p>The entertainment industry is just so incredibly rife with this since basically inception that I don&#x27;t really think I need to even list an example here.<p>&gt; spammy link building<p>Hollywood, of course, has been infamous for the IRL equivalent of this for quite some time.<p>&gt; dishonest marketing<p>Milli Vanilli, or any number of artists that don&#x27;t actually write their songs<p>&gt; the me-first principle.<p>Eli Manning famously said he would go to law school before playing for the Chargers, the team that drafted him, because he didn&#x27;t think it would be good for his career.')
