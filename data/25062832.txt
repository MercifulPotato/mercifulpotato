It&#x27;s also risk aversion. If you&#x27;re optimizing for numbers of papers published, and you&#x27;re optimizing for your confidence that your next paper is going to be accepted, it leads to redundant and uninteresting research.<p>The research world, just like every other social circle, is full of people who are just parroting each other, repeating to each other what everyone already believes, and patting themselves on the back. Maybe, once in a while, one person takes a risk, gets a cool result, and then 100 others rehash the same idea with small variations. At some point, the field collectively decides what the next cool research meme is going to be, and everybody follows along.<p>So yeah, structural battery packs stopped being cool at some point, I guess. Except that battery tech 10 years ago wasn&#x27;t the same as what we have today, so maybe the results don&#x27;t directly transfer. The topic hasn&#x27;t been studied in a contemporary context, maybe the old results are out of date, maybe they would really be worth investigating again... But who cares, that topic has been done, it isn&#x27;t cool anymore, it was 10 years ago. All the cool kids are doing solid state batteries nowadays.')
