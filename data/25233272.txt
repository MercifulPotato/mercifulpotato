[...] Make the operating system one file.<p>Yes and yes! That&#x27;s actually exactly what I&#x27;ve been working on with Actually Portable Executable. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;ape.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;ape.html</a><p>&gt; How could we simplify: Write a GUI bootloader<p>Nooo. There&#x27;s the problem. GUIs have always been a shitshow w.r.t. compatibility. I&#x27;ve pretty much come to the conclusion at this point that, if we want simple, we have to give up on wanting it with GUIs. Vendors just aren&#x27;t going to ever agree. There&#x27;s too much vision and financial incentive to compete. However terminals, are boring, and operating systems no longer have any reason to engineer incompatibilities. As of last year, they&#x27;ve all pretty much been like, yeah, we&#x27;ll implement vt100 because we don&#x27;t care anymore. Even Windows CMD prompt! It&#x27;s great. This new consensus is going to make so much toil go away.<p>For example, here&#x27;s an app I wrote a few months ago. It&#x27;s a single file TUI application. The binary runs on all the different operating systems and looks exactly the same. Truly build-once run-anywhere. It literally looks the same on Linux as it does in Windows command prompt and Mac too etc. It doesn&#x27;t have any dependencies. It&#x27;s about 200kb. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;blinkenlights&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;blinkenlights&#x2F;index.h...</a><p>I&#x27;ve been using it lately testing tool, because I want these single file programs to boot from BIOS on bare metal too. I&#x27;ve got it working for stdio so far. So once I add a virtio ethernet driver it&#x27;ll be golden. Especially for cloud deploys. Every program you compile is its own operating system which runs on all the other ones too.
