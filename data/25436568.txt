I could watch stormy weather in the South of the USA, hurricanes rolling in. I even saw someone live streaming driving about in it.<p>The best ever use I got from it was watching the attempted coup in Turkey. I was able to see a news station get overrun, I saw bullets fired from helicopters against protests. The worse one was an armoured personal carrier getting surrounded and then other soldiers fire into the open APC after the occupants opened up.')
