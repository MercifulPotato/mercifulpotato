My ego doesn&#x27;t depend on Bitcoin&#x27;s success. You could say that expecting it to still be around then is naïvité, maybe. But of course, I still disagree.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s success has more to do with its monetary policy and hard-money aspects than with the way it consumes energy. Monetary policy isn&#x27;t something we&#x27;ve seen any innovation with at all in the crypto space. Different coins have different inflation curves, but inflation curves exist in all currencies. They&#x27;re not a new concept, they&#x27;ve just got specific variants.<p>But also, Bitcoin isn&#x27;t static. It&#x27;s still being developed. And I think its focus on slow stability and payments makes it more attractive, not less, in the long-term.<p>It&#x27;s already been here 11 years, 20 is not so many more. I fully expect it to still be around then, and almost certainly in the top position in crypto, if not globally among all currencies.')
