He was wrong about that one thing, and to be fair to him, it&#x27;s still a little amazing in retrospect, even when we can look back over the decades of history through which we&#x27;ve created a society dependent on vast, unimaginably complex, world-spanning computing systems built out of pieces that are virtually all broken.<p>And it&#x27;s not like he was a lone crank railing against the 99% who were moving forward with a well-founded idea of how computing could scale indefinitely by composing incorrect programs.  Just like today, 99% of programming, including programming for government programs and vital infrastructure, was done by people who were only hoping to make their own projects succeed well enough for the next six months to three years.  I&#x27;m sure there were brilliant people who made intelligent arguments against the need for correctness, but their arguments didn&#x27;t carry the day.  Complacency and short-term thinking did.<p>In that context, Dijkstra&#x27;s pessimism and his use of harsh, attention-getting language makes a lot of sense.  How many people at the time really understood that in 2020 every part of our civilization would depend on code compiled by compilers with bugs, linked with libraries with bugs, in virtual machines with bugs, on operating systems with bugs, on CPUs with bugs in their microcode, and yet it would still all mostly work?')
