But, it certainly is part of the business.  And as the consumer, at the time of service, I really don&#x27;t care why it happens, only that it does and that it costs me time and money and delays treatment.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s a byproduct of an adversarial relationship between the 3 parties (consumer, doctor, insurer).  Insurance doesn&#x27;t trust the MD to do his job, so hires their own MDs to second guess.  And on anything that costs more than $100, that second guessing is the default action - the insurance company&#x27;s own MDs are only there to provide legitimacy to the initial denial.  I say this because in ALL cases, my medical needs have eventually been covered, but not before committing more time and energy than should be necessary.<p>At the end of the day, we pay more money (and time) for worse outcomes than most of Western Europe and the wealthier nations in Asia.')
