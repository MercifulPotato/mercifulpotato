However, `null` as a reference, even though that is exactly what is usually &#x27;said&#x27; (the null reference was a billion dollar mistake!), is something different. Typetag based typing systems can have the null reference and nevertheless provide full write-time information about it: &quot;This variable is of a type that isnt tagged &#x27;definitely not null&#x27; and you are passing it as an argument in a position where you are required to have this tag&#x27;&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s language design; things are complicated. Pithy maxims such as &#x27;suffer&#x27;, &#x27;terrible&#x27;, &#x27;biggest crime since MS-DOS&#x27;, and astronomic dollar amounts aren&#x27;t helping.<p>Can we try to put an end to this hyperbole? This very article shows where it goes: We went from &#x27;billion dollar&#x27; mistake to a &#x27;trillion dollar mistake&#x27; in the span of 3 paragraphs.<p>I&#x27;m not looking forward to reading a hackernews post about the Vigintillion Euro Mistake in the near future to describe some solution to a complicated aspect of programming that somebody disliked a little bit.')
