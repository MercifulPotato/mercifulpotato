As an outsider looking in I felt Trump and all his crazy ramblings to be a real fall from grace for America. I felt very much like &quot;wow, America has really lost its way electing this guy&quot;.<p>Exactly.  I think Trump marked the end of America being seen as any kind of &quot;shining city on the hill&quot; (to use Reagan&#x27;s phrase).  He was and is a giant embarrassment for America, even if many Americans don&#x27;t realize it or don&#x27;t care.  I say that as a relatively nonpartisan American with many immigrant friends.')
