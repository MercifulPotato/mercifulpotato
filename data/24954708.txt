The paper is peer reviewed.<p>&gt; Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 to −7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability &gt;95%, low certainty).<p>For masking they find only &quot;low certainty&quot; evidence, and that&#x27;s with N95s or 12 to 16 layers of cotton. (Most people are wearing 3 to 4 layers).<p>Low certainty comes from GRADE and means &quot;The true effect might be markedly different from the estimated effect&quot; -- masks may be markedly more, or markedly less, effective than they found.<p>&gt; What you won&#x27;t find though is studies supporting the assertion that sick person wearing a mask protects others, not the wearer. Those are the studies that show little to no benefit and always did actually. You protect others with a mask by not catching the virus yourself, it&#x27;s a second order effect.<p>Oh-ho, so here we see a clearly shifted goalpost. Everyone else in this thread is saying that the science is obvious and that you wear a mask to prevent your infection from spreading to other people. So, does the science support &quot;source control&quot; or not?')
