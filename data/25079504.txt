The larger the project, the more you have to split it up and write interface documentation between libraries - which adds complexity.<p>As for processing scalability - Python is OK, but it&#x27;s considerably hampered by BDFL&#x27;s own opinions. The result is a few third party libraries that implement parallelism in their own way. That functionality should be integral to the standard library already. The worst part is lack of standard API for data sharing between processes.<p>&gt; packaging<p>Python&#x27;s packaging issues only start with package management. Setuptools is a wholly mess of a system, that literally gave me headaches for the lack of &quot;expected features&quot;. I hate it with every single cell in my body.<p>And then there are systems and libraries, where you literally cannot use docker (Hello PySpark!).<p>&gt;read other people&#x27;s (un documented) code<p>I lolled! Seriously... We get Python fanboys moan about how indentation makes everything more readable and it&#x27;s a pleasure to write code in python. Give me a break!')
