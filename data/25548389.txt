And <i>everyone</i> knows all mechanics will take advantage of your ignorance. And of course, why hire a photographer, all they do is press a button, and why won&#x27;t they give me all the originals so I can run them through filters and ruin their reputation by crediting them with it on Facebook...<p>Now that I think of it, IT people and mechanics suffer from the exact same stereotype where people don&#x27;t trust anything they say and assume they&#x27;re just lording their knowledge over the poor, uninformed user for status&#x2F;money.<p>I&#x27;m sure the others also suffer from stereotypes.')
