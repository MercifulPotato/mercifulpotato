One of the concerns was you&#x27;d never know when they were scanning you and looking inside your car. But of course, though these active systems are invisible to human eyes, they do have to send out pretty strong signals. So I wonder if a kind of sousveillance is possible. Can we have devices that detect the signal being directed at the target, and alarm and publish that info? Both individuals could know if&#x2F;when they are being imaged, and the public could see some patterns in who they look at. Anyone aware of how hard a detector would be to build?')
