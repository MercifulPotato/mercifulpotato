(And the reason I&#x27;ll probably never pay for it.)<p>Other than opening the settings screen, or playing a video and hitting pause, there is no way to leave netflix alone and not have it make noise&#x2F;play video.\nThree seconds after you stop hitting buttons, whatever&#x27;s selected on-screen becomes a full-video ad for that thing. (with all of the annoying traits of ads, like loud attention grabbing sounds)<p>I&#x27;ve idle-mindedly mashed buttons to prevent this on console-netflix while trying to have a conversation about what to watch, with no attention being payed to what was actually on the screen.')
