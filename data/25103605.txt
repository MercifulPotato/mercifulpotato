They will always be niche for cost reasons.<p>A NiCd cell has 1.2V per cell, a lithium cell has 3.2-3.7V per cell, so they need to have three times the electron density just to break even. They are about 1.5-2.0x higher IIRC and aren&#x27;t getting better, while we are still improving lithium slowly.')
