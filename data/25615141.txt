Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609612679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614656, text='&gt; Why are people still thinking that taxing high earners is an option? The world is ruled by rich people, why would they tax themselves? Doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Democracy is nice, until all the choices you have, exhibit the same underlying core values that you disagree with.<p>for the most part, &quot;high earners&quot; are not rich people; they are the upper-middle class. the richest people make the vast majority of their income from investment returns, and are often able to avoid having it count as &quot;income&quot;. the very rich are quite happy to have taxes increased on high salaries in exchange for maintaining the status quo re investments.<p>&gt; Instead, what we need is Democracy 2.0, where the people vote on individual packages, not parties. Switzerland may be the only country where that works out quite well.<p>this much I can agree on. why do I have to choose between guns and abortion?')
