Item(by='nobleach', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606700783, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25245551, text='I worked for a production company that went from 100 grand worth of Grass Valley Switchers&#x2F;Digital Picture Manipulation (DPM-700) down to one Video Toaster 4000 on an Amiga 4000. While I missed some of the cool stuff we could do with the expensive equipment, we were mostly doing local TV commercials and infomercials. So the Toaster ended up working just fine. I barely knew anything about the Amiga at the time other than the thing was rock solid until it crashed one day.<p>We had to load up the entire box of like 60 floppies of Toaster software, the Amiga itself and drive to some hole in the wall in St Augustine Florida to have one of the last remaining Amiga gurus to help us fix the machine. He put a new hard drive in it, but we got like 40 floppies into the Toaster software install and it failed. The dude HAD the software on site but told us it would be wrong for him to use his own floppies to do the install. We asked him if there was ANYTHING he could do. He eyed the twisted pair network card we had and said, &quot;I could be persuaded for that&quot;. We weren&#x27;t using it... as far as we knew, it was just another BNC on the back of the computer case. So, he lowered his &quot;morals&quot; and we got our box fixed. Great times.')
