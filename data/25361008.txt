You are attempting to redefine want as like.<p>Want doesn’t imply like and you can want things that are available even if you’d prefer (or want even more) an option that isn’t. In fact this is always true of things we <i>want</i>.<p>It doesn’t invalidate the meaning of the word want.<p>Examples: “The prisoner wants to be released from solitary confinement back into general population.”, “Voters wanted a candidate who would reduce taxes.”, “Jack wants his father to beat up the bullies at school”.')
