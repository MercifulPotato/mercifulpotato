Item(by='daanlo', descendants=None, kids=[25417473], score=None, time=1607952545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415348, text='I co-founded a home vertical farm company a few years ago (not in operation any more).<p>Plants grown closer to the person eating the food are way tastier. There are two main reasons:\n1) as soon as you harvest, the plant is basically dead and starts losing nutrients and flavors. So avg. time from harvest to eating makes a huge difference for taste.\n2) Since the transport is long, plants are often harvested when they aren&#x27;t ripe yet. Again this leads to less nutrients and hence less flavor.<p>The unromantic truth is that plant growth is physics. They need water, nutrients and light and all of these can be administered in a &quot;factory&quot;. The plant doesn&#x27;t care whether the photons it receives come from the sun or a grow light, as long as the spectrum is the same. With modern grow lights you can mimic the environment you have in other parts of the world. E.g. you can have sun like in Sicily in Denmark.<p>The flavor will actually be better (as in MUCH better) and less transport means growers don&#x27;t need to optimize for varieties that can survive a long transport.')
