I&#x27;ve looked at some feed sources and didn&#x27;t see anything obviously wrong. I suspect TheOldReader also because if I go to view only a specific feed, the entries are sorted correctly newest-first, but displayed publish times go something like &quot;... February 2003; ... January 2003; ... September 2020; 2 hours ago&quot; but on hover the &quot;September 2020&quot; and &quot;2 hours ago&quot; change to their correct 2003 publish dates.')
