My one counterpoint in my head (change from the inside) is ruled out if Coinbase isn&#x27;t receptive to the change at a leadership level, which seems to be the case here. I think you do the most good here by explicitly dropping out and telling them this is the reason why. Maybe if they won&#x27;t listen to their own employees, they will listen to the labor market.')
