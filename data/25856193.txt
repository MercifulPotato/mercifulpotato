Item(by='Alekhine', descendants=3, kids=[25857410, 25856265], score=1, time=1611211303, title="Ask HN: What resources would you give to non-techs who want to 'learn to code'?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I know this is a tedious question, but I have to ask since I can&#x27;t find anything satisfactory.<p>I&#x27;m a 20 year old student. I have a few non-tech friends who have asked me to give them some tips on learning to code. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to give them. I was recently a beginner, so I know better than most HN readers what it&#x27;s like to learn to code in these times and often have thoughts on how it could be better.<p>Learning to code in 2020 is both much easier than in 1980 but also more frustrating in many ways. There are far more resources, but most are abject shit printed by an entire cottage industry devoted to teaching people the basics. In the 80s, a curious kid sat down at a home PC with a BASIC interpreter and a reference manual. I think that is an infinitely better experience than what most people get today.<p>I&#x27;ve tried several beginner resources. HTDP is too slow paced, most beginner Python books just force feed syntax and that&#x27;s it, most websites are total crap and the vast majority of beginner tutorials are either not truly beginner level or are so braindead that nothing is actually taught.<p>My ideal would be a modern BASIC with the most intuitively simple syntax possible, that includes well-written tutorials that would walk you through basic programs and concepts all the way up to at least one or two complex, multi-file projects. Importantly, it would encourage the right mindset to tackle learning about tech, i.e curiosity, organization, not getting bogged down in details unless necessary, etc.<p>But I don&#x27;t have that, so what resources are any good?')
