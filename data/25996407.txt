If your life doesn&#x27;t give you the opportunity to do that I&#x27;d suggest try to get more flexibility, you don&#x27;t need to be super attentive and productive every day. ADHD isn&#x27;t a disease, it just means you are badly adapted for modern office work and bureaucracy, and having vacations where you can go back to your simple carefree self is very valuable.')
