No fancy API, no crazy isomorphic app or something needing fat servers.<p>Just 3D modeling files.<p>Literally they could generate a static page for each asset that uses the preview image instead of the 3d viewer, stick it in their cloud storage solution, and have it exist, untouched, in perpetuity.<p>The cost wouldn&#x27;t even register on a microscopic scale for a place like Google')
