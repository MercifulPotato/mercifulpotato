What you actually <i>do</i> in your life is. For some of it, some amount of money is important, and if you have plenty its easier to achieve. But that&#x27;s about it. I live in place swarming with rich folks, both old rich and new rich, while being neither. Most of them live such boring lives it would be sad if I cared for them. Never once met one of them that I would want to swap my adventurous life with. Had to go through a bit of hardship to get where I am obviously but not that much.<p>What I want to say - striving to get rich from the start is a stupid strategy of a clueless person. Be good at something you do, and more importantly be good at living a great life, being a good kind person. Being rich becomes just a gimmick, whether it happens or not.')
