Work on a thing on company time that helps the company achieve it&#x27;s goals&#x2F;business, but is not the main focus of the company.<p>This seems to be less and less the case. Because companies are more ruthlessly focused on the bottom line, and don&#x27;t think they can afford to have anyone working on something they don&#x27;t own or that might help a competitor? I dunno.<p>But this change has a lot to do with the current apparent sustainability problems in open source.')
