Would you even presume to have any standing to do so?<p>I think a case could be made that knowledge that &lt;A friend B&gt; belongs to A and B equally and that neither has standing to preclude the other from sharing that fact. Of course they could both mutually agree to such an arrangement ahead of time, but outside of such an agreement, I have a hard time seeing the case for &quot;B prevents A from telling C that A and B are friends&quot;.<p>Another aspect of this though, is &quot;how much can A tell C about B without permission from B?&quot; We know that IRL, people <i>do</i> get angry when friends reveal overly personal details about their lives to others, so this is definitely something to consider.')
