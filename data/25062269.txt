They didn&#x27;t make the same mistake for the next ones. And, yes, unlimited original quality still works for me as of today, but I&#x27;m not taking any chances with deleting my local copies.<p>Though, to be honest, Pixel 1 is absolutely horrendous when it comes to replacing the battery. Even if you did manage to open it without breaking the screen, good luck putting it back together. I did a poor job on mine, part of the bottom bezel didn&#x27;t stick and there are weird green glitches on the screen when you press on that part. This thing <i>really</i> wasn&#x27;t designed to ever come apart.<p>So, anyway, I have a Pixel 4a on its way to me, and I&#x27;m paying 50â‚¬&#x2F;month for a server with much more disk space than I know what to do with. Are there any decent self-hosted replacements for Google Photos?')
