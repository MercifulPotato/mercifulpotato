Eg. articles, papers, books and notes. Right now I use Pocket, but it&#x27;s pretty much to read a quick article and throw it away. I&#x27;ve kept lists of papers&#x2F;articles in Trello or Evernote, then I&#x27;ll make notes in Evernote. I use Kindle to read books and then I translate highlights into light notes in Evernote. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain though moving between the apps, and I&#x27;ve lost some faith in Evernote lately.<p>I&#x27;m looking to organize and keep track of past articles and keep lists of things to read by categories. Before I invest more into the tagging&#x2F;list features that Pocket has, I&#x27;m curious to see what other people do.')
