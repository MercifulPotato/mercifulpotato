Item(by='humbledrone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610929913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816585, text='I&#x27;ve lived places that weren&#x27;t dense enough for it to work. But in a fairly urban environment, provided that the item is not total crap, it tends to go fast. I have had cases where I found a taker after I left my front door to take the item out but before I had set it on the sidewalk.  :D')
