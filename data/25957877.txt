The stock should go into free fall, and the people who bought the stock are also going to be victims unless they sell to an alternate victim before the call date.<p>It should all be convoluted by policy, settle dates, brokers selling and later replacing stock in margin accounts, etc. But basically anyone involved in buying GameStop stock itself is playing in the options market with insufficient evidence of understanding, and brokers are supposed to interfere with that.')
