MuseScore has always been the inferior option based on features and quality of output. I&#x27;m glad they are actually focusing on engraving improvements though, as it is really the core point of a program like this, to make the notation accurate and beautiful. Whether this new font lives up to the hype we&#x27;ll see. Dorico&#x27;s new font (Bravura) has certainly seen a lot of usage in the professional space, even if Dorico itself is struggling to capture that market.')
