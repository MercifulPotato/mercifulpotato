Ideally, they could eliminate duplicated data, so that all systems would get data from the &quot;Authoritative Data Source&quot; system instead of duplicating it locally in the application&#x27;s database.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can immediately see why this is wildly stupid and unrealistic.  Imagine what it would look like if every single piece of data that I can technically obtain from another source has to remain in that source, and that storing that data locally with my application specific data is forbidden.....  Suddenly, there is a massive increase in I&#x2F;O, drop in performance, etc.<p>The whole project taught me a lesson about the politics of academia, and how there is a segment of the population that is highly educated, and has learned how to manufacture work for themselves outside of academia by pushing for high-level government officials to implement programs based on their theories.....  MITRE was a big part of this particular project.')
