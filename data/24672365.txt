Its IMDB rating is 7.9&#x2F;10 from over 500k votes over 11 years -- surely this would place the film squarely in the &quot;tried and tested&quot; category.<p>If I look on some smaller sites I see a different story.\nLetterboxd: 7.2&#x2F;10, 234k votes\nRateYourMusic: 6.4&#x2F;10, 3k votes\nThe first site has a higher ratio of capital f Film fans and the second site is a much smaller site focused on music. Using these three data points I can deduct that Star Trek (2009) is probably a decent franchise action movie that most will find enjoyable but won&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny as a stand alone film or for those expecting something more substantial.<p>The article is right that it&#x27;s so much easier to access the history of a medium than in the past. It&#x27;s interesting to me when a previously unknown work from 25+ years ago is rediscovered and entered into &quot;the canon&quot;. In alternative music a recent example is Long Season by Fishmans from 1996.<p>But going through the canonical &quot;best of&quot; lists for a medium is more-or-less a gateway to developing and discovering your own taste in these things (a process that never ends). You shouldn&#x27;t put much trust in any single source.<p>Something that&#x27;s missing now with this intermingling of old and new art is historical context. A film streaming platform is just a directory of video files attached to 250px images and paragraph blurbs. What is Netflix saying about film and its viewers when it has less than 50 films pre-1980? Now that watching 2000+ films before the age of 30 is common for film fans, what will that mean for the future of film?')
