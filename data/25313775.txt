If you remove &quot;objectionable subs&quot; (which is arbitary as I will explain below), the first place they will move is the places that won&#x27;t remove them and then people say &quot;look see this is what happens when you don&#x27;t do moderation, this place is toxic man&quot;. Well of course they are going to be concentrated on the sites that don&#x27;t have stasi like moderation. This has to be some form confirmation bias.<p>Btw what is a &quot;objectionable content&quot; can be completely arbitrary e.g. a subreddit that was a criticism of consumer culture was removed, there was nothing on there that could be considered objectionable. I won&#x27;t even get into the removal of criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party since Chinese companies own a large stake in reddit now.')
