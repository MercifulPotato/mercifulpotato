I&#x27;m not going to link to reddit but there is a thread on the cyberpunk sub listing all the lies Cyberpunk said before release. Nobody forced CDPR to lie about the content of the game, especially all the unique NPC scripting stuff that doesn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s not just the bugs and the performance. CDPR sold something that wasn&#x27;t in the game at release.<p>It must have been an horror for the developers pressured by management to do the impossible, only to be met with contempt by both the management and the gamers in the end because management can always blame developers &quot;for not doing enough&quot; even though every dev must have crunched for 2 years straight.<p>Also these dev sweatshops usually have high turnover, so they are incapable of retaining experienced developers because they don&#x27;t value that, only rookies they can squeeze to the bone then throw away when they are burned out. The state of that game is the result of all that culture.')
