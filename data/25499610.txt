If Apple brings high quality, tight fit and finish, elegant design, software focus, vertical integration (including their new M1 processor tech), logistics support (charging station network, maintenance, etc), and &quot;next-level batteries&quot; to the mix, then I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll find space in the market.<p>If Apple can execute with electric cars as they&#x27;ve executed with consumer electronics, then they&#x27;ll be competing not just with Tesla, but directly with Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, etc.')
