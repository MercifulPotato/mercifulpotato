Basically everyone except the PE gets screwed.<p>I have not been following this closely, but if the 5-10 PE deals I’ve looked at over the years, it was clear from day 1 whether it was structured to have a chance at recovery, (some of which succeed, and some fail) or just to enrich the PE buyer.<p>I wonder why this isn’t clear to the creditors - my guess would be that an early legitimate creditor only uses “other peoples money”, which legitimizes it for others.')
