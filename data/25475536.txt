No one on the face of the earth deserves that level wealth.<p>If you ever seen an actual billion dollar product or even a product hundreds of millions of dollars (in cost, not revenue generation) it is always built by hundreds of people. Your physical two hands, strength and intelligence limits you to a lifetime gdp output of well less than 1 billion. Therefore whenever you see a billionaire, the billionaire achieved his wealth off the backs of others.<p>A more fair distribution of wealth for jetbrains is one where the wealth is more evenly distributed among everyone who works at the company.  There is a term for this... it&#x27;s called communism&#x2F;socialism and it has a set of downsides but I don&#x27;t want to walk to far down that road.<p>Suffice to say capitalism works, but it works because it&#x27;s not fair. No billionaire ever deserves to be a billionaire because he simply does not have the physical or mental ability to produce that much wealth. It always must be taken from the hard work of others.')
