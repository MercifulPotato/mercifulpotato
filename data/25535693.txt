Eventually renewables will outcompete fossil fuels by becoming cheaper, let them do it, but till then, name of the game is to pump and burn as much of the cheap fossil fuels as possible - this is the last chance ever to do so, for our children, vast majority of fossil fuels will be inaccessible because of energy costs - driven down by renewables - will be too low and won&#x27;t pay for extraction.<p>As for climate change, just let it happen. It will happen anyway because if someone reduces their carbon footprint they only leave money on the table for others to grab - and those others will produce MORE carbon for the same amount of goods produced, because their energy efficiency is lower - so any attempts to &quot;fight for climate goals&quot; is destructuve and counterproductive.<p>Just do a fair assessment of future climate changes and proceed with regulatory actions to mitigate them (for example, ban any new capital construction on land which will be flooded in case of 4C temperature rise).')
