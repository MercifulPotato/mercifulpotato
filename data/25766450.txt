It&#x27;s a product which enables a lot of useful features on a variety of devices, including Linux desktops.<p>No competitors of Dropbox enables the same functionality under Linux. This is why I use, and will continue to use it. Yes, iCloud just works and Google Drive works well enough, but  none of them works on Linux. Nextcloud doesn&#x27;t create too many problems but needs your own infra to run.<p>Dropbox allows me to do a lot of things and they&#x27;re currently irreplaceable for me. That&#x27;s not because I can&#x27;t replace them (would take half a day at most) but, their service worth the money they want.')
