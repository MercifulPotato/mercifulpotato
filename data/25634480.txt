I don&#x27;t want to waste screen space or CPU time to fancy widgets, but having a few leds that blink too much when my system does too many things is very handy. It&#x27;s like in the old days of HDD leds: it didn&#x27;t intrude, but I quickly knew what was going on if I looked at it. And blinking things have a tendency to catch your attention, so it removes the &quot;monitoring&quot; problem too (because, when do you know it&#x27;s time to check htop?)<p>Linux LED triggers are very handy to do just than.')
