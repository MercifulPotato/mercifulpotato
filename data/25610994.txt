Learning the concepts behind operating system design isn&#x27;t crucial or needed for something like web development.<p>However, concurrency is something that&#x27;s used and fundamental when programming in C++, and learning it should not side-stepped with libraries. Yes, you are correct to state that it&#x27;s basically all relative and based on opinion and therefore we could go around in circle all day comparing everything. But I think that my point is a fair one when you have two things as closely related as concurrency and C++.')
