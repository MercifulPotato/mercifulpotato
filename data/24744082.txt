There&#x27;s plenty of code out there that&#x27;s unreadable because of the coder, how is this outside of the realm of possibility? Why is all the onus and bias on the reader?<p>For example, readable:<p><pre><code>    measurementOfLeftBottomSideOfBox = 200;\n</code></pre>\nversus unreadable (an acronym of Left Bottom Side):<p><pre><code>    LBB = 200;\n</code></pre>\nJust like English, programming languages rely on the talent writer and on the abilities of the reader At the same Time.<p>The best code is code written by a talented programmer who can make the code readable to All people of All skill levels.<p>One thing people get confused about is readability and elegance. Obviously &quot;measurementOfLeftBottomSideOfBox&quot; is readable but not elegant. While &quot;LBB&quot; is certainly elegant but not readable. My philosophy is readability over elegance, but you will find many programmers are unaware of this dichotomy and have a strict subconscious aversion to writing something ugly like &quot;measurementOfLeftBottomSideOfBox.&quot;<p>This aversion leads to more unreadability than necessary. It&#x27;s some subconscious thing in our minds that makes us code this way but when you think about it.... there&#x27;s no logical point in it at all.  Aim to encode as much context as possible into your code because it&#x27;s completely irrelevant how ugly the variable appears.')
