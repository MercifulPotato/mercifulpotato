Even worse, making someone else rich?<p>You obviously don’t think that, so I don’t get why you and grandparent are projecting that onto OP.<p>I want to minimize my wasted time like mindless Redditing so that I can maximize my time spent doing things that fulfill me. It’s just a great tragedy that it’s so much easier to waste time in unfulfilling ways like spending a day in a heroin nod than it is to do the things that maximize my life.')
