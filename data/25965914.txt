The money you pay goes partly towards buying the property and the partly towards paying &quot;fees&quot; to use the property that you don&#x27;t completely own.<p>Check out what the Companions Ibn Abbas and Ibn Mas&#x27;oud said about such a transaction. It&#x27;s still Riba (usurious) because the price of the house or asset is raised in exchange for postponing payment. It&#x27;s only relatively recently with the heavy influence of Western banks that this &quot;model&quot; has gained some traction, but it remains a usurious transaction and many scholars have spoken against it.')
