Experimental evidence can provide support for the theory, can disprove a theory, but cannot prove the theory.<p>Unrelated to mathematical proofs, but there are counter examples for each of your statements.<p>1.<p>The acceleration due to gravity on earth is not constant, it varies depending on location (easy to experimentally refute that it&#x27;s not 9.8 everywhere). For example, being on mount everest versus at sea level in the Arctic would give different rates of acceleration.<p>Adding a tilde in front of 9.8 m&#x2F;s^2 doesn&#x27;t help make the statement look like a proof.<p>2.<p>Given that acceleration due to gravity is not constant, then the trajectory will no longer be a parabolic curve.')
