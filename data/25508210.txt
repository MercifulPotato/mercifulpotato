Meanwhile, inherited wealth allows a class of people to &quot;work hard&quot; with zero downside risk, all the while claiming they have earned their due.  The fact that someone as wise and reflective as Sam Altman cannot understand this is puzzling.  He says earlier &quot;I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.&quot;  Again, I cannot fathom how one can fail to observe how class privilege bestows automatic success to certain people regardless of the speed at which they move.  Trust funds accumulate, there is never concern over making rent or providing food, and they can easily take low-paying internships or found a startup without any personal risk whatsoever.  People without this kind of leverage do not have the luxury of seeking &quot;alignment&quot; in their jobs.  They do the actual hard work at the firms owned by the warrior class of inherited wealth, and are then admonished for not working hard enough to enrich the owners further.')
