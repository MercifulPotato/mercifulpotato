My requirements are pretty low, but I need to run on some pretty low-spec hardware, with VR multiview. Right now, everything is in WebXR, so perf is about half of native. And if I&#x27;m on a non-Oculus standalone headset, the only browser that is available is Firefox Reality, which has some perf issues of its own. There <i>should</i> be enough perf to run everything I need in this setup, especially of I can get some of my loading and texture transform ops running in Workers (again, with Firefox being the pain point here).<p>But with dynamic content loading over the &#x27;net and teleconferencing and corporate authentication and general Unity update fuckery, it just got to be too much to manage. A lot of my users can&#x27;t have Facebook accounts, so I need to support as many other headsets as possible, and Unity&#x27;s tooling for that is way too constantly-in-an-ever-shifting-landscape-of-broken.<p>With OpenXR starting to really take off, and upcoming .NET 5 promising much more robust multiplatform support, I might be able to go back to .NET with Veldrid. Though I&#x27;d still have the teleconferencing and authentication bits being a lot harder to pull off outside of the browser, and having a native app would mean we would have to deploy through the Oculus store, which I definitely don&#x27;t want to do.')
