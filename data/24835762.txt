Over the last few years, I started running into those more and more often as well. From an UX standpoint I would categorize them somewhere between marque&#x2F;blink tags and rotating GIF icons.<p>Actually, that was roughly the time from which I recall first running into those things on corporate websites (IIRC Yello Strom in Germany had one in the early 2000s, widely know for a particular Easter egg).<p>I find it kind of funny that those are having a revival in recent years, along with animated GIFs (abused as a video format this time round) and annoying overuse of the word &quot;cyber&quot;.')
