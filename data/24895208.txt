I transitioned to Go from Python (which we still use in some projects), but overall I started to prefer Go over python.<p>What I like about Go:<p>- explicit error handling, one is forced to write correct code and think how exactly the errors will be handled. I now prefer Go&#x27;s approach over exceptions.<p>- code is readable, I can look at the code of my coworker and very quickly see what exactly it does.<p>- surprisingly, I found myself not missing OOP features<p>- If project is compilable on localhost, it will be compilable on the server... this is easy to achieve and also deployment is straightforward.<p>- it forces to write &quot;stupidly simple&quot; code. for example, it doesn&#x27;t allow function parameters with default values. The consequence is, that I sometimes need to spend a little extra time on refactoring, but then have more readable code.')
