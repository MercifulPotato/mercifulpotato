Sometimes I am very assertive, pushy with my friends, and make them uncomfortable. I&#x27;d like to think that I&#x27;m doing that when making them uncomfortable is in their interest (e.g. telling someone to stop doing something that&#x27;s harmful for them is definitely not a &#x27;friendly&#x27; thing to do).<p>In a business setting, being friendly can simply be means to squeezing more value out of a person.<p>Therefore I&#x27;d be careful with my words here: if TFA wants to say &#x27;friendly&#x27; then that is what it should do instead of saying that &quot;treat people like they were your friends&quot;.')
