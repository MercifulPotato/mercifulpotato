Most sensible philosphers have long since abandoned categorical absolutism and there are many hundreds of years of arguments around it.<p>Call them tags and the generality of the tag becomes irrelevant. If enough people like some combination or derivation of rogue elements then roguelike is good enough.<p>The issue with non specific tags (roguelike vs permadeath) is that the membership defines it, leading to either infinite dilution or periodic membership - think the evolution of political parties.')
