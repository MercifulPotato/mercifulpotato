That&#x27;s insane. But yet it&#x27;s what Twitter does.<p>I don&#x27;t want Big Tech execs being dictators. And if they can censor then they are indeed dictators.<p>If Twitter can say: &quot;We&#x27;re in charge of speech, because we own the hardware&quot;, then so can AT&amp;T (and that&#x27;s absurd)<p>We have 20-somethings sitting in their Ivory Towers with the power to censor Presidents and Heads of State. It&#x27;s got to stop. They&#x27;re children. Presidents are getting censored by children today.')
