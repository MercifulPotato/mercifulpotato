It is a war between malware creators and OS creators.<p>From my perspective it goes like this:<p>To &quot;identify&quot; malware you need signatures. Signatures need valid certificates. Signing keys get lost (or worse stolen), bad actors need to get identified and their identity revoked.<p>If you don&#x27;t have signatures you will end up with polymorphic malware. (Brew, pip, ruby gems, npm make me uneasy with how much external trust they require!)<p>To stop persistence you need some system immutability and secure startup &#x2F; boot.<p>If you don&#x27;t have secure startup &#x2F; boot you will allow persistence in ways it may be impossible to remove.<p>If you don&#x27;t have an encrypted disk protected by a passphrase, a lost device means your personal data is now potentially now &quot;public&quot;.  If you don&#x27;t also have the other above protections having a passphrase at this point may be meaningless.<p>I use an iPhone because it boots from ROM and a DFU Restore wipes all mutable firmware. The flash, where my data is stored is encrypted. When I can, I will also use an Apple Silicon Mac because it works the same way.<p>Hardware products and operating systems from other vendors and sources do not have these protections. Some attempt to, but the implementations are very flawed or poor - I choose not to use them with my personal information.<p>For me, Apple products really are designed to protect my personal information.')
