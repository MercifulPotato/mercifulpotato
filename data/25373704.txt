That is far beyond the legitimate exercise of Trump&#x27;s rights.<p>I want you to step back and really consider the reporting on this. And do this, by taking into context the kind of reporting of the behind-the-scene Trump Administration actions that came out of the media. And given that, I have no idea how you can possibly take this interpretation at face-value.<p>For the last 4 years, there has been an egregious claim after another, each more bonkers than the next, unverified, stemming from some &#x27;anonymous sources&#x27; against Trump that has time and time again proven to be without merit. Every.single.week.<p>Just recently, a news cycle was devoted to the claim that Trump will barricade himself in the office if Biden wins. Just prior to the election, multiple news cycles were devoted to Trump destroying postal boxes to prevent main-in voting. A little before that, Trump was accused of ignoring Russian bounties on American soldiers (another meritless claim that was disavowed by the the Taliban, Russian, American Intelligence and Army). Again, this occurred every single week for the last 4 years.<p>And you don&#x27;t even have an ounce of skepticism of reporting that Trump in a private conversation asked legislatures to break the law, given how this kind of stuff has been reported, time and time again?<p>The gaslighting of the last 4 years has been insane.')
