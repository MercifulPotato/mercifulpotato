It means that myself, as an average person, have the right to be relatively comfortable in that chair. If an obese person sits next to me, I have nothing against them on a human level - but the fact that they use my space.\nThey are not comfortable either (certainly physically and probably psychologically) so <i></i>if we accept obese people in our society<i></i> (which is the case), they should have special chairs in planes, similar to the situation for disabled people. They should not, objectively, pay more for them even if I think that in the vast majority of cases obesity is a choice (I am somehow overweight and do not think that this is anybody&#x27;s else fault than mine). This is akin (at least in France where I live) to the fact that they will be medically treated with my money (same as the ones that smoke cigarettes will be treated for heart issues or pulmonary cancer).<p>Now, should someone who horribly stinks be allowed on the seat next to mine? No, because <i></i>we do not accept stinkiness, as a society<i></i>. It is completely arbitrarily, but this is how life is.<p>The example in sports is a good one too. I think that we should not test anybody for anything because a sportman today is not a normal being anyway. They are bred to be excellent in what they do. A volleyball player will not be able to participate in a 100 m sprint and have the slightest chance. So any idea of &quot;natural&quot; in sports is long gone (except for purely amateur).<p>In that light I have no idea how to deal with the women&#x2F;men separation we have today. There probably not be any because a top woman volleyball player will be eons better than the amateur man volleyball player I am now. On the other hand they have no chance against a men team.<p>Sports at pro level is such a commercial entity that I even wonder if we should care.')
