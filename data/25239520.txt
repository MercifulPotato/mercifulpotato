The CoWoS and other 3D packaging technologies from TSMC&#x27;s marketing pages aren&#x27;t on the M1 chip. I believe there isn&#x27;t even a silicon interposer due to cost presumably [1]. It is substrate on top of substrate (PoP) to connect the memory and CPU. CPU+GPU are on the same die which is pretty remarkable (Intel&#x27;s IGPUs have been on the same die as well albeit they&#x27;re not as powerful as M1s graphics) but that&#x27;s somewhat unrelated to the packaging.<p>Here is a good diagram (sans the silicon interposer): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;3D-stacked-DRAM-example-High-Bandwidth-Memory-consists-of-stacked-memory-layers-four_fig5_320867388" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;3D-stacked-DRAM-example-...</a><p>Btw, memory has been stacked like that for a decade or more. Used to be stacked + wirebonded. But now, we have through-silicon vias (TSVs). The reason you can stack memory like that are many, one of them being thermals &#x2F; power density.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t6KUnC-oU5g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t6KUnC-oU5g</a>')
