Generally I think the interface is good (other than the latency that others have pointed out). But the outfit recommendations seem quite bad&#x2F;nonsensical (sorry for bluntness):<p>For a denim trucker jacket (a fairly common outerwear in many menswear lines&#x2F;people&#x27;s closets) it recommended:\nOne outfit with Sand colored shoes + Khakis (no contrast between shoes&#x2F;pants...)\nTwo outfits that had no shirts but another jacket (eg a red track jacket...)<p>Its not all bad, one example outfit generated from a plain white crwwneck sweater was clever - olive flight jacket + orange trousers + white mocassins.<p>I wonder how you&#x27;ve built the recommendation engine. Is it using a dataset to generate these (maybe include a real photo of the look?) Or is it generating them based on color&#x2F;style rules? Or (what Id hope) a combination (learn rules from a lookbook dataset that can give general tips then also fall vs spring tips).<p>Either way, thanks for sharing - this is a fun tool to play with but it feels like I&#x27;m searching for needles in a haystack right now.')
