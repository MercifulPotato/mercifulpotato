While that is true, they also removed other sources of funds such as taxes.  So in the end the funding level is about the same while less of it comes from taxes.  This means Florida can tax people less to pay for education but as other have pointed out, the lottery is essentially a tax on stupidity or at least innumeracy. I guess using an innumeracy tax to fund education is kind of poetic but what Florida has done is tax the uneducated to give tax cuts to everyone else.')
