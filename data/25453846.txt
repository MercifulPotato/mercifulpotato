Say &quot;defect&quot; long enough and eventually it represents the same idea as &quot;bug&quot;. I have an instant negative reaction to the idea that &quot;if it has defects, it may not be shipped\n&quot;. Any moderately complex piece of software is guaranteed to have bugs. The action space of ex. a modern OS is way too big to test every possible code path. I&#x27;d rather have an OS with a few bugs than no OS at all. Move fast and break things (unless you&#x27;re writing code for a space shuttle).')
