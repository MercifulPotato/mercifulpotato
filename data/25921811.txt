The commit that added this flaw to sudo claims to fix a parser bug but includes no tests. There is no reason for the author, the reviewer (if there even was such a person), or anyone else to believe that the bug existed or was fixed by this change. The pull request that supposedly fixes this CVE also includes no tests. There is <i>no</i> reason anyone should believe this fix is effective or complete, or that it does not introduce new defects. This is the result of people who stubbornly refuse to practice even the most basic good engineering practices, like testing and code review, while at the same time using the industry&#x27;s most dangerous high-level language. As long as this type of thing continues, our tools will remain at a very low level of safety, reliability, and correctness.')
