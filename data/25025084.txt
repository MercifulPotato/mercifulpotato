Its a bit like messing around with the buzz-word-of-the-day Kubernetes compared to just getting the job done with a good old fashioned VM.<p>Given solutions like Salt are around that can manage reproducible builds anyway (in conjunction with PXE installs), I see limited applications for NixOS.<p>Also, sometimes its nice to have the warm fuzzy feeling of using a software vendor&#x27;s supported package build on a supported OS (e.g I&#x27;d rather run a package from the official Postgres repo then mess around getting Postgres working on NixOS).')
