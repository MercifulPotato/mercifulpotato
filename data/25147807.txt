At the time I did it without thinking about it twice. Now I would not give them my contact data even if they paid me. Google already has it, Facebook and Linkedin already have it - and unfortunately I have no way of getting them to realistically remove that information, but for sure I don&#x27;t want yet another corporation to get all that info.')
