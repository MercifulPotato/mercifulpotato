QuickSync is CRAZY good, I stumbled onto a post about it a month or so ago and thought &quot;Ehh, I&#x27;m probably already using it, w&#x2F;e&quot; then saw I needed to run some commands and mount a device in my plex docker container to actually enable it and I was blown away by how little load there was on the CPU. I know there has been some grumbling about QS not producing the best output but that seems to be mainly related to the earlier iterations of it, I have not noticed any issues. It kills me how long I waited to try this, it literally took &lt;10min to setup and has been a huge performance boost.<p>To everyone else: If you have an Intel CPU that supports QS and you are running Plex in a docker container then I HIGHLY recommend you look into enabling HW acceleration (both in plex settings and by mounting a device, &#x2F;dev&#x2F;dri, into your container). Here [0] are the directions I followed. Make sure you read the instructions, the first time I tried to follow this I misread the instructions and thought my CPU didn&#x27;t support it or there was some other issue but it couldn&#x27;t have been easier when I actually stopped and read instead of skimming.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.unraid.net&#x2F;topic&#x2F;77943-guide-plex-hardware-acceleration-using-intel-quick-sync&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.unraid.net&#x2F;topic&#x2F;77943-guide-plex-hardware-ac...</a>')
