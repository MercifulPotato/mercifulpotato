Of course I would rather listen to an open, commentable discussion forum than the top search result which is there because of manifactured relevancy and heavy ad spend.<p>Scarily whats been happening recently is that the black box turk vogon SEO machine is starting to pump out sites with random urls but that are riddled with the phrase &quot;reddit&quot; in the meta tags &#x2F; seo texts.<p>The machine is learning!')
