However, the effect is probably very small compared to environmental factors (e.g. disrupted innate immunity due to insulin resistance or obesity).<p>The highest genetic contribution to any common disease seems HLA-B27 ~ ankylosing spondylitis, closely followed by HLA II ~ type 1 diabetes. But in these cases, still, it just explains around 15% of the variance. After these big contributors, there&#x27;s a long list of genes that contribute with exponentially diminishing effect sizes. And the overall contribution of genetics never exceeds 50%. It&#x27;s good to understand some disease factors, but interventions are much simpler from the environmental side of things.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that COVID is not linked to HLA in any meaningful way. Probably the study from Pääbo is not accounting for HLA because of lack of imputed haplotypes. It&#x27;s a bit of a statistics smell that there&#x27;s no association whatsoever. Nothing shows up in his chr6 region in the Manhattan plot. All infectious agents have some correlation. That&#x27;s the whole point of HLA, implementing different strategies against them.<p>For example, HLA-B57 and B27 tend to be super-responders against HIV. This haplotype seems to be trading more autoimmunity risk in exchange for better protection against rapidly mutating viruses. It expanded quite quickly around Northern Europe around 10000 years ago, probably due to another pandemic.')
