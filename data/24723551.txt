It&#x27;s that when you look at playbooks for both teams you see that the names of all the plays are identical, and under the same headings! And you come to the conclusion that the second team must have copied the names from the first teams playbook.<p>Such a thing might be considered fair use if the second team&#x27;s argument was they indeed copied the playbook because they had a recruited some players from the first team and keeping the names the same made it easier for them during practice. But for now the judge is suspicious that they&#x27;ve come up with this explanation after the fact.')
