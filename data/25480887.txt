It&#x27;s operated by the Lookout Pass Ski Area and one end of the trail is the ski lodge. Going on that trail is truly memorable:<p>&gt; The Route of the Hiawatha mountain bike or hike trail is 15 miles long with 10 train tunnels and 7 sky-high trestles. The ride starts with a trip through the 1.661 mile long St. Paul Pass Tunnel, also known as the Taft Tunnel. It is a highlight of the trail that follows the crest of the Bitterroot Mountains near Lookout Pass Ski Area.  The best part is.... it&#x27;s mostly downhill with shuttle buses available to transport you and your bike back to the top.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traillink.com&#x2F;trail&#x2F;route-of-the-hiawatha&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traillink.com&#x2F;trail&#x2F;route-of-the-hiawatha&#x2F;</a>')
