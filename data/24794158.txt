It&#x27;s good for engagement.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever watched someone be completely wrong about something you know a lot about, you know how strong the urge to correct them is.<p>On social media, promoting clearly wrong beliefs and ideas (Flat Earth, for instance) is good for business because people will similarly jump in to correct the wrong belief. And if you tie that belief to a political ideology, the believers will defend their ideology, further increasing engagement.')
