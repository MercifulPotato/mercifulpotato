With a flexible and collaborative culture, people will communicate these things naturally as part of doing their work. Issues that come up will get addressed as needed <i>when they come up</i>. If something is important, why would you wait for tomorrow&#x27;s standup? If something <i>isn&#x27;t</i> important, why are you dedicating an inflexible <i>daily</i> meeting to talking about it?<p>If your team is having the sort of communication problems standups are supposed to solve, it&#x27;s a symptom of a deeper issue and standups are a bandaid solution. If your team already works collaboratively, standups are pure overhead at best and actively counterproductive at worst. It&#x27;s easy to get into the bad habit of waiting for a standup to bring up important issues, which loses time and context. Worse yet, chances are the standup has too many people and not enough time to discuss anything in detailâ€”I&#x27;ve seen <i>so many</i> standups where any actually useful conversation would be caught, stopped and moved to a different venue. You end up with a <i>pro forma</i> meeting where most of the information isn&#x27;t useful to most of the attendees, but still breaks up people&#x27;s schedules and focus.<p>In my experience, an emphasis on standups goes hand-in-hand with a view of engineering work as a ticket factory: individuals get a ticket off the queue, work just on that, get it done as soon as possible and pick up another ticket. I think that correlation is not a coincidence.')
