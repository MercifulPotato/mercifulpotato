Even failover (sometimes seamless) on a VMWare cluster can help with planned maintenance scenarios without downtime, etc.<p>Another way of achieving HA together with satisfying disaster recovery requirements is replication (either app level or database log replication, etc). So, no distributed system is necessary unless, you have <i>legit</i> scaling requirements.<p>If you work on ERP-like databases for traditional Fortune 500-like companies, few people run such &quot;sacred monolith&quot; applications on modern distributed NoSQL databases, it&#x27;s all Oracle, MSSQL or some Postgres nowadays. Data warehouses used to be all Oracle, Teradata too - although these DBs support some cluster scale-out, they&#x27;re still &quot;sacred monoliths&quot; from a different era (they are still doing - what they were designed for - very well). Now of course Snowflake, BigQuery, etc are taking over the DW&#x2F;analytics world for new greenfield projects, existing systems usually stay as they are due to lock-in &amp; extremely high cost of rewriting decades of existing reports and apps.')
