After issuing the RCPT (recipient) command, you&#x27;ll get back a status code from the server telling you if the recipient is valid (250) or invalid (e.g., 550). At that point, you send QUIT without sending any DATA (so no message will be sent if the e-mail address is valid).<p>There are examples of successful and unsuccessful RCPT attempts here (scroll down to the second sample SMTP session):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_SMTP_server_return_codes#Example" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_SMTP_server_return_cod...</a><p>This is an entirely valid use of the SMTP protocol (getting back that status code is how you find out if a message to an address was undeliverable), but I suppose that if an e-mail provider wanted to prevent this kind of validation, they could stop accepting connections from subdomains of Experian that repeatedly aborted their SMTP sessions.')
