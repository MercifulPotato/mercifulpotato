If you mean pirate music, then yeah, I guess I&#x27;ve largely stopped doing that (blogspot shares ain&#x27;t what they used to be).<p>If you simply mean BUY music and store it digitally, I&#x27;ve got a 1.5TB external HDD filled with MP3s and FLACs that argues otherwise. Amazon&#x27;s AutoRip is a nice timesaver, but I still largely prefer to do my own ripping via Exact Audio Copy.')
