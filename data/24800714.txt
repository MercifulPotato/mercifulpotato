This is a decade&#x27;s worth of knowledge in a single article.  I&#x27;ll be forwarding this one to coworkers and acquaintances when they ask about how to do this kind of stuff.<p>I can understand why the author focuses on cheap entry-level parts. It&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s fun. He also kind of dismisses the major SOMs for this reason so maybe there can be a more comprehensive review of those (I build almost exclusively with these), but that&#x27;s probably out of his view.<p>Going with a mystery AllWinner part is really compelling, but I can&#x27;t go into production (with a 5+ year expected run lifetime) on that.')
