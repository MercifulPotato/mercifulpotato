It&#x27;s voted by the people, replaced by the people. The government may be corrupted but at least its stated goal and the way it works is to serve the people.<p>Corporation don&#x27;t even have that as a goal. They only serve their shareholders.<p>So on one hand we have one party which has a stated goal to serve the people and another one which has goals that can directly contravene this, and nobody will bat an eye.<p>Which party is closer to what we want and need?')
