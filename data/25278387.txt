The issue is that too many of these things are turning out to be given to private companies that are mates with a Tory where no basis exists for believing they can deliver, when other, qualified companies exist.  Or, as in Serco&#x27;s case, with no penalty clauses in place if they don&#x27;t.<p>Again, for clarity: using the private sector isn&#x27;t a problem. Corruption is. Failing to get results is.<p>I&#x27;m all up for chucking money at a big problem and sorting out the mess later, but this is a depressingly predictable mess, and chucking money at the problem bought us a demonstrably worse outcome than we should have had.')
