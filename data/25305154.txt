It&#x27;s at least affecting the Bay Area.<p>AT&amp;T Fiber seems to be sometimes flipping a bit in the TLS handshake, causing TLS connections to break. This can show up as connections to TLS sites not working on the first try, your browser stuck on &quot;Performing a TLS handshake&quot;, SSL_ERROR_BAD_MAC_READ in Firefox, etc.<p>If you tunnel your browsing through a VPN, that will work around this issue. It doesn&#x27;t seem like anything else obvious is affected - gaming, video calls, etc. seem to work fine.')
