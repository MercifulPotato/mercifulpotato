The main board is a server main board with 10 GE Ethernet and a console for flashing bios and remoting into the machine - no graphics card needed. This was expensive and you can most likely save a lot using a consumer grade main board.<p>The RAM was taken from the list provided at \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asrockrack.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;productdetail.asp?Model=X470D4U2-2T#Memory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asrockrack.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;productdetail.asp?Model=X...</a><p>The CPU models supported are here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asrockrack.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;productdetail.asp?Model=X470D4U2-2T#CPU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asrockrack.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;productdetail.asp?Model=X...</a><p>Be careful not to buy an AMD APU - this doesn&#x27;t support ECC RAM for some insane reason. An APU would have build in graphics and the CPU.<p>I use both SATA drives (long term storage) and SDD drives (for speed).<p>I created two ZFS volumes (I don&#x27;t remember the proper terms). One for rotating discs (which could sleep most of the time) and one using SDDs for fast storage which doesn&#x27;t use much power.<p>I have 6 KW solar cells with battery so I don&#x27;t really care if the box uses a lot of power. During daylight its more or less free when sun is shining. I get next to nothing when selling the electricity that I generate and would like to use as much as possible locally.')
