The first email from the editorial staff seemed reasonable, if perhaps a little heavy-handed. It certainly did not seem to warrant Glenn&#x27;s immediate escalation - his reply reads like an ultimatum:<p>&gt; But if the Intercept&#x27;s position is that it won&#x27;t publish any article by me that suggests that there are valid questions about whether Joe Biden engaged in wrongdoing, then I think we should agree that the Intercept&#x27;s position is that it is unwilling to publish the article I want to publish about the Democratic front-runner. Under my contract, if TI decides it does not want to publish something I want to publish, then I have the right to publish it elsewhere, which is a right I would exercise with this article.<p>Another excerpt that stood out, this one from Glenn&#x27;s follow-up email (the 3rd in the chain):<p>&gt; ...this is the first time in fifteen years of my writing about politics that I&#x27;ve been censored... and it&#x27;s happening less than a week before a presidential election.<p>So, he first equates the editorial request to censorship, then emphasizes the closeness of the election in order to justify why that editorial concern should be bypassed.<p>His entire attitude seems to be that since he doesn&#x27;t write anything factually incorrect, any attempt to influence or challenge the things his writing tries to imply is equivalent to censorship. A misguided attitude, if not downright disingenuous, IMO. But you can read and decide for yourself.')
