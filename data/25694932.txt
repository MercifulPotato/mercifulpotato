While they won&#x27;t succeed in effecting the coup on the 20th either, there is a <i>very</i> real chance that violence will happen and people will die as a result.<p>Those people were already planning for violence before any of the deplatforming started. The only way you&#x27;re going to deescalate the situation is either to give in to the terrorists and give them a Trump coup, or you&#x27;re going to have to convince them that violence is not going to be tolerated and the underlying grievance is not worth it. The latter probably requires Trump (and only Trump can be the standard bearer at this point, and I&#x27;m not even sure <i>he</i> could pull this off) admitting that the election was not fraudulent and that he has been lying to his supporters, in addition to calling for legal punishments to those that committed violence in his name. If you haven&#x27;t noticed, those were pretty much the exact opposite of what he chose to do in the brief time he had access to Twitter today.')
