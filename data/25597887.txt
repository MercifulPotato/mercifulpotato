I was surprised to find out how different it is from the TV series, and that it&#x27;s still being written. This was after completing Robert Jordan&#x27;s Wheel of Time, which was a favorite in high school but never finished.<p>This was really just nostalgia. But I figured why not, it&#x27;s 2020.<p>They&#x27;re not so good though, I think the series will be better with both books.')
