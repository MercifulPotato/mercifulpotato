Cutting technology slack because it was the first iteration doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>I think Nano is more secure than Bitcoin considering that the majority hashrate of BTC is controlled by mining pools in China. If the Chinese government decides to coerce the owners of those mining pools to perform a block reorg tomorrow, it will happen.<p>Nano does not have the sort of incentives that create centralization. In fact, Nano voting power is getting more decentralized over time, which is the opposite of what has happened with Bitcoin.<p>When you consider that Nano txs take under 1 second, are feeless, are scalable, and require no POW mining, it&#x27;s obviously superior to Bitcoin. All that Bitcoin supporters have left is vague &quot;security concerns&quot; about Nano. But if Nano is not secure, wouldn&#x27;t it have been compromised by now considering there is an economic incentive to do so and considering that the mainnet has been running since 2014 or 2015?')
