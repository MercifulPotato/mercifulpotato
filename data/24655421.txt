Item(by='Kosirich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601581607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24653116, text='Croatia - it&#x27;s common to ask a person applying for a position a proof issued my Ministry of Justice that they don&#x27;t have an active criminal case against them but some will ask for an equivalen of background check from the Ministry of Internal Affairs (&quot;police&quot;)<p>Denmark - I have a friend who was asked to provide something like a proof of not being prosecuted for a an engineering position, while another colleague who applied and for the same position wasn&#x27;t asked for one. The difference between the two was the country they were from with, I&#x27;m guessing, appearance of the former one playing a role. The guy looks like a bouncer with his 1.90 height, 100 kg of muscle and a crooked nose from being an ex amateur boxer (under the appearance he is a teddy bear).')
