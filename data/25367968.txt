I am CEO&#x2F;Founder of Cloud Linux Inc.<p>&gt; CloudLinux OS has never depended on CentOS®. Our software was and continues to be a fork of RedHat® EL. We base our packages on sources provided by RedHat®.<p>&gt; As such, we don&#x27;t expect any changes for CloudLinux OS due to the RedHat® announcement.<p>&gt; As we already maintain CloudLinux OS, we plan to release a free, open sourced, community driven, 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL® 8 (and future releases) in the Q1 of 2021. We will create a separate, totally free OS that is fully binary compatible with RHEL® 8 (and future versions). We will sponsor the development &amp; maintenance of such OS. We will work on establishing a community around the OS, with the governing board from members of the community.<p>&gt; Why we are doing it:<p>&gt; We have all the infrastructure, software and experience to do that already. We have a large staff of developers and maintainers that have a decade of experience in building a RHEL fork, starting from RHEL5 to RHEL8\nWe expect that this project will put us on the map, and allow people to discover our rebootless update software (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kernelcare.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kernelcare.com</a>) and LTS offering <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudlinux.com&#x2F;extended-lifecycle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudlinux.com&#x2F;extended-lifecycle</a><p>&gt; What will we do to make sure that we don&#x27;t go wrong:<p>&gt; We plan to make all the build and test software free, open sourced, easy to set up, so if we ever go in the wrong direction - the community can just pick up where we left off.<p>&gt; What it means for you:<p>&gt; If you are running CloudLinux OS 8 -- it will continue to have stable and well tested updates until 2029, and ELS releases for years after that.<p>&gt; If you are running CentOS 8 - we will release an OS very similar to CentOS 8 based on RHEL 8 stable. We will provide stable and well tested updates until 2029 - totally free. You will be able to convert from CentOS 8 at any moment by running a single command that switches repositories &amp; keys.<p>&gt; Timeline: Q1 2021')
