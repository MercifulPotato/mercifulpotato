Can&#x27;t be proven for anything more than coincidence of course.<p>Wikipedia has a decently comprehensive summary of the funding cutbacks Arecibo faced: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arecibo_Observatory#Funding_reductions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arecibo_Observatory#Funding_re...</a>\nThey oddly enough don&#x27;t mention some of the questionable things NSF AST did, like argue over Arecibo finding it&#x27;s own funding: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;search-for-alien-life-ignites-battle-over-giant-telescope&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;search-for-alien-...</a><p>&gt; This probably means, the scientific output was less promising than those projects.<p>Not true. Arecibo was by far the most powerful planetary radar system on the planet, by something like a 20x factor of sensitivity. Arecibo&#x27;s size and frequency used (2.38GHz) meant that it&#x27;s beam was a great compromise between beam width and strength. The narrower beams available on the remaining telescopes makes it more difficult to find elusive and not well known near-earth objects.<p>Arecibo was contributing vast and meaningful science until it met it&#x27;s untimely end.<p>&gt; I wonder whether there should be plans made for a completely new rebuild?<p>Yes. Resoundingly yes. Even a comparable telescope (meaning we don&#x27;t chase bigger and better like FAST) would be a massive enhancement. And with intentional planning, it would likely be possible to extend and enhance the capabilities while still reducing problems in the original design.<p>Unfortunately, I can only imagine the hurdles in design&#x2F;funding&#x2F;construction that a second telescope would face.')
