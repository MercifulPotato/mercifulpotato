They&#x27;re just wired for it.  Sitting at a desk for hours on end is incompatible with their physiology.  Sitting like that isn&#x27;t good for girls, either, but they seem to cope better.  Schooling, as it is widely administered today, is not humane.  It&#x27;s not that it benefits one sex.  It&#x27;s that it hurts one more than it hurts the other.<p>If you have a boy who&#x27;s on the verge of failing because he can&#x27;t pay attention, make a serious effort to get him <i>several hours</i> of moderate or intense physical activity every day.<p>You&#x27;ll see a world of difference.')
