So for example for doubling in base-100 we think about 1&#x2F;98 (b=100, k=2) and we find<p><pre><code>   1&#x2F;98 = 0.01020408163265...\n</code></pre>\nand factors of that 98 also may have similar patterns, so 7 has this strength because it is a factor of 98.<p>So for example we want to think about 1&#x2F;7 in base-12, this suggests that maybe we should look for things that quintuple base 12, but that rapidly overflows base 12. So we do the same trick as 1&#x2F;7 where we take pairs of digits, and maybe things quadruple base-144 (since 144 - 4 is 140 which is divisible by 7), and so we find that<p><pre><code>    1&#x2F;7 = 0.{20}{82}{41} repeating\n</code></pre>\nand if you squint closely you can see starting with 20, quadrupling to 80, quadrupling to 320 but then getting a bit unwieldy. Of course even on single digits 12 - 2 = 10 which has 5 as a factor so you can expect to see a pattern in base-12 on<p><pre><code>    1&#x2F;5 = 0.{2}{4}{9}{7} [repeating]\n</code></pre>\nwhich you can see a sort of &quot;2, 4, 8, 16,&quot; pattern happening.<p>The other base that I really like is nonnary, if we met aliens we might find that they count in balanced nonnary with digits -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, (so like 7 is actually {1, -2}, 7 = 9 - 2), but it&#x27;s harder to search for patterns in that because you really feel the cap of having only half the base to count up to before you carry.')
