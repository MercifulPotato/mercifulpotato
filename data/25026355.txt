Is it either you write pristine, bug-free code on the first try for everything, or else you should be relegated to the back room gluing things together built by the _real_ devs? This is such snooty behavior that I&#x27;m not surprised at all by a response like the angry dude in there. He&#x27;s an asshole for sure, but he&#x27;s not totally wrong in my view.')
