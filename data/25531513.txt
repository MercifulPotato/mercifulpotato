And best of all, the useless extra data is often rendered extra useless with a font size that is too tiny to read without a magnifying glass.<p>There are movies with nice, (semi) plausible fantasy UIs too! For example, The Midnight Sky (damage assessment, map views etc.), Chappie (firmware upgrade, policebot PoV, etc.), Interstellar (flight controls, robot &quot;debug&quot; displays etc.).<p>Star Trek LCARS screens have been generally well thought of, but not always. There are weird numbers and &quot;display nonsense&quot; here and there. But, I can believe a starship could be steered with such a touch UI with clearly distinguishable big buttons and clear separation of functions.')
