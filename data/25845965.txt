After I finished with their product I paused the card and sent customer support an email asking to cancel (since the online cancel form wasn’t working for some reason.) I watched as Adobe attempted to charge my card several times over the next few days. Luckily Privacy declined all those charges since the card was paused.<p>The only other company I’ve had such an experience with has been Stamps.com.')
