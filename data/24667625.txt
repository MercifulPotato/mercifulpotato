You can approach compliance frameworks in two ways, you can put a lot of effort into designing your infrastructure and compliance testing methodology (I would suggest Amazon as a canonical example of how to do this well), so that it performs well and meets all the requirements, or you can take out the sledgehammer, implement a new control for every occasion, and create a cumbersome bureaucracy.<p>The good design approach is obviously superior in many ways. But the downside of it is that you have to trust the competency of a lot of different business units to maintain it. A cumbersome bureaucracy on the other hand ensures that incompetent&#x2F;lazy&#x2F;low-initiative internal actors can’t impact your compliance. If you fail, at least you fail in a compliant and auditor-approved way.<p>That said, a lot of the failures I’ve seen in organisation like this stem from silo’d expertise. People don’t know that much about the systems that are outside their remit, so they will make changes that impact connected systems in ways they failed to imagine. As an example I have seen 3 seperate banks have non-trivial service disruptions stem from the same independently made mistake. A person enabling debug logging on the SIP phones. The traffic DOSes their networks, and all of a sudden, core network infrastructure starts to die. Afterwards they send the right reports off to the right people, make the correct adjustments to the bureaucracy, and proceed with their compliance intact.<p>There is also a 3rd way to approach compliance, via negligence. But the more you are in the regulatory spotlight, the less of an option that is.')
