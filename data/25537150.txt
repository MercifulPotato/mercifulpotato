Item(by='avian', descendants=None, kids=[25537307], score=None, time=1608912016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536993, text='&gt; Thermonuclear Orion could reach as much as 10% the speed of light<p>I wonder how much such a mission would cost in terms of total Earth resources. I&#x27;ve read Dyson&#x27;s book on the project some years back and I don&#x27;t remember that being mentioned.<p>Wikipedia states the cost in percentage of U.S. GDP (0.1 - 1% of yearly GDP), but I feel like the millions of tons of copper and fissile material required would be significant hit on remaining mineral reserves. It&#x27;s kind of hard to justify sending out a few missions if it means that the planet left behind is out of easily mined copper and uranium deposits.')
