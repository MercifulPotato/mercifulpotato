That&#x27;s not US&#x2F;China&#x2F;Saudi-level police state bad--as in, the UK police aren&#x27;t able to arbitrarily confiscate cash or shoot people with impunity for having the wrong skin color--but it&#x27;s bad enough that I consider such behavior a feature of a police state.<p>Any jurisdiction where it&#x27;s not possible to perform the normal functions of everyday life, including creating works of art through photography, without fear of hostile police interaction is to some degree or other a police state.')
