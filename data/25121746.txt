The experience of reassurance that offers determinism¹ is too powerful for an argument to overrule.<p>¹ Don’t blame me, the universe determined that things should be in a way which make me unresponsible of all that is wrong in this world. Also that’s the universe determined nature that anything positive should be credited to me.<p>My current opinion&#x2F;impression&#x2F;illusion (you name it), is that free will is an undecidable topic. As you can not &quot;go out&quot; of your actual experiment, you can only pick between models of the outside world. But for this very reason, you can’t &quot;objectively&quot; decide what causes or not your decision of believing in free will or determinism. Deterministic people will say that free-will believers are determined in such a way which forces them to do so, and free-will believers will say that the deterministic mindset people freely chose to believe in a deterministic model.<p>The concerned issue is not what the external world provides as data, but how we interpret it. That is, how we decide to opt for this or that interpretation. How we decide to opt for a model which includes free-decisions or only completely-bounded-decisions is not evaluable before a model is selected.')
