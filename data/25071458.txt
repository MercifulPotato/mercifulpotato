You also don&#x27;t have to use all of ASP.NET either, it just comes with a full featureset and the default templates are configured for easy productivity<p>This is only true in theory, but couldn&#x27;t be further away in reality.<p>Microsoft suffocates everything which is not built in-house 1), so there is absolutely no OSS ecosystem going on in .NET which would allow a choice of different non-ASP.NET web frameworks.<p>Other languages have a wealth of different web frameworks and some are super basic and lightweight and others are huge with batteries included.<p>You don&#x27;t get that in .NET at all. Everything is ASP.NET Core, and ASP.NET Core is a typical Microsoft product - an attempt to build a one size fits all solution, the magic silver bullet to solve everyone&#x27;s problems at once.

In F# you will find a more vibrant OSS community and non ASP.NET alternatives (most famously Suave), but only because Microsoft doesn&#x27;t care about F#.
