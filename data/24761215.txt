Item(by='acdha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602550305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757422, text='&gt; Another bit of fluff that may have confused you is that they refer to this as a &quot;Zero Trust&quot; architecture, which sounds a little bit like BeyondCorp. IMO, this is basically a lie. BeyondCorp lets users connect to corporate resources behind a proxy, without a VPN.<p>I thought this was referring to the combination of Access (identity constraints on connections) and the tunnel system and your app servers only connect outbound to the CDN nodes, forcing all connections to be made through Access. That seems like zero-trust to me, doesnâ€™t it?')
