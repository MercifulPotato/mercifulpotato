Troubled people are prone to crime. Crime spreads and creates unsustainable living conditions for everyone. And that&#x27;s not mentioning the destructive effect on culture and social interaction in general.<p>This description seems to me to be clearly one of correlation, not of causation.\nThe (from my point of view) simplistic argument is, that the drug use causes either crime or troubled people.<p>The question here is, has the criminalisation of drug use or abuse has had any tangible positive effect on either drug use&#x2F;abuse or crime?<p>To my knowledge treating addiction rather as a medical issue than a criminal one seemed to have shown quite positive results in Portugal, and seems to me a more reasonable approach.')
