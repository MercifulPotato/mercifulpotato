Unless they are marketing these services for a very limited (ultra-rich) clientele, in which, it doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Why buy an airplane that you can only use over sea, and in good conditions? You can use a boat at a fraction of the cost for large numbers of people (purchase, maintenance), or a helicopter for a smaller number of people.<p>And on planet earth we do get bad weather (even at sea level). It&#x27;s not as bad as in Interstellar (&quot;these are not mountains&quot;), but it can certainly render this useless.<p>Unless they target VERY SPECIFIC region (specific parts of Arab peninsula), then we are limiting the use so much that it can only survive as a niche company and not expand much.')
