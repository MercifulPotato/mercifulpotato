I only read the article quickly so it might be mentioned, but it&#x27;s odd that the title says &quot;Jazz&quot; and mostly deals with the progressions known as &quot;12 bar blues&quot;. A straight 12-bar blues progression would be recognized as &quot;blues&quot; by any listener, so presumably there is something that makes such a progression sound more like jazz than blues. But what is it? Is it through the number of tweaks added, such as more &quot;jazzy&quot; chords like 9&#x2F;11&#x2F;13 chords? Is there something else that distinguishes jazz from blues in a 12 bar progression?<p>Edit: I found an explanation here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;71149&#x2F;how-can-you-recognize-whether-a-song-is-blues-or-jazz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;71149&#x2F;how-can-you-...</a>')
