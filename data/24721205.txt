I <i>like</i> MSL as a language but it pays a heavy price for &quot;being different&quot;, it&#x27;s woefully underspec&#x27;d, even compared to HLSL, and the tooling is pretty miserable. You couldn&#x27;t even run the Metal compiler on Windows until very recently.<p>But I love a lot of the actual Metal APIs.')
