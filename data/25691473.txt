Just provide an interface for external servers.<p>&gt;And if anyone could cross-post content on any platform, wouldn&#x27;t the platforms argue that it violates their right to control content on their platforms?<p>That&#x27;s what federation is for.  As long as I can authenticate to my account, what difference does it make whether a post is interactively entered or sent via an API?<p>Those platforms still have their own TOS, so they can decide how or if they want to moderate any individual post.<p>Something along the lines of Diaspora[0] or ActivityPub[1] federation.<p>&gt;And what happens if you get a concerted effort across platforms to block individuals based on political&#x2F;moral stances? Within 2 days (I think) Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Redit and others have suspended and&#x2F;or blocked content from Trump and various Trump supporters. The ex-first lady is asking &quot;big-tech&quot; to take additional actions, whatever that means.<p>That&#x27;s the beauty of a decentralized environment. I can host my own federated server or connect to any other federated server.  Presumably, <i>someone</i> will be willing to host your content.<p>And if not[2], you can do it yourself.<p>The best part is you can control where your data is shared and who gets to see it.  If you don&#x27;t want the big boys to host your stuff, you can use federation to share with others on those platforms.<p>All of which can democratize the environment and allow <i>you</i> to be in control of your data, not the rapacious scumbags that run FB or Twitter.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diaspora.github.io&#x2F;diaspora_federation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diaspora.github.io&#x2F;diaspora_federation&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ActivityPub#Federated_(server-to-server)_protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ActivityPub#Federated_(server-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1357&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1357&#x2F;</a>')
