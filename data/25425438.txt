I was with him, at his house, for his final week, with a hospice nurse checking in periodically. He refused morphine and instead took a fair amount of acetaminophen; for calories, he drank a lot of beer and V-8 juice mixed together. I warned him about the danger of mixing alcohol and acetaminophen; he immediately perked up, thinking that would be a way for him to end things. He was disappointed when I explained that it wouldn&#x27;t be a quick death: he&#x27;d just wreck his liver and be in even more agony. (He died a few hours later.)')
