Nobody gives away their edge for free, although they may give away their trades.<p>This isn&#x27;t trading, though. It&#x27;s forecasting. You could make that argument about the sub-category of economic forecasts, perhaps. But not about more general things, like presidential elections.<p>&gt; Imagine a strategy that has a 50% chance of blowing you up completely over 10 years, but nets you 50% more profit if it works. The average return of this strategy is 25% less than a safe strategy (zero risk, zero gain), but it has a 50% chance of winning in this marketplace. If it were real money, nobody would go near it.<p>People go near real money strategies like that all the time. That&#x27;s all WallStreetBets is, or the financial crisis, for that matter. I do take your point that this behavior may be <i>more</i> pronounced in a community like this, but I don&#x27;t think it invalidates the model.')
