I suppose because I&#x27;ve been trying to learn SPARK more than Ada proper, this hasn&#x27;t bitten me. Since SPARK&#x27;s version of functions are closer to pure functions. But reading the rationale, I sort of get why they did it. Functions were already impure, but couldn&#x27;t be marked as explicitly changing their inputs (access types could be altered and you&#x27;d never know by the function signature), so changing it to allow explicit `in out` parameters made some sense (as the Ada language has a preference for more explicit rather than implicit behavior). Though that kind of defeats my case since I used Ada as an example, and its functions may as well be procedures.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adaic.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;add_content&#x2F;standards&#x2F;05rat&#x2F;html&#x2F;Rat-9-3-9.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adaic.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;add_content&#x2F;standards&#x2F;05rat&#x2F;...</a>')
