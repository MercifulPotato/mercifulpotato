They are focusing on being a Firebase alternative, we are focusing on making it easy to build encrypted applications. Not the same target audience and not the same offering.<p>With that being said, Supabase is very cool, and I&#x27;m a big fan! If you don&#x27;t care about end-to-end encryption, you should definitely use Supabase!')
