I&#x27;ve been very careful about how I choose my jobs. But a lot of developers end up in situations where the truly deep work can only be done in coordination with a bunch of others. Assuming typically bad management, this means that the only thing left is hard work.<p>The first time I saw this pattern was with a place that used their master database as the central integration point for a lot of different code bases. They could have simplified things greatly, but that would have required multiple teams to simultaneously change how they used particular tables in their code. The database was controlled by a central group of database administrators who were very busy and had different incentives than the teams they supported. Getting all these people on board for a change was possible only if it rose to an executive level. Which if it could be achieved at all, required lots of politicking.<p>So in practice, every team had to make up for the garbage architecture through hard work. Which however much they meant well, tended to reinforce the problems.')
