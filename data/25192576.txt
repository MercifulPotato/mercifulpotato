That is not a normal result for any mid-to-high level SATA SSD. Plenty of SATA M.2 SSDs can easily hit the same speeds the NVME drive is hitting (specifically when on USB3). NVME might give you some additional random r&#x2F;w performance, however.<p>It seems like overkill to use NVME on USB 3.0 when SATA can saturate that bus just as easily. SATA M.2 drives will also run cooler. Some NVME USB controllers are notoriously hot-running')
