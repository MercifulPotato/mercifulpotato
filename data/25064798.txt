Reading the report, men think their sons are less tough than their daughters.<p>Putting these two together suggests that the way we define toughness for men in anti-social ways may be the problem. Perhaps we need to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy ways of building toughness, and seek healthy ways for men&#x2F;boys to build toughness. As one example, I (a man) have never been in a fight, but I have found that challenging myself physically, and going camping have built toughness for me. Neither of those things required me to hurt myself or other people. There is something deeply toxic to me about a definition of toughness that requires men to hurt others, or to hurt themselves.')
