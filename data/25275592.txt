At least I found no reviews&#x2F;forum posts at all...). Got mine (Samsung QM49N) from an Amazon-clearance sale (marked down 50% - apparently they couldn&#x27;t successfully break existing supply chains this iteration).<p>Initially I was a little bit worried that it might have really bad black levels&#x2F;image quality, given that it&#x27;s rated for 24&#x2F;7 and 500cm&#x2F;m² of backlight brightness and the fact they offer a &quot;plain&quot; TV-like model for a little bit less. I was pleasantly suprised that these fears were unfounded and you can even adjust the actual backlight (most TVs will do this dynamically and so have fun in your sunny living room...) and it has really great viewing angles (for VA. I own a 32&quot; VA-display as well ...). I&#x27;d say picture quality is on par, if not better than most of what I could have gotten at a similar price point (remember price was reduced from €800 to €400) and compares okish to the €900€ TV of relatives (the latter has less banding (and yes, every TV in the 3-digit range has groce banding))<p>So: if you see a digital-signage display marked down and are shopping for a TV (without nuisances and inbuilt-tuner). Try it. It might be a really nice experience!')
