Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608594577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500449, text='&gt; If there was no repercussion to defaulting on loans why would anyone ever pay off a loan?<p>&gt; Are you joking? Do you not realize that any current problems were caused by the current system?<p>What&#x27;s even more telling is how that all happened when I was in school, prior to my JR year defaulting on student debt was what most did when they got to the professional levels and secured a decent job--and this was back when university costs were much lower and more broadly available, too.<p>I&#x27;ve had several boomer aged physicians&#x2F;surgeons&#x2F;anesthesiologists&#x2F;lawyers laugh about it when I was in motorsports and told us to explore it despite the stigma as it &#x27;paid in the end.&#x27;<p>In many ways I think this predatory model of extracting wealth from the youth is not only short sighted its absurd; reducing the quality of life with underemployment&#x2F;unemployment creates lost generations like they have in Japan, and unless the goal is to lower the population at all costs then not much &#x27;good&#x27; comes out of it except Zombie banks, high national&#x2F;&#x2F;coprprate debt ratios, mass impoverishment of Society as a whole and suicide as proved by the last 30 years of Japanese Sociological observations.<p>Then again, some study using Machine Learning was stated to have had &#x27;break through&#x27; results identifying India was not in poverty, only to see that Apple factory workers were paid $7&#x2F;month instead of the ~$100 and proceeded to smash the factory.<p>Are people still in doubt we live in a Dystopic Cyberpunk existence already? Its not just an overly hyped game, its clear to see we&#x27;ve been in one for over a decade now. Its just not all neon, robotic enhancements and flying cars; everything else seems to be lock step with the genre from an untouchable Corporate Class, decaying environment, to poor living standards, wide spread disease and poverty.')
