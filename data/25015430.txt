But say they rented a dozen powerful 1U servers on a fast pipe in colocation somewhere, and did it all themselves, would they be self hosting? Or no? Because they wouldn&#x27;t own&#x2F;run the datacenter itself, or the ISPs and IX point that were their upstreams. Or would it be self hosting only if they owned the bare metal versus leasing it?<p>Anecdotally I have seen a lot of instances where medium to large sized non-profit, open-source project related organizations become the umbrella organization containing a number of smaller community initiatives within them.')
