These small aircraft parts actually provide a respectable amount of thrust. The low weight of drones and model aircraft usually means they have massive thrust-to-weight ratio. T&#x2F;W &gt; 1 means the engine alone is able to propel it straight up. The larger the ratio, the more it acts like a rocket.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thrust-to-weight_ratio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thrust-to-weight_ratio</a>')
