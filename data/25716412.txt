There&#x27;s a single output exposed; you can&#x27;t accidentally use the wrong value downstream. You could wrap it all in an inner function, I guess, but that seems like overkill unless you plan to reuse it.<p>Though to be fair, having explicit intermediate variables is idiomatic in Python, from what I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s one of my biggest pet-peeves about the language, but it&#x27;s not without precedent.')
