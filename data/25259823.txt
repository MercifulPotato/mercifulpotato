It has three decoders but only one of them can handle &quot;complex macroinstructions&quot; that require micro-operations from the ROM. If a limited-functionality decoder got the complex instruction, the instruction gets redirected to another decoder the next cycle.<p>As far as variable-length instructions, a separate Instruction Length Decoder sorts that out before decoding.<p>Ref: &quot;Modern Processor Design&quot; p268.')
