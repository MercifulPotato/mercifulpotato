The prof had a 64-bit computer (probably DEC Alpha) which you could do that on,  but it didn&#x27;t work on my 32-bit x86 machine.<p>It turned out that the program never used the array that it allocated so deleting one line from the code got it to run.<p>Most CS profs never have to really finish the systems they work on so they lack many of the skills and attitudes of the professional programmer.  Some of them are artisans with code,  but mostly they making a living writing papers and teaching classes and the code is tertiary.')
