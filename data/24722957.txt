Maybe they would have come up with a new language, or reused whatever else was viable at the time.  But, maybe their OS wouldn&#x27;t have been so overwhelming in its popularity and other OSes, like PalmOS and the windows phone OS, could have remained alive today. I think there&#x27;s a lot of people, maybe the majority, who would agree that Android&#x27;s UI was inferior to one or both of those alternatives.<p>e.g. #2: looking to the future, the resulting fragmentation could mean that even new OSes will have to be developed (edit - since even kernel APIs could be covered by copyright). That could be pretty bad for open source and hacking in general - except that as another poster has pointed out, closed-down software might turn out to be pretty useless compared to open-source. Maybe Oracle winning could be a really good thing for reinvigorating the development of new paradigms in software.')
