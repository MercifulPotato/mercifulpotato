I&#x27;m just listing examples of folks that I want to use my code. And you left off the rest of my quote that explains in a bit more detail:<p>&gt; Given the current intellectual property regime, corporations are incentivized against the use of copyleft software in a large variety of circumstances. Thus, copyleft software, particularly libraries, is regularly avoided by corporations. Since some of these corporations also play a huge role in the FOSS world itself, this leads to systemic network effects that push folks strongly towards the use of permissive licenses. Thus, putting aside ideology and activism, it is simply a reality that if I publish a library with a copyleft license, it&#x27;s less likely to be used by folks, which is inhibits my goal.<p>The fact that corporations do use copyleft in some places doesn&#x27;t negate this point at all. It&#x27;s pretty clear that there are a wide variety of circumstances in which copyleft <i>is</i> avoided.<p>This isn&#x27;t theoretical or hand wavy. I have direct experience with this. One of the criteria Visual Studio Code used to evaluate ripgrep was its permissive license.[1]<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;vscode&#x2F;issues&#x2F;19983#issuecomment-282581996" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;vscode&#x2F;issues&#x2F;19983#issuecommen...</a>')
