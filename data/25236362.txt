After staying in Canada for 3 years, I would be granted Canadian citizenship.<p>In 1st week of Oct 2020, I was informed my I-130 has been approved. My father, who became a naturalized US citizen in Oct 2018, had filed for my GC and I am in F2B category right now. I have been told it’s another 2 years before I get my GC.<p>Naturally my first priority would be to get Canadian citizenship, and then US.<p>I am expecting my Canadian PR to be approved by first half of 2021, after which I would be leaving for Canada. My GC would be approved by Oct 2022, approximately.<p>1. Do I have to land in USA as soon as my GC is approved? If my calculations are right, I would still be in Canada in the middle of finishing my 3 years to Canadian citizenship when my GC would be approved. Is it okay if I get my Canadian citizenship and only after that move to USA to pursue 5 years wait time of US citizenship?<p>2. How much tax would I have to pay to both countries? Is there a double taxation avoidance treaty between Canada - US?<p>3. Any other caveats I need to know before I become a citizen of both counties?<p>I am 31, working in IT with 4.5 yrs of work ex, currently based in India, have a 4 years bachelors of engineering degree, and never married.<p>Any suggestions would be reciprocated with immense gratitude.')
