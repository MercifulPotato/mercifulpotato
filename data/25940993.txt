(Which is probably already a thing somewhere legally, and very likely is the factory state for some Android phones.)<p>Note that banning E2EE implies banning encrypted p2p communications entirely. E2EE is a concept that applies only to centralized comms providers where all messages go through a server.<p>Practically speaking, it&#x27;s impossible to ban every encrypted protocol (TLS, SSH, ...). It&#x27;s also (probably) impossible to ban IP communications that don&#x27;t have an &quot;approved server&quot; participating.<p>However, comms providers &#x2F; social networks to date at least manage, authenticate, and introduce users at the serverside. Fully distributed projects have problems with spam. So governments would have to ban comms providers from &quot;allowing&quot; their clients to talk to each other directly and not via the backend. That&#x27;s a hefty technological restriction, which would block a wide range of protocols (webrtc&#x2F;SIP, torrents, probably a bunch of other Very Important things I&#x27;m not thinking of right now).')
