Item(by='brianwski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611779095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925921, text='&gt; this response by you reads as quite disingenuous<p>It wasn&#x27;t intended as such, I really meant it.  I&#x27;d like to get to the bottom of this, understand what this person&#x27;s true issue with Backblaze is.<p>&gt; these seem like very real reasons to get upset, maybe you &quot;can try to fix&quot; those?<p>What the user is doing is called &quot;Gish gallop&quot;.  This is a technique where somebody makes a rapid fire list of unrelated half truths or misrepresentations, each of which takes CONSIDERABLY longer to address than to claim. And I&#x27;ve repeated explained why they are invalid, but the user just shows up a day or two later and makes the same exact list of complaints.  No edits, no admitting that even one of the complaints is invalid.  Gish gallop.<p>This is not the behavior of somebody that is genuinely interested in having Backblaze address or fix that list of issues.  There is something else going on, and I personally would like to know what it is.  First of all because I&#x27;m curious what the issue is, second of all I hope I can fix whatever the real issue is.<p>I&#x27;m not going through the whole list because I&#x27;ve done that maybe 10 - 15 times so far?  But let&#x27;s take this one, because it&#x27;s spectacularly false, this person KNOWS it&#x27;s false, but this person repeatedly makes the claim over and over again:<p>&gt; Backblaze mislead users about PEK. The decryption key is sent to their server, and so is your password. It is not a zero-knowledge system. They donâ€™t care.<p>Backblaze has 4 security levels, one of which is zero-knowledge, and we ENCOURAGE customers to pick the correct level for themselves.

All the user&#x27;s claims are like this.  Obviously something else is going on.<p>I just wish that user would tell me what the real issue is. I can&#x27;t fix what I don&#x27;t know about.')
