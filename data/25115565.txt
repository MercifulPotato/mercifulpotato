Now I am transitioning to Emacs. I keep hearing that you can &quot;live&quot; in emacs but I can&#x27;t seem to have that revelation, yet.<p>For example, I often find myself quit Emacs to jump to a different directory just to open a file. I think I am doing this wrong. I have tried Dire&#x2F;Neotree but those are not providing enough convenience imo.<p>Do you you a workflow or setup to &quot;live&quot; in emacs? Note: I use pure Emacs and not spacemac or Doom.')
