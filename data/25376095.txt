Every tab can hive its own cookies, separate from all other tabs, which disappear when the tab is closed.<p>I&#x27;ve got mine setup to delete cookies for a domain when the last tab for that domain is closed. I also run Ublock Origin, don&#x27;t accept third party cookies, and have javascript turned off for all domains by default.')
