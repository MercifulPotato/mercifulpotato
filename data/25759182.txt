Item(by='agiroth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610522330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753413, text='&gt; The slippery slope argument is generally regarded as a logical fallacy because the argument can be applied to anything.<p>Can you expand on this? I&#x27;ve seen the claim several times, but given the fact that (in general, not referring to covid) it is possible to point to historical examples of how things progress from A-&gt;B-&gt;C, and then you can identify a sequence of A-&gt;B currently, it becomes almost silly not to conclude the goal is C. So why is demonstrating history repeating itself a fallacy?<p>Granted I&#x27;ve placed a number of conditions there. Maybe that&#x27;s what you mean. I&#x27;m just curious what the general argument is.<p>&gt; What interest would the U.S. have in requiring Flu or HIV tests for travel?<p>Humans unfortunately have a bias for &quot;doing something&quot; rather than nothing, even if the two actions are equivalent in consequence (which favors doing nothing - less energy).<p>Scream loud enough and we&#x27;ll create problems where there weren&#x27;t any. I mean that&#x27;s basically what network news does all day every day. Then we&#x27;ll respond to those problems, and create more problems. Etc. &quot;It worked for covid, why aren&#x27;t we doing it for the flu?&quot; Even if the argument isn&#x27;t valid, it <i>sounds</i> good, and politicians like things that sound good even if they don&#x27;t do anything, creating problems and great expense for people for little to no actual gain.')
