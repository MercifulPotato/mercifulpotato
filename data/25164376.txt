Just because in the past you wouldn&#x27;t get called out for it doesn&#x27;t make not mean.<p>Then you have to realize that in having your character call someone disfigured in your fictional work is also mean without treading extremely carefully. You have to use your voice as the narrator to make it clear that this wasn&#x27;t an okay thing to do. It&#x27;s the same as DnD rules where &quot;it&#x27;s what my character would do&quot; isn&#x27;t an excuse for being cruel and making people feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. Everyone has a story of that one guy who makes women uncomfortable by having their character rape someone -- sometimes someone in the party -- and get mad when the DM says no and kicks them out.')
