Consider any of the countless elections that have taken place around the world and throughout history. Do you believe that the number of them in which actors engaged in fraud is so low as to be incredible, when you think about countries and time periods that are not the country and time period you presently live in?  Peruvian elections in 1960.  Scottish elections in 1990.  Zimbabwe in 1994.  I&#x27;m just naming random countries&#x2F;times here.  What percentage of these do you think involved fraud?  That&#x27;s what the prior probability is.')
