It&#x27;s up to you to figure out how to manage that, of course.<p>Now, that said... to avoid any potential issues, I&#x27;d only ever use .local for its intended purpose. There&#x27;s just too much potential for &quot;weirdness&quot; to occur. Personally, however, I completely avoid any use of either (.local and Multicast DNS) regardless.<p>--<p>On a side note, &quot;.localdomain&quot; mentioned in the grandparent comment should actually be &quot;localhost.&quot;<p>--<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6762" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6762</a>')
