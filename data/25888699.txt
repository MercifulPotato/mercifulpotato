You’re part of a gang (or clique, as they’re apparently called now), probably beefing with another, and almost definitely carrying a gun on you for protection. You’re well aware.<p>The city has tried various interventions - social workers, police visits, calling the kid’s school&#x2F;parents (a lot of the people aren’t 18) - but the things that work are the same as always: social support plus significant police presence in the neighborhood.<p>Which leads me back to my original point... they recently stopped maintaining the list IIRC because it just doesn’t provide any actionable info beyond what we already have.')
