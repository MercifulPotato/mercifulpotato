It&#x27;s a citizen-trained response team initiative that usually falls under law enforcement. The idea is in an earthquake you can have a couple thousand purpose-trained citizens running around shutting off gas valves, checking on neighbors, assisting emergency services with communication (through HAM radio for example), and doing other basic tasks that let the fire department focus on cutting people out of collapsed buildings or putting out fires.<p>By the way, regarding &quot;gun and bunker&quot; preppers, this is a sharp divide in the prepper community. Practically every thread in &#x2F;r&#x2F;preppers and similar forums and subreddits eventually devolves into what essentially amounts to an ideological battle between communists and libertarians, or, &quot;we believe people are inherently good&quot; vs &quot;we believe people are inherently evil&quot; to take a non-political-compass take. FWIW, the &quot;inherently good&quot; people have more evidence on their side, based on how communities have responded to disaster in the pass. A great book on the subject is &quot;A Paradise Built in Hell&quot; by Rebecca Solnit[1]. She takes a look at primary sources from a set of disasters throughout history, and how people helped eachother with no expectation of reward. She also turns up some cases of totally selfless ultimate sacrifices for strangers. It&#x27;s really interesting.<p>EDIT: A great fictional illustration of this rift in the prepper community is &#x27;The Masque of the Red Death&#x27;, a short story in the book &quot;Radicalized&quot; by Cory Doctorow. It follows the story of the ultimate prepper fantasy, a rich options trader who builds a &quot;Fort Doom&quot; in scrubland, equipped with a year or so of food, water, purification equipment, sanitation equipment, and of course a veritable armory. It compares this character against the general community of IIRC Portland, who are reacting to a government-ending pandemic through mutual aide instead. A really fun exploratory take.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;6444492-a-paradise-built-in-hell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;6444492-a-paradise-built...</a> S')
