People genuinely believed he was going to work for the common man. He talked about workers rights (in a xenophobic sort of way, but still) he talked about increasing pay for blue collar workers, and about restoring the lost legacy to places that have been abandoned by globalization.<p>That never got talked about by Trump detractors. Union working class Joe-Schmoe&#x27;s used to vote democrat, and now solidly do not. There&#x27;s a reason for that.<p>Edit: Please note that I never said he did those things, just that they were what he promised. He is completely full of crap on almost everything he says, those promises at the top of the pile. But that is the reason working class Joe love him. He says the things they want to hear.')
