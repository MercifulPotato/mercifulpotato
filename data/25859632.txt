No idea what rules there are for developers, but an individual can buy land anywhere and is not required to have any of those things when they build their home.  The only things almost universally regulated is sewage.  Some states allow composting toilets, but most require a septic tank inspected by the county.  Some counties in some states have rules about types of septic systems.')
