My Steam handle has an O and I used &quot;negative squared Latin&quot; characters -- I was investigating this yesterday (I found no answers!).<p>Last year my Steam name showed properly on MS Win10 and on Kubuntu. About 6 months ago Win 10 started showing it with the O as red. Last week the red O doesn&#x27;t show at all in one part of Steam but shows white in another part.<p>I copied the symbols to a Unicode decoder and it showed the O name with a {blood red} modifier, something like that.<p>I searched briefly but couldn&#x27;t find the symbol without the red colour, but it only shows red in some places: I&#x27;d pasted it into the search bar in Firefox (on Kubuntu), it showed as a number-square (1Fxxx) but then after searching it showed as the red-O character.<p>Utf8 is weird.')
