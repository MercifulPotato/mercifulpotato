But I must say, I already forgot two pins and there&#x27;s now a pop up for the third one asking me to insert it every time I open the app, and I have absolutely no idea what this pin is either. Not entering it though doesn&#x27;t seem to be preventing me from using the app though, so that&#x27;s also weird. Meh, still not too much of a deal breaker to stop using Signal.')
