In absence of supervision, the various articles on the Internet, stack exchange answers on how to write a controller or other piece of Java app, give a novice developer necessary guidance on how to structure their code.<p>On the other hand as a more mature, knowledgeable and experience developer you may see that this structure is not perfect. It is repetitive and it has a lot of boilerplate and it does not suit well every application.<p>You may even figure out that every application has their own perfect framework, depending on its size and other characteristics and the problem it is trying to solve.<p>Clojure lets you design that framework and then write the application in perfect framework for your application.<p>That framework might be some zero-code decisions (like decisions on where to put which part of the code) but can also be some set of macros up to full blown DSL.<p>Assuming you are mature developer, you will know how to use these to solve your problem but if you don&#x27;t then that&#x27;s where the problem starts.')
