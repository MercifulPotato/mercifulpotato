You would also be restricted in what you do to people who refuse to join your strike.<p>The UK is an example of a European country with relatively tough union laws. The list of issues that it&#x27;s legitimate to strike over is restricted, votes are required, the general secretary of the union must authorise the strike and so on. Strikes do happen of course but not because some random middle manager threw a hissy fit about feedback on a paper she wrote.')
