I don&#x27;t think a bit of London real estate and a share of uber is going to keep them on top forever, especially when western governments realize that there&#x27;s no need to be nice to them any more and keeping them out of prison and giving them western visas is a bigger headache than it is worth.<p>I expect it&#x27;s probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better though. The Saudi Royal family is not going to let itself be drained of wealth slowly and go peacefully into the night. They are going to claw each others&#x27; eyes out to maintain their status and privilege. MBS will probably get his comeuppance at some point at the hands of one of his relatives or via some Iranian proxy.')
