I&#x27;m not surprised by the findings and the resolution to this paradox.<p>When we look at apparent inefficiencies of life systems (singletons and complete systems) we have to take into account setting and environmental factors as well as the various layers of abstraction.<p>Looking down at cancer (similar to a defect in software) and questioning why it behaves in seemingly counter intuitive ways makes it all the more appearent that we are still at the tip of our scientific and spiritual understanding for models of healthy systems, both cellularly and holistically as life on our planet.<p>As above so below.<p>Based on this research cancer switches to a process which accepts the inputs at hand and processes outputs for growth (often rapid growth).<p>Regardless of how it looks as a spectator, the cells inside you make billions of individual decisions each second and those decisions may have eventual degrgations over time with enough entropy.<p>The cell has blueprints and is on a mission, sometimes it&#x27;s mission is corrupted or the order of operations is abnormal.<p>I like how they make mention yeast fermentation as a similar process and I didnt know our cells could run both processes. I wonder why? Do we use fermentation at various parts of our human development?')
