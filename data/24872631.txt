China can&#x27;t equal America or Europe because China isn&#x27;t white.<p>There are arguments against China&#x27;s continued rise that are rooted in demographics, politics, and social issues, but the Chinese are definitely <i>capable</i> of doing what Americans and Europeans do if all else is equal.<p>Racism is nonsense, and like other forms of nonsense believing it makes you gullible and foolish.')
