They&#x27;re ~$2500 a pop to have replaced when they&#x27;re out of warranty (EDIT: some additional research is showing Tesla might be able to replace a $120 daughter board the eMMC is attached to instead of the entire MCU), and Tesla has been attempting to push the costs onto the owner as much as possible (even though the flash memory longevity issue was Tesla&#x27;s fault and should&#x27;ve been mitigated long before it was with a software update).')
