It seems to me that the same point phrased as a declarative statement vs a joke are received completely differently.<p>For example,<p>1. &quot;Tesla is overvalued because of x, y, z.&quot;<p>2. &quot;Just read about x, y, z. Better call my broker and dump some shares.&quot;<p>Sometimes the addition of humor can show just how silly the context is, something that a formal declarative statement cannot.<p>So, why does HN hate humor?')
