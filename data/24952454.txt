I started with PHP more than a decade ago and every company I&#x27;ve worked for (very large, large and medium-sized) has migrated away from it or never touched it. I don&#x27;t see any sort of renaissance but if PHP has gotten really better as I read many times here (didn&#x27;t bother to fact check as I abandoned it many years ago) then the market will speak. I don&#x27;t see that happening yet in my experience.')
