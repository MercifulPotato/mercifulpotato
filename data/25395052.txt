Vaccines, masks and who won the election are not &quot;sweeping opinions you don&#x27;t like&quot;. People have actually died due to the anti-vaxx movement, leading to +50% Measle deaths in 2019. These are hard facts and these decisions are a matter of life or death.<p>No one is blocking opinions. Trump has failed to prove election fraud in over 50 cases so far, and the safe harbor deadline has now past, which is why Youtube has now put this rule in place. It is now confirmed that Biden has won the election, and anyone claiming otherwise is intentionally lying. If they had proof, they would&#x27;ve shown it in court, where there are <i>real</i> consequences, not on social media where anything goes.')
