It lets you use your entire investments in Steam, Epic, etc. with the benefit of a streaming service. It&#x27;s also surprisingly not all that expensive (especially compared to buying equivalent hardware yourself).<p>It also entirely solves waiting for games to show up on these services, or going away (a la Geforce Now), and ownership issues. There&#x27;s no problem even putting custom software, games, dev environments, whatever, into the Shadow machine.<p>I was about to buy an entirely new rig and tbh, I&#x27;m probably just going to get a Shadow subscription in a month or two.<p><i>note</i> there may be a several month wait for your Shadow rig to be ready as they provision dedicated hardware upon subscription and are pretty popular at the moment.')
