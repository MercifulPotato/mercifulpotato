They are completely locked down. For obvious reasons. This is very unfortunate.<p>I would love to spend $199 a piece to replace them all with Pinebook Pros. It would add up to about $300,000 for the hardware. Many would suggest this is a poor choice because of lack of an app ecosystem. But the current chromebooks are not allowed to have any apps anyway. Still, the school district would refuse them because they are not so locked down. The freedom to use them any way you can imagine terrifies administrators.<p>Pine64 sells replacement screens, keyboards, motherboards, harddrives, whatever. A knockoff parts market would evolve very quickly. You actually _could_ have students maintain these. They could learn enormously.<p>This terrifies most adults in the chain of power that can prevent it from happening. And some of the most important of those people are not educators. They work for SV companies. They convince the educators it is a bad idea.')
