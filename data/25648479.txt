One friend in particular had an ex install some sort of remote access software on her laptop which he used to access her webcam.<p>Personally I like to think I&#x27;m careful about who has access to my hardware and I trust the webcam light. Theoretically someone might be able to hack the firmware but if I was being directly targeted by a sufficiently capable and motivated actor my webcam would not be my biggest concern.')
