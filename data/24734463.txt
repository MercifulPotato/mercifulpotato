The key is to leave the REPL running, I find. Then, with Revise.jl the speed is insane because nothing has to start up; only the changes you make will be recompiled during execution. Also take a look at Pluto.jl.<p>Edit: By the Visual Studio paradigm, I mean a paradigm where all the stuff is made around visual interactions with the IDE. For example, showing autocomplete which works because the programmer is very constrained in OOP (foo.b completes to foo.bar) and statically typed languages with Java and C# as prime examples.<p>I think these constraints are made around the idea that programmers are dumb and that it mostly is a distraction from how one actually wants to think about the problem at hand.')
