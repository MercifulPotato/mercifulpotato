If one woman accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, the burden of proof for her story is high.  She would need some pretty strong evidence to get Cosby charged let alone convicted.  She probably wouldn&#x27;t even receive coverage in the mainstream media without some other form of evidence.  However the entire situation would change if she was one of 60 women coming forward.  Suddenly the burden of proof for that first woman is greatly diminished.  Each individual&#x27;s story is corroborated by someone else having a very similar story.')
