I said that tough policing is a natural result of high crime areas because cops are humans and are affected by the environment they are in. I read an article about Facebook and YouTube content reviewers getting PTSD after only a few weeks of work looking at despicable images.<p>Imagine being a cop with decades of experience policing one of the most violent cities on the world, seeing what the worst of humanity does to innocent people, knowing that the next stop may be your last. My point is: there are limits to what you can do with policing in such an environment.<p>Sure .. get rid of all the bad cops you want. File any lawsuits to protect rights of criminals you want. None of that will make the crime go down and safeguard the community.')
