They’re incredibly nice people who have never heard of Stripe, AWS or Parler and don’t own Twitter accounts.<p>When we see video of hundreds of people storming the capital, or dozens of violent online posts, let’s not forget that their are lots of Trump supporters who don’t participate in or like the drama of recent weeks and aren’t as integrated with “Big Tech”.
