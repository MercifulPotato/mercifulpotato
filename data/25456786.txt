Two objectives: how fast PM2.5 is removed, and down to what level can it bring down PM2.5.<p>From worst to best:<p>* Nordic Pure 20x20x4M15+C MERV 15 - the carbon layer absolutely kills airflow, doesn&#x27;t work<p>* Filtrete 20x20x1, AC Furnace Air Filter, MPR 2800 &#x2F; MERV 14 - works okay<p>* Nordic Pure 20x20x4 - works well<p>* Lennox Corporation X7935 20X20X5 MERV 16 - works the best. This thing is an absolute beast in terms of filtration performance; significantly lower steady-state PM2.5 readings during the California fires.<p>Test equipment: Awair and Plume Flow v2.')
