It contained this question: &#x27;The Nautilus evolved from the Ammonite, which lived millions of years ago. It only lives in shallow waters and takes decades to grow. Suggest why the Nautilus is rare.&#x27;<p>The answer given was breathtaking (to me) in its wrongness.<p>&gt; Nautiluses are rare because all the Ammonites have already turned into Nautiluses so there are none left to make any more Nautiluses.<p>As pompous as it sounds, this was a formative moment in which I realised that some people were a <i>lot</i> less clever - or at least a <i>lot</i> less knowledgable - than I was.')
