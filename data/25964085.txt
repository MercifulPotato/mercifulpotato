If they were, they wouldn&#x27;t be publishing the contract or making such a public fuss. What you&#x27;re seeing with this publication, with the aggressive statements by senior EU politicians, and with the imposition of border controls, is the application of political pressure, not legal pressure.<p>I think the EU&#x27;s behaviour is mostly driven by internal political reasons. Their vaccination programme has been highly inept so far, partly due to the failure of the commission. But no government admits failure when there&#x27;s a possibility of assigning blame elsewhere. The more EU citizens can be convinced that it&#x27;s all AZ&#x27;s fault for missing deliveries, and the dastardly post-Brexit UK holding doses hostage, the less scrutiny will be be applied to their own role in creating the situation.')
