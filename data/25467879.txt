I tend to only buy Seasonic power supplies, but there just weren&#x27;t any in stock anywhere.  I ended up finding an Asus power supply on B&amp;H and it served me well, but I really hate deviating from my approved vendor list.  (So far it has treated me well.  It&#x27;s a 1200W unit and I can pull 1000W from it without any problems at all.  The same cannot be said of other non-Seasonic units I&#x27;ve had over the years.  I was plagued with flakiness with a Corsair 1000W unit many years ago.  I wasted so much time debugging that problem; finally connecting an oscilloscope to the 12V rail and noticing that the 12V rail fell to 10V when running AVX instructions.  That explains why the computer just hard powered off when I hit an AVX workload :)<p>ECC memory was also in a bad state then, so I suffer with non-ECC memory.  So far, that is also treating me well.  Can&#x27;t worry about bit flips you don&#x27;t know about!  (taps forehead)')
