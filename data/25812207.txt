Turns out a huge emacs configuration is not needed, in fact I notice my emacs config actually started to become smaller over the recent times. It&#x27;s hard to express how much I value emacs now and the only regret I have is that I did not give it a chance earlier when I still exclusively used &quot;modern&quot; editors and IDEs.<p>Another aspect I see rarely mentioned is the emacs evil[1], it basicelly provides a full vi layer, it&#x27;s much more than your average &quot;vi keybindings&quot; plugin.\nEmacs vs Vim? Not a question I have to give any thought when I can use both and switch between them without much effort.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emacs-evil&#x2F;evil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emacs-evil&#x2F;evil</a>')
