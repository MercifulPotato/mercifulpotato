These lightweight, user friendly and secure microservices then connect to one another in a mesh design, allowing users to follow one another and share their posts.&quot;<p>Love this idea. Simple concept. Should scale, save for the tail cases 1:huge N followers, but that&#x27;s solvable with caches&#x2F;proxies. Hope for the decentralized web free from the grip of the Big Tech elites.')
