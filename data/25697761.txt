The original strain was only projected to infect 60-70% of the population (if left unchecked).  A new strain being 70% more infectious drastically changes that figure.<p>Not to mention a similar uptick in serious cases and even just more people presenting to the hospital.  Imagine the current situation, where some cities are already at 0% capacity, but 70% worse...<p>Just something worth noting when we say that a new strain is _just_ more infectious.')
