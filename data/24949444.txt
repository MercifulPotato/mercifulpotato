It can occur after a serious surgery or traumatic event.<p>Anyway, there’s no cure, but after months of stretching it’s mostly gone now.<p>While health issues still persist in my life, I feel healthy enough now to do basically everything in my life that I did before the surgery. But the whole incident really changed the way I look at health, life, and health care&#x2F;awareness in America.')
