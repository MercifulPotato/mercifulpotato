If you&#x27;re using Uber to get home from the bar late at night once a week, an extra 25% is no big deal.<p>But if you&#x27;re on the lower income scale and you need Uber to help you get between your second and third job (because you can&#x27;t afford a car and public transit is unreliable) or you need it to get to a doctor&#x27;s appointment, this kind of change is a big deal.<p>What will also likely happen is that ridership decreases <i>at the margins</i>.
