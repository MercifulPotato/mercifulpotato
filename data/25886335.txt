If we think of them as a energy infrastructure company + subsidiary car company&#x2F;freight company (tesla semi) then I can see the valuation making some sense.<p>Tesla doesnt need perfect automation to handle cheap, automated, short run freight lines, leveraging clean cheap electricity, and low maintenance trucks(no ICE, less drive train maintenance, no driver time at wheel restrictions)')
