Others working on the problem are ignored entirely or seen as a threat to their own solution.<p>If a person isn&#x27;t already rich, then they&#x27;re often balancing doing good for others with making at least enough money that they don&#x27;t have to work a side job.  In that sense, others working on the same problem absolutely are a threat to one&#x27;s livelihood.  Being aware that helping others can sometimes be in conflict with helping oneself and figuring out how to resolve those conflicts in a way that doesn&#x27;t reduce one&#x27;s effectiveness in helping others is important, but it seems to me that not working to help other people who have different approaches to the problem might not necessarily be an ethical failure but rather an economic one.  Working with someone else and doing it their way might not be an option if there isn&#x27;t a viable route to funding ones&#x27; own work.<p>On the other hand, I do agree that humility is valuable.  If you&#x27;re in it mostly to feel good about yourself rather than to do the most good even if it isn&#x27;t personally rewarding, then the end results might not be as good as they would be otherwise.  But then I&#x27;d rather have more people trying to help others even for bad reasons than not trying at all.')
