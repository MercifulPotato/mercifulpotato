Food is not price controlled to any similar degree as housing.<p>Nobody is going in to restaurants and telling them that they must sell a hamburger for less than 15$.<p>No one is going in to walmart and forcing them to sell cereal for less than 5$ a box.<p>Compared to rent and housing, it is way way way more free of a market, regardless of any negligible government regulations that you can find that are in no way on the same scale as rent control.')
