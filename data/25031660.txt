People have gone to prison for it.<p>Fair enough, though now I&#x27;m wondering why I keep hearing &quot;no shred of evidence of voter fraud&quot; from so many people.<p>&gt; But voter fraud, on the &quot;retail&quot; level, is heavily penalized and extremely unlikely to impact outcomes.<p>There are currently four states (AZ, GA, PA, WI) with less than 1% margin between the candidates. Georgia is at 0.2%. It wouldn&#x27;t take a high percentage of fraud to flip a state.<p>But let&#x27;s suppose that retail voter fraud is rare. How are we even detecting <i>wholesale</i> voter fraud? What&#x27;s the method to detect when someone with access to the voter rolls slips an extra crate of ballots into the count, or fills out and mails in thousands of ballots in the names of people who never asked them to?')
