Most employees (especially non C-suite executive employees) <i>do not want to loan money</i> to a startup to receive a &quot;convertible note&#x2F;debt&quot;.  Even if employees wanted to loan money, most don&#x27;t have the discretionary play money in their bank account to risk on a startup.<p>It&#x27;s the investors that have the money and risk appetite to pay for convertible notes.<p>If you meant that employees should receive convertible notes even without paying anything (no loan)... then I think &quot;convertible debt&quot; is the wrong label to describe this transaction that you&#x27;re proposing.')
