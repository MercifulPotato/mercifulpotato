Just because it&#x27;s &#x27;different&#x27; doesn&#x27;t make it good. Most artists who are actually &#x27;pretty good&#x27; have <i>some</i> kind of following - they get picked up, at least marginally. Of course there&#x27;s nothing wrong with &#x27;liking that band with 2K views&#x27;. One reason this happens if if they are &#x27;genre&#x27; meaning, a newer band, playing into a past sound or genre, people may not pick up. A local band here in Montreal is <i>really</i> good, but they play a kind of specific Cajun country&#x2F;rock, so their appeal is &#x27;respectable&#x27; but &#x27;quaint&#x27;.')
