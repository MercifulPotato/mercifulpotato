The game logic&#x2F;features are a far cry from what was advertised; I&#x27;ve waited 7-8 years for this game and the disappointment is immeasurable. I don&#x27;t believe they can fix the short-coming by Jan&#x2F;Feb (As a software Engineer myself I just don&#x27;t see how they can implement&#x2F;fix so much missing logic in that short of a time frame).<p>I&#x27;m holding out for the PS5 patch so that at least I can play what _is_ there at a decent resolution. The game looks nice, that and the story is pretty much all it has going for it (in my opinion). The PS4 build is running at such a low resolution (60FPS though) with terrible lighting and shadows on PS5 right now that it&#x27;s embarrassing. That&#x27;s once you get past the 10+ times the game has totally crashed out on my since the 1.04 update.<p>I want to enjoy the game and right now I can&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s see how it fairs in a couple of months.<p>If you want a feel for how it&#x27;ll play for your giftee on PS4&#x2F;Pro (at the current patch level) check out Digital Foundry&#x27;s reviews on YouTube.')
