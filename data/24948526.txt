One would wish there were a kill switch if you knew you were both in pain and going to die of starvation. Having that might even save some of your species members so that predators can&#x27;t guess where the rest of the healthy ones are.<p>It&#x27;s also strange that social behaviors didn&#x27;t evolve in more species. They seem to have the brains to migrate thousands of miles and borrow homes, yet they don&#x27;t have the brains to help members of their species, which would help them proliferate.')
