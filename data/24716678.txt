Laws enabling this have always been on the books, but somehow people have come to tolerate corporate officers getting a free pass. Prosecutors don&#x27;t even try to fulfill their public duty.<p>Exxon and coal executives are personally responsible for a substantial part of global climate disruption. Paint executives are responsible for deliberately poisoning hundreds of millions of children. Tobacco executives got millions of children addicted to nicotine. Coke and Pepsi are poisoning whole generations. Yet, the most we seem able to do is fine shareholders, when shareholders really have hardly any say in what companies do. A nut job who shoots up a bus station triggers a nationwide manhunt, yet these rich bastards kill by the millions, wholesale, and more horribly, and are allowed to retire to their yachts. It would not take much prosecution to bring about a sea change in how corporate executives behave.')
