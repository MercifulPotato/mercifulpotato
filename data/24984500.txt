For example in Bangladesh the religion is Islam but the culture is more Indian. In my experience, American Muslims are more similar to Catholics. People who aren’t actively practicing might just be going through the motions, but ones who affirmatively reject the underlying beliefs would usually identify as something other than Catholic. There is also a strong social pressure to “return to the fold.”')
