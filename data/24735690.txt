I was suggested to take that much by my doctor _daily_ without even bothering with a test (granted I&#x27;d taken a test years prior in a similar climate, perhaps that was enough for him). I even temporarily upped it for a period to 4000 IU basically for the same reason as you. And I think I&#x27;ve heard some people claim that as much as 5000 IU is safe without a test?<p>It&#x27;s just surprising that this happened to you given that you&#x27;re naturally deficient.')
