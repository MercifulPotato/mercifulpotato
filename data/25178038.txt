Now, theres about 40 in that category and about 40 in above 1 million category.<p>Why take a look at this data?\nBecause it shows you what happened - less people inside, more people outside. There are more external centres of congregation than we had before - more malls with more people, more bars, more shops. The chances are you will encounter 5-10 times more people than back then on your way to the store, and thats a low guesstimate.<p>Edit: My point is, masks outside are now way more necessary than in 1919 when in mid-high populated areas.')
