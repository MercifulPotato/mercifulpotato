Once I saw you point out the proper idiom I was able to breathe easily again.  I&#x27;ve tried to find the origin of this idiom, but I&#x27;ve come up dry as a bone.<p>It&#x27;s strange, but I come across these idioms from other cultures back-to-back as I read stories on HN.  That&#x27;s most likely due to the blood, sweat, and tears people put into communicatng on here.  Or, maybe language is a bone of contention, and the idioms are simply a breath of fresh air that grabs us by the nape.  Whatever the cause, the languages differences sometimes chill me to the bone, maybe they even cause a gut feeling as they hit a raw nerve.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s better to be up your ears in idioms, rather than waiting with bated breath.<p>Thanks for letting me go off on a tangent!')
