This is arguably Pypy&#x27;s only major barrier: if you can&#x27;t run the software on it, you&#x27;re not going to use it. Pyston was arguably the most serious attempt at fast python while maintaining compatibility with the API, but DBX clearly didn&#x27;t see the RoI they were hoping to.<p>It&#x27;s looking like HPy is going to (hopefully) solve this. But finishing HPy and getting it adopted is likely to be a pretty massive undertaking.')
