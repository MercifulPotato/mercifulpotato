Item(by='scubbo', descendants=None, kids=[25524785], score=None, time=1608779211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522075, text='&gt; I wasn&#x27;t aware that playlists can be copyrighted.<p>I Am Not A Lawyer, but &quot;a curated collection of units-of-art&quot; seems like a very reasonable thing to protect access to, independently of ownership of the actual units-of-art themselves (overly-generic terminology is intentional, since although we&#x27;re discussing playlists here, the same argument could be made for, for instance, &quot;a particular framing&#x2F;hanging of visual arts&quot;)<p>&gt; And what&#x27;s the difference between someone mechanically scraping playlists [...], and someone hiring people via mechanical turk or getting 3 other people together to make text-based lists?<p>What type of difference are you interested in?<p>* Effective difference in terms of output? None.\n* Spotify&#x27;s desire to prevent people from doing so? None (they would want to provide both - and justifiably so, IMO, since, again, the playlist _itself_ is their own (algorithm&#x27;s) creation).\n* Likelihood of evading prevention? The MTurk solution is less likely to get shut down, for sure. That doesn&#x27;t mean that you have magically gotcha&#x27;d copyright and that corporation will cease trying to protect their IP, it just means that you have found the next step in the arms race.')
