Item(by='TulliusCicero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610902380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25811215, text='&gt; &quot;Parler had no moderation!&quot; and &quot;Parler wouldn&#x27;t moderate!&quot; are clearly untrue. If the complaint is &quot;not enough moderation&quot; that could be legit.<p>Has anyone been saying otherwise? I&#x27;ve always heard it reported that violent&#x2F;bigoted posts stayed up too long, thus leading to the platform being awash in them. Not that there&#x27;s literally zero moderation, but just too little.<p>Parler&#x27;s own marketing works against their reputation  here, since they liked to talk up being a &#x27;free speech app&#x27;, which implies a more &#x27;anything goes&#x27; attitude towards moderation.<p>&gt; Parler notes 3 times AWS complained about specific messages and Parler removed all of them within 24 hours each time, some within a few hours and each time AWS noted they were satisfied.<p>I mean c&#x27;mon man, that&#x27;s just not great reasoning. Of course they&#x27;re going to quickly remove the things AWS specifically points out to them. The real issue is how quick they are to remove rule-breaking content in general.<p>A better test would be AWS employees or whoever noting rule-breaking content themselves, then seeing how long it takes Parler to remove them. Or simply seeing how common rule-breaking content is to start with.')
