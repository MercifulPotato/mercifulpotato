He&#x27;s not an author, but a &#x27;blog writer&#x27;, and comes across as such in his books. Also, his insipid academic style is painfully dry, lacks flair, and contains no grander story beyond the literal. Matthew Walker&#x27;s Why We Sleep is another example of a book offering good advice, but written by an untrained author.<p>For me, when I pick up a &#x27;book&#x27;, as opposed to reading a blog article, I want the author to have spent a while meditating on a point, and to have uncovered some small portion of the universe. That magic is lacking in Cal Newport&#x27;s writing.')
