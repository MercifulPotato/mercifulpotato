We can only speculate on _exactly_ how friendly Facebook is with the three letter agencies but they are very unlikely to be &quot;estranged&quot;. In-Q-Tel know potential when they see it.<p>The behaviour of U.S. platforms overseas tends to make more sense if you ignore U.S. values for a moment and consider U.S. _interests_.<p>The alternative is of course replacement by a homegrown service or, more likely, one from a rival nation. There&#x27;s no outcome where human rights win.')
