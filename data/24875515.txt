As a relatively young adult (30s no kids), I can&#x27;t imagine fitting anything like this into my day. Wake up at 6am, exercise, work for 8-10hours, eat dinner, then trace an area out on my floor and enter another world while my wife sits on the couch alone? I think the tech is cool, but can&#x27;t practically fit into my life of real-world responsibilities.')
