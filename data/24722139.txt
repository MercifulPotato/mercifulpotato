It comes for free at the cost of you needing to satisfy the tool. Where is this in a monorepo?<p>In a monorepo if your change breaks someone else&#x27;s code, you&#x27;ll know immediately because you won&#x27;t be able to check in the code with a breaking build. If you have the correct monorepo tooling set up it will help you figure out what you&#x27;re breaking.<p>With multi-repos others will have to upgrade to your new version and then see that their code is breaking.<p>GP&#x27;s analogy was imperfect because as you pointed out the company has to invest in the monorepo tooling. But it makes sense to me.')
