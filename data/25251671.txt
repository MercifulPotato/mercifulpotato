I have a few acquaintances (&quot;friends&quot; as Americans like to call them) who have gone through literally dozens of fad diets over the years, and either never lost a single pound, or gained it all back after they stopped &quot;dieting&quot;. Not a single long term success story among them.<p>When they ask me how I managed to keep the weight off for such a long time, I simply answer &quot;eating what I always have, and calorie counting&quot;.  Nobody likes to hear that for some reason.')
