If I&#x27;m using Element&#x2F;Matrix and a colleague is using WhatsApp, or Signal, or Telegram, or Briar. Can they reliably send me messages? Can I reliably send them messages?<p>Matrix is not the provider. Matrix is the protocol&#x2F;idea. Element is both an app and a service.<p>What is common, reliable, and achievable in practice: I decide I no longer like New Vector (who run the matrix.org home server). I switch to Purism&#x27;s matrix server. I no longer am doing business with New Vector, yet I can still chat with everybody that is using New Vector&#x27;s matrix service.')
