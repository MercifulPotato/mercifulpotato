Item(by='aurizon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611324779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871739, text='Now that is a heck of a charge rate., say 100 KWH in 1&#x2F;12 of an hour = 1200 KWH per hour at 350 Volts = one heck of charger and the need for heavy wiring in the charger, in the car to the battery and to the car. Any sort of a bad connection = hot spot = heat will develop.\nThis is going to take a while to roll out, upgrade all the chargers and the distribution lines even a 10 car charge station will need. Will this work? I have seen vapor batteries before in press releases.\nHigher rates will need fewer charging spots, although I assume the change over to high rate will take 10-20 years to fully roll out and will be backwards compatible to the old slow charge batteries?. Perhaps room temp superconductors will be developed?')
