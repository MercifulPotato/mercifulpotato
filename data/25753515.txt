Tickets sometimes had quite long discussions.<p>The advantages were:<p>* Permanent, so you thought about what you wrote.<p>* Public, same effect.<p>* Sequential, so it was very rare for people to reply over each other.<p>* Goal-oriented, you wanted to move towards resolution, which was then archived forever.<p>* Opt-in for following, so you had some control over your attention.<p>* Available, so you could search and see old attachments etc etc.<p>* Safe, Local, easily self-hosted and backed up.<p>* Customizable, e.g. easy linking to the repo even if you change repos.<p>The more things moved to various forms of the all-consuming Jirapoly, the attention sink of Slack, the anarchy of mail+chat, the less useful and (importantly) the less <i>productive</i> these conversations became.')
