If I make comments implicitly about going to shoot up the neighborhood school, even though I didn&#x27;t do it yet, do you presume me innocent and leave me alone? No, it&#x27;s going to be investigated and I&#x27;ll likely get a nice greeting from some men in black soon after.<p>This wasn&#x27;t some genius, novel clock that kid invented. He put the internals of a clock into  a very specific kind of pencil case to bring around school to show people until it was confiscated by a teacher due to the very fact that it looked like a bomb. So don&#x27;t tell me that no one thought it was an actual bomb. That doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s not the best example for what you want to say about presumption of innocence - which I agree with you on by the way.')
