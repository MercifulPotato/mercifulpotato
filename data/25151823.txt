In the (untyped) Python ecosystem, you&#x27;re lucky to get &quot;this parameter is a file-like object&quot; even though &quot;file-like&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell you if it just supports read() and write() or also seek() or close() or truncate(). You have to dig into the source code, which likely just passes the parameter into another function which passes it into another and then across a library boundary and so on. And again, that&#x27;s the best-case scenario. Just having correct type information is 80% of the battle IMHO.')
