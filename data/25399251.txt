Stop streaming. Stop watching.<p>Fining businesses who make mistakes is a dangerous path. That means anyone new to the industry who tosses up their first project is open to getting fined if they make a mistake. It also means there is either some organization in charge of being the watchdog for the industry with power to just apply fines to companies as they see fit... or we are doing this via lawsuits which just means cranking up litigation to absurd levels.<p>No, it is better to pressure businesses via our own choices to only patronize those who treat their customers and subscribers well. We talk about it all the time on here - stop using Facebook, stop using Google, find alternatives that match your ideals.<p>We need to truly embrace those types of grassroots change if we want to drive behavioral changes.')
