Apple imposed the Developer ID code signing requirement on Mac developers a number of years ago. If you don&#x27;t sign your Mac app with a Developer ID cert, then macOS will warn about malware and refuse to launch the app when Mac users download it.<p>Almost all known Developer ID cert revocations have been for malware authors. These revocations are initiated by Apple, not requested by the (malware) developers.<p>There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about Developer ID, because people are comparing them to web site certs, but Developer ID is very different. When a Developer ID cert is revoked, all software ever signed with that cert is immediately disabled on every Mac in the world. It&#x27;s a remote kill switch. This kill switch is only used in extreme circumstances, such as malware distribution.<p>The cert owner&#x27;s desires are not really relevant to Apple. The cert is for malware prevention only. Some Mac developers would prefer to be able to distribute their software without Apple&#x27;s permission, and balk at having to pay $99 per year to Apple for code signing, but we effectively have no choice.')
