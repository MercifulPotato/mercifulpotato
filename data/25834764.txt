NATO bears some blame for what&#x27;s happening in Libya since they did side with the rebels (though I think if you want to calculate blame you should compare the current situation with what would have happened if NATO had not intervened, which still would have involved a lot of casualties). But Syria? The West&#x27;s support of the rebel movements has been token at best, and actual military support has been devoted almost entirely to ISIS and ISIS-aligned fighters.')
