Just now I checked the temperature of the water from my city water company I measured it at 8C. The current outside temperature is -1C. The water couldn&#x27;t be lower than freezing or pipes in homes would freeze.<p>I agree cold, hot, warm are all relative. Somewhat related I&#x27;ve seen people from hot countries worry about &quot;cold weather&quot;. To them ~20C is cold compared to 35C hot day and was blamed to be the cause of colds and flu. Often perpetuated in movies and TV too a tired old trope. So yes to someone in a hot country a &quot;cold&quot; shower may be considered warm to someone from a cold climate.')
