Because the only reason I&#x27;m using Disqus is because I don&#x27;t have &quot;a server&quot; that backs my website, it&#x27;s just static hosting. If I need to set up my own server just to get comments, that&#x27;s not a &quot;drop in replacement&quot;, that&#x27;s a costly (especially the hours spent on maintenance) replacement.')
