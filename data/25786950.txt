You can also use it to find all classes&#x2F;interfaces derived from a given class&#x2F;inerface - and all the classes&#x2F;interfaces derived from a given class&#x2F;interface.<p>The tool uses the asm library to scan class files and to extract annotations. it can detect annotations with retention policy CLASS and RUNTIME. It can&#x27;t detect annotations with retention policy SOURCE that are not put into bytecode, for example @Override is one of these.')
