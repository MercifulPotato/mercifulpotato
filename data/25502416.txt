Item(by='db48x', descendants=None, kids=[25504064], score=None, time=1608606436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501442, text='Ligatures do not change the value of the text field, just the visual representation of that text. Unicode does not even have a distinct character for the &quot;st&quot; ligature, and not all fonts include a glyph for it either. This is why the text is fine when you paste it elsewhere; the text includes the individual characters &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, and the app you pasted it into may request that it be rendered without ligatures. I think it&#x27;s much more likely that you really did just forget your password.<p>There are tools you can use to view the actual HTTP request sent by the browser, if you really want to take the time to set them up.
