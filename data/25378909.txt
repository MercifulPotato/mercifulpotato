I&#x27;m not sure how to open up stories if I were an internet user just passing by.<p>That&#x27;s probably by design. The stories are meant to be discovered while searching on Google. Of course a site owner should have the common sense to include a separate section on their site for stories. In most CMSs, It would be as simple as setting a &#x27;web stories&#x27; category, then adding a link to the navigation that takes them to a dynamically generated page, something like &quot;example.com&#x2F;web-stories&#x2F;&quot;')
