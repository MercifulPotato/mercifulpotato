FreeBSD also didn&#x27;t import the newest version the last time they synced because a slightly older version was faster.<p>Then FreeBSD hard forked pf and made it multithreaded.<p>Now FreeBSD&#x27;s pf is the fastest implementation of pf but is missing the latest features&#x2F;syntax and may have some bugs that were already fixed.<p>Meanwhile IPFW is still faster than pf anyway, so I don&#x27;t know why people even care.')
