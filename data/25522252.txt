Then if all works fine I don&#x27;t upgrade the kernel or driver  until I am forced and I always have the option to rollback,<p>Then when I want to try the next LTS years later I install it on a different partition and check if it works or not for my use case.<p>For my work I use Intellij , when there is a big update I get the .tag.gz and try it. If something goes wrong I still have the working version and I can go back.<p>Updating to latest and greatest was fun when I had the time and when I knew how to format the disk using &quot;fdisk&quot; and it was pleasurable to read and tweak stuff, this days I don&#x27;t care about shiny stuff and my work does not require latest libraries and I am not using any first gen of hardware.<p>So IMO if you want stability and no surprises and the ability to maybe upgrade the kernel and a driver Ubuntu is a good solution(not sure about Debian or SUSE) and also I don&#x27;t have experience with Wayland so maybe that invalidates things and is impossible to get a stable working Wayland setup.')
