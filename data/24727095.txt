Compilation is an embarrassingly parallel task. This means you can increase the number of threads by a much much larger amount before you hit Amdahl&#x27;s law. That is not true for video games unless you count what runs on GPUs. Not only can it be less obvious on what to parallelize in a game engine. You quickly start to see the parallel slowdown&#x2F;diminishing returns in game engines. Further, not every thread in video game is going to use the CPU at 100%, a lot them will be waiting on IO, and not using any time slices till that IO task is finished.<p>Games do not scale like compilation, it does not matter what engine or how new that engine is.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embarrassingly_parallel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embarrassingly_parallel</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parallel_slowdown" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parallel_slowdown</a>')
