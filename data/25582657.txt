To see that papers get written and not only that, but they are also having an impact on other research (citations).</i><p>But papers and citations are the wrong metric for accountability. What we want from government funded science is <i>models that make good predictions</i>. That&#x27;s what we need if the knowledge gained from government funded science is going to be useful to the government and the taxpayers. So that&#x27;s the metric we should use to judge it. Number of papers written and number of citations are, at best, irrelevant to that metric, and at worst, actively opposed to it; it&#x27;s much easier to generate papers and citations if they don&#x27;t have to be based on models that actually make good predictions.')
