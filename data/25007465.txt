Item(by='Udo', descendants=None, kids=[25009542], score=None, time=1604669460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007390, text='With languages as complex as modern C++, I always tend to hunt for a subset of features that makes me happy and productive, and effectively discard the rest. Compared to that, I think there is relatively little in Go that one may want to disregard, and I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s due to the fact that it&#x27;s a relatively tight featureset with practicality in mind, and is therefore easy to learn. With Rust, I&#x27;d say the experience is more subjective, but it&#x27;s still not as sprawling as C++.<p>I know it&#x27;s an unpopular opinion, but I believe personal fit in a programming language is just as important as its fitness for a purpose. I always like to check out new languages and features, but in the end I&#x27;m very likely to stick with what feels productive for me personally. If that means dropping half of a language&#x27;s features, I&#x27;ll do that, too. Chasing &quot;modernity&quot; or buzzword fads is a recipe for unhappiness in my opinion.<p>If C++ (modern or reduced) feels good and productive to you, I&#x27;d say there is nothing wrong in sticking with it.')
