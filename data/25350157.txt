A system being very well designed and implemented only attracts enthusiasts and people like that with free time. Even the &#x27;better security&#x27; aspect doesn&#x27;t convince the majority of developers. For general usage in IoT and primarily in smartphone&#x2F;tablet devices, Google would have to:<p>1. Port ART together with all of Android&#x27;s public facing APIs to Fuchsia. Evidence says they are doing it, at least for Android ART. As people say, &quot;there&#x27;s no way without Android app compatibility&quot;...<p>2. Convince OEMs to switch to Fuchsia platform instead of Linux. That I believe is under way with project Treble, or at least has a path for a possible solution. And Fuchsia&#x27;s architecture solving Linux big pain points would be a strong argument in convincing OEMs to switch. Woundn&#x27;t be easy though as drivers would have to be (re)developed or some bridge would have to be built.<p>With above done, developers would have a push to develop targeting Fuchsia natively. Then Fuchsia&#x27;s better system architecture together with security advantages would be more strongly perceived by end developers.<p>If Google managed to develop some new fancy end product on top of Fuchsia that got traction, then that process would be a lot easier for them...')
