Drunk driving is not ok, not even in remote parts of Scotland.<p>As for driving 35 in a 30 zone... I can agree that it&#x27;s not much of an issue if it&#x27;s next to a school and you drive in the middle of the night: there won&#x27;t be any children entering or leaving the school at that time. But generally, these racers drive way faster, and don&#x27;t give a fuck about any of these rules, red lights, etc. They see the roads as a racetrack. On the computer or console, they can play GTA V or whatever, I don&#x27;t care. Just if they do it in the real world they deserve harsh punishments, as the risk of killing people is so extremely high.')
