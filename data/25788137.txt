It does matter who is using it for free and profiting.</i><p>You mean to say, Facebook must share a % of its WhatsApp profits with ejabberd, or ejabberd otherwise is right to SSPL their software?<p>Or, Google pay Oracle a share of the spoils because it is an &quot;app container layer&quot; on top of Java&#x2F;JVM? And that Oracle is okay to switch to SSPL otherwise in search of those dollars?<p>Or, okay if CnFdn SSPLs k8s?<p>Also, if it matters <i>whoever</i> profits contributes back monetarily, may be the right way to do so would be via a <i>Foundation</i>.
