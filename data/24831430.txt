But if the info is correct, it&#x27;s at least interesting.<p>Another tip that could be added to the &quot;What else&quot; list is to check if a site has mobile-friendly content. For example, famously bloated CNN has <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.cnn.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.cnn.com</a>.<p>The lite.* landing page doesn&#x27;t present all the article links, but all CNN&#x27;s articles can be rendered through it by modifying the URL accordingly. Someone could probably write a plugin to do that automatically.')
