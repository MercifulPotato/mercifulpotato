Main feature is it can adjust to any room or place you put it.\nI find it bit bass heavy, though I prefer more neutral sound.\nI bought it just for listening of music while I work and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I want to get another one to pair them into stereo setup.<p>Some reviews:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flatpanelshd.com&#x2F;review.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1545383058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flatpanelshd.com&#x2F;review.php?subaction=showfull&amp;i...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2&#x2F;6&#x2F;16976906&#x2F;apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2&#x2F;6&#x2F;16976906&#x2F;apple-homepod-rev...</a>')
