I like Signal more: and I think Telegram has many useless features that are not of any interest to me and only create needless bloat at the expense of security&#x2F;privacy which is untenable, so while I hope some bugs get sorted in Signal as I run both I know why I side with Signal.<p>I also understand that Signal runs on a thin donation based hacker budget and Moxie Marlinspike&#x27;s podcast on Joe Rogan is a really cool watch that made it clear to me it&#x27;s just a hacker project that scaled really well and is in need of funding and staff. I think Joe revealed himself to be a part of the money-centric Corpo class to Moxie&#x27;s dismay when he refused to have that rock, paper, scissor match and you could see the disappointment in his eyes when Joe reacted almost offended at the idea that Moxie had anything worth his stake and could so quickly ascribe a dollar value to it.<p>It reminded me that it&#x27;s okay to care about the messenger (guest) that his podcast attracts rather than Joe or the brand he&#x27;s created around himself, even though I agree with may of his points I struggle to think its nothing more than hook or gimmick most times. I don&#x27;t really enjoy any of his standup and find a lot of his quips to be childish and immature reactions to what seem like feckless attention grabbing that can derail a guest&#x27;s conversation or train of thought, much like uninvited fart jokes would amongst otherwise fascinating discussion and in depth arguments: then again he is a comedian first and foremost.<p>With all that said, donate to help get those fixes on Signal sorted here [0]!<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;donate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;donate&#x2F;</a>')
