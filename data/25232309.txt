Creating them in such a quality (and not some sketchy animation or a re-cut of existing work) is still a challenge today. You need half-decent actors.<p>But is this core to the value? I find a lot of the animated versions, Ken Burns, and stock footage on Youtube to be way more than good enough. It&#x27;s exactly as you said: It&#x27;s about the content.<p>&gt; Just because paper and ink got much cheaper since the 16th century, we didn&#x27;t suddenly produce a Shakespeare every 2 years.<p>We kinda did, actually. He&#x27;s hidden among a massive pile of stuff, but he&#x27;s there. Brilliant books come out far more frequently than I can read. I&#x27;d place many well above Shakespeare, not in fame, but in quality.<p>&gt; So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any historical documentation on YouTube which even compares to the depth and width of &quot;Connections&quot;.<p>My favorites are Extra History (history) and 3Blue1Brown (math). I think both have at least the same depth and width, albeit in a different direction.')
