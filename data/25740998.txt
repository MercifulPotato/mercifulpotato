Amazingly good English banter from a German and Russian.  In general, the individual personalities of Nations comes through really well in chess commentary, since commentators are from all over the place, are quite sharp, and everyone is talking about the same thing in usually the same language (English).  I didnâ€™t even know Germans and Russians had a sense of humor...<p>ICC is an old (in Internet terms) established website.')
