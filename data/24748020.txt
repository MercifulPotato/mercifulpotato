Because sex is the largest difference between human beings. Its importance is highlighted by doctors needing to know for better treatment, for social circles not being comfortable around people further away from your group. Bathrooms being a painpoint as it has deep roots in culture and history. Though the interesting thing about which bathroom to go to, it becomes irrelivant the moment you enter someone&#x27;s home; there is only one or two to choose from and they are &quot;Gender neutral&quot; by design.<p>&gt;Will you be fired for wearing a dress when your boss sees you as a man?\nThis is exactly my point, discrimination based on immutable characteristics is wrong. if your boss fires you because you&#x27;re a man or sees you as a man, or makes judgements because you&#x27;re a woman pretending to be a man is wrong by design because it is still based on immutable characterstics. Though dress code violation is such a grey area as it is not directly based on strong legal precedent.<p>&gt;If you are forced to put your biological sex on the application form, what if your new workplace outs you as &quot;a man&quot;\n&quot;IF&quot; you are forced to do so. I&#x27;ve never seen it be mandatory. unless you talk about exeptions to the rule. Like how some women&#x27;s shelters only hire women. or gynecologists.<p>&gt;will they ostracize you, call the police, or exact violence on you because you don&#x27;t fit in their worldview of acceptable behavior?\nNonetheless, anti-discrimination laws aren&#x27;t there to stop discrimination or stop people from breaking the law. They are there to put them on trial. Lots of people fall out of a certain worldview and have lost jobs and friends because of that. talk to any clean heroin addict and they&#x27;ll tell you. These things certainly matter and should be discussed as you are so kind to do.<p>I guess my approach is more conservative when it comes to enacting change in how people are treating each other. I consider no solution better than a bad solution. as no solution at least lets people have the freedom to treat eachother with the respect that they might deserve.')
