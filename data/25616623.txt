Because 40~100k cores isn&#x27;t Google scale either it also doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to invest in custom silicon.<p>There&#x27;s a huge I&#x2F;O bottleneck as well as you&#x27;re reading huge textures (I&#x27;ve seen textures as big as 1 TB) and writing constantly to disk the result of the renderer.<p>Other than that, most of the tooling that modern studios use is off the shelf, for example, Autodesk Maya for Modelling or Sidefx Houdini for Simulations. If you had a custom architecture then you would have to ensure that every piece of software you use is optimized &#x2F; works with that.<p>There are studios using GPUs for some workflows but most of it is CPUs.')
