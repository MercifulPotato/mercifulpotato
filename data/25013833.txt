That was enough for me to learn that I will never buy any product from them ever again.<p>These kind of &quot;we need to trick money out of you&quot; methods are not limited to their printers. The one HP notebook that I installed half a decade ago was the worst bloated system I have ever seen.<p>Only their displays seem to be not cursed by that plague — yet.<p>It is too sad that there is no reasonable open hardware printer, so for now brother laserprinters will have to do. Costs &lt;100€, toner cost per page is low and the thing runs for a decade (in my case) without weird issues.')
