In these covid times I&#x27;ve rented a small private office very close to the house where I can hole up and concentrate (I have a younger child so silence isn&#x27;t happening at home).<p>I turn off all notifications from every possible source. No emails, no slack, no phone. (My phone is always 100% on mute for everything, except calls from my wife in case there&#x27;s an emergency).<p>Maybe most importantly, I take 20-30 minutes in the evening to make a plan on what to work on the next day. In the morning I just work on what I pre-planned. I will not check email or slack or anything at all until I&#x27;ve done 3-4 hours of solid work. Only then I&#x27;ll check email in case there&#x27;s anything new to care about. As soon as I check these communications the day tends to go downhill on distractions from dozens of discussion threads so I won&#x27;t get anything else done in the day. But I banked in those 3-4 hours in the morning on progress.<p>When times are slow, sure, I&#x27;ll check email&#x2F;slack in the morning and won&#x27;t get anything done all day.')
