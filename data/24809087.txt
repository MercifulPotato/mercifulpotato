This is true in any language and if people do not watch for it their library landscape turns into a hot mess quickly. Take Python.<p>But the thing is, I believe that in many applications, C++ does not make it easier to build serious things. It adds complexity and when working on large-scale stuff, you need extra complexity as much as a hole in the head.')
