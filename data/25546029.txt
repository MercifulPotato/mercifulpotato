This is a driver with a history of reckless driving who was screwing around with his friend.<p>But because he was screwing around in a <i>Tesla</i> it is therefore newsworthy.<p>The seats were reclined, but there is no evidence that the driver and passenger were both asleep. They “appeared asleep” because the seats were reclined.<p>This was undoubtably a stupid prank. I’ll be glad for the day when kids can’t pull stupid pranks in their cars. The trade-off is we’re unlikely to truly “own” our own cars at that time, they will operate as essentially private taxis.')
