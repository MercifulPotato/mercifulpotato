A small amount of people can hurt you.  If we park the PKI argument, only the owner of the server can attack you.  The problem here is, the server owner can specifically detect your behaviour, and take advantage of your trust.<p>language specific - _generally_ you&#x27;re pulling a hash from a repository that&#x27;s public and many people can and do audit.  You can&#x27;t be spot served a slightly different, malicious version of a file, without it first being published for others to see.  This means the vendor risks their reputation with this kind of attack, and you&#x27;re likely to find out about it at some point down the line.<p>Obviously reality is slightly more complicated, but if your language package manager is relatively modern, pulls and checks via hash, and offers up a .lock file functionality, then it&#x27;s quite a bit different from a curl http(s) | bash.')
