And you think you&#x27;re tasting enough of a difference to say one is horrible and one is amazing? Because the hot water and the ground coffee interacted slightly differently(?) between contraptions?<p>I do this test for all of my friends and they all fail. Unless it&#x27;s the moka pot or french press because the lack of filter has you picking soot from your teeth. Those cups always rank last.<p>Not to derail the thread. But I seriously think you should do a blind test with someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing. Just for fun.<p>My theory is that it&#x27;s 75% placebo of having a coffee gimmick that everyone else is missing out on, and 25% the fact that an aeropress or whatever finally got someone to measure coffee grounds and time it for once instead of dumping a random amount of grounds into a drip filter and then drinking it when it&#x27;s been sitting on the burner for  3 hours.')
