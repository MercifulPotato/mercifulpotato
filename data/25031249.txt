The one I hear most frequently is that the electoral college is outdated and should be replaced on that basis alone. The second one is that it is undemocratic and allows disproportionate representation to small state voters. The third one that I believe underlies the two previous is that when the popular vote has been contradicted by the electoral college, it typically has elected someone from the &quot;wrong party&quot; depending on who you ask. Looking at the states in the popular vote compact there is some truth to that.')
