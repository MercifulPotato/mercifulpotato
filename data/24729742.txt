On the other hand, it&#x27;s easy to architect a system too shortsightedly such that any modification is difficult to do.<p>The best approach I&#x27;ve seen from technical leaders is to use new feature sets&#x2F;initiatives that come from the business as an opportunity to clear up technical debt in the process. That way, you can guarantee that the architectural direction you&#x27;re taking is aligned with business needs and that you&#x27;re not wasting time on unnecessary improvements.')
