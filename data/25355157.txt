Not so much the Javascript aspect, although I&#x27;ve always viewed JS with the &quot;less is more&quot; mentality myself. I understand that it&#x27;s become a critical part of the web, so that&#x27;s not really where I agree with you.<p>I agree with you more on the &quot;breaking things that used to work perfectly fine.&quot; To me this has nothing to do with &quot;accessibility.&quot; If I recall correctly, a couple years ago the header was white, then they changed it to grey.<p>While I feel like giving users more theme options and more control over their UI is the right direction to go in and one that adds value, I can&#x27;t help but think that this is just the design team keeping themselves busy&#x2F;valid.<p>I followed their design team on social media for a brief period until I realized that all they do is hold senseless confs with the same people over and over again to discuss the same things over and over again. None of them have real code in their repos, just markdown and HTML and stylesheets. None of them contribute to 3rd party projects. Then they iterate something nobody was complaining about.
