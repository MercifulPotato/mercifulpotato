My license plate is indeed public information, should someone follow me around and document evertything I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m fine with that as the amount of resources required to perform this far outweighs any potential gains. When It&#x27;s automated by computers It&#x27;s very cheap.

Completely unaware that they&#x27;re tracking every purchase she makes because of her membership card.')
