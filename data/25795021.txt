If a heat pump were used the efficiency might not be TOO bad.  The per-energy cost of such a system could be an order of magnitude less than batteries.<p>One interesting side of this is that it admits extremely cheap &quot;assurance&quot; storage.  That is: if one has a fuel to heat the thermal store when needed, then this can provide an assured source of power in the event of very rare prolonged outages that deplete the usual store.  The marginal capital cost of adding this capability could be a factor of 3 less than that of providing dedicated gas turbines (using hydrogen, say) for that assurance.')
