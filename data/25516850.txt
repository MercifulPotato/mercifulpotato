Uber was my favorite example... years of never-profit, but rather multiple higher rounds of funding and then IPO.<p>But at least in the case of Tesla, they not only have managed to build actual cars that sell well, but more importantly they are a battery company. This last bit is probably a big part of their future valuation.')
