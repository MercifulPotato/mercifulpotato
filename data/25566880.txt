Animal cafe for lost pets? Handing blankets out to homeless people? Planting trees? How many of these jobs do you think are needed in the world?<p>I mean, if you are really into this stuff, nobody prevents you from going down this road... If not, then the main concern is this:<p>Do I like my job? When I wake up, do I think about what I was stuck on last evening and how am I going to tackle this? If you wake up thinking &quot;Oh fuck, I need to work&quot;, yeah then that&#x27;s a bullshit job for sure. But even then, I don&#x27;t see how more than 1% or 10% of the population could have a job they enjoy. Work needs to be done, most of it is boring, dirty and doesn&#x27;t earn money.<p>Until that changes, this is how it will be. No point in crying after it, just think about where you want to position yourself in this system.<p>Not to mention that this whole discussion brings us back to the question: Who&#x27;s fault is it that people die? The arms researchers or manufacturers? The army? The people who are mean to us and own resources we want (I mean they could just surrender)?<p>Are the people building Facebook responsible for the social decline? Or is it the government, not applying proper regulation&#x2F;laws? Or is it the people using Facebook (nobody is forcing you)? Or are humans just like this and Facebook shows us their true color?')
