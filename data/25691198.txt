If you&#x27;d like, we can talk about my comment and try to see if we can find any agreement or not.<p>It is true that 30+ people died, some of them from police, some, of them from being shot and murdered (chop&#x2F;chaz&#x2F;portland), some by other means. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that many people died as a direct result of ongoing chaos and anarchy that was largely dismissed as justifiable by the most prominent news organizations and pundits (cnn, nyt, wapo). Two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right, we need to disavow all violent protests across the board and stop with double standards.<p>What do you disagree with?')
