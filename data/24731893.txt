Just last week I was looking for a ceiling lamp but couldn&#x27;t really find anything I wanted. I finally found one that I liked by seeing it in an ad that was obviously targeted.<p>It was nice to not having to actively go through the hundreds of pages of lamps and instead get presented a few different ones in each ad group now and then, as a break in my usual feed. The drip exposure also made me contemplate each one in isolation instead of being overwhelmed.<p>What I don&#x27;t like is that I keep getting ads for lamps now after I&#x27;ve already bought it.')
