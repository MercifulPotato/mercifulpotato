I&#x27;d sit in front of both options for a little and see what you think.<p>The top quality I look for in a programming monitor is <i>contrast ratio</i>. For me a good contrast ratio has a huge effect on text readability and eye strain.<p>Panel type matters for contrast ratio. There are really three types in common use: IPS, VA, and TN. I&#x27;ve had great luck with VA panels which are not as well liked by gamers due to somewhat slower refresh but have great contrast ratios. I don&#x27;t personally notice good VA panels looking &quot;slow.&quot; High-quality IPS panels are good too of course. TN panels are very fast and usually are the cheapest but they also tend to have the worst contrast ratio. I&#x27;d avoid them for programming.<p>Beware of over-exaggerated contrast ratio numbers. Look at reviews and third party measurements if you can find them.<p>I have a Benq 30&quot; 4K VA panel monitor right now for my primary and it&#x27;s pretty good. Had a Samsung curved VA panel monitor a while ago that was also great but I don&#x27;t think they make them anymore and mine broke (due to being dropped, not burning out).')
