It can simply mean financial and overall governing independence. OP&#x27;s point is not that Taiwan is better than China, but to point out that Chinese people can do well without CCP and this is what CCP doesn&#x27;t want people to know. Also Taiwanese economy has many sections from CCP so I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;ll do well above current standards without them')
