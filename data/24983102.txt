Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with the progress.<p>I&#x27;ve run about ten thousand builds now and find the biggest issue the mysterious cancelling of jobs (especially on Win&#x2F;Macos host), crashing of jobs across the board during GH outages, and the intermittent long pauses (e.g. 15min) between jobs in a multi-job build when nothing appears to happen (scheduling delays). GH could have more clarity on the status board, since I&#x27;ll see many jobs fail, and check the status page to see everything is green. :&#x2F;')
