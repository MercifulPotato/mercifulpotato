The goal isn’t just to lift people up, it’s to mentally bring everyone else down.<p>It may seem like that at first, but carry it to the logical conclusion.  Assuming one does have imposter syndrome and isn&#x27;t just incompetent:<p>1. Other people in your field are not as highly skilled or immune from mistakes as you think<p>2. You are not as far below them as you think<p>3. Their amazing accomplishments, which had convinced you of their inhuman skill and your incompetence, <i>are still amazing</i>.  And how can you call somebody who achieves amazing things incompetent?<p>4. So, if there&#x27;s less distance between you and them than you thought, the only explanation is that you&#x27;re not as incompetent as you thought.<p>&gt;Instead, we should be giving people skills to accurately self-assess without tying current abilities to their self-worth<p>Is it any better to tie self-worth to future abilities?  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad idea, but it might just be delaying the problem.')
