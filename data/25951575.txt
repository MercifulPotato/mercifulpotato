I think public markets are more important than most folks believe.<p>I do believe that frequent trading is a good thing, as is retail participation in markets. One of the amplifiers of income inequality, I suspect, in the past few decades has been the fact that high-growth companies that normally would have gone public sooner have stayed private for longer, denying participation from the public market.<p>For example, a well chosen index of Dot Com stocks that included Amazon, Google, E-Bay etc. picked in 1998 would have, provided there was continuous investment and a long-hold, injected a large amount of capital back into the public and retirement systems, which would have helped lift all boats so to speak.<p>AMZN was originally at around $4&#x2F;share (adjusted for splits, provided this data source is correct, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;amazon&#x2F;stock-price-history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;amazon&#x2F;stock-...</a> ), if you had bought 1k stocks of the company in pre-2000, and held until now. Your originally $4k position would be worth 3.2M.<p>That&#x27;s quite crazy. And it&#x27;s retirement money for a lot of people.<p>Amazon&#x27;s growth has occurred in the public, giving retail investors the ability to tap into the formation of new wealth. SpaceX&#x27;s, AirBNB&#x27;s, DropBox&#x27;s etc hasn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re playthings of the well heeled. Not the gumshoes.<p>We need to re-orient public markets in such a way that everyone gets to participate in wealth creation. Not restrict it even further.')
