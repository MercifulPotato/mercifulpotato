Item(by='stephenr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611173860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835436, text='&gt; unfortunately rich people get away with injustice. If a rich person has done something wrong to poor person, the family feels like they have no choice but to accept monetary compensation instead of seeking justice by law.<p>This cuts both ways. There’s now an <i>expectation</i> from a lot of predominantly poor Thai’s that if they are involved in a traffic incident with a larger vehicle, the driver of the other vehicle owes them compensation, regardless of fault or circumstance.<p>This is not an urban legend, or rare occurrence. I’ve experienced it personally. When you add in the corrupt police, who upon learning the car is insured, try to pressure the driver to just admit fault because they want a cut of the compensation  money, you end up in a weird scenario where you have more trust in the fucking insurance rep than the police.<p>I still don’t know what’s more shocking: the outright lies from the police, or the sister of the guy on the motorcycle complaining - in a hospital hallway - that they “won’t get any money till he dies”.<p>I’m sure rich assholes get away with plenty here, but poor assholes try to milk the system and Thai culture just as much.<p>Edit: brain fart, reference was to his sister not her brother.')
