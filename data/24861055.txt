The reason for this is that you can discharge batteries much faster than you can charge them.<p>Also, it seems like you&#x27;re imagining that you can charge batteries with more power if you charge them in parallel instead of series. This isn&#x27;t true since you&#x27;re just trading a higher  voltage&#x2F;lower current for a lower voltage&#x2F;higher current.')
