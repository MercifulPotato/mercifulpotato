Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=[25179245], score=None, time=1606052087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173426, text='&gt; Existence of tooling in one manufacturer lab doesn&#x27;t make something not &quot;bricked&quot;.<p>I didn&#x27;t say otherwise. Again you&#x27;re attacking the idea that &#x27;permanently broken&#x27; is meaningful.<p>You&#x27;ve shifted from attacking the term &#x27;permanently broken&#x27; as unworkably imprecise, to attacking it as unknowable. Neither holds water. In real-word use, we just make do. It&#x27;s not practical to give perfectly precise legalistic definitions.<p>We&#x27;d all agree that a severely water-damaged smartphone counts as permanently broken, and as bricked, regardless of whether it would be possible in principle for the device to be repaired at great expense.<p>&gt; Releasing that stuff to the public makes it &quot;soft bricked&quot;.<p>I agree that the availability of tooling can impact whether we consider something permanently broken. A failed hard-disk in an old games console might be enough to write off the whole machine, if the machine is hostile to replacement hard-disks and official repair services are no longer available (and their special tooling&#x2F;software not made public). A failed hard-disk in a desktop computer, though, can easily be replaced.<p>&gt; definitely somewhere murky on this spectrum<p>Again, of course there are edge cases. This is true of just about any categorisation we use, outside of mathematics. To refer back to my earlier example, it&#x27;s not possible to give perfectly precise definitions of <i>chair</i> and <i>table</i>, but this doesn&#x27;t much matter, the terms are still useful.')
