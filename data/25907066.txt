I&#x27;ve hard that people still say to use the capture card with that anyway. I have a decent mic, but I&#x27;m still using the kind of crappy logitech webcam because I couldn&#x27;t decide between all the camera options that all seemed to have tradeoffs (lumix gh5, lumix g100, sony a7siii, sony zv1, etc.)<p>If you&#x27;d be willing to break some of those down in a comment I&#x27;d really appreciate it. Why is the a6400 the right choice? what lens is best for remote work and why? Is the ring light better than key lights? Why prefer one of the other?<p>Thanks!')
