Do you assume that there exist (or someone could produce with today&#x27;s technology) sensors that are &quot;objectively&quot; better that the current phone sensors?<p>In my opinion the limiting factor in phone cameras is the size. Of course, for a given size a cheap, crappy sensor will give crappy results. But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that sensors used in flagship phones are actually pretty close to the state of the art.<p>The issue with the size is that if you increase it for the sensor, you&#x27;re going to have to increase it for the optics. In an era where manufacturers are convinced we want paper-thin devices, they&#x27;re going to have to choose the one over the other.')
