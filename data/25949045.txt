My impression is that &quot;we only hire A players&quot; is considered to be kind of a running joke. Interview processes seem, from a safe distance, to be dystopian. In addition, there seems to be an article every week on &quot;hiring is broken&quot; and an entire ecosystem of startups trying to solve that problem.<p><i>Yet somehow firms do OK with the people they manage to hire</i>.<p>So maybe firms could just be less fearful of hiring, attract equal talent, and get on with life.<p>I doubt that I&#x27;d be considered an A player. My employer already makes productive use of talent in the Midwest, but we are not predominantly a software company.')
