I don&#x27;t like all the excess complexity that comes from its unsurpassably enterprise-grade level of configurability. I don&#x27;t like being trapped behind a distressingly awkward FFI. I don&#x27;t like being required to adjust control levers for aspects of memory usage I&#x27;d rather be automatic, while simultaneously having little ability to control the aspects of memory usage that matter to me. I don&#x27;t like having Java&#x27;s half-baked type model hiding just under the surface no matter what language I choose, just waiting for a chance to jump scare me. et cetera.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, other platforms have their problems, too. Oftentimes they&#x27;re even more of a headache. But at least they&#x27;re <i>different</i> headaches. Yes, I like to program for fun, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t like a change of pace on the weekends.')
