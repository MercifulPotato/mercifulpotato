(Anyone who sells dumb non-approved investments without requiring this certificate from buyers goes to prison.) \n&gt; To get that certificate, you sign a form. The form is one page with a lot of white space. It says in very large letters: “I want to buy a dumb investment. I understand that the person selling it will almost certainly steal all my money, and that I would almost certainly be better off just buying index funds, but I want to do this dumb thing anyway. I agree that I will never, under any circumstances, complain to anyone when this investment inevitably goes wrong. I understand that violating this agreement is a felony.” \n&gt; Then you take the form to an SEC employee, who slaps you hard across the face and says “really???” And if you reply “yes really” then she gives you the certificate.\nThen you bring the certificate to the seller and you can buy whatever dumb thing he is selling.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-09-24&#x2F;earning-the-right-to-get-swindled" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-09-24&#x2F;earnin...</a>')
