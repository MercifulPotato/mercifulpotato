I understand not every company can afford to do Basecamp&#x27;s &quot;pay everyone SF wages&quot; thing, but any company can afford to set uniform pay grades at some level and one would think that the equal pay for equal work principle should apply here. One should neither receive a big city subsidy nor have their pay cut for choosing to live somewhere else.')
