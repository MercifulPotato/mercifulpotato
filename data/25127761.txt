If person A has pushed and nobody else has pulled, then for most situations there&#x27;s no reason to prevent A from un-pushing. Even if person B has pulled, a propagating un-push might well be what they want. I generally would. There are certainly some cases where B might not want that, but given that undoability is a has become a strong user expectation, I don&#x27;t have particular reason to believe that balancing users needs would come out in favor of the current behavior.')
