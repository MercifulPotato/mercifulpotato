Governance models aren&#x27;t (generally) exciting, but they&#x27;re really important for _mature_ projects that grow beyond the original developer or team. The ASF provides things like:<p>- A contribution model that allows for clarity around copyright ownership<p>- A nonprofit that makes it easy for individuals and companies to interface with<p>- Clear rules around project ownership and decision making that are oriented for _community_ ownership as opposed to ownership&#x2F;sponsorship by a specific company or individual.<p>That last point is what particularly distinguishes the ASF from organizations like the Linux Foundation which is more suitable for direct corporate involvement.<p>As a truly community driven organization, the ASF doesn&#x27;t have an agenda or policy to pick and choose which projects join. We don&#x27;t go hunting for popular projects, we don&#x27;t have a portfolio we need to fill out. Any community of developers is invited to join as long as they agree with our principles. So that means we get everything from an open source project being &quot;donated&quot; out of some company to a scrappy group of developers trying to grow their project.<p>As for Java, that&#x27;s a historical point in that many critical open source Java projects in the early 2000&#x27;s found their home in Apache. And while the ASF tends to have projects that fit the &quot;internet middleware&quot; shape, we have communities that range from desktop software to core libraries in diverse range of languages.')
