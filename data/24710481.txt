Cast iron even better.<p>that&#x27;s misleading if not outright wrong.<p>the counterpart to nonstick is not cast iron or stainless steel -- it&#x27;s carbon steel. carbon steel pans compare well to nonstick when seasoned (good woks are still carbon steel, and you can still find good carbon steel skillet pans, just not by lodge).')
