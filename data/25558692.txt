The skilled people are less incentivized to move (the in-demand skills guarantee somewhat decent living in most places on Earth), while for unskilled people from poorest countries migrating can be about baseline survival, so the motivation is very strong. Also, the unskilled people are more welcome in the target country, as they do the worst jobs for the least money [1], which basically increases everybody&#x27;s standard of living.<p>[1] For example, there would be serious problems in the German society if not for Eastern European immigrants who take care of millions of older people for pennies.
