Sadly recent versions of thunderbird seem to default to this as well, but an extension fixes that.<p>The problem for most users is that they won&#x27;t recognise people&#x27;s email addresses as signal - it&#x27;s just noise to them. They don&#x27;t know how to parse a domain backwards from TLD&#x2F;ccTLD to determine where it goes, and even if they did, homographs and other international characters can fool them fairly easily.<p>Maybe the solution is something like SSH with trust on first use? Where users get alerted to a new display name and are asked to approve it the first time they send an email. Then a bundle of sender email, DKIM&#x2F;DMARC&#x2F;SPF success is stored locally, and future emails need to match that, otherwise the user will be warned this might not be the right user.<p>It seems without cryptographic identities (vouched for through PKI, a la S&#x2F;MIME) that this is a hard problem to solve when you take into account the human factors and how much the existing solutions rely on the user.')
