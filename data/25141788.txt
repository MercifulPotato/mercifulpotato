It&#x27;s limited to the usefulness of wearing surgical mask to protect the wearer.<p>There is lots of evidence that wearing mask protects others, that&#x27;s why surgeons wear surgical masks during surgery.<p>Surgical masks are not intended to protect the wearer, you need medical respirator for that. The question is how effective they are in doing job they are not designed to do. It seems to be limited, maybe around 30-50% depending on the study.')
