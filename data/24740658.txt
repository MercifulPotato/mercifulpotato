In particular, there are a lot of nonfree things that are in the core Arch repos that Ubuntu and Fedora don&#x27;t tend to include. I tended to need things that weren&#x27;t in the repos at least as often on Ubuntu as I do on Arch, but had to use either third-party PPAs or compile from source to get them.')
