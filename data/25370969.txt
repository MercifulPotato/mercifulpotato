Purchased the game on Steam, and ran it using Proton experimental (a version you can pick via Steam settings &gt; Steam play &gt; Run other titles with: &quot;Proton experimental&quot;). Running with a prior version of Proton throws a Qt error.<p>- The announcement mentions AMD cards but I have an NVIDIA GPU card and it worked just fine. I used the NVIDIA driver version 455.<p>- Changing graphics settings or switching windows cause major graphical artifacts, which are fixed restarting the game.<p>- Noticeable sound glitches sometimes, but the game is playable. Tried adjusting pulseaudio priority, a trick that helps with these kinds of issues sometimes, but it didn&#x27;t work.<p>- Performance is more than OK for me, and I am not using 2020 hardware. I wouldn&#x27;t try running on 4k + high graphic settings unless you have a high-end box.<p>- During these 3 hours, the game crashed twice.')
