Item(by='tinco', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609245750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568703, text='Domain specific languages just didn&#x27;t settle at the level we expected. We thought they would be for really narrow domains, like a language for each kind of business logic. But instead the domains are more at the architecture level and some very broad purpose (i.e. HTML, SQL, etc).<p>At my company, we use Ruby for web backend and system administration. We use Typescript for web frontend. We use C# for process automation. We use Rust and C++ for real time performance (we&#x27;ve got an in house 3D engine), and a little bit of high performance processing. We use Python for data processing and machine learning.<p>That&#x27;s six &quot;general purpose&quot; languages, each applied to a specific domain, on six software developers, in three teams of two. Each happy with their choice of languages, effectively solving the business needs.<p>I think at some point in the past this situation was described as a nightmare. But I think at that point people thought developers were something you just opened a tin can of, and then applied to whatever problem you had. Nowadays we hire for a specific purpose (or at least I do). When I hire web dev experts, I expect them to be fluent in the industry standard web programming languages and platforms of our choice (i.e. for us it&#x27;d be Ruby and Typescript). When I hire 3D experts I expect them to be fluent in C++, and proficient in Rust (it&#x27;s the future). And obviously it&#x27;s Python for the data science types.<p>That&#x27;s a very clear world to me, and to be extra clear, I&#x27;m not saying any of the languages I mentioned are the best choice. As long as we operate within the lines the industries have drawn, you can draw upon the best libraries and ecosystems for your particular problem. I would never approve a 3D engine to be developed in Ruby, or a data science pipeline in Javascript. I&#x27;d rather have a Ruby developer learn some Python so they&#x27;d be able to work on the data science pipeline (disregarding their complaints about Python&#x27;s inelegance) than have them trying to kludge together subpar Ruby libraries.')
