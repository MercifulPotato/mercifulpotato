According to the benchmark, the M1 has a 3.2GHz base frequency.<p>&gt; The  Mac mini  with M1 chip that was benchmarked earned a single-core score of 1682 and a multi-core score of 7067.<p>&gt; Update: There&#x27;s also a benchmark for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 chip and 16GB RAM that has a single-core score of 1714 and a multi-core score of 6802. Like the  MacBook Air , it has a 3.2GHz base frequency.<p>So single core we have: Air 1687, Mini 1682, Pro 1714<p>And multi core we have: Air 7433, Mini 7067, Pro 6802<p>Iâ€™m not sure what to make of these scores, but it seems wrong that the Mini and Pro significantly underperform the Air in multi core. I find it hard to imagine this benchmark is going to be representative of actual usage given the way the products are positioned, which makes it hard to know how seriously to take the comparisons to other products too.<p>&gt; When compared to existing devices, the M1 chip in the  MacBook Air  outperforms all iOS devices. For comparison&#x27;s sake, the iPhone 12 Pro earned a single-core score of 1584 and a multi-core score of 3898, while the highest ranked iOS device on Geekbench&#x27;s charts, the A14 iPad Air, earned a single-core score of 1585 and a multi-core score of 4647.<p>This seems a bit odd too - the A14 iPad Air outperforms all iPad Pro devices?')
