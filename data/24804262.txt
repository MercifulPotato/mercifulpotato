The smoke issue is new but it&#x27;s unlikely to be this bad most years. Detroit is unfriendly a much greater portion of the year<p>It&#x27;s likely the craziness in the Bay will subside but I would be extremely shocked if it began to resemble Ddetroit. Some of the more remote suburbs that haven&#x27;t historically been places people would commute from might fare badly though.')
