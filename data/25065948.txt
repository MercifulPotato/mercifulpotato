To have a 2x or 4x M1s would require interconnects between the CPUs for sharing RAM and general communication, which isn&#x27;t there on the M1 currently. So at a minimum you&#x27;re talking a rev of M1 to add such interconnects. But that all seems very unlikely. If they do go that route it&#x27;d almost certainly be something like AMD&#x27;s chiplets instead of just straight &quot;multi-socket&quot;')
