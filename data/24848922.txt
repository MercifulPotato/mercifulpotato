Is that really productive? What do you get out of it?<p>You also make some strange technical remarks. Julia does not allow &quot;arbitrary subclassing&quot; (or typing). It doesn&#x27;t allow subtyping at all, except for of abstract types. In fact, composition is the preferred approach in Julia, and frequently held up as preferable to inheritance in general.<p>As for your preference that it&#x27;s better to have good performance for only some selected parts of the language, in stead of good performance in general, that seems so idiosyncratic that I&#x27;d like a better explanation. It&#x27;s hard to tell if you are serious.')
