Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25232628], score=None, time=1606509384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232221, text='&gt;It is possible for a Black person to feel discriminated against because of their race even when such discrimination has not occurred.<p>This explanation&#x27;s believability has an inverse relationship with the number of claims.  I could buy the idea that a couple people perceived &quot;normal annoying work crap&quot; as discrimination, but would that happen 15 times?  75% of the Black employees left the company in a 6 month window.  You don&#x27;t see anything like that at any other company.')
