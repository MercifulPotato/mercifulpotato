But fish have no conception of EEZ boundaries and the moment they wander outside they&#x27;re free game for Chinese DWF fleets. From China&#x27;s view, if foreign countries want big EEZs, they can shoulder the cost of maintaining the fishing grounds inside.<p>Looks like the real solution is to genetically modify fish so they always stay within 200 nm of land.')
