From &quot;Major Linux Problems on the Desktop, 2020 edition&quot;[0]:<p><pre><code>  - Applications (or GUI toolkits) must implement their own font antialiasing - there&#x27;s no API for setting system-wide font rendering. Most sane and advanced windowing systems work exactly this way - Windows, Android, Mac OS X. In Wayland all clients (read applications) are totally independent.\n\n  - Applications (or GUI toolkits) must implement their own DPI scaling.\n\n  The above issues are actually the result of not having one unified graphical toolkit&#x2F;API (and Wayland developers will not implement it). Alas, no one is currently working towards making existing toolkits share one common configuration for setting font antialiasing, DPI scaling and windows shadowing. At least in theory these issues can be easily solved, in practice we already have three independent toolkits for Wayland (GTK3&#x2F;Qt5&#x2F;Enlightenment).\n\n  - Wayland works through rasterization of pixels which brings about two very bad critical problems which will never be solved:\n\n  Firstly, forget about performance&#x2F;bandwidth efficient RDP protocol (it&#x27;s already implemented but it works by sending the updates of large chunks of the screen, i.e. a lot like old highly inefficient VNC), forget about OpenGL pass-through, forget about raw compressed video pass-through. In case you&#x27;re interested all these features work in Microsoft&#x27;s RDP.\n\n  Secondly, forget about proper output rotation&#x2F;scaling&#x2F;ratio change.\n</code></pre>\n[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itvision.altervista.org&#x2F;why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itvision.altervista.org&#x2F;why.linux.is.not.ready.for.t...</a>')
