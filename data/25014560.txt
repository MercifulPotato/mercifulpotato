But he is still accountable to an agreement between him and workers. He can&#x27;t do &quot;whatever he wants&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t really true for most large firms. Since people are dependent on their wages, they are generally subjects to their boss&#x27; whims. You just have to look at Amazon workers wearing diapers to realize that workers don&#x27;t generally get a say, even if they are not technically slaves.')
