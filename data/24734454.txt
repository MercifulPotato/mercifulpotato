Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602277673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732860, text='&gt; should all of that surplus value only be captured by the technology owners?<p>No, and neither is that the case. The increased profit is the wage the technology earns for the investor who wisely chose to make a successful investment. Other investors made different, less wise automation decisions and in so doing, earned less (or negative) profit.<p>The remainder of the surplus value is captured by the consumer who now has available to him or her a greater variety of higher quality products at lower prices. They capture this value when they go to market and get more better and newer things.<p>&gt; What about the people who build and service the technology which allows these improvements to be implemented?<p>They are typically more skilled workers who get paid more because they are performing a higher skilled job. The old way of doing things was less productive and required less skill from the workers. The new way is more productive and requires greater investments in capital and skilled labor.')
