Rightly or wrongly, these people just want to see much less centralized moderation. And they feel unherd and oppressed (again regardless of whether that&#x27;s actually true, that&#x27;s what they experience and feel).<p>They see things in a more absolutist free speech lens, meaning any content that is legal should be allowed. And they don&#x27;t see platforms as being responsible for moderation. They view centralized moderation as inherently biased and illegitimate. If they can&#x27;t or wont allow legal speech, then they think 230 should be repealed and these sites should cease to exist.<p>They are reacting to takedowns from social media sites, SaaS providers, IaaS providers, and financial services because they view these sites as an oligopoly acting in unison to bar them from the basic infrastructure of modern life. Imagine if typewriter companies ganged up to stop selling to right leaning newspapers and authors. Or, imagine if telegraph companies said they wouldn&#x27;t transmit messages for Abraham Lincon.<p>On 230, they see social media sites as a monopoly due to network effects. Also&#x2F;alternatively they talk about a bait-and-switch, where the social media sites held themselves out as public squares when they were small. But once they were big, they started enforcing their views.<p>Generally, I think people are failing to put themselves in a Trump supporter&#x27;s shoes. Imagine you genuinely believed that the election was stolen. The court cases were almost all dismissed on standing and laches. From their perspective, no one will substantively address their videos, affidavits, statistical anomalies, etc.<p>And when they protest, people call them violent insurrectionists, despite all year BLM doing very similar things (again from their perspective).')
