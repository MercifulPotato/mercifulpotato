As you say, once your base facts about reality differ there&#x27;s really no hope for reconciliation about things at a higher level than that. And for all the healthy spirit of &quot;both-sides-ism&quot; in this thread, I will put it out there that there is one side that has egregiously allowed it and its supporters to become detached from reality. Note I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;bias&quot; here which both sides certainly exhibit, but concrete basic verifiable facts of reality. I really don&#x27;t see how much can be achieved if we can&#x27;t repair that. And as much as I want to encourage a new spirit of unity, I fear that if that becomes an excuse to not confront this problem, then it will actually just make things worse.')
