Presumably it&#x27;s therefore better to only share relative risk numbers, which are almost always more frightening.<p>That&#x27;s what I was responding to. I probably agree with most of your views on personal liberty versus the common good, but I think it&#x27;s tangential to the original point about risk communication.')
