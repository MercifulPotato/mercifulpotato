There is likely an effect, though we can&#x27;t yet say how large that effect is. A few doses of high-dose Vitamin D are probably not going to hurt, but there are harms to massive doses of Vitamin D - and if we give it to everyone indiscriminately we will see more of those. Also remember that younger patients were excluded from the assessment of mortality risk in the third study - because no one under 40 died in their study, despite the fact that most of them were deficient in Vitamin D.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s complicated. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of nuance, and there&#x27;s a very real likelihood that Vit D deficiency may just be a proxy for an unhealthy lifestyle.')
