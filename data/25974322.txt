If you “deposit” money with Robinhood (or any other broker) and can trade it immediately (or any timeframe less than a few days) you are not trading cash. Cash takes days to move from 1 account to another without taking on credit risk.<p>Similarly if you sell shares in 1 symbol and buy shares in another in less of a time frame than a few days you aren’t using cash. You are using credit (because it takes days for sales to settle).<p>All of that credit risk is all  currently legislated to go through a few bottlenecks who have the power to enforce their own credit rules.<p>Analogies are dumb but it would be like if Amex called all the casinos and said “everyone has 90% less credit than they did 2 minutes ago”. If you had a roulette ball running based on your previous credit line at Amex you can bet the Casino would grab that ball. Especially if it had 200k Amex lendees in their pits.')
