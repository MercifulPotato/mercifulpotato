I regularly take varying amounts as a prophylactic (I pour the concentrate into other drinks), but back when I was getting acute attacks I could knock them out in an hour if I drank say half a cup of the concentrate. (again, not straight: it&#x27;s too tart by itself!) There is a local grocery store that carries this concentrate in the refrigerated section, but even the hot-on-the-shelf jugs at GNC seem to work.')
