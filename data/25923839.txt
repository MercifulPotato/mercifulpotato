It&#x27;s that I have yet to see a statically typed language whose type system is designed to help solve the kinds of problems I have when I&#x27;m wrangling data.<p>The distressing example that nags at me here is how the headline feature of Apache Spark 2.0 is that they Greenspunned a dynamic typing mechanism into it. And, in doing so, realized improvements in ergonomics, performance, <i>and</i> memory consumption. Understanding why and how is an instructive lesson.<p>The most promising typing system for arbitrary data wrangling that I&#x27;ve seen so far is the one that&#x27;s built into a Python package called Dagster. It seems reminiscent, as best I can tell, of dependent typing. (Although I haven&#x27;t actually spent any time with a dependently typed language, so that could be a misunderstanding on my part.) The actual checks are done at run time, of course, but I don&#x27;t see any particular reason, aside perhaps from the complexity involved, why a similar mechanism couldn&#x27;t be implemented as a static type check.')
