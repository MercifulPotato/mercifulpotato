Absolutely yes for ad hoc queries and there&#x27;s a wealth of logging and privacy features built into all of our tools.<p>2. Absolutely yes and those queries are audited. For any query that matches some heuristics it&#x27;ll warn us with a big scary message to make sure the query is legitimate work.<p>For the query linked above about checking who was around a location at a given time I&#x27;d probably be fired before the query completed. It&#x27;s a pretty comfortable job but they don&#x27;t mess around with user data, it&#x27;s zero tolerance if it&#x27;s abused and even if there was never a warning message your ass is still out the door when they catch you.<p>For all the flak tech giants get around PII I think it&#x27;s horrifying that smaller players can still get hordes of sensitive data and yet have basically no safeguards to prevent misuse like querying whatever some internal engineer wants to look at.')
