Most stores don&#x27;t take credit).<p>Local credit cards, however, cannot be used online. They have no &quot;card number&quot;. Online stores ubiquitously take Ideal. Ideal it tied to ones bank account, and money is moved from payer to recipient instantaneously. It&#x27;s super safe, since you actually need to either scan a QR code with your phone, or use a tiny OTP device you get for free from the bank.<p>Aside from not qualifying for a credit card here, I&#x27;d never get one because I don&#x27;t _want_ a credit. I only want to use money I have, period.')
