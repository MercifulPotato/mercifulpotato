In 99.9999999% of cases this would be an odd use of an op-ed, but it appears to have been the only option since the reporters refused.<p>It is also worth noting that WSJ has a unique and well-known dichotomy between “brilliant, hard-hitting reporting” and “unbelievably hackish Joe-Rogan-level opinions.”')
