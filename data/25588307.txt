Item(by='newfeatureok', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609376263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588213, text='&gt; But those numbers aren&#x27;t about total air travel, they&#x27;re about air travel at the holiday at that highest point since March was _still_ a 50% reduction (which is pretty minimally impacted by business travel, so not sure why you&#x27;re bringing that up at all.) Again, from your latest link<p>My point in bringing up business travel is that it still happens during the holiday, almost exclusively by air, but the rate of increased travel from late number until thanksgiving is similar to last year.<p>Meaning if the rate of change is the same but the amount is offset, that could mean either it’s business travel during the holidays, or that there’s a group of people who were going to travel no matter what (which is my point regarding a lockdown not being followed)<p>Vehicular travel is also representative because it shows how the behavior people who are within driving distance was hardly affected.<p>In any case my point was about a lockdown not really being feasible to begin with, which we apparently agree on.')
