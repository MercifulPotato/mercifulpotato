Much modern and contemporary art is not going to speak to most people on its own.<p>Art serves as a physical token of something bigger -- a shared experience of culture, time, place, narrative, or whatever. Sometimes, the technical craftsmanship of the piece is self-evident. Sometimes, it&#x27;s not. Sometimes, the craftsmanship, or lack thereof, is completely beside the point.<p>One of the things that really changed my experience of art was doing guided tours at museums. Invariably, I come away with insights that would not have come to me, no matter how long or how many occasions I might have visited a piece.')
