Unix is messier but doesn&#x27;t limit you, and it&#x27;s what basically all big systems are made of these days.  A major strength of shell is to glue things together that nobody thought should be glued together.<p>---<p>Good example here from Paul Bucheit: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;simplest-explanation.html#productive-programmers-secretly-use-shell" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;simplest-explanation.ht...</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulbuchheit.blogspot.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;01&#x2F;communicating-with-code.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulbuchheit.blogspot.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;01&#x2F;communicating-with-...</a><p><i>However, we needed a way for Gmail to make money, and Sanjeev Singh kept talking about using relevant ads, even though it was obviously a &quot;bad idea&quot;. I remained skeptical, but thought that it might be a fun experiment, so I connected to that ads database (I assure you, random engineers can no longer do this!), copied out all of the ads+keywords, and did a little bit of sorting and filtering with some UNIX SHELL COMMANDS</i><p><i>I then hacked up the &quot;adult content&quot; classifier that Matt Cutts and I had written for safe-search, linked that into the Gmail prototype, and then loaded the ads data into the classifier. My change to the classifier (which completely broke its original functionality, but this was a separate code branch) changed it from classifying pages as &quot;adult&quot;, to classifying them according to which ad was most relevant. The resulting ad was then displayed in a little box on our Gmail prototype ui. The code was rather ugly and hackish, but more importantly, it only took a few hours to write!</i><p>----<p>Also, use whatever&#x27;s best for you, but Unix people tend to hate PowerShell:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@octskyward&#x2F;the-woes-of-powershell-8737e5346b1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@octskyward&#x2F;the-woes-of-powershell-8737e5...</a><p><i>PowerShell feels like it was built by people who had heard about command lines a long time ago and tried to recreate one based on stories passed down through generations of their ancestors</i><p>The fact that they cargo-culted operators like -eq, -le, -lt, while not maintaining compatibility is just silly to me.
