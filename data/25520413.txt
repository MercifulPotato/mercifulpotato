We did, and then as soon as the WD19 came out we tested that, and it&#x27;s been night and day.<p>They still require custom drivers but 99% of issues disappeared. I had one issue with a laptop that likely had a faulty tb module and was failing back to usb 3.1 but no other complaints from anyone.<p>Well aside from the lack of usb ports on the thing... the Eport had like 8 usbs, the wd16 had 5 and now we&#x27;re down to 3 on the wd19, that&#x27;d be fine if the laptops didn&#x27;t keep dropping usb-a&#x27;s also, most of the 7000 line only has 2 now. I refuse to get a usb dock to plug into the wd19 just for usb, that&#x27;s insane and I&#x27;m not a crazy person.')
