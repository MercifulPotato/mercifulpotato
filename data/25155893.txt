Don&#x27;t know if, e.g., companies do a hiring lockdown right before IPO.  Also, just on the emotional side, I joined a company very shortly after IPO years ago, and it was always a sore spot to see the life-changing millions of dollars of those who joined the company not long before me, and the constant reminder of &quot;pre-&quot; vs &quot;post-&quot; employees.')
