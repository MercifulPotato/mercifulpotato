So you’re going to need to pay rent and you need to subtract that off the profits from S&amp;P investments.<p>You also generally can’t borrow 5x your income and invest it, but you can do that on a house, so if you think house prices will rise, even a tiny bit, then you’re missing out on a chance for major leverage you won’t get elsewhere. Hint: house prices don’t really go down much, because everyone is leveraged and literally can’t afford to sell below a certain point.<p>Finally there’s something to be said for the security and ability to make a house your own. Not being dependent on a landlord’s whims and decisions can be of huge value.')
