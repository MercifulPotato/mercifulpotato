Despite the marketing fanfare, they are not as big a change as say jumping from Windows 7 to Windows 10.<p>Windows 10 has new major releases every 6 months, changes might be more minor than a typical macOS major release. Windows also gets security patches and bug fixes every month, those are comparable to macOS minor versions.')
