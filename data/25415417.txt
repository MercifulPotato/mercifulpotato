Item(by='pheelicks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607941587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415377, text='I recently launched an open-source 3D mapping library <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;felixpalmer&#x2F;procedural-gl-js&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;felixpalmer&#x2F;procedural-gl-js&#x2F;</a> which can be configured to display imagery tiles for 3rd party providers. However, to make 3D terrain, elevation data is needed, and for this I wanted to have a simple, friction-less API that would work seamlessly with the library.<p>Hence: www.nasadem.xyz. The API is fully operational, and has served over 200k requests over the last month. While I built this primarily for the purpose above, the image format is easy to understand and could be used to power any other apps that need elevation data. Right now the data is returned as an image, but in the future other options are being considered, like returning the elevation at a given point, or along a route.')
