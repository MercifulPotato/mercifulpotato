If you often need to look upward for longer than a glance, you are likely to tilt your head back a bit to relieve strain on eye muscles (trading it for strain on neck muscles).<p>Often people compensate by resting their head on a headrest and leaning back against a back rest. Often this causes shoulder and back strain. Then they use an armrest or palmrest to type, causing RSI from static loads on bent wrists.<p>There are two main ways to avoid static muscle loads that cause discomfort and long-term problems. One is to regularly change position. Another is to default to a neutral and comfortable basic position.')
