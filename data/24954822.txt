Item(by='detaro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604175221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952735, text='Your examples all are for simpler chips, more microcontrollers rather than application processors (with the chip on the Teensy 4.x being the closest to the latter category, it&#x27;s a bit of a hybrid). Those kind of boards also typically do not expose much that&#x27;s specific to the capabilities of the chip, but rather mostly jut raw access to the IO pins + some helper circuitry. That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t use those to develop things with the chips, but it&#x27;s a somewhat different market.<p>Whereas from a classic development board it&#x27;s typically expected that it provides access to as many capabilities of the chip as possible, and more complex chips have a staggering amount of those. E.g. taking the chip on the teensy, since it&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s the most high-end one from your examples: It has Ethernet support - add an Ethernet port. It has CAN support - add external CAN circuitry. It has USB - add USB ports. It supports low-level debugging through JTAG and SWD - add that, either a basic debugger or at least a space to connect an external one. It has a display interface - add a dedicated header for that, or maybe even just add a display. I think it supports eMMC flash - add space for that. That makes these boards a lot bigger and expensive, but it means a developer can start with whatever combination of things they want to try, and if the alternative is them spending a day on figuring out and hooking up all the external bits they need on a simpler board the higher price doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. (Especially coming from the days were there wasn&#x27;t as big an ecosystem of breakout boards for lots of things available).<p>The end result then looks more like something like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.embeddedartists.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;imx-rt1062-developers-kit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.embeddedartists.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;imx-rt1062-develope...</a>, and appropriately costs a bunch more than the teensy Teensy.')
