My dad is a train nut, and ages ago I tricked him into boardgames by giving him 1830 for his birthday. Since then, he&#x27;s bought nearly every 18xx game in existence, which turned out to be way more than I expected at the time.<p>We try to play them regularly. Usually it&#x27;s my dad, my brother and me. Originally, sometimes my mother or my sister would join us (and I&#x27;d immediately lose) or I&#x27;d bring a board gamer friend from university. These days, my 11 years old son joins us.<p>Our most recent favourite is <i>Steam Over Holland</i> (No 18xx name! Heresy! which is only the latest of many, many games of the genre taking place in Netherland. But this one is really nice, plays fairly quickly, and has a predictable length. A previous favourite was <i>18EU</i>, taking place in Europe (France to Austria), which felt big and epic, with 15 minor companies merging into larger companies in sometimes unpredictable ways, but actually still played relatively quickly, at least compared to a monster like <i>1841</i>.<p>What&#x27;s really interesting about the genre is how all these games have roughly the same rules, but slight variations in those rules, or even just the board or the number of available trains, can make a massive difference in how the game plays and feels. I still remember the first time I played 1835 (Germany, very non-aggressive, constructive and buildery) and tried my reliable aggressive strategy from 1830 (US East Coast, very aggressive and cut-throat), and only got exhausted without getting anywhere. Every game is similar yet totally different, and everybody has their own favourites.')
