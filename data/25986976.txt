Item(by='woofie11', descendants=None, kids=[25987019], score=None, time=1612170770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986786, text='There&#x27;s a very different risk profile for me (an individual investor) if I&#x27;m buying shares from someone who doesn&#x27;t have them, and merely promises to deliver them, than if they&#x27;re backed by real shares. I&#x27;d like my brokerage to be holding real shares on my behalf for real dollars I gave them. I don&#x27;t want them loaning my shares out either.<p>They&#x27;re mine.<p>If there are naked shorts floating around (or shorts covered by my stock without permission), someone else is making money off of risk I am taking on, but didn&#x27;t agree to. There can be a cascading set of failures which lands with me not having my shares.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between taking out a $300,000 mortgage on a $500,000 house, versus borrowing $300,000 with no collateral. You&#x27;ll get a different interest rate, if you can get a loan at all. And this resembles someone taking a $300,000 mortgage, only missing the house.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s always a risk, but that risk profile is very, very different (esp. in the case of catastrophic events, like a stock market collapse or similar, when many institutions might be going down at the same time).')
