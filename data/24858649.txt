It&#x27;s just that I see reading as having more benefit for me than just writing (without reading as much). As in, the relative importance of reading to writing is higher.<p>By reading someone I can implicitly understand how they structure their thoughts and how they think (where and when they stop to explain something.) This, opposed to me experimenting how to structure my own thoughts as to make sense for someone who might then be reading (which might be myself). It&#x27;s in this sense that I prefer to have various inputs as to how different people write their thoughts rather than just experiment on my own (with the corollary that when I have to write something, when I really have to explain something -- it will just come up in the page without giving too much thought to the structure of the text. The structure is inherent and can be traced back to me reading different authors.)')
