Speech has ALWAYS had limitations.  You cannot yell &quot;fire&quot; in a movie theatre.  You cannot publish falsehoods that harm a person&#x27;s reputation.  You cannot reveal classified information.  You cannot imitate a police officer.  Why is &quot;you cannot incite violent terrorism&quot; suddenly controversial?  Particularly when these are private corporations making the decisions, who are not duty-bound to enable free spech in the first place?')
