There was gcj and now Oracle&#x27;s AoT for Java, etc.  In the late 1990s, MIT&#x27;s 6.270 robotics competition used an interpreted implementation of C.  I haven&#x27;t heard anyone claim that these implementation details should cause the implementation to be &quot;not really Lisp&quot;, &quot;not really Java&quot;, or &quot;not really C&quot;.<p>Also, if you link in Boehm&#x27;s libgc and start allocating via libgc, you&#x27;ve got (conservatively) garbage-collected C without violating any of the C standards.')
