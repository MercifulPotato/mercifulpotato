They&#x27;re all supporting a grift run by the President --- you know it&#x27;s a grift, because substantially more than half of the hundreds of millions of dollars he&#x27;s raised isn&#x27;t going to the lawsuits. It&#x27;s no surprise that feckless Republican officials in heavily-Republican states are willing to kowtow; the President has deluded his true believers into a frenzy, and they don&#x27;t want those people outside their house at 1AM. I&#x27;m fine if Google &quot;censors&quot; them. This is what Parler is for.')
