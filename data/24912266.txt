It&#x27;s a really hard set of axioms for me to justify compared to MLTT, and it&#x27;s important to me how &quot;obvious&quot; some set of axioms is. MLTT also has the advantage that it&#x27;s very easy to use <i>without</i> encoding everything into well-founded, untyped trees, which is nice.<p>2. What are these &quot;substantive problems&quot;? I don&#x27;t have any experience in foundations, so I&#x27;m genuinely curious.<p>3. Sure, intuitionistic mathematics has very little popularity, but a lot of that popularity is among computer scientists, for fairly obvious reasons.<p>4. The HoTT book and the nLab are two of the most out-in-the-open developments in math I&#x27;ve seen --- the HoTT book was even written in a public GitHub repo iirc. Naturally that has a lot of appeal for HN. If you have anything similar (blogs, wikis, etc.) for mainstream foundations, I&#x27;d love to read them.<p>5. Yeah, personally, I&#x27;m not really convinced that HoTT is a good idea, but I guess we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.')
