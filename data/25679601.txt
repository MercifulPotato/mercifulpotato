You believe all we need is the fine and then the company goes under ? If that&#x27;s true then all the individuals who failed could just as easily go to another company and repeat their failures.<p>For doctors a failure can make their license get revoked (even tho it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen very often in practice). Wonder if there could be something similar but indeed it is very hard to find &quot;a person to blame&quot;, maybe the CEO? CTO? :)')
