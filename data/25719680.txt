I&#x27;m not red tribe and have no friends who are so take what I say with a grain of salt:<p>* The USA has gotten worse.<p>* Immigration is bad and one of the reasons for the USA decline.<p>* Our (Red tribe) economic interests are not being defended or advanced.<p>* Red tribe social norms and interests are not being advanced or defended by the centres of power.
