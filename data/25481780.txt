The accrual of 14 lineage-specific amino acid replacements prior to its detection is, to date, unprecedented in the global virus genomic data for the COVID-19 pandemic. Most branches in the global phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 show no more than a few mutations and mutations accumulate at a relatively consistent rate over time.<p>It&#x27;s certainly still not proven that it&#x27;s definitely more infectious than the other strains. But it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to infer from previous experience here, given the quantitative difference.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations&#x2F;563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;preliminary-genomic-characterisati...</a>')
