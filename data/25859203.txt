More directly, the Columbine shooters were influenced by Timothy McVeigh and the militia movement, who was and which were explicitly white supremacist.<p>What&#x27;s disgusting is that this keeps happening, and that white Americans are so married to this ethos that they&#x27;ll sacrifice their children to maintain it, and that people like you would rather flag and dismiss a post pointing out this dynamic than introspect. What&#x27;s inflammatory is this purposeful and obstinate denial, while all the world watches in pity.')
