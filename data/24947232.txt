I plotted latency&#x2F;ping on a map When I was having pretty bad internet trouble in early Uni. I rendered some pixel-perfect shapes when building a stub website (At the time I didn’t know how to use Inkscape). I think at some point I visualised exponential mathematical algorithms too.<p>My initial project was to build a media center similar to Kodi. It was horrible, pseudo-objective, and built UI components from event and pixel blitting primitives. It was a year 12 project (in a ‘pick your project’ non IT class). It probably actually pushed me to complete year 12, and gave me a good foundational basis for IT at uni. I was a ‘troubled’ student who hated school, was bullied pretty bad, and hung out with people actively abusing drugs and alcohol. 15 years on am thankful I’m not a methhead, I’m sure that Kodi project had a part in saving me no matter how unstable and poorly written it was.')
