However, I would never pay for it because I can easily get it for free, and would laugh at anyone who tried to charge me for permission to breathe.<p>I think it&#x27;s difficult in general for people to put a price on most of the things they get for free, just because they&#x27;re used to getting them for free, and build their price intuitions on being able to get them for free.')
