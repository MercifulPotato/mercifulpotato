That 5% is a real PITA.<p>I think nix isn&#x27;t as useful for developers using it to setup their workstation compared to for operations setting up deployment environments. -- I like that I can just run &quot;nix --install myPackages&quot; and have the exact, up-to-date versions of software installed... but, it&#x27;s not often that I <i>need</i> to run this. (The up-to-date versions thing is nice). -- Maybe this will be more compelling for stuff like GitHub Codespaces, and other ephemeral machines?<p>(EDIT: and nix-shell is cool and very pure, but looks to me like people are just fine using images of development environments&#x2F;toolschains with VMs or Docker. etc.).<p>NixOS itself does feel very different to other OSs. I think people discount how much trouble they run into on other OSs. Partly because other OSs have larger communities, and advice will often apply across multiple OSs. With NixOS, there&#x27;s a higher requirement for understanding of what&#x27;s going on; and it&#x27;s not obvious that the benefit from doing this is worth it.')
