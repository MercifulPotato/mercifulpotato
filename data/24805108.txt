People frequently mislead about the advancements Silicon Valley has made because it makes them feel good to bash it.<p>There are dozens of companies not named Uber or Airbnb that have come out of SV in the past 10-15 years that lead the world at what they do. You won&#x27;t see the SV bashers talk about any of that, they go out of their way to avoid that point in fact.<p>Where is the Cloudflare of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the ServiceNow of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the WorkDay of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Palo Alto Networks of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Twilio of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Snowflake of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Splunk of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Okta of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Veeva Systems of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the Zoom of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Where is the DataDog of Europe? Doesn&#x27;t exist. (DataDog is NY, however they have an office in the SV area as well)<p>And on the list goes. These are massive, wild success stories. Most of them are already big companies and they&#x27;re growing fast. With few exceptions meanwhile most of the rest of the world not named China is asleep, and SV keeps on conquering markets and building giant software companies.<p>Where is the global competition for these companies? It largely doesn&#x27;t exist, they&#x27;re going to keep on with the SV traditional of pushing out of the homogeneous US market and scaling up globally and building giant companies.')
