My work area is dead silent!<p>Note I also use a usb extender and a usb DAC, so I got 2 long cables and I get keyb&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;audio and 4K 60Hz video.<p>I think a comparable spec new desktop would have cost about 5-10k..<p>With the savings I was able to get a PCI card with NVME drives, and 2x16TB drives and that was still cheaper :)')
