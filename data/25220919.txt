Now they have removed the 20 kms&#x2F;h extra you could do for overtaking other cars. It is ludicrous.<p>Everybody goes over the limit, and hence everybody goes against the law, and everybody could be fined with 300 euros, like my father 1 month ago.<p>In cities, they are putting limits under 30km&#x2F;h.<p>Politicians love the fines because it is an extra tax of an extra billion euros nobody controls.')
