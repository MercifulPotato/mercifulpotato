But when you&#x27;re in a team, or worse, in a large company, it starts to be a problem that everyone can use their own style. It&#x27;s much easier to read someone else&#x27;s code when you have a common code style.<p>And in Scala there are not only many different ways to use the standard libraries or to structure your code, there is a pure FP vs OOP-style FP schism as well. Because of this, you can qualify as a senior Scala developer for one job but only a junior in another.')
