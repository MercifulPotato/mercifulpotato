One in which code&#x2F;features were automatically scheduled by the license to revert to GPL&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;whatever at a point a year or three in the future?<p>I think that might sap some of the impetus to reinvent those features in a competing open source project (they can of course just copy them if they wait), and also might entice people to pay that wouldn&#x27;t normally because they don&#x27;t want to get on the paid product train. Users also get a known date a feature will be available, a real date, not a projected delivery date.<p>In a lot of ways it&#x27;s what many companies that develop products do already to allow people to get familiar with their product (have an open source version with less features), but this allows them a better story, makes users feel more sure about what&#x27;s going on, and if they release the code immediately but it&#x27;s unusable for a period by other projects, that does make it harder for those projects to cleanly reimplement unless they&#x27;re sure they haven&#x27;t seen in (that might be a net negative for the public with a litigation happy company).<p>The hard part would be tracking the time, but git has ways to make that pretty simple.')
