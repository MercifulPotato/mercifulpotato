Moderation requires judgment, and different people have different ideas about what good judgment looks like.  Your question made me think about what a &quot;real review&quot; is.  Should the person have used the app for more than a certain period of time?  Do they need to have taken certain actions (make an account?)  Different folks will draw lines in different places because reviews are just opinions, and there are no real credentials for having an opinion.  I don&#x27;t see a way to resolve this with a centralized model.<p>Federated&#x2F;distributed systems where the network is itself the filter seem more promising to me, even though they tend to come at the expense of usability.')
