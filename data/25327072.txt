In the event of a positive result, they&#x27;re not even permitted on set for at least a week until after the last positive result, even when followup tests suggest that the positive result may have been false positive. When on set, all crew and cast must wear masks at all times except when filming, in which case <i>cast</i> but not crew may remove their masks for the duration of the take.<p>How often are the restaurant employees being tested? How often of the <i>customers</i> being tested? (For both questions, the answer is &quot;not regularly, if at all&quot;.)')
