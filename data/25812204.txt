I recall in 90th I used to run quite a large Fidonet node. I was responsible for my points&#x27; (users) behaviour - when someone violated rules by misbehaving in an echo conference it effected me as a boss node in first place, I had to execute the ban and brainwash negligent user. What&#x27;s more, I had to introduce new and old users to fidonet policy and its updates regularily to make sure they understand the rules. This all worked pretty well and was widely accepted. Fidonet was incredibly popular in 90th.<p>I think we may create a similar network basing on same old ESMTP, what we need is just to agree on rules and their enforcement. Also we need to secure inter-node communications.')
