Then there&#x27;s also error correction mechanisms that are more common nowadays that can compensate to some extent. We don&#x27;t test for every single possible combinatoric like was possible so long ago, full stop. Furthermore, GPUs aren&#x27;t necessarily to be tested in the same ways as CPUs. GPUs don&#x27;t really branch and hold state with exotic addressing modes like how CPUs can operate, so testing compute shaders is in many respects closer to testing not a state machine as much as a big, wide bit bus. Heck, one doesn&#x27;t need to even bother hooking up any output devices like HDMI and HDCP decoders to a GPU as long as the PCB is hooked up fine during assembly and the peripheral chips are tested to spec, too.<p>And for an extra measure of automation there are test suites that are programmed into hardware that can drive chips at line speed on a test bench.')
