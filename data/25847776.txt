It doesn&#x27;t benefit students to have instructors who are shocked by common&#x2F;natural errors.<p>Math, as commonly encountered, is a collection of facts and relations. Their notion of variable is <i>very</i> different than in CS and programming.<p>To a mather (one who uses&#x2F;does math), this makes sense:<p><pre><code>  x = 7 * y\n  y = 6\n  therefore x = 42\n</code></pre>\nTo a coder (of most conventional programming languages) that&#x27;s an error, y is undefined when x is assigned a value. And even if it <i>did</i> have a value, changing it later wouldn&#x27;t change x so who knows what x could be.<p>It makes sense to the mather because each statement exists <i>at the same time</i>. To the coder, each statement is realized <i>over a period of time</i>. To the coder &quot;y = 6&quot; hasn&#x27;t happened yet when &quot;x = 7 * y&quot;. This is the part that has to be communicated to the novice with a mathematical background.')
