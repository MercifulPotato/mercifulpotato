Once that is clear in your mind, it becomes much easier to use.<p>When I explain Git to other people I explain it as a tool for manipulating commit graphs, where every node in the graph is a (merge) commit with some unique hash, where a commit itself is just essentially a patch on the previous node(s) in the graph.<p>Implementation details on how this commit graph is manipulated or stored behind the scenes are not important to understand Git in my opinion.')
