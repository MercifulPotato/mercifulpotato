This is why we can&#x27;t have nice things. I really don&#x27;t want the kernel&#x27;s filesystem performance to depend on the number of different UIDs writing to the filesystem. That is insanity!<p>Ted Ts&#x27;o is just wrong here: performance should take priority over preserving the behavior of applications that rely on non-contractual implementation details of the Linux kernel. fsync should sync <i>only</i> the indicated file, and that&#x27;s that. We can add a mount option to let users opt into the older, safer behavior, but we shouldn&#x27;t suffer for essentially an eternity because somewhere, someone might have written an application that depends on an ext4 implementation detail.')
