Item(by='smt88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605497422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105185, text='&gt; <i>You&#x27;re using a very particular definition of &quot;design&quot;</i><p>No, I&#x27;m using a common definition of it. I&#x27;m using the same one that the person I responded to was using, which is the type of design for which people hire UX&#x2F;UI designers.<p>People don&#x27;t hire UX&#x2F;UI designers to design CLIs. Maybe they should, but they don&#x27;t. Is it UX and UI? Sure. But we&#x27;re talking about an industry term at this point, not 100% of everything that is designable.<p>&gt; <i>Why does design have to be graphical, and why does &quot;UX&#x2F;UI designers&quot; get to say what it is?</i><p>I honestly don&#x27;t know who or what you&#x27;re arguing against right now. This seems totally tangential to the comment I replied to.<p>Companies hire engineers to write code and designers to create GUIs. Those are the domains we&#x27;re talking about. I don&#x27;t disagree with you philosophically at all.<p>&gt; &gt; <i>most engineers don&#x27;t practice design</i><p>My meaning was unclear here.<p>I meant that most engineers don&#x27;t study and repeatedly practice design, meaning that they don&#x27;t have feedback loops with their designs. The goal is releasing their code, not building their skill at design.<p>Designers, on the other hand, will create many iterations of something with feedback along the way, sometimes in an academic setting.<p>Even setting that aside, most engineers work at large corporations where design is a bureaucratic process that engineers aren&#x27;t expected to change. They just write the code.<p>&gt; <i>Citation needed.</i><p>No, it&#x27;s not. First of all, I&#x27;ve in the software industry for 20 years, so I&#x27;m going to lean on first-hand experience here.<p>Second, the burden of proof is on the person making the more uncommon claim. The inverse of &quot;most software engineers don&#x27;t practice design&quot; is &quot;most software engineers <i>do</i> practice design,&quot; and the latter would be more surprising to the typical person.<p>Unless, as mentioned above, you expand the meaning of &quot;design&quot; far beyond what the original thread was about, which was web UI design.')
