You’ll understand when and why users need accessibility. Then you’ll dive into the &quot;how&quot;: making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.) You’ll understand what &quot;semantics&quot; and &quot;semantic markup&quot; mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally, you’ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.')
