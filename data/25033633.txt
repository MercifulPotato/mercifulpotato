Writing something down, like the author states, helps me focus and accomplish the task at hand, and the more I worry about the long term value of the notes the less I take notes because I am worried about making the notes perfect!<p>What I do now is use a stack of nice small notebooks from Field Notes (no relation, just a customer), one for each project.  I just scribble things in when I need and it helps me push forward!')
