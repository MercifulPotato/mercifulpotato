Large investors can negotiate a  liquidation preference with their investment. This means they will receive some multiple (1x, 2x, ...) of their investment from the liquidation proceeds. These investors can also be &quot;participating members&quot; which means after receiving their liquidation preference they can still receive their pro rata share of the liquidation proceeds based on their equity stake.<p>So if a company was liquidated for an amount at or below the sum of the liquidation preferences there&#x27;s nothing left for the shareholders to divvy up.')
