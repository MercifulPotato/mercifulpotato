Major factors in Weimar that don&#x27;t exist in America&#x2F;the West today:<p>- Immediately after a massively destructive war that affected all levels of society<p>- Populace of young men with PTSD <i>and</i> military experience<p>- Little&#x2F;no social safety nets<p>- No history of democracy - remember that prior to Weimar, Germany was governed by Prussia and basically had no democratic traditions<p>IMO the real actual historical comparison to use in 2020 is the Printing Press and Protestant Reformation; i.e. established power structure (the Catholic Church) dealing with new information-propagation technologies and factions. I&#x27;d bet that 2050 is going to look a lot like 1550.')
