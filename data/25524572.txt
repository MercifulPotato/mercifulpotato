The absolutely last thing a company wants to do is compete. They avoid competition at all costs.<p>The first instinct is to buy, then shut it down, then smother it out with sheer capital, then retreat either up or downmarket.<p>That&#x27;s why when you go in to the supermarket to look at commodities, they&#x27;re often owned by either 1 or 2 companies that are mutually invested in each other.<p>You see a bunch of brands, but the capital ownership structure is almost entirely consolidated. Better products get dragged to court by existing players who try to shut them down or legislatives get greased palms for new regulations (&quot;protected&quot; terms).<p>In instances where this can&#x27;t happen there&#x27;s cartel systems which is why the dominant grocery store changes city by city.<p>The Austrian model of how humans work is dead wrong, how markets work is dead wrong, how capital flows is dead wrong, they&#x27;re just wrong wrong wrong.<p>That&#x27;s why they never use any examples and only have theoretical exercises, because there&#x27;s absolutely zero evidence for their claims.

They know this and that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t use anything more than broad non-specific folksy anecdotal stories, because narrative fiction is the closest thing to reality they can get.')
