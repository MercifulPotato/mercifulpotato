The Nissan has automatic steering more than just lane keep &#x27;assist&#x27; - there&#x27;s a somewhat sharp curve on a highway where the Nissan takes it well, but the Honda has limited steering torque available and just gives up + turns off LKAS in the middle - which is a bit scary, especially since the audio alert is either quiet or not always triggered.<p>On the other hand, the Nissan has the same issue with merging cars that you mention, but the Honda seems to have an uncanny ability to recognize it and slow down &#x2F; make space, just like a human would. Maybe their camera system detects blinkers, or their radar is more sophisticated? I haven&#x27;t driven it enough to get a lot of insight on this.<p>Overall it seems like all three systems are just bad enough to require constant attention - each has weaknesses that make it unreliable in the right scenario, and other manufacturers have those specific issues resolved but have their own issues. Except maybe Tesla.<p>Nissan has had this since 2018, I wonder how their latest implementation is doing. And also the ones from more expensive brands. Honda&#x27;s 2020 systems also have low speed follow which works for city driving where you come to complete stops, but my car is a manual transmission so I don&#x27;t have that feature to try.')
