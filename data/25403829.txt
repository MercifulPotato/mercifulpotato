A few metal subgebres, mostly doom and sludge and things adjacent to those, a little bit of various punk genres. Also like certain bits from the 90s alt rock scenes. I listen to a little bit of electronic music, though Iâ€™m incredibly particular on what I like there. Other than that I likely have few tracks from everything mixed in somewhere.')
