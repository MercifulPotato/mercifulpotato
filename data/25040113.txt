You don&#x27;t generally need arbitrary query patterns from the client, and Rails&#x2F;ActiveRecord already has tons of problems minimizing SQL calls. If you&#x27;ve built a decent backend API framework, making a new route should be quick, it&#x27;s just access&#x2F;auth boilerplate plus whatever retrieval is the most efficient.')
