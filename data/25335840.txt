Another user has already pointed this out, but I want to add personal direct experience.<p>We used the 529 plan for our daughter, who will go to college in a few years. Let&#x27;s say 5 for the purpose of the math. At this year&#x27;s price her 4 years of college tuition will cost her ~ $48k. This total expected to go up around $10k every year before she gets to college (around $2k annual tuition rise, over 5 years).<p>So if we paid her tuition when she went in five years, we would pay $20k, $22k, $24k, $26k, for a total of $92k. Instead we pay $50k now, and are guaranteed to not have to pay any additional tuition costs, for a savings of $42k. The tax deferment might be another $8k (spitballing).<p>Which means the using a 529 plan now you can send two kids to college in 5 years for the price of sending one to college in 5 years and paying for it then.<p>Yes, there are risks.<p>* They may want to go to a private school, or out of state. The money isn&#x27;t lost, but you don&#x27;t get the guarantee either. You just get the money applied to the tuition.<p>* Tuition prices may come down and stay down. They haven&#x27;t yet, and it seems unlikely without major upset. They might come down over the next year, but I suspect they&#x27;ll go back up.<p>* Universities may become free, or become extinct in their current form.  With any forward-looking investment there is a risk of a true disruption that completely changes the landscape.  This would be such a huge change that it&#x27;s not likely to completely happen within the 9 years until she would graduate, if it happens at all.')
