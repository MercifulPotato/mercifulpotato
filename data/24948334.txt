People like Obama and Biden accomplished nothing in their careers, yet are nominated to run for President of the most powerful country on earth. (The problems we&#x27;re having with the CCP now are related to Obama&#x27;s weakness in patrolling the South China Sea.)<p>- the Marxist rioters have no purpose in life, so could keep rioting regardless of who&#x27;s elected. I doubt if antifa members and supporters even know what the word &quot;fascist&quot; means.<p>- the alternative the left is looking for is to replace the US constitution, which is the envy of the world and has worked for 2 centuries, with Marxism, with a century of failure.<p>- Republicans and the right, who have a moral center, are not rioting or cancelling people, it&#x27;s the left, whose god is political correctness (a Maoist phrase.)<p>- the current college generation are fragile snowflakes who shatter when stressed, which is the fault of parents and society, but still a problem that feeds the riots.')
