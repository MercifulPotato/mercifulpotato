So, for example, the 2017 iMac Pro can&#x27;t boot a 2016 or earlier macOS.<p>This is still unsupported, mind you — if your 2017 iMac Pro is firmware updated to 2020 and you&#x27;re booting a macOS from 2018 on it, you may encounter random bugs and&#x2F;or crashes and&#x2F;or mysterious issues due to assumptions made by the older macOS that are no longer entirely valid on 2020 firmware — but in general, it should work as long as the macOS is newer than the hardware.<p>(You probably won&#x27;t be able to boot an M1 macOS external drive on an Intel Mac, and vice versa, for other reasons unrelated to this. In that scenario, Migration Assistant is probably your only choice anyways.)')
