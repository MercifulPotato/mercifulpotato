It is not, it is a statistical increase. GP know 8 Covid-19 mild cases and zero severe. Let&#x27;s estimate the chance of severe Covid-19 over reported cases to about 1&#x2F;10. That&#x27;s a probability of 43%, GP&#x27;s experience is typical.<p>One interesting bit of stats I&#x27;ve seen is that catching Covid-19 roughly doubles your chances of dying this year, regardless of your age. It is a lot but still in the realm of statistics.<p>And as you probably know, we are very bad at judging statistics instinctively, and for most of us, it is all we have. Otherwise, most people would stop smoking. If Covid-19 can (statistically) cost you one year of your life, smoking costs you 10.')
