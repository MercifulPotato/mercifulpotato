Apple had to do <i>something</i> to counter the mostly bad publicity for them around the whole App Store topic. But they can&#x27;t simply reduce the store tax for everyone, because this would cut their App Store revenue in half overnight. The vast majority of apps on the app store most likely make a lot less than 1 million&#x2F;year, while the vast majority of profits is made through a &quot;handful&quot; (well ok, probably a few more then that) massively big apps, so this announcement probably won&#x27;t make a big dent in Apple&#x27;s App Store revenue (but will make a lot of indie devs happy).')
