For example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0832DC7W8&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0832DC7W8&#x2F;</a><p>And anyway, compare this to before USB-C. &quot;My MacBook&#x27;s magsafe cable isn&#x27;t long enough, can I get a longer one?&quot;<p>No, it&#x27;s soldered to the power brick, comes in only one length, costs $80 to replace the whole thing if the cable frays, and no reputable 3rd party options exist because it was Apple&#x27;s special sauce patented power connector.<p>I&#x27;ll take USB-C over that.')
