I very much doubt that that is true.<p>I very much disagree. Hate speech is just one example. &quot;Speech&quot; designed to terrorize, threaten, and incite action should not be &quot;free&quot;.<p>&gt; Of course any crimes that derive from it are and will always been fully enforceable.<p>By this logic no one who is purposely inciting anything is even liable for the actions that they cause. &quot;Leaders&quot; will never face punishment, because they only say things, right?<p>The line (or at least one of the lines) comes when speech is no longer an expression, but an instruction. It may be a tough line to draw, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the line shouldn&#x27;t exist somewhere.')
