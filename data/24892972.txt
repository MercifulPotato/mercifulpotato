On the other hand, if you then go and generate work based on what you read, then distributing that work certainly <i>can</i> be infringing. Thus &quot;clean room&quot; techniques, where one team reads copyrighted text, writes up a spec (which may then be checked off by lawyers), and then another team, <i>without</i> reading the copyrighted text, implements based off the spec, are sometimes used to attempt to launder copyright taint.<p>Taking a step back, the fact that well-known authors have infamously declared that they don&#x27;t read fanfiction as a CYA move against accusations of plagiarism suggests that yes, brains that have read text are widely considered derivative.')
