Item(by='mcny', descendants=None, kids=[24991859], score=None, time=1604511363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987776, text='&gt; I don’t understand the point you’re making here. Surely your second sentence contradicts the first?<p>I rarely have a point to make. I started off thinking I disagree with the parent comment but as I started typing I realized I agree with them more than not. It is more of a thinking out loud. It helps me a lot because I have very simplistic opinions that are sometimes VERY incorrect so when I think out loud, people can correct me. I guess where I thought I differed from the parent is that when you &quot;believe&quot; in something, you will dig into your position given contrary evidence. I like to believe this is not true with scientists.')
