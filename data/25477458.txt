I decided to craft my own saddle binding script (a mere 179 lines of code) in python by using the output of this program as a guide. The java program here works well enough for one book at a time. I needed fine control over margins and being able to print two books at a time from the same round of printing.<p>I make pocket sized books no larger than 72 pages. To achieve a professional result using an inkjet printer it requires about 17 minutes of work and waiting time to produce 2 of them. The paper stacks are cut in half, folded, stapled, crushed in a press, and then trimmed with a sharp paper cutter. It is possible to achieve a remarkable level of quality with these methods.<p>If working in batches of more books at a time the books printed per hour is increasing but the limit seems largest on the printer which can only print about 2 sides a minute.<p>I thought there could be no way that an inkjet could possibly compete with a laser printer for cost per page but I was pleasantly surprised when I found ink tank printers. The quality is fantastic at least.')
