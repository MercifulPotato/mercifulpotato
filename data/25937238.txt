I think a more likely explanation is that it&#x27;s just not a very professional field. As a field it hasn&#x27;t been around for very long at all, and it&#x27;s changed a lot during that period. If it was obvious to tell the difference between bad and good programming, then perhaps things would be different. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s obvious at all, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to create any meaningful level of agreement in that area.

IETF RFCs take years to process, with the typical outcome being a standard that enough people agreed to publish, but that 0 people faithfully implement.')
