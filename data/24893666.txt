[To be exact, emails went out in batches and each batch has a shared wallet].<p>We&#x27;ve been trying to spread the good word and make people understand the hackers can&#x27;t know who paid, because they didn&#x27;t generate a wallet for every single user. If they can&#x27;t know who paid, how would they be able to delete <i>your</i> data.<p>But many people will probably end up paying, because 200 euros seems like a low price to keep your dignity and privacy.')
