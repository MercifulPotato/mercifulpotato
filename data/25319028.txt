Congrats for beating the worst habit of the xx century. How are you feeling after all these years off cigarettes? Did you pick up any other bad habit? Im still on e-cigs but dilluted the nicotine concentration and am ready to stop altigether. Ive been e-ciggng for 3 years and didnt gave a regular cigarette since and am already feeling much better')
