Item(by='bbarnett', descendants=None, kids=[25480280], score=None, time=1608394924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25477332, text='<i>You apparently missed the whole point of newsletters automatically unsubscribing users on a 5xx error from the previous discussion</i><p>There was no previous discussion &#x2F; topmost thread, as I replied directly to the topmost comment, and this thread forks from that.  No mention was made of newsletter unsubscribes thread upwards.  Further, I made it quite clear I was discussing SMTP response codes, and not the article directly.<p>Ergo, your stated context, isn&#x27;t the context of <i>this</i> whole thread&#x2F;discussion.  Further, from what I see, everyone in this thread is discussing MTAs, SMTP, SMTP return codes.<p><i>that the topmost comment was referring to. Not that you are to blame for missing that because it wasn&#x27;t restated here, but that&#x27;s the context of the whole discussion.</i><p>No, it isn&#x27;t the context of this thread&#x2F;discussion, as per above.<p><i>If I have sent emails successfully to a certain email address before it is not wise to assume a permanent error on a single response that the RFC specifies as permanent. Email&#x2F;SMTP is in it&#x27;s core a stateless protocol, but as a mailing list service I can keep state and provide additional context to errors that can improve my service.</i><p>In the context of the RFC, mailing list software should be viewed the same as a &#x27;human being&#x27;.  Of course it&#x27;s fine to it to re-send, if the software wishes.  Just like it is fine for you to send a mail with your mail client, get a 5xx, and re-try by clicking &#x27;send&#x27; once again.<p>(5xx errors can happen during auth&#x2F;etc stages too)<p>However, during this entire thread I&#x27;ve have been peppering the words &#x27;MTA&#x27;, &quot;smtp server&#x27;, &#x27;bounce&#x27; and more.<p>Note that the mailing list software you&#x27;re describing, is receiving a <i>bounce</i>.  Bounces only happen from the MTA side.  EG, mailing list software doesn&#x27;t &quot;bounce&quot; anything, ever.  Only an MTA does.  Without that bounce, most mailing list software won&#x27;t even <i>know there is an issue</i>.<p>Others upthread were advocating that MTAs don&#x27;t bounce on an initial 5xx failure, regardless of my assertions that the client&#x2F;end user should receive an immediate 5xx perm failure message.<p>Whether a human, or some automated software, as per my upstream statements, the proper thing to do is bounce back to the sender.  5xx, bounce, return.  In 99.9999999% of cases, this is what is needed.  This is the majority case.<p>Then, the mailing list software, the end user, can do as they wish.  Including trying a resend.  I don&#x27;t see the conflict here, except it&#x27;s apparent that a lot of people don&#x27;t have much in the way of MTA experience.  That&#x27;s not even a knock on them, but it is a bit disheartening to see people suggesting massive MTA behaviour&#x2F;RFC alteration for no reason.<p>To speak to mailing list behaviour, as a separate issue from above, repeated hits to 5xx targets will get you blacklisted faster than you can imagine.  It&#x27;s the equivalent of knocking on someone&#x27;s door, them answering and saying &quot;Sorry, Bob moved out&quot;, but you come back all day and night, banging on the door &quot;HEY IS BOB THERE?!&quot;<p>Yeah.  That&#x27;ll work out well.  Just because you can do something, doesn&#x27;t mean you even remotely should.')
