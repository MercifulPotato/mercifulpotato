There are a lot of was to skin the data pipeline cat.  I think a lot of companies already founded data engineering teams, all of whom have established tech-stacks for data engineering tasks.<p>Personally, I keep an eye out on new technologies, but I&#x27;m not likely to embrace them without good reason.  A fragmented tech stack is annoying.<p>This looks an awful lot like Spark to me.  And doesn&#x27;t seem to really solve the problems <i>I</i> typically experience with data engineering.  For me, the biggest issue is orchestration.  I don&#x27;t see any facilities here for managing and executing data pipelines.<p>So, it seems to me that people aren&#x27;t using dataflow more because it looks a lot like legacy products on the market.  And it doesn&#x27;t solve the massive problem of job orchestration and management.  Apache Airflow + python + BigQuery is immensely powerful and dead simple to use.  It&#x27;s going to be hard to compete with.')
