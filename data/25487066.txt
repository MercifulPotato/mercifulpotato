PJDL in few words is a sort of open 1-Wire with a longer range, support for more devices and a stronger immunity to noise.\nSee: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gioblu&#x2F;PJON&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;strategies&#x2F;SoftwareBitBang&#x2F;specification&#x2F;PJDL-specification-v5.0.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gioblu&#x2F;PJON&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;strategies&#x2F;So...</a><p>The core of the community uses PJON over PJDL in home automation systems, irrigation systems, feeding systems ecc. Soon Mysensors will include PJON over PJDL in their list of supported transports. PJON works also over TCP, UDP, MQTT, ESPNOW, LoRa ecc. so generally a router is built and programmed to run 2 instances of PJON for example PJDL and MQTT, to then route data to and from a process running on a real-time operative system<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gioblu&#x2F;PJON&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;routing&#x2F;ARDUINO&#x2F;Network&#x2F;Router&#x2F;Router&#x2F;Router.ino" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gioblu&#x2F;PJON&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;routing&#x2F;...</a><p>which can also run PJON thanks to the wide support of the implementation.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gioblu&#x2F;PJON&#x2F;wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gioblu&#x2F;PJON&#x2F;wiki</a><p>Looks to be handy for many to connect devices, even on different media.<p>Although many also use PJON to implement mesh or peer-to-peer networks, there is a group in Australia building such a network using PJON over LoRa.<p>I must say I hope we will be able to start building a private network infrastructure with it, that would be awesome.<p>Companies and institutions are also implementing PJON within their products and services. AD24, a Czech company, recently created a mesh network over PJON to connect advertising monitors around the city of Prague. It looks there are also few companies in Germany which use PJON to create real world automation systems.<p>Recently contacted by the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) to support the development of a PJON network of temperature and humidity sensors to monitor the vault of the Cathedral of Valencia and avoid its decay, I hope this will end up done, it would be really rewarding.')
