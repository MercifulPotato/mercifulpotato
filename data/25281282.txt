And HN lacks a sense of humor about Tesla and all else Musk. So either you don&#x27;t know your audience or you&#x27;re stirring up bad feeling. Dismissing a context as &quot;silly&quot; is not intellectually interesting and someone is the butt of the joke, which makes it less of a joke. Unless the silly person is you and you are the butt of your own self-deprecation.<p>Good humor is humorous. There&#x27;s something for people to get. And when they get it they feel good. They don&#x27;t feel mocked They don&#x27;t feel stupid - except in a &quot;I wish I had said that&quot; sense. It might start a conversation. But it won&#x27;t start an argument. Good humor doesn&#x27;t tell people &quot;I&#x27;m clever.&quot; It shows them.<p>Good humor is good humored. Good luck.')
