Different colours in taskbar? Nope, was homogeneous in KDE 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3&#x2F;x (the way it is now is unnecessarily distracting). Taskbar on left and bottom? Nope. There was one the bottom, still is. Dock like macOS? Nope, wasn&#x27;t there by default.<p>Also, back in the early days of KDE and GNOME you had applications using all kind of toolkits.
