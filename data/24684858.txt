Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601876718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684457, text='&gt; Take a moment to contemplate out how Coke and Pepsi (ostensibly commodities) can dominate their channels in a supposedly free market - it&#x27;s a little bit similar.<p>You&#x27;re comparing beverage companies with a market share of 30-40 percent (or less depending how you narrowly you define competitors) to Microsoft with a market share ranging from 70-90 percent. Note microsoft was able to come from behind and succeed mostly before the days of software patents.<p>Open source is perversely helped by IP laws because it&#x27;s the only way to create an alternative that can survive. Like bitcoin being anonymous, versus e-gold which was shut down by the govt. Great except we have to wait for hobbyists and others with free time to waste before competing ideas can get implemented.<p>As for hardware being worse than software without IP protection, well it sure is worse than software with IP protection. So I guess it&#x27;ll stay consistent. Maybe the lesson is the nature of hardware is to be commoditized, so you need to put your value in the bundled software.')
