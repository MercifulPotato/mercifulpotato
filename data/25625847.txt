Item(by='codys', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609713110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623774, text='I&#x27;m not sure this comment responds to the parent comment&#x27;s statements very effectively.<p>The parent comment is primarily about the non-internet case becoming uncommon enough that it isn&#x27;t tested (or tested as effectively) as the internet case.<p>The &quot;first&quot; point here gives some very interesting details on the various timing of data necessary for a fix. But then it confusingly makes the claim that &quot;the idea that GPS chip manufacturers have already forgot how to do offline cold starts is a bit silly&quot;. This claim doesn&#x27;t appear to follow from the details about the offline cold starts. Perhaps some information about when these various methods of offline cold starts might help support the claim being made, but even then we&#x27;d have to keep in mind that those introducing new offline cold start methods aren&#x27;t all gps manufs. We should also be careful not to discount offline warm starts or offline semi-warm starts. (iow: handling various pieces of information necessary for bootstrapping and effectively using all components possible without, say, requiring a full almanac download if a partial had been obtained previously).<p>The parent comment doesn&#x27;t make a specific statement about what type of timing for fix when offline (either cold or warm) is reasonable. This makes it a bit funny to talk about the minimums&#x2F;etc for offline cold start at all. The general thrust is that offline has become the uncommon case.<p>I would similarly be more cautious in the &quot;second&quot; point here for that reason: because of the proliferation of GPS into cell phones, I would be unsurprised if the majority of GPS devices were in devices that are &quot;online&quot;. The GPS in those devices is primarily used for fine position information. While it&#x27;s true that it can be used when the gross position estimation fails (due to lack of wifi signals or cell towers), because of the additional power consumption of the GPS radio it is less likely to be used for gross position. I would hesitate to describe this as a &quot;prime scenario&quot;.<p>On the &quot;third&quot; point, I think we&#x27;re ignoring that it&#x27;s fairly easy to break offline cold starts (or make them very bad) without necessarily breaking ongoing ephemerides data. Certainly, it&#x27;s very possible to break both, (given that the data is separate subframes), but one could imagine something breaking almanac assembly (for example), without breaking ephemerides subframe reception&#x2F;decode&#x2F;handling&#x2F;etc.')
