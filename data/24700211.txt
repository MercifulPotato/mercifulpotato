Google already barely has influence over the OEM’s that choose to use it, case in point their recent spat with Samsung over the fact that Samsung keeps patching the kernel in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities. Samsung hasn’t stopped, Google has just started publishing the vulnerabilities to shame Samsung into maybe doing something about it. Is this a scenario where it looks like Google is leaving money on the table? And if this is all the money available from Android that spells bad news for an independent company, since we know from the Google v Oracle filings that Android has made Google something like $10B total over all the years it’s been operating. Android might break even, but I assume it’s operating at a loss so that Google can benefit in a bunch of less direct ways from the fact that it exists.')
