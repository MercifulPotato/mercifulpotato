Affected people in Portugal have a very easy time moving to a different European country and Portugal itself is quite small. So, whereas one could argue that forest fires in the US are unlikely to affect the population dynamics of the US taken as a whole, they are in fact likely to affect population dynamics of Portugal. With people first moving to the coastal areas and Lisbon, and afterwards many moving further to some place like Germany or Scandinavia.')
