It was a compromise between the people who did not want congress to be part of the voting (due to opportunity for corruption) and the ones that did not want a popular vote, because they did not trust the uneducated masses and feared mob rule. So the electoral college was born as compromise.<p>The distribution of votes was actually performed based on population which even included slaves (as 3&#x2F;5 people as another compromise, because the southern states wanted slaves to count for their votes, but not have them vote). It&#x27;s just state populations have changed dramatically since then and the electoral college has not.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;electoral-college-founding-fath...</a>')
