We&#x27;ve had a number of discussions about how it&#x27;s apparently impossible to manually move ones&#x27; own signal private keys from disk storage on an android device onto a new android device. This works among people I know closely and recognize the sound of their voice.<p>Among non technical users, they&#x27;ll just click the equivalent of &quot;okay&quot; and continue chatting without even thinking about what the error message means.')
