In practice though, there are always apps that I need in modern life that only exist for iOS or Android. The carsharing app I use, a few of my banks, and some apps I need for work, etc, all only exist on Android. Is there any solution for running an Android VM inside a Linux phone in order to use these apps that I need that aren&#x27;t available for Linux?')
