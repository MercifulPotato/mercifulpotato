I don&#x27;t miss it at all.  If I&#x27;m bored or tired, every once in a while I&#x27;ll reflexively start to open it in a browser tab but so far I have always caught myself and not gone into the Zuckerworld.<p>I&#x27;m not active on Twitter but I imagine it&#x27;s more of the same.<p>I doubt if some Alternabook that lets conspiracy theorists go nuts in their own little bubble will make the world a better place, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;ll be any worse than what Facebook and Twitter have been doing.')
