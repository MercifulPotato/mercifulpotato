I have every sympathy for artists that can&#x27;t live off their art (because that&#x27;s the dream, right?). But I&#x27;d be curious how any of this would compare to record sales and artists that made money in the past. Arguably your chances of &quot;getting heard&quot; now are far, far greater than previous generations when you&#x27;d actually have to get out and play (or sign a deal with a label). Now you can have fans without ever leaving your bedroom (assuming you understand a little bit about marketing), you can operate completely without a label, or distributor, or manager, or anyone but yourself - if you choose.<p>I think the trouble is a lot of people are <i>literally</i> equating streams to record sales, a bit like an extension of the old MP3 argument (every download is <i>instead</i> of a sale, but now every stream should equate to a sale).<p>A rough google reckons a PRS royalty for a Radio 1 play to be about Â£38 for the song. The Radio 1 breakfast show is 5.13m listeners. I&#x27;d hazard a lot of the plays on Spotify are just as passive as the radio (and it&#x27;s probably replaced the radio for a lot of people). If you&#x27;re working to the same metrics, Spotify pays <i>considerably</i> more per play (again, based on some Googled numbers).<p>Not everyone is going to make a living from music. Even in a world of hyperconsumption there&#x27;s still more music being <i>shared</i> than ever before and can ever be heard. And I keep seeing this argument about how awful Spotify is (and YouTube, and streaming etc etc), but personally I think it&#x27;s fantastic. And I say this will a box of unsold &quot;I was in a band once&quot; records under my bed.')
