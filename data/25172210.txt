Arch (without AUR) has way less total updated packages (7k).<p>* Arch has about the highest percentage of fully updated packages (85%), Debian is lower (72%), and the AUR is even lower (69%).<p>* NixOS rivals the AUR in number of total packages (53k), has a big margin in total latest upstream versions over everything else (24k, thus 30% more than Debian or Arch), but does not have as high as an update percentage (79%) as as Arch.<p>The numbers are not perfect because of split-packages and alternative packages (e.g. the AUR often has addtional `-git` variants), but they give a rough idea.<p>Hope this helps!')
