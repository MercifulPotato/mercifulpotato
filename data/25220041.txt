There are definitely people who have long lasting effects of these drugs. Negative and positive. I have depersonalisation&#x2F;derealization and anxeity disorder after a bad LSD experience. Would it have been triggered without it? Maybe. But what I do know is that shortly after that experience these problems began. I think this overly positive reporting is harmful. I too used to think that drugs aren&#x27;t that bad and it&#x27;s all just propaganda but drugs do mess with your mind and if you value your mental health you should stay away from anything harder than alcohol imo.')
