The value is based on the relationship between the concept and the application.<p>You can say &quot;consistency in code is good&quot; or &quot;consistency in code is bad&quot;, but then you&#x27;ve made an argument and you need back that up with reason.<p>&gt; id prefer someone&#x2F;something that is consistently wrong to someone&#x2F;something that is more often right, but randomly wrong.<p>Just to be clear, we&#x27;re not talking about bugs here, we&#x27;re talking about style where there&#x27;s, sometimes subjectively, &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; more often than &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>&gt; consistency implies methodology that can be changed and adapted, as opposes to simple mistakes that have to be assiduously monitored for.<p>Consistency doesn&#x27;t imply anything of the sort, but if you want to apply consistency to a problem with the goal of being able to change every instance of something you&#x27;re not really solving a problem, unless your actual goal is consistency, which I argue isn&#x27;t actually a goal at all.')
