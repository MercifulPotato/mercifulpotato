That is obviously something a large portion of the country is going to disagree with.<p>Ever since the ousting of Brendan Eich over his Prop 8 donations, right-leaning people have been a bit wary of Mozilla. Many of us still backed them because the ideas they claim to stand for seem noble.<p>Blog posts like the one in question make it very hard not to feel like Mozilla&#x27;s position is &quot;we disagree with you and we don&#x27;t want you around.&quot; If they don&#x27;t want us as users, then maybe it&#x27;s better we go elsewhere.
