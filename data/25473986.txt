For example, I know for a fact that if I don&#x27;t routinely roll out my IT band, it gets too tight and that then results in pressure on the outer portion of the patella. It&#x27;s rather unlikely that&#x27;d show up on an MRI, except perhaps for someone noticing &quot;Hey, maybe your IT band is tight&quot;. Even then, probably not, since it tightens as I begin running.<p>So, there&#x27;s probably something real going on, and something real you can do to fix it. Consistent stretching, rolling, and low-weight exercises to build strength in muscles like your hip abductors makes a world of difference.<p>If you&#x27;re not doing those things, start there. Really do get a roller. The IT band cannot be stretched - since you can&#x27;t exactly flex your femur.')
