The people leading the call actually said the problem was &#x27;volume&#x27; of data. I heard them talk, i&#x27;m not sure they really know what is going on or understand the issue.<p>Also the problem isnt just weather.gov and weather API. Sites like accuweather are likely grabbing raw files from the FTP servers. Everytime a new forecast comes out (for say the GFS), all these people hit the server at same time to download gobs and gobs of data. Yall would be surprised at how much data in is weather prediction outputs!')
