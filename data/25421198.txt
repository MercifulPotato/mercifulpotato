There is also mismatched labels on the axes sometimes they are per machine and sometimes they are per benchmark which made it a little hard to follow. The overall point that the M1 is a viable development machine is really nice to see. I am intrigued by the fact that the air seems to be the mini often timesâ€”I would be interested to know more about why. I would also be interested to see additional benchmarks from other lower level languages like rust, C and Swift.')
