I’d be interested- the problem I have in the FP space is not getting the F# or Haskell experience so you have to “keep up in your spare time” and with other commitments I have to choose what to keep up with and the rarity of FP jobs means it makes more sense to say learn Redux, Sagas, that kind of stuff etc. So I think it’s good if companies like yours would take pure enthusiasm with proven knowledge of other programming languages and desire to learn F#. But I guess it depends as you may have a queue of people wanting a FP job so you can be choosy!')
