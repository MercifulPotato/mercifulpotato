I think of Hume. Our reality is made from our senses. On it&#x27;s own, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine. It needs what it&#x27;s hitting as much as it&#x27;s own internal state. You have the sun at the center of our solar system. You have instruments at the outside we built, as well as telescopes imaging black holes millions of light years away. In between there&#x27;s us. It will be nice to make use of all that for particle pair production in regards to coherent control of quantum biology. In order for the cancer to grow back or the arterial lesions to rupture, they need to disrupt the surface of a super massive black hole.<p>Individuals only need to move in inches to improve their lives:<p>- First step out of bed early in the morning to work.<p>- Opening a clenched fist.<p>- Shutting their mouths.<p>That&#x27;s all it takes and you have a decent life. Nations and states must move light years just to tread water:<p>- Gravitational singularities must be modeled and observed to build positron emitters to lower the cost of cancer treatments at a bill of trillions a year.<p>- Russian communists on the run from all the horrible murders they committed launch the space race while the USA was focused on building highways and celebrity presidents.<p>- The public has seen and done everything and grown coarse so we are looking at AR and even controlling the weather just to entertain and tell a story.<p>Thesis, antithesis, and synthesis just doesn&#x27;t exist. More brute force than anything.  The free market caps violence. Finance and production instead of butchering one another. Leaders can mess up, like China with covid. Leaders don&#x27;t get to tell everyone what to do and are subject to the rules too. You do it. If it works, I&#x27;ll do it too.<p>In the deepest depths of depression, and at the stressful heights of mania, what never fails to bring a smile to my face is the job the greatest generation, my grandparents, did to the monsters and criminals of Europe long ago. Remember when they held a state address just to laugh at FDR? A few short years later, everything&#x27;s bombed out and they are watching their children die of cyanide before they shoot themselves. You are right to be disgusted by them. Instead you should look at the hand that destroyed them. It is much more horrible than you can ever imagine.')
