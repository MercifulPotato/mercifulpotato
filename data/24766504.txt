I&#x27;m reminded of a Vonnegut quote:<p>&gt; “The kick of creation is the act of creating, not anything that happens afterward. [...] write a four line poem. Make it as good as you can. Don’t show it to anybody. Put it where nobody will find it. And you will discover that you have your reward.”<p>That&#x27;s creativity to me. In these months I&#x27;ve been exploring what I can make in Blender, mostly weird stuff, posting it nowhere. Nothing has been more satisfying.')
