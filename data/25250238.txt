When you read about it you&#x27;ll hear it&#x27;s about &quot;how to learn&quot;, so you might disregard it, but by the result of applying the method is a written page that fully expresses the idea. I would start with that and don&#x27;t worry about the document becoming too large, just continue as necessary. Finally, aggressively edit the document. If it&#x27;s very long there may be some &quot;prerequisite&quot; post to write before your desired topic, but you can mostly just pull out the prerequisite content, and then re-edit the original one to account for that.<p>[0] There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a single canonical document to read but there&#x27;s thousands readily searchable.')
