Seems like a pretty easy thing to stay clear of.<p>Ohhhh. You hear that? Overturning a fair democratic election. Where was the same argument when the whole Russia narrative played out - including intelligence agencies trying to &quot;wire&quot; the sitting president and sending agents to his national security advisor&#x27;s residence to frame him? And trying to plot 25th amendment. And the whole 3years subsequent to that trying to find &quot;collusion&quot;.<p>Also there is no evidence the founders of Parler were actively trying to sabotage the election and install illegitimate president. Some rouge users decided to co-ordinate through apps like Parler and FB. Same applies for FB.')
