As a negative example, just look what happened to Slashdot and Reddit. Slashdot&#x27;s redesign ten years ago in particular seemed really well-done at first, but took away &quot;substance&quot; for lack of a better term, and so did Reddit&#x27;s.<p>That said, maybe HN could place the logout button further away from the login name&#x2F;link while preserving info density eg <i>without a fat&#x2F;dick menu</i>. Right now, these two small touch areas on top of another are mildly prone to mis-clicking on mobile.')
