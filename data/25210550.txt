Bitcoin has the longest history, good team management, wide distribution, a track record. Just as people judge fiat currencies by the stability of the government behind them we do the same with crypto.<p>This is why Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether are on top, but other coins will rise as well. This is what we&#x27;re seeing today - Crypto scaling horizontally to deal with scaling issues and transaction fees.<p>I don&#x27;t see any government making a crypto the &#x27;default transaction mechanism&#x27; as it would work against the government itself.  Being able to control your currency, and print more when need be is what allows a country to manage their long term debt and fund things like large infrastructure projects (or wars etc..)<p>Crypto is just like gold, just better at storing value than gold in every way - so people are moving over to it. Just as gold doesn&#x27;t replace cash and credit cards - don&#x27;t expect crypto to either.')
