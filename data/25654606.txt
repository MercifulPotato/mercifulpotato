That&#x27;s a crime. He can play victim all he wants in his BMW SUV, he got off lucky, both legally and extralegally.<p>Of course the video&#x27;s edited to only show the pissed of cyclists.<p>Having done a lot of this kind of riding, let me tell you what likely happened: The kids were riding as a group, acting stupid (running reds, popping wheelies, etc.). BMW driver either said something to them, or drove aggressively near the group. The group rides, surrounding his car to fuck with him a little. BMW driver hits his brakes rather than slow down, cyclist crashes into the SUV (this part is confirmed). Kids are livid, and the pedestrian camera rolls.<p>The alternative to that sequence is that these kids are beating the shit out of an SUV with their bicycles unprovoked. Not buying it.')
