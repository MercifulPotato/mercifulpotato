I found out about Miller[1] a year or so back and have been using that instead. I don&#x27;t know how it stacks up in terms of performance, but for my money, named arguments and one-shot statistics is all I need.<p>For example analysing the number of people per-year over multiple differently formatted files is as easy as `mlr uniq  -f pid,year then count -g year`. It has filtering, very extensive manipulation capabilities and a nice documentation.<p>John has also reacted very fast on feature requests I had (so fast that I&#x27;ve not yet implemented using them).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miller.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miller.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;#overview</a>')
