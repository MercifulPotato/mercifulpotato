It feels quite powerful and the syntax is pretty easy to understand. It could just be my personal lack of experience with Lisp, but there seems to be little standard in naming conventions and code formatting. This may be where a lot of developers look at Lisp code and declare it an unmaintainable mess. Often I&#x27;ve seen multiple styles of formatting in the same file when I look at non-emacs production code.')
