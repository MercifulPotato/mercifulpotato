(Not every frame, but upon receiving an event.)<p>Except that a a retained mode GUI can easily tell that no redraw is necessary and it will be a no-op.<p>&gt; With modern GPUs, redrawing a whole frame is super cheap, even with integrated graphics.<p>It&#x27;s cheap as in fast, but it&#x27;s not cheap in power consumption having to wake up the GPU from sleep state to redraw what&#x27;s already on the screen.<p>This matters with battery powered devices.<p>&gt; The gain, then, is going to come from not having to rebuild the scene graph every frame.<p>Rebuilding a scene graph that&#x27;s based on CSS-style flexbox layout is REALLY fast. It&#x27;s a linear time operation in the worst case and a lot of the work can be just skipped if the layout doesn&#x27;t need updating.<p>Check out Raph Levien&#x27;s talk which I linked to in my top level posting. He discusses the implementation details to make this smoking fast.<p>Text layout is by far the most time consuming operation in rebuilding a GUI scene graph.<p>The way this is done in the Druid UI library is probably a lot faster than what ImGui does, if you exclude the time it takes to do text layout with HarfBuzz.<p>All of this is pretty moot point, because the most important factor in performance and battery consumption is not to wake up the GPU to do unnecessary work.')
