In my experience in the UK anyway.<p>In the past I&#x27;ve had disputes where I&#x27;ve made tens of phone calls to customer support people who cannot solve the problem but pretend they will.  Every call is groundhog day.<p>Now, if the problem isn&#x27;t solved by the first phone call I write a letter.<p>A short paragraph (one or two sentences) describing what happened and why it is a problem.  A short paragraph describing what I want.  Then all the tedious detail.  And conclude by restating the problem and what I want.  No threats.<p>It hasn&#x27;t failed yet.')
