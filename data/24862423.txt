Now we arenâ€™t here to complain about Apollo, because it does do a fantastic job at providing in-depth and valuable insights into what is going on under the hood in your GraphQL deployments. However, for all the analytics it does provide, it does not currently track subscription data.\nNo analytics === no optimization.\nOur new npm suite Aqls solves this problem.')
