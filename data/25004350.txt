I spent the summer of 2017 interning in Helsinki for Smartly (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartly.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartly.io&#x2F;</a>) and had an amazing time. I&#x27;ve heard the winter is a little bit different, but I&#x27;m willing to try it out. For anyone else thinking about it -- don&#x27;t be worried about the language barrier, everyone speaks English, and you can mostly pass as a native by mumbling, saying kiitos, and shrugging your shoulders.')
