Tesla pours capital into building infrastructure to deploy vast fleet of BEVs!<p>Details in Harvard Business Review!<p>This would have been news in 2014 or so. That&#x27;s when Tesla&#x27;s efforts to get this right started being obvious.  I&#x27;m glad HBR caught up to it, even if they&#x27;re years late to the party.<p>Telsa is getting it right. For their Superchargers, they have excellent location-scouting crews, permitting crews, construction crews, alliance-building crews, and maintenance crews. Not to mention the actual equipment, centrally monitored. It&#x27;s no simple thing to convince rural convenience store operators and building inspectors to install electrical equipment that draws more than a megawatt.<p>Most people other than Tesla customers don&#x27;t know this: they lined up a world-wide network of electricians trained to install those 40a x 240v connectors at peoples&#x27; homes and businesses.<p>They must have imbibed Geoffrey Moore&#x27;s &quot;Crossing the Chasm.&quot; Until the Model 3 started appearing in 2017, their customers were classic early adopters. (I was one.) They managed to turn their early vehicles into Veblen goods (where demand goes up as price goes up). That would not have worked without the infrastructure they built. (I didn&#x27;t buy Ludicrous Mode: it cost an extra US$15K and I would have used it once or twice for the lulz. But I did buy a big battery.)<p>If Tesla&#x27;s mission were merely to sell cars, they would have failed. Many years ago.<p>Today&#x27;s bafflement for me: do electric grid operators understand what&#x27;s happening in the next thirty years? Do they know they&#x27;re going to win almost all the business of fuel stations? Are they preparing for that? If so, they&#x27;re awful quiet about it.')
