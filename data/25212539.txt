To my way of conceptualising, Entropy is something like the inverse of data. What makes one state less ordered than another? The more ordered state requires less data to be fully described.<p>In that sense there is an underlying reality to entropy, but it&#x27;s impossible to be sure, an ordered state could seem disordered if we lack the data that would describe it. I think we understand entropy to the same degree we understand data, and as data science develops I hope we&#x27;ll develop a better understanding of entropy as a consequence.<p>Heat makes for a good proxy though.')
