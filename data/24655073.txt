Please consider doing this before commenting, because in my opinion it really illuminates how silly this all is.<p>4K: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;hZ1OgQL9_Cw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;hZ1OgQL9_Cw</a><p>Original: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;aohXOpKtns0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;aohXOpKtns0</a><p>The colorization, of course, is lies. The upscaling and interpolation, however, is harder to argue about. Sure, if you were to freeze a frame and zoom in, you are looking at data that may not directly correspond to what was recorded. But it didn’t come out of thin air either - its upscaled and interpolated. I have read the arguments and some of the comments on this page and I still cannot figure out how this isn’t just rationalizing elitism.<p>Of course we need to keep the source material, but nobody is suggesting to not do that.')
