You have a just right of center party and a far right party. Pick any Democrat (with a few exceptions) and pop them in another countries left party (Uk labour for instance) and they would be sent over the aisle with jeers.<p>My assumption is that the Cold War and fear of anything vaguely “commie” pushed the US that way as the gov in the 50s and 60s seems (from anecdotes) to have been very progressive.<p>I would love to see what would happen if you had single transferable vote (or similar) that picked the single issue voters away from the GOP. You might find a situation where the dems become everyone’s second choice because they are firmly in the Center and it would show just how unprogressive they really are (or at least how they appear to be to an international audience)<p>It still blows my brain that there isn’t wide spread single payer&#x2F;NHS style health care in the richest country in the world.<p>And don’t get us started on gun control, I’ve travelled to dozens of countries around the world and nowhere have I felt less safe than SF&#x2F;Buffalo&#x2F;NY&#x2F;Miami&#x2F;Jackson.')
