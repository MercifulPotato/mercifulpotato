And if they do hit the jackpot, well, they become the megacorps (or achieve &quot;success&quot; by being sold to a megacorp).<p>I generally agree with what Drew is saying here, but it&#x27;s important to remember it&#x27;s not just the business&#x27;s size. It&#x27;s the mentality and values. A &quot;lifestyle business&quot; that isn&#x27;t dedicated to growth at any cost may be less likely to leave a trail of bodies behind it, but petty mundane evil still exists in mom-and-pop shops. It&#x27;s all part of the same capitalist system, from top to bottom.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to maintain any values when your life depends on submitting to capitalism, and I think picking on specific entities within capitalism may be a distraction. It&#x27;s easier to make choices based on your values if e.g. leaving a job doesn&#x27;t mean losing your healthcare during a pandemic. Only systemic change can meaningfully prevent the evils of megacorps, rather than shuffling around who is doing the harm that capitalism incentivizes.<p>I do think you should avoid working for evil megacorps, but perhaps it&#x27;s not the best use of your time and energy to vilify people who feel that doing so is necessary. It may be better to help e.g. unionize those workforces so they can organize to e.g. hold Amazon to their climate commitments.')
