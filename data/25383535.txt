I don’t believe you’re arguing in good faith and I think you’re full of shit.<p>Then why did you reply to me? What value is there in engaging in some bad faith bullshitter on the internet? Don&#x27;t you believe that I&#x27;m going to respond with more bad faith bullshit and further confuse anyone who isn&#x27;t rational and detached enough to see <i>the truth</i>?<p>&gt; Because, after these last four years saying “bad actors on both sides” means that you’ve chosen to either obscure or deny reality.<p>After all this you&#x27;re not even able to see how there could be bad faith actors on both sides? You don&#x27;t think that bad faith actors on your own side might harm your cause or detract from your message? Or you don&#x27;t think they exist?<p>&gt; What you’re doing is dangerous to democracy and you should be ashamed of yourself.<p>I get that you&#x27;re passionate about this so can you explain this statement? If me sharing my opinion is so dangerous then why is it safer to let me vote? I&#x27;m genuinely curious how you can think that its good for the common person to cast a ballot but its bad for the common person to share their opinions on the integrity of the election.<p>&gt; I’m not saying YouTube removing this content is the right move, but your logic only holds up in a fantasyland devoid of fact or context.<p>What&#x27;s the error in my logic? Is trump uniquely bad so the normal rules don&#x27;t apply, or is there something dangerous about the idea that people who decide whose opinions should be heard are potentially bad faith actors who could corrupt the discourse?')
