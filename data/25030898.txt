Then speaks about the same lack of Democratic turnout in Texas, because it always go Republican (again, due to the electoral college).<p>But wouldn’t those same effect apply to Republicans as well?  They don’t bother to vote in CA because there is a 0% probability they will affect the outcome.  And in addition, there are likely Republicans in Texas who don’t vote because they know the state will go Republican.<p>I would argue that if you dropped the electoral college, you’d see a massive change in how people vote and it’s not obvious that the popular vote would remain the same.')
