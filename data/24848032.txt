I&#x27;m very familiar with TNF-Alpha inhibitors as I have tried several. I started on Remicade which actually worked, but my rheumatologist at the time foolishly switched me to Humira for the sake of convenience. Once I switched, it did not work anymore nor have I had any response from a TNF inhibitor since (switched back to Remicade and also tried Enbrel). I switched to a better rheumatologist who explained to me that if you start and stop a TNF inhibitor, they may never work again as your body adapts to the medicine.<p>I don&#x27;t mind though, I have health anxiety and got a few weirds symptoms and infections on the TNF inhibitors. Many patients lives are changed by TNF inhibitors and those therapies are game changers in rheumatology. For me, however, the medicines scare me because of the side effects I had and don&#x27;t work anyway.<p>I also tried sulfasalazine but had the rare side effect of falling white blood cell counts. Given the level of my disease activity which has been radiographically slow and that my day to day pain is manageable, I prefer to be off medicine and deal with the pain.<p>I still love to ski when I can and will still do those activities which bring me happiness (hiking, dancing, etc.). For me though, I get tendonitis when starting or attempting really any form of regular exercise.<p>Thanks for your reply and I wish you the best in your treatment.')
