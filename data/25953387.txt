You are not &#x27;paying someone&#x27; at all. It&#x27;s not your money. The basic income is paid to all, similar to roads and police and fire.<p>The additional goods and services it buys, come from advances in automation, which are consuming jobs at a geometric rate.  Nobody is enslaved to make these things for us (already true for most things).<p>This attitude is simply the old Protestant Work Ethic writ large - folks that cannot stand to think anybody might not have to slave away at a job.<p>To draw it clear: is it actually necessary to have an underpaid below-poverty class of workers to make our society function? It cannot exist without them? Was Marx right all along? Is that what is being argued?')
