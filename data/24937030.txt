How are they vilifying him if they&#x27;re literally helping him spread the word?<p>I think you&#x27;re using &quot;The media&quot; very liberally there. Were there pundits on some cable channel vilifying him? Sure. But that is in no way equivalent to every single major news publication refusing to back NYP on this report.')
