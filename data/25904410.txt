Item(by='atomicnumber3', descendants=None, kids=[25904529], score=None, time=1611589200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904135, text='I&#x27;m from the middle of nowhere, USA. I recently left a local job that paid significantly more than &quot;normal&quot; software jobs locally (though fairly modest by by SF&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;Seattle&#x2F;Chicago&#x2F;etc standards), and I was quite lucky to have been able to work there. Truly an outlier even among outliers.<p>I left for family reasons (we were moving cities) and basically just assumed I would need to work remote to find comparable comp. Still, I applied to a few local places that happened to be allowing &quot;work from home&quot;.<p>The offers were just depressingly low. In talks with one local place, I put down my current base pay + current (expected) annual bonus as what I wanted for my base pay. The recruiter told me they&#x27;d be very unlikely to be able to come close to that, because the number I&#x27;d put down was the <i>top</i> end of the range that they paid people with <i>twenty five</i> years of experience. I ended up doing their interview process just to get practice but due to a clerical error on their side, despite the fact that the result of the interview process was a decision to hire, they weren&#x27;t able to make me an offer because all the positions had filled up. So I&#x27;m still technically waiting on their promise that &quot;as soon as a position opens up, you&#x27;re the first person I&#x27;ll be calling&quot;.<p>Anyway, I took an offer from a coastal company for 3-4x what I suspect they were going to be offering me.<p>The worst part is this company was lauded as one of the best, highest-paying, most-generous-benefits-having companies in my area.<p>So, I dunno. Clearly whatever they&#x27;re doing works for them. But I&#x27;ve got a fairly dim view of my local job markets. I also suspect they&#x27;ll be the kinds of places that just outsource development and&#x2F;or die rather than raise dev pay if widespread-post-covid-remote-work raises salaries locally.')
