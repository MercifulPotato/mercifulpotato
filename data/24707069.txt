Wrong, I say!<p>I once wore a baseball hat for a month, day in, day out, sleep, etc.  However first, I ripped out the liner, and placed tinfoil inside, replacing the liner afterwards.<p>I wanted to empirically test -- to see, would I behave differently?  Think differently?  So I also kept a journal.<p>Problem was, did I EVER SWEAT!  And this was in the winter too.<p>The solution?  A hat which is not directly in contact with the head!  And has space under it to breath.  Like this hard-hat!<p>Clearly, this kid knows the truth, knows the forces aligned against us all, and this hardhat, in this pic, is his message to us all.<p>Beware.  Beware of them, of those, placing thoughts in our minds!')
