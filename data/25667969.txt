It&#x27;s a client-server protocol. There is no coordination in connection setup. And it&#x27;s TCP. It&#x27;s not designed to do the necessary gymnastics to establish incoming connections through a NAT. So HTTP being HTTP is not an argument for NAT traversal being impossible.\na) it&#x27;s much easier with UDP where you can multiplex incoming and outgoing traffic over a single socket and it&#x27;ll work for any remote peer as long as your UDP NAT uses EIMs.')
