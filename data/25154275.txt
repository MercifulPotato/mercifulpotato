TAI matters when you have to manipulate the non-zoned wall clock (as opposed to date and time components) and that&#x27;s surprisingly rare.<p>&gt; If your system uses TAI in its distributed coordination mechanisms, you don&#x27;t need to worry about leap seconds and an error in the UTC-TAI difference won&#x27;t cause your system to fail<p>This is a legitimate concern, but TAI is not <i>the</i> solution (you should probably be using PTP or GPS clock if you do care that much) nor an essential part of the solution (any monotonic clock, including &quot;leap smears&quot; and UTC-SLS, will do fine). In fact I think most perceived benefits of TAI are actually of monotonic clocks and not inherent to TAI, and UTC <i>is</i> already monotonic... (Yes, I&#x27;m distinguishing the actual UTC and time_t; for the latter there is a relatively simple conversion to monotonic however.)')
