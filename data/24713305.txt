But that&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; Linux, so you don&#x27;t have to spend time installing GNU tooling or fighting with brew.<p>So instead I can run IntelliJ under WSL2? Nope, not until there&#x27;s a performant X server. Ok, so under Windows, pointed at my Linux filesystem? Wouldn&#x27;t there be dos2unix file format issues there? And it sounds like it&#x27;s painfully slow for now until they fix the networking.<p>But this is somehow better than having to &quot;brew install&quot; a few things? I&#x27;m very eager to try this out, but I think WSL3 might be a better starting point.')
