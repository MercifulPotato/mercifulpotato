Furthermore, though this limit is universal, it does (in a well defined way) depend on your prior knowledge. It may seem paradoxical but isn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s just too long for this space....<p>It is not proof in the mathematical sense, mostly because your statement cannot be qualified in such a sense, but it strongly hints that &quot;it would be amazing&quot; because it is impossible.<p>Which is not to say we cannot do better than where we are today; but there is likely no solution that is, along all scenarios, better.')
