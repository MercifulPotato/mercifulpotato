With software automation all these events could be handled automatically.<p>The cynic in me says NASA has been encouraged to put in an objection by SpaceX who run a competing constellation.  Spacex&#x27;s constellation requires special ground stations, unlike this which can transmit direct to an existing 4G phone.  That makes this a big business risk for SpaceX.')
