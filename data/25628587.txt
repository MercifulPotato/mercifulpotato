A group of people much more likely to listen to Bob Dylan or Creedence Clearwater Revival than to Streisand.<p>Likewise, the sort of people associated with Streisand concerts -- mainly well-to-do, cosmopolitan, white (especially, but not exclusively, Jewish) women -- would not trust a shaggy man with a rusting VW bus with their money, let alone be interested in his handmade wares when there are perfectly good boutiques on Fifth Avenue (or Rodeo Drive) to patronize if they are in need of clothing.<p>OP was trying to imply that the people who still use Java have fundamentally different tastes than dynamic-language programmers, and so evangelizing Clojure to them would be a fundamental mismatch in tastes, like a hippie trying to sell to upscale white women.')
