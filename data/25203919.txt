Item(by='news_to_me', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606258146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203038, text='A progress bar is only appropriate to show one metric changing between two known points over time.<p>- A progress bar should not measure multiple tasks, unless each task is of the same type (e.g. converting a batch of files, _not_ system booting)<p>- A progress bar should not measure &quot;time left&quot; unless it is literally tied to the value of a timer (i.e. _not_ &quot;time left to download big file&quot;)<p>- A progress bar does not show &quot;busy state&quot; â€” a spinner does that. A progress bar can stop if e.g. it measures bytes of a file downloaded and the network connection drops; a spinner will still spin.<p>- A progress bar should include a label to explicitly state what it is measuring (otherwise users will assume it means &quot;time left&quot;)<p>People like to see progress bars because they want to know &quot;progress is being made&quot;, but a progress bar is not always appropriate, depending on the situation. Instead, consider using:<p>- Spinners show activity is happening. Use when there isn&#x27;t a single metric to report, or the &quot;bounds&quot; of the metric aren&#x27;t known.<p>- A checklist can show different tasks completed in sequence. Can be combined with a spinner on the &quot;current&quot; task<p>- A segmented progress bar can replace a checklist when each task could be represented by a progress bar<p>Just my opinions, I guess, and obviously we don&#x27;t live in the world where the above is applied, but it feels good to have it sorted in my own head. Curious what others think of this scheme.')
