I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very effective method to bypass them.<p>At least, that&#x27;s what I can gather from the linked issue and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uBlock&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;1.25.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uBlock&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;1.25.0</a> â€“ so I&#x27;m not sure if I understand that article.<p>In goatcounter the whole CNAME thing was just intended as a cute &quot;shortcut&quot; so you can have &quot;stats.example.com&quot;; I assumed that all adblockers would deal with that correctly, and it was never intended as a way to bypass them (and certainly never advertised as such).<p>As for &quot;selling IP address&quot;, how do you know &quot;blog.example.com&quot; isn&#x27;t just collecting and selling that? Or HN for that matter?')
