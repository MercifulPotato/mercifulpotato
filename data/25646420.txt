This is the kind of thing that makes me question if removing coffee from my routine is really worth it in the long run.  I have two young kids so a bad nights sleep (not from insomnia but from kids) is going to make my next day super unproductive.<p>I definitely drink large cups in the morning but don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s causing my problems except if I don&#x27;t drink coffee and the afternoon lull.  If I was being honest the hope would be that going cold turkey would have a completely level, focused energy all day long but that isn&#x27;t a realistic outcome and I trade out an enjoyable morning routine (coffee w&#x2F;bagels, coffee w&#x2F;biscotti).<p>The outcomes everyone talks about don&#x27;t quite resonate with me - though I don&#x27;t love the idea of being beholden to coffee&#x2F;caffeine.  Not being dismissive of everyones benefits I find myself questioning the long term benefit.  I feel like I&#x27;m missing something.')
