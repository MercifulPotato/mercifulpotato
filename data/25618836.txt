I used to do my idle browsing on both, the PC and the phone. In an earlier bout of productivity (many moons ago) I blocked all the usual suspects on my PC. That was several years (and PCs) ago - but there&#x27;s now never an inclination to hop over to those sites on the PC and the &quot;missing out&quot; feeling isn&#x27;t there since I can check &#x27;em on the phone (later). For whatever reason, it feels more like goofing off when I&#x27;m on the phone, so there&#x27;s a slight aversion to doing that during the regular day.')
