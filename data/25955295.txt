Now I have -$200 of cash.  (The UI doesn’t necessarily show it like that, but that’s what’s in my account.). If the stock goes up to $600, I still have -$200 of cash. If the stock drops to $400, I still have -$200 of cash. If the volatility estimates change such that a rapid crash to $199 seems likely, the broker should margin call me, as a crash to $199 would send my account value negative.<p>Contrast this with non-margin trading. If I deposit $400 and buy $300 of stock, I have $100 of cash, and the broker doesn’t particularly care what happens to the stock price, since they are taking no risk.  Their clearer may impose requirements on them, but that’s a somewhat separate issue.')
