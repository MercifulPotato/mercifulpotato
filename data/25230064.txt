Tours are already dangerous enough as is, a bike breaking poses a danger to all riders on the course not just the rider. Weight minimums ensure that there&#x27;s not an attempt to drop the structural weight below safe limits.<p>That said, weights can be decreased over time if there are legitimately new weight saving technologies that do not compromise strength of the bike.')
