You&#x27;d figure out how to minimize bias in the algorithms and in the data, and identify any other sources that could introduce bias, and figure out how to put controls on developers and data collectors to prevent bias ... right?<p>Ok, now go look at what is actually discussed in AI bias papers.<p>Sometimes I feel the emperor has no clothes and everyone just pretends like vacuous bullshit is something profound because if you criticize the papers you&#x27;ll be fired or blacklisted in Silicon Valley.')
