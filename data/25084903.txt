Having different computer languages allows people to express ideas (solve problems) more efficiently given the domain of the problem. Very basic example: I wouldn&#x27;t use zsh to write an xmpp server implementation (but it&#x27;s possible) and I wouldn&#x27;t use Java to call a handful of unix commands (also possible).')
