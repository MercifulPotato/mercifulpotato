Essentially if the show isn&#x27;t a hit immediately after release, it won&#x27;t be renewed, and the threshold required to renew goes up exponentially every season, so essentially a show has to be a runaway hit in order to survive past the second season.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is a data-driven decision, and I guess it shows that novelty is probably what drives people to the platform and gets new subscribers. It makes intuitive sense: with most forms of media the largest number of people will give something a try when it&#x27;s new, and aside from very rare exceptions the viewer base will settle in to a much lower number of &quot;true fans&quot;.<p>So it makes sense in the short term from a business perspective, and they have way more data than I do from my armchair, but I wonder if they are adequately assessing the risk of this decision model. People get deeply emotionally attached to media, and it&#x27;s a strong negative when a series you love is cancelled, so this could negatively affect their brand over time. And that&#x27;s not something which is so easy to design KPI&#x27;s around as new subscriber numbers.<p>I suspect Netflix would have to see increased churn due to pressure from competitors to see more serious attention paid to loyalty and retention.')
