This strawman is presented every time this topic comes up.  It&#x27;s not about the quality of the Post&#x27;s journalism.  It&#x27;s about whether Twitter should restrict it.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading the Post off and on for the last 40 years, and you are correct that it is a rag.  But it is a newspaper.  A newspaper with a better reputation for reporting the news than Twitter.<p>Not every article is going to be to your taste, or ape your point of view.  And as newspapers go, it is very sensational.   This is not a secret.  Everyone knows what to expect when they pick up a copy.  And they read it with that filter in mind.  This is literacy 101.<p>But people on HN try to falsely characterize it as the equivalent of the National Enquirer.  It isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a legitimate newspaper, whether you like it or not.<p>99.9% of the Post criticism I see on HN is from people who have never lived in New York. Never actually read the Post, or any other newspaper.  They just amplify and repeat the echo chamber hyperbole they see from other people who have never read the Post.  Some of the most vocal have stated in other threads that they are Twitter employees.<p>If I have to choose between the Post being an information gatekeeper and Twitter, I&#x27;ll go with the Post every time.')
