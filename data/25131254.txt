It&#x27;s so attractive to think that &quot;this one new feature will make all the difference, so I should probably just focus on coding rather than talking to users.&quot;<p>Has anyone found a particularly effective way to overcome this? Is it just a lack of discipline on my end? (Maybe I need to reread &quot;The Mom Test&quot; a few more times...)')
