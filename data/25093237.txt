You advise your grandpa to do better than &quot;password&quot; and he might move to &quot;Password1!&quot;.  You advise him to not reuse passwords...and that&#x27;s really hard without a password manager, so he reuses passwords.<p>But yeah, your password choices very much matter and those choices can foil {credential stuffing, password spray, brute force}, which is admitted but downplayed in the article.<p>Considering that most people reading the article will be security-minded, a far better title would have been &quot;Your Users&#x27; Password Choices Often Don&#x27;t Matter&quot;.')
