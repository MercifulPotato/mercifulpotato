But there is a need for a &quot;smart grid&quot;.<p>We, in France, have a very primitive system based peak &#x2F; off-peak hours used in many houses, and I expect other countries to have the same kind of system since it is so simple.<p>Basically, you have an extra wire coming out of the meter. If there is voltage, it is peak hours, if there is no voltage, if is off-peak. To that wire, you connect a relay which sits in the breaker panel. That relay can turn a circuit on or off, often the water heater, so that it only runs off-peak. You can force it on if you know you are going to use more hot water than usual.<p>Such a simple thing, but updated in real time can already go a long way. In a more advanced system, the meter could tell you the price of electricity via PLC and you could have a relay in your breaker box that turns on a circuit depending on price.<p>Even smarter devices could receive the signal from the meter directly and do more things, for example, many appliances have a &quot;delayed start&quot; function. A &quot;start when electricity is cheap&quot; function would be a great addition.<p>The problem is that would require standardization. A standard protocol shared by utilities and electric device manufacturers. As for communication, PLC sounds ideal, it doesn&#x27;t have to be fast, and it could also be the same signal used by the utility to remotely check the meter for billing (something that is being deployed in France, BTW).')
