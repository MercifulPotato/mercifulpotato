If the vaccine could prevent silent transmission it could stop them from unwittingly passing on the virus. &quot;That&#x27;s a big deal. Because that means the virus could be stopped in its tracks,&quot; says Pollard.<p>Intriguingly, when the trial results came out, there were indications it may partly suppress transmission of the virus. But more evidence is needed.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Crucially, no-one who got the vaccine was hospitalised or got seriously ill due to Covid. Whereas in the control group there were 10 serious cases and one death.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Perhaps, regardless of immunity, it reduces symptoms to &quot;not serious&quot;, and may reduce transmission, which the other vaccines do not?  Which seems like a fair trade for high immunity percentages, and possibly better for the wider community.')
