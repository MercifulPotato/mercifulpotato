I haven&#x27;t seen any Coke Cola Ads for years,  not online digital Ads and I rarely consume any traditional media. But I will still buy Coke Cola every once in a while.<p>They are also on all of the convenience store with decent positional shelf space or visual merchandising. Something I learned that no one on HN actually knows anything about during the discussions of App Store.<p>Edit: All of my friends can taste the difference between Coke and Pepsi. It is just different. So I was surprised to read comments and youtube video about &quot;blind tasting&quot; on the two. No, I didn&#x27;t drink Coke because of Ads, I drink it because it taste better. (And some people prefer Pepsi )')
