I&#x27;m not worth much at all, but slowly (and thanks mainly to YNAB) I&#x27;ve managed to build up 5 digits of cash (savings, not folding), rather than living paycheck to paycheck. This is a huge load of daily stress I used to have that I no longer do. My credit card is for convenience and frequent flyer points, not something I might not eat without. I bought the missus a (6-year-old, boring) car recently, and I did so with a personal loan not because I had to but because I <i>chose</i> to keep the money on hand, and the world is a little shaky right now. I didn&#x27;t have to accept a lien on the car, and if there were a crunch on my cashflow I can make minimum payments for a while.<p>I don&#x27;t have &quot;fuck you money&quot;, and probably never will, but even this much peace of mind has helped my mental health significantly.')
