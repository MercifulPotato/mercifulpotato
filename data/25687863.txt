On some kind of stack of records from calls? That will grow linearly with the number of calls? So that&#x27;s a call-stack is it? The <i>whole point</i> of TCO was to eliminate the stack and you&#x27;ve re-invented it there! If you have an infinite tail-call (like a web server accepting requests in a loop) you&#x27;ll have an infinitely long list of records with your idea.<p>&gt; It’s certainly not something that is common, or commonly understood as a requirement for optimization.<p>In many languages (Python, Ruby, Java, etc) they are not debug information - they&#x27;re part of the program semantics and (from experience!) if you change them you&#x27;ll break programs.')
