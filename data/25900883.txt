(That said, I am curious if this is a problem occurring in almost all or almost no other countries!)<p>As far as I understand, these problems are also in the process of being fixed in the US via caller ID authentication (to enable carrier-level filtering), which seems like the right approach: In the long term, it&#x27;s more or less futile to keep a phone number out of data breaches or advertiser databases.')
