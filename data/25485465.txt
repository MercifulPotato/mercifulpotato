I use it daily and don&#x27;t know what half of them do.<p>knowing what the other half does is usually a couple clicks away on the web, a &#x27;man ...&#x27; away in the terminal, sources are usually available at a similar distance, and most of these services can be stopped and (forever?) disabled with a &#x27;systemctl stop&#x2F;disable ...&#x27; (you might even go the extra step and apt remove them). Trimming down stuff that you know you don&#x27;t need is a pleasure (assuming you know what you&#x27;re doing), and the end result is a leaner, faster system. Eg. after I installed AnyDesk, I didn&#x27;t like that it started with the system (I&#x27;m paranoid, and I&#x27;m only using it occasionally), so I systemctl disabled it. This doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it when I need (that is, to assist others. In the rare events when I need remote access <i>to my system</i>, I just use a reverse SSH tunnel, which is more practical for me)')
