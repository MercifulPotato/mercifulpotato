They number each point.  This helps person replying to address each point separately.<p>2.    When hiring, a candidate is asking a lot of questions.  An email with a proactive communication is a win over another candidate that fails to communicate, is silent, or inability to communicate over writing.<p>This should allow for the responder, manager, whoever, to respond back and also synthesize whether follow up call is required.  Writing is one channel for communication and can be efficient if done right.<p>I also found that non-english native speakers tend to write quite well.  Superfluous words are omitted and usually the &quot;essence&quot; of the idea is straight to the point which makes it easy to clarify any ambiguity, if any.  Whereas you might expect to literally take on face value what was written by a native speaker without hesitation.')
