It looks fascinating.<p>A lot more interesting to me than the bonsai installation.  I have an aesthetic and a practical concern. Practically pines (and many others) naturally have a dormant period over the winter, which is amongst the reasons why bonsai live outside. Some trees die without it. It also looks like a great environment for fungal growth!<p>Aesthetically this is more like seeing a person on life support than seeing them alive.  Like bonsai tree in the matrix.<p>I guess this is just an art installation though, but I hope they don&#x27;t kill the tree.')
