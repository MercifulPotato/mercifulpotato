I don&#x27;t have time to shave yaks with respect to database access, cloud storage, etc.<p>The savings in just going over to GCP or AWS and filtering your &quot;potential languages&quot; by the list of supported languages seems impossible to overestimate.<p>If you want something with more safety machinery than Go (and I get it, so do I), I think your real choices for a language that needs to interact with cloud providers are something on .NET, or something on the JVM - you pick one, and you go solve your actual problems instead of having to write your own stdlib.<p>I&#x27;d be way more open to experimenting on the front-end with buckle-&gt;rescript or similar, where I&#x27;m leveraging existing JS libraries and don&#x27;t have to worry about high quality database drivers.')
