I like to think of it like Discord but for work.<p>For context, since the pandemic, my company have been more flexible in term of working remotely. Although we do use tools like Microsoft Teams to communicate with each other, I still feel that there are something missing.<p>In an office environment, If I have a question for my team members, I can just hop into his desk with my laptop and have a chat. This sort of interaction is a bit hard to replicate online with existing tool. I think because the act of &quot;calling&quot; someone makes it a barrier to have this sort of small chats. That&#x27;s why I created <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inoffice.chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inoffice.chat</a>.<p>What makes Inoffice different is that there is no &quot;call&quot; concept. If you see someone you want to talk to you can just hop into his &quot;desk&quot; and start talking. You can also see who your other team member are talking to and join in if you want.<p>I&#x27;m hoping by reducing the barrier of initiating a conversation with your team member, it can promote you to talk more with your team members.<p>Any feedback is welcome.<p>Thank You!')
