If the law was followed to the letter, and if somebody nosy had enough access and time to inspect the past 15 years of my life, I&#x27;d be serving at least two life sentences. The smallest offence is carrying a hunter&#x27;s knife in my car: that&#x27;s a 3rd degree felony as I&#x27;d discovered recently. In practice, though, if the law was followed to the letter, 90% of males would be serving life right after high school for reasons I probably don&#x27;t need to explain.')
