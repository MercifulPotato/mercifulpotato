So at least some of the players understand the practical need for encryption. I&#x27;d rather those pro and con insiders fight it out, instead of fighting by proxy thru us citizens and consumers.<p>#2 Fishing expeditions<p>What possible value does unlocking, decryption have <i>after the fact</i>?<p>Does the FBI really need to unlock a spree shooter&#x27;s iPhone? Why? What could they possibly learn? They already have all the meta data like FOAF, location, purchases. What more are they looking for? To better establish guilt?<p>And any one already under surveillance has already had their entire life rootkitted. So again no need for after the fact unlocking.<p>#3 Trusting trust, time boxed secrecy<p>I&#x27;ve had many, many fruitless conversations about computer security (wrt election integrity) with non-tech policy makers. I have yet to figure out how to convey the understanding that backdoors and security thru obscurity is no security at all.<p>The best policy compromise proposal that I can imagine, and I&#x27;m spitballing here, is formalizing some kind of temporal privacy.<p>Using voting and secret ballots as an example:<p>I absolutely do not want any one any where to know anyone&#x27;s votes during an election. I don&#x27;t even want precounts, so that pols and admins can preview tabulations. But I also don&#x27;t care at all if someone knows how I voted <i>after</i> the election is certified. (Sure, there&#x27;s still some risk of coercion and vote buying. But there are easier attack vectors for which we have no mitigation, so it&#x27;s comparatively minor.)<p>So instead of trying to protect all secrets for all time, I think all the players might be able to chill a bit if we time boxed most secrets.<p>(I have other proposals for protecting personal privacy, like with medical records.)')
