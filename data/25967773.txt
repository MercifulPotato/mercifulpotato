In fact the same conclusion brought me to create Assistant extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows you to document your know-how and display it in the source code while you are writing it.<p>It is not only great for technical knowledge but also for project know how. Also it does not require know how to be introduced to the source code, it is stored separately.<p>It increased my productivity by 30% because I am not distracted by googling answers again and again.<p>It is a free extension, so try it out:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=tomasz-smykowski.assistant&amp;ssr=false#review-details" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=tomasz-s...</a>')
