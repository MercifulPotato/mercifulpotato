Putting a pet in the luggage compartment is not acceptable, and airlines basically don&#x27;t give you any other option unless your pet is small enough to fit in its carrier under your seat, which very few pets are. Airlines have options to support people traveling with infants and small children; similar options for people traveling with pets, even if they cost more, would be helpful.')
