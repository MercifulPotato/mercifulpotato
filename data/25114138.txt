But for example the kitchen alone has 2 ceiling lamps with 4 spots each, 6 lamps for countertop lighting and 2 in a wall of cabinets. So that&#x27;s already 16 lamps in only the kitchen. It&#x27;s more in the living room.<p>Even a bathroom easily has 6 or 8 in the ceiling, a few near the mirror etc.')
