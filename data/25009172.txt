I know that 4&#x2F;5 are going to vote for candidate A, but I don&#x27;t like that, so I publish:<p><pre><code>    abc - A\n    def - A\n    ghi - B\n    jkl - B\n    mno - B\n</code></pre>\nThen I simply give all the people who voted for A either abc or def. They all think they&#x27;re identifying themselves, when really they&#x27;re sharing identifiers.')
