I would replace it with the following example:<p>QWERTYUIOP ---[gets chopped up into]----&gt; QWERT ERTY UIOP WE QWER TYU QW<p>Note that I used the terms &quot;read&quot; and &quot;sequence&quot; interchangeably here because the general notion is the same. But these two words refer to two different things.<p>2.<p>Histones are proteins. You can get rid of them simply by adding proteases to the mix. Proteases specifically break down proteins and leave nucleic acid sequences intact.<p>A commonly used protease is Proteinase K, which you can just order online here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmaaldrich.com&#x2F;life-science&#x2F;metabolomics&#x2F;enzyme-explorer&#x2F;analytical-enzymes&#x2F;proteinase-k.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmaaldrich.com&#x2F;life-science&#x2F;metabolomics&#x2F;enzym...</a><p>You can also buy kits for specific applications: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmaaldrich.com&#x2F;life-science&#x2F;molecular-biology&#x2F;dna-and-rna-purification&#x2F;genomic-dna.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmaaldrich.com&#x2F;life-science&#x2F;molecular-biology&#x2F;...</a><p>Once the histones have been digested, the DNA can be extracted, purified, amplified, etc, at your leisure. A full treatment of this topic would fill an entire textbook, so I will spare you the details.<p>3.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this question means, but if you can rephrase I might be able to answer.')
