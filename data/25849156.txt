This was in Northern Canada, just South of Sudbury, near the Magnetawan river.<p>I&#x27;d never seen anything like that ever before, I had to stop for gas, saw a few insects land, went in to pay and by the time I wanted to go back to the car it was literally covered in insects, there was no way to get into it without bringing a few hundred of them along. I ended up waiting out the worst of it.<p>Horror movies really don&#x27;t capture the feeling well.')
