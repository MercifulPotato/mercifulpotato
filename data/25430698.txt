Depending upon what you like, you can probably find just about your ideal weather somewhere in CA. The central valley is very hot. SF itself basically never gets hot but you have to sometimes deal with cold fog even in the middle of the summer. You have some of the hottest, driest weather on earth around Death Valley.
