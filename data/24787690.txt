He proposed it as a zero sum game which I don&#x27;t agree with. I think there should be no hastened confrontation because both sides are strongly pathological so probably neither should win all right now. Also I don&#x27;t believe USA can win anything anymore because it struggles even in minor conflicts and lost all support and trust of global community more than decade ago. I don&#x27;t see USA becoming less dysfunctional because it had every opportunity and didn&#x27;t improve. I&#x27;m more optimistic about China because we have seen that communism can fall. I know it&#x27;s a stretch hoping that for China but since post world war ii period we never seen USA improve its behavior.')
