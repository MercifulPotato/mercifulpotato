Conduct on HN is uncommonly civil (for the internet) across the board - props to Dang and whoever else moderates things. Insightful discussion, however, is almost entirely limited to the extremely technical submissions.

I guess there&#x27;s no way to automate such a determination though, and even if there were any such action would probably anger the majority of the user base.')
