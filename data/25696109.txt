Just imagine you are in Walmart or a Target or your local grocery store. You don&#x27;t have a right to be there or to engage in any speech or really anything else if the manager wants you removed from <i>private property</i>. If you want to nationalize Twitter and Facebook be my guest but until then the owners of said private property can continue to kick people off of it. I still have yet to see one case where a person&#x27;s right to free speech were somehow infringed upon.')
