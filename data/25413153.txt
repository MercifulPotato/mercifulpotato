I see far more non-Tesla chargers around in my area. They&#x27;re different brands, but they all use the same standardized plug.<p>Just go to any site showing chargers in your area. Turn on just the Tesla and Supercharger plugs. Then turn on just the J1772 and CCS plugs. See which one looks to be the bigger network.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plugshare.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plugshare.com&#x2F;</a>')
