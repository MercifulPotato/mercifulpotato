Item(by='todd8', descendants=None, kids=[25276901], score=None, time=1606919084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267028, text='Thank you for pointing out Professor Rota’s remarks on teaching differential equations; He was my Professor for my first course in Probability about 50 years ago. He was an unforgettable teacher!<p>Once, I went to visit him during office hours. There was a light on visible behind a frosted window so I knocked on the door and awaited a reply. Instead of a reply, I heard a strange ring of what sounded like a chime. I waited a second and knocked again, and again the strange bell-like chime sounded in response. I peeked though the door and there was Professor Rota. Surrounded by stacks of books, on his desk, on a table, in mounds on the floor, Professor Rota, wearing as he did every day a three piece brown suit with a red tie and holding a large musical bell said “Well, come in!”<p>My kids are now in their mid 20’s and I’ve been disappointed by the way that they were taught math before college. The “Industrial&#x2F;political educational complex” has convinced the school that tablets and laptops and math books full of colorful pictures are what students need. The teachers are sent to workshops where they learn things like Russian Peasant and Egyptian multiplication. Sadly, many kids come out of such programs with remarkably poor basic math skills. I have a math degree and was comfortable tutoring my kids in math, but the schools themselves should have done a much better job.')
