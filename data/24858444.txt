I think they also took a stool sample and didn&#x27;t find any blood in the stool itself, I believe (can&#x27;t remember what else they tested in the stool), and when it happens it&#x27;s usually after some significant walking (i.e. a long walk with the dogs), and it&#x27;s bright red and not mixed in with the stool, so I&#x27;ve been inclined to agree with them.<p>I had blood almost 20 years ago back in college too, and it took forever for the situation to calm down because I had to walk so much to get from class to class every day (like a 15 minute walk between every class), so I was constantly irritating it. Back then I never got it checked out because I was too embarrassed, just tried to hide it as best as I could.<p>And when it was really bad a few years ago it was when we were living in a townhome with a dog and I had to go walk him for 15-20 minutes 4 times a day every day, so it was a similar issue to back in college. It&#x27;s been pretty rare since then (I&#x27;ve only had it happen twice the past two years, and the most recent time it was after we returned from a 3 hour hike).<p>So I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s more just the hemorrhoids. I do still want to get it checked, but Covid is more of a concern since I have some risk factors that could lead to a poor outcome. And I&#x27;m not even saying wait until Covid &quot;goes away&quot; or anything, just until next summer when it&#x27;s likely to go down to a somewhat manageable level again (&lt;5% positivity rate), at least in my state. Currently we&#x27;re about double that.<p>EDIT: Also another commenter made me aware that you can order and get at-home Fecal Immunochemical Tests (which I&#x27;m pretty sure was what I got at the doctors several years ago) to help detect blood within the stool, so I went ahead and ordered one. If that comes back positive, I&#x27;ll schedule a colonoscopy right away.<p>Er, actually after consulting with my doctor, since apparently insurance companies aren&#x27;t required to cover it before the age of 50 and they can cost up to $4000. Maybe with a doctor recommendation insurance will cover it.')
