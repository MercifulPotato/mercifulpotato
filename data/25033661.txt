I sleep better, I eat better, the pain I feel is a good feeling, like, my body is repairing for some heavy effort I made, my sexual drive is (a lot) better, my energy levels are better. Food has a purpose. My hormones are better. I feel great overall. I eat without guilty. Besides that, I&#x27;m stronger by the day.<p>I tried to simulate these feelings with other activities (soccer, running, bike, even calisthenics). No success. Not the way that barbell stuff do to me. And I&#x27;m not even a very strong guy (101kg bench, 130kg squat, 150kg deadlift @ 73kg).')
