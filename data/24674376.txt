Usually when you bite a lemon you feel a strong sour taste followed by involuntary movement of hands tightening towards the chest and shivering briefly.<p>With covid&#x27;s loss of taste, i felt no taste at all when biting a lemon, but the body wants to shiver which i could control easily but was very confusing experience i never felt before. Very unique experience.<p>Also realized the appetite falls rapidly. Without taste i had to force feed myself. During normal illness your are tired and don&#x27;t want to eat, but this is very different experience.')
