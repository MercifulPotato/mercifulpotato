I now wonder, if&#x2F;how the throttling changes when plugged into 4K display, as this caused MB12 to run out of thermal headroom in tens of seconds.<p>(Also, even thermally throttled M1 destroys my current 4C&#x2F;8T 4 GHz Haswell i7 desktop, which is beyond powerful for everything I need. M1 = 7700 pts, M1 throttled = 5300 pts, Haswell i7 = 4600, and Macbook 12 = 1400).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;keff85&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328740865926459400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;keff85&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328740865926459400</a>')
