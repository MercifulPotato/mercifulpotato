It has a user-oriented data model: all of the application code is run client-side, and all of the data is stored under the user&#x27;s control.<p>That means that someone can create a new application at any time which has access to all of the data - because all of the data is accessed client-side and owned by clients in the first place.<p>This doesn&#x27;t solve the standards problem, but on the other hand I think what would likely happen is the first project to become successful would also become more or less the standard, with other people building extensions to that data standard over time.')
