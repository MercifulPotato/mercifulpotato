And in this case, for city dwellers.<p>I&#x27;m only half joking about the &quot;poor&quot; part. For 80% of the world a car starting at $35k (which is actually about â‚¬45k everywhere outside the US, so more like $55-60k) is an expensive car. I&#x27;m pretty sure the world average car price is $20k or less.')
