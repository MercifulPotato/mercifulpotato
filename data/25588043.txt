Item(by='abeyer', descendants=None, kids=[25588130], score=None, time=1609374193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585372, text='While I don&#x27;t entirely disagree with your premise...<p>You&#x27;ve cherry-picked specifically the numbers for &quot;vehicle travel&quot; which isn&#x27;t even defined but is differentiated even by that article from air travel -- I&#x27;d read that as people driving in their own cars. Which is still concerning, but perhaps less so. Some places have even actively encouraged people w&#x2F; cars to get out on a drive as a safe way to get out of the house during lockdowns while minimizing social contacts.<p>Even your link calls out that the drop in air travel this year was far greater. A quick google turns up some estimates that air travel generally accounts for more than half of normal Thanksgiving travel[1], and that there was ~%50 reduction in air travel this year[2]. So that seems like closer to a 30-40% overall reduction -- still not great, but nothing like 5%.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protrav.com&#x2F;travel-411&#x2F;thanksgiving-travel-statistics-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protrav.com&#x2F;travel-411&#x2F;thanksgiving-travel-statistic...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;niallmccarthy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;how-2020-thanksgiving-travel-numbers-at-us-airports-compare-to-2019-infographic&#x2F;?sh=ce8aa3f65798" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;niallmccarthy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;how-20...</a>')
