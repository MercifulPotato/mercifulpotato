It’s that if you decide to commit to it and use it for your work you’re now at the whim of Apple. They can wreck your workflow because they have a dispute with the developer. Combined with the push towards rented („subscription based“) software this makes for a very uncertain platform. Even if disputes are rare, as long as Apple holds this power I think it will only ever get worse over time.')
