I bought it on PC via GOG, and while it was rough and unstable, I happily put about 100hrs of game play into it.<p>Honestly, they should have released it as under-development on platforms like Steam that support such designations.  It&#x27;s pretty common for studios to release games in an alpha&#x2F;beta state.  At least that way, gamers would know that they are getting a potentially buggy release.<p>For consoles, they straight up should not have released it until v1.07 at minimum.  That&#x27;s where they really screwed up.  The game is in a much less playable state on the PS4, and console gamers in general are used to a much more polished gaming experience.')
