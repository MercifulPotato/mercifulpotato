I&#x27;m an independent security researcher that currently has a vulnerability in macOS with grave implications. I&#x27;d like to sell it to Apple for a fair price, but their security email is a dead end. Every time I&#x27;ve reached out they want me to disclose all of my research up front, no price negotiation. After doing as many bug bounties as I have, I&#x27;ve been burned one too many times by companies giving ~$200 for weeks or months of effort (less than minimum wage of course) on P1&#x2F;P2 vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. I&#x27;m talking to a few groups who are willing to negotiate a price with me, but I can&#x27;t be sure of their intent. I want to get it patched, but it&#x27;s difficult when Apple themselves are disinterested.')
