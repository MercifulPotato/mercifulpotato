When the salesman tried to upsell me on a service contract I accidentally laughed in his face. It happened before I could stop myself and Sony had an absolutely incredible record for quality at the time. I used that monitor heavily for over a decade, but finally replaced it because the phosphors were starting to go and the picture was getting dingy. Still it was a great piece of hardware.')
