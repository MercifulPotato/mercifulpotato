Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611406625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881088, text='&gt; This is like crusading against people using their clothes dryer, driving when they don&#x27;t absolutely need to, turning on A&#x2F;C when they could just put on a sweater, not to mention all the industrial and commercial energy expenditures producing bullshit we don&#x27;t need. From where you sit, look around your room and contemplate the incredible energy expended to get these items where they are.<p>You didn&#x27;tconsider that the things you have listed cost money. There is an incentive to reduce them to the absolute minimum because you would go broke if you leased commercial property and put 200 clothes dryers running 24&#x2F;7.<p>Mining bitcoin is a profitable activity. You can afford to do that. The price of bitcoin dictates how profitable mining is. The higher the bitcoin price and transaction fees the higher the margins and that means you can buy more miners and thus waste more energy. There is no limit to how much energy can be wasted. Every time you think this is an insane amount of energy it can always get worse. Right now it is only at approximately 80 TWh. In 10 years it could be at 300 TWh. In 20 years it could be 1000TWh. There is no reason why this shouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>Bitcoin doubled multiple times in the last decade. The value of a bitcoin could easily outpace the reduction in block reward.')
