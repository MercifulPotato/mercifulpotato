You see, even if you manage to attach yorself to the thing (and the Philae lander of the Rosetta mission demonstrated is&#x27;s not easy), the thing usually <i>rotates</i> with one revolution every couple hours.<p>So unlike a cosy stable state vacuum of space with sun in one direction to point the solar panels and Earth in another where you point the antennas, you are now sitting an a pice of material that can freeze you&#x2F;cook you by convection &amp; Sun an Earth continually change position.<p>Also unlike with a space probe that can have a hot (in the sun) and cold (in the shadow) sides, now you need to handle temperature management from multiple constantly changing angles. Fun!<p>Thats why we don&#x27;t regularly communicate with NEAR Shoemaker or Rosetta even though both landed on a space rock - they are simply no longer in a working order.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible - you just need to use a rather more complicated spacecraft for that, than just trying to land a space probe.')
