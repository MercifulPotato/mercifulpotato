You could have a per-year UBI with processing delays. You could have an instantaneous tax reconciliation system with electronic transfers.<p>&gt; Taxation has more scope for fraud so requires much more overhead for prevention.<p>You say that as if the existence of a UBI would cause there to not <i>be</i> taxation.<p>Having a negative income tax is entirely orthogonal to tax complexity. The <i>explanation</i> is more complicated, because it&#x27;s just a harder to reason about way of describing the same system.')
