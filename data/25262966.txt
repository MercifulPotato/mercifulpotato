I hope you are not talking about Craigslist or another established platform having even larger userbase, thus larger amount of money changing hands.<p>&gt;there are tons of truly open projects being created and maintained this way, I can think of a dozen off the top of my head<p>Please spell these, I am unaware of any. Yeah O.k. the homebrew developers managed to get enough donations to by Mac mini with M1. Which is sad because it&#x27;s one of the most popular projects out there, considering the value they provide they should have been able to buy a large boat, not a Mac mini. There are a very few, established projects that can barely sustain part-time donations and there are a couple of platforms that are worth billions who facilitate this. It may work fine when you actually sell the premium closed source stuff(support services for proprietary software development based on the free stuff or personalised nudes in addition to the free nudes).<p>Also, the free content now comes as a side venture of political campaigns.
