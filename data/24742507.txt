That moving air has to stop once it is out of the tube, that resistance to the moving air at the end of the tube is dynamic pressure.  The hole in the side though has no moving air directed at it, not having to resist that moving air, the pressure is less at that interface than at exit.<p>If this wasn’t true, you would have to be compressing the air, that is increasing its density. Saying a fluid is incompressible is equivalent to saying the speed of sound in it is infinite; that is obviously never true, however the effects of compressibility are relative to the speed of sound so as long as you aren’t dealing with flow of hundreds of miles per hour in air, incompressability is a very accurate approximation.')
