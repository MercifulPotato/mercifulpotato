Some traffic needs to be processed right now, and if it can&#x27;t be processed within a narrow timeframe a failure needs to be acknowledged and handled. Other traffic can wait an hour, but needs to eventually succeed. Why conflate the two?<p>&gt; What happens if that system fails to see these for whatever reason and you dont have a full-time employee monitoring dead letter queues?<p>&quot;What if you fail to monitor correctly&quot; is a bad scenario no matter the architecture, but doesn&#x27;t critique message queues. Any sensible message queue will have lag and backlog metrics on subscriptions, which you can monitor just as easily as an RPC end point.')
