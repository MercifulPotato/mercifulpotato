The person you are quoting its a Canadian lawyer of no meaningful repute who gave up his legal career of a paltry decade to become a YouTube influencer. He has never even been licensed to practice law in the United States.<p>His opinion is out of sync with what legal scholars and indeed an what an author of the law says the law means.<p>Just on a laymans reading of the text good faith isn&#x27;t given in some universal context of fairness or fair play it is given in the sentence.<p>&gt; any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected;<p>Good faith herein means actually because they found it objectionable not for some ulterior motive.<p>In order to assert that the removal wasn&#x27;t protected under 230 you would be asked to prove the contents of the minds of the decision makers that the removal was NOT because they found it objectionable. They could literally argue that they found the effort to influence the election itself objectionable and suppressed it therefore and be safe within the boundaries of the law.<p>In fact good faith .... otherwise objectionable is so broad as to encompass virtually any removal for any reason<p>Furthermore finding that one removal wasn&#x27;t protected under 230 wouldn&#x27;t magically dispel all legal protection it would mean for the purpose of THAT removal someone could sue them if they had just legal grounds.<p>I don&#x27;t believe your source provided one.')
