You saw the project and launched into a mild rant about “kids these days who use libraries for everything” when on-topic comments would be “I hope nobody actually uses this ;) Although in all seriousness based on my experience this kind of thinking is unironically already present in the software engineering community”. Your original comment fails to tie itself back to the project and it fails to demonstrate that you understood it was not meant for use in production. As such, it deserves as much disdain as a “Mozilla should fire its CEO” comment should get on a post about SpiderMonkey.')
