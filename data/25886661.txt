Flying over felt costly which is why I thought about wardriving and relying on transmitter antenna sidelobes for detection - as I believe they&#x27;re smaller for parabolic antennas. From what I&#x27;ve heard, this is the most common approach - just a van roaming the city and comparing what they see to list of licensed radios.<p>Although, now, thinking about the costs I feel that maybe I was wrong in that assumption, and flying drones is cheap enough for this purpose.')
