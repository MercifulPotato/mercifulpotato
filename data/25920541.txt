So in that neverending quest for the razorblade laptop thickness is shaved all around.<p>They&#x27;re also an extra expense very few people care about. Most people who grew up with a touchpad hate the trackpoint experience and wouldn&#x27;t use it for free, let alone pay for it or have it as only option. I own IBM and more recently Lenovo laptops because they still come with that red nub and I instinctively use it but I can understand why manufacturers don&#x27;t bother including one given how little the market cares for them.<p>But the laptop still needs the space there in order to have a decent form factor. If anything it would need <i>more</i> space under the keyboard to have an even better 4:3 aspect ratio.')
