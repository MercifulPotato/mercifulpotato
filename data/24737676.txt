I meant 100s of approaches for extracting that knowledge (using questions from &quot;The Mom Test&quot; and so on).<p>You&#x27;ve mentioned asking people about their sleep, what they do about it, what did they try.<p>Have you tried something like:<p>a) Asking: What are the last 10 places on the web (related to improving your sleep) that you visited?<p>Another way to formulate the question:<p>&quot;What sleep-related sites&#x2F;communities&#x2F;etc. did you visit over the past 10 days?&quot;<p>b) This is just my idea, but wanted to hear your opinion: Give them a gamified experience (top 100 resources on the web for improving your sleep), but before they see each &quot;section&quot; (1 section=1 acquisition channel, like a FB group, subreddit, etc), they need to shortly type the answer to &quot;What [section] (related to sleep) have you visited?&quot;. Can be a simple quiz-like experience using a input box.<p>Curious to hear your thoughts.')
