Besides, some will outperform in a non-academic environment, and I&#x27;m sure every gifted one today is still not even fully literate in their native tongue.  Literacy was way less common among scientists and everybody else in previous generations too, so the documentation has been all over the place.<p>Just like many other chemical plants or operations.<p>You have to figure the fumes have always been capable of affecting people&#x27;s thinking, and that could have an effect on philosophy though.')
