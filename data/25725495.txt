There were hundreds of thousands of people there and 99% of them never even entered the Capitol buildings.<p>I think the most telling part of intent is coming from the arrest data.  There have been less than a handful of arrests due to firearms.  Two of them were alarming (one had mason jar IEDs, one was making assassination threats at Pelosi).  I am sure we will get more of what I would agree with you were &quot;people with an intent to intimidate officials&quot;, but they are going to make up less than 99.5% of the hundreds of thousands of people that were there to demonstrate.  The bulk of arrests have been curfew related - no surprises there.<p>I think it helps to put ourselves in the mindset of the people there, regardless of what side you&#x27;re on.  These people were upset that while the &quot;fraud&quot; of 2016 (the Russian collusion narrative) was thoroughly investigated and proven to be false after 3.5 years of dragging the President through the mud, the 2020 &quot;fraud&quot; allegation feels like it&#x27;s being completely ignored.<p>And look I do not think there was enough fraud to change the results (I assume that in any election with no voter ID there will be some fraud, period).  What I think is problematic is when instead of investigating allegations to appease 70 MM of your constituents, you instead say &quot;no investigation and if you even ask about this you must be de-platformed, banned from the internet, and are probably a terrorist&quot;.  <i>That</i> response is extremely dictatorial and not the sign of someone acting with good intentions.  That&#x27;s what scares me much more than anything than the fraction of a percent of demonstrators did.')
