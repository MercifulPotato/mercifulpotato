What would is your opinion on private platforms such as Reddit, Twitter et al. and their obligation to not shut down or restrict dialogue or discussion.<p>It is my opinion that since they&#x27;re a private company and explicitly state so in their terms they&#x27;re under no (legal) obligations whatsoever to maintain users ability to comment. They&#x27;re not the government and therefore can do as they please in this regard and people would be wise to remember such lessons when investing time and energy into privately owned platforms.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in your opinion however.')
