Suppose I buy a $50,000 minivan which I expect to keep&#x2F;last 10 years. At $8&#x2F;hr for a rental, the breakeven is 50000&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;365=1.7hrs&#x2F;day. When I was growing up in a family of 4, my parents easily spent more time than that in our van, shuffling us between school and other activities. And of course this doesn&#x27;t count the depreciated value of the car after 10 years.<p>I can imagine the hotel argument working out better mathematically, but it&#x27;s definitely very much dependent on where you live. In a rural area you&#x27;d probably be crazy not to get a bigger home. In an urban area, a hotel could make sense.')
