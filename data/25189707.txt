As someone that has spent 15 years as a founder I can tell you that the opposite is true: I have seen startups racking in seemingly endless funding only to be beaten by much smaller &#x2F; less well funded competitors that happened to have better strategy or execution. The examples are endless, more recently we heard about Quibi ($2B funding!) failing, Yik Yak, WeWork etc<p>There are markets that are capital intensive, and others that are really commodity spaces where winner takes all (Uber comes to mind) but for the most part, the smartest VCs in the industry will tell you that you should worry about strategy and execution, not raising a ton of cash which creates a bunch of problems on its own.')
