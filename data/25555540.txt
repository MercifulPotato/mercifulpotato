I don&#x27;t see what that isn&#x27;t a good combination.<p>With two instructions compressed into one and then fused into one micro-op you get both less pressure on cache while still getting high throughput in the micro-op execution pipeline.<p>The &quot;killer feature&quot; here is about designing the ISA around the fact that one knows macro-op fusion and compression exists.<p>E.g. x86 ISA was designed without any thought to the possible existence of macro-o fusion.<p>ARM seems to also have mostly ignored the existence of this in high end processors when designing their ISA. Innovation is really just about using existing stuff in clever new ways.<p>Btw Macro-op fusion and micro-op fusion are not the same thing.')
