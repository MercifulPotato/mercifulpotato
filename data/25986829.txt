Seems like a case of NIH to me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not against &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; for a toy project or to learn but gemini seems to have become more popular than just that. If someone is really tired of the modern web I would suggest to them a distributed alternative rather than this.')
