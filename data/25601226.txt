Thanks for all your hard work as always.<p>Thanks for sharing these stats -- seems like HN is similar to other internet communities. 2% covering 83% of all comments is certainly pretty skewed. I do notice a tussle over upvotes&#x2F;downvotes when making comments that might be against the HN vocal orthodoxy, so maybe that&#x27;s where the silent majority make themselves heard? Via upvotes&#x2F;downvotes?<p>What percentage of uniques have accounts here? Would be interesting to know if commenters are also a minority of total lurkers.')
