You don&#x27;t need to buy equipment, barbells etc., bodyweight exercises is weight&#x2F;strength training.<p>Is this, along with diet, sufficient to put on weight? I really need to gain 50 or so pounds at least and have never been able to do so. Even my brother, who routinely works out now is still pretty thin for his height. I&#x27;ve had a lot of people tell me you have to go to a gym for the equipment programs, but I&#x27;m not sure as it seems everyone tries to sell you something.')
