It&#x27;s &quot;juking the stats&quot; and IMO the thing that makes it so easy is that computers are great at correlation, but worthless when it comes to cause and effect.<p>Blog posts tended to be a good source of info, so now everything is a blog post because all Google sees is blog post = good.  Without a certain amount of human intervention and moderation, the computers are extraordinarily stupid.<p>I think the system that eventually topples Google will be something that&#x27;s built with an expectation of having a certain level of human interaction.  If I had to make a try at it right now I&#x27;d focus on local search; restaurants, events, groups, classifieds, etc. and build something that&#x27;s sustainable via franchises.  That way the human component would always be someone local to a community, they could take some of the profit, and they&#x27;d act as moderators &#x2F; advisors for their community.<p>TLDR; You need more people involved.')
