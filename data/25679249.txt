Even Apple&#x27;s clang just doesn&#x27;t have any new optimizations that work on their own; there are certainly new features but they&#x27;re usually intrinsics and other things that need to be adopted by hand. They thought this would happen (it&#x27;s what bitcode was sold as doing) but in practice it has not happened.')
