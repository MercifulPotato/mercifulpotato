Intel&#x27;s fabs are integral not only to their success and profits, but to the infrastructure of the United States itself. We simply cannot allow all CPU fabrication to be offshored, especially when most of it is close to China (Taiwan &#x2F; TSMC). Samsung is too busy pumping out smartphone &#x2F; tablet CPUs and NVIDIA&#x27;s GPUs, so even <i>if</i> Intel wanted to use them, there&#x27;s not enough capacity.<p>Intel is going to have to get their shit together, not just for their own sake, but for strategic manufacturing security interests of the United States as well.')
