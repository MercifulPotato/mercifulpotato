Not so great for paying rent, attending college, or going to the hospital.<p>It&#x27;s not all &quot;junk&quot; on Amazon. Trivializing the range of products that have become more affordable thanks to Amazon, as &quot;junk&quot;, is a massive case of taking for granted what you have.<p>If you&#x27;re low income, and the knob on your washing machine breaks, you can get a replacement part for $20 and a minimal cost in time&#x2F;effort, where in the past you would simply forego getting it, because it would involve a huge amount of time&#x2F;effort, and $80, which you don&#x27;t have.<p>If you&#x27;re not wealthy, and want to start a web business, AWS&#x27;s EC2 instances make it far more convenient and low cost than it was in the past. This makes entrepreneurship accessible to far more people.<p>I would go as far as calling your characterization of what they sell as &quot;junk&quot; as being disingenuous. It&#x27;s deliberately trivializing what these retailers offer in order to maintain your canned anti-corporate-giant narrative.<p>Especially when you consider that Walmart sells groceries too. Are you going to claim affordable groceries are &quot;junk&quot; too, or resort to another feat of mental gymnastics to discount the benefit it confers to people?<p>&gt;&gt;Companies like Amazon and Walmart have led to monopsony (buyer advantage) dynamics that have gutten communities, stifled innovation, and led to stagnant wages.<p>Neither Amazon nor Walmart have monopsonies. They both face intense competition, particularly Amazon. In fact, they both compete against each other in the ecommerce market!<p>They both have successfully improved supply chain efficiency through technonological innovation which has enabled them to reduce the cost to consumers.<p>Like I just explained: lower consumer prices is effectively a wage hike. When people need to spend less on consumer items, they can afford to buy more consumer items, or they have more left over for what you allege is the only things that matter: &quot;paying rent, attending college, or going to the hospital&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt;The issue is that these companies wind up not just competing on their own comparative strengths, but take advantage of their size and market advantage.<p>Yes, they take advantage of economies of scale, and that does have the potential to lead to sub-optimal outcomes in the long run, where competitors with better technology and processes cannot effectively compete due to lack of scale.<p>But it can&#x27;t be denied that right now, Amazon is successfully increasing the efficiency of the supply chain through infrastructure build out and technological innovation, and that this efficiency is resulting in lower consumer prices, which in turn is increasing the effective wages of workers. You yourself seemed to have acknowledged this earlier, but then found a way to dismiss its relevance to quality of life by characterizing what they sell as &quot;junk&quot;.')
