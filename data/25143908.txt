Not as effective as today. But yes.<p><i>Anyone who actually use the excuse of &quot;foreign interference&quot; for totalitarian censorship basically basically doesn&#x27;t believe in the concept of democracy.</i><p>Agree. I think Democracy has failed because the tools of propaganda have become very effective.<p>Democracy died in the U.S. a long time ago... the Deep State was formed and it had a monopoly on propaganda, not only for keeping the citizens in line but also using it to control many other countries. The major competitor was Soviet Union, which wasn&#x27;t very successful for long. Fast forward to today, there are many countries which are powerful enough and have competitive tools for propaganda.<p>While many countries are well equipped for offence, only China has very good defense against it. If other countries don&#x27;t take actions to strengthen their defense, it&#x27;s going to be very difficult for them.')
