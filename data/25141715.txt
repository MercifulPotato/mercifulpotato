Intel has 10nm which is equivalent to TSMC 10nm without EUV, altough it&#x27;s not that great.<p>SMIC has already produced some 7nm chips without EUV.<p>As for EUV for the further future, there has been quite a bit of research in that domain for many years in pre-emption of this, and while I think they will be a node or a node and a half behind for a while, they will almost certainly have one ready eventually. Of course, that will be accelerated by stealing data on EUV machines, or maybe buying a used EUV machine from someone and reverse-engineering it.')
