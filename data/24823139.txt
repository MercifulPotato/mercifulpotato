When people join the room&#x2F;game, they start as spectator and you (the host) flip it on and they become players. (I wish I could figure out how to put the &quot;off&quot; label on the other side of the switch so it is more obvious, but when I can, I have the label describe the current state of the switch).<p>I always create a game and then realize afterwards that more people than I expected joined. :-) I&#x27;ve found it best leave to the calculations (tiles per player in particular) until I actually press the start button.<p>So, as long as you have two players or more in the game, should be good to go.<p>Feel free to email me if you&#x27;re still having issues; willowpatchgames@gmail.com.')
