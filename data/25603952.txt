He would sneak off from the family to go upstairs to grab something and then we would find him there three hours later playing. He built up a huge farm and since it had the mechanic for visiting nearby farms became quite famous. Then one of his daughters, who was a freshman in college at the time, came home with a few of her friends. The family member mentioned FarmVille at one point and all these teenagers went “omg you are [his game name]?!?!?!” He quite literally became an in game celebrity for a time apparently. He quit a few months later and never went back.')
