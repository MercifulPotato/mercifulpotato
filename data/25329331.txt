It&#x27;s more as though the program they write for a composition is something to be steered and actively adjusted on the fly. THAT&#x27;s the performance. They&#x27;re not micro-managing note and rhythm choice. They&#x27;re performing by adjusting probabilities, or adding new seed conditions on the fly, or controlling meta functions.<p>I believe their compositional style is more akin to a long form improvisational jam that may then be edited down for conciseness and redundancy. I don&#x27;t get the impression that they&#x27;re going back and tweaking the fine details at this stage in their long career. They&#x27;re way too prolific to keep that up.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of some tracks that are typical of them:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cMD_oenMGVk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lvgLLXuJvmlSA-QH0-R95CzhYx00aRnJM&amp;index=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cMD_oenMGVk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lvg...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CRBKryLk29E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CRBKryLk29E</a><p>As you&#x27;ll hear it&#x27;s pretty removed from conventional rhythm, harmony, and form. There are certainly underlying foundations, but they&#x27;ve transitioned into a mode that&#x27;s almost entirely rhythm and timbre. In fact, by leaning into the generative components and ignoring the need to replicate traditional song forms, melody, or cadence in a credible way they&#x27;ve pioneered a very radical and exciting form of composition with electronic instruments.')
