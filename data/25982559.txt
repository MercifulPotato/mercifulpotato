If someone were rich, they would presumably be doing other things than hawking referrals links through personal finance advice. And if the author isn&#x27;t rich, why should the audience listen to their advice?<p>The other aspect is that even if it can be a good idea for a given individual to invest their savings, there is a reason why this sort of budgeting advice is often satirized as a form of propaganda. It happens to be paradoxically both actionable and ridiculous at the same time given how systemic issues affect people far more than their own small scale scrimping and saving.')
