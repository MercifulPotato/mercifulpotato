I&#x27;m sorry that happened to you. However,<p><pre><code>  If Apple refuse to take actions, I will interview with major media outlets describing the experience in more details and I will release a list of all individuals involved from senior management to the HR director and all the evidence as public record.\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;re wasting your time if you think they&#x27;re going to do anything with this kind of approach.
