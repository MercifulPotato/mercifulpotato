Can it not be done with just Python? And if using the library is much different from normal Python, does it mitigate Python&#x27;s problems with functional programming? (For example one expression only lambdas and no TCO.)<p>I also do use some functional concepts in my Python work, but do not use a library for it. Only procedures or functions. No additional dependencies.')
