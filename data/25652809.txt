Each generation uses more spectrums, more ranges.<p>So 5G is neat because it&#x27;s got low frequencies with long-range towers in rural areas, but also high frequency short-range &#x27;towers&#x27; in urban areas. This means instead of way too many people trying to share a limited spectrum over a huge area (IE: low frequency in the city), you can have short-range high frequency &#x27;towers&#x27; every few hundred meters in a city.<p>But now they&#x27;re coming for our wifi routers, demanding that spectrum too. And that&#x27;s kind of bullshit.')
