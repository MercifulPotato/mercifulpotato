What you are testing, if anything, is the efficacy of &quot;UV-C lamps to kill TB bacilli&quot;.<p>Wearing masks is an entirely different thing, and would need an entirely different test.<p>Even the original experiment leaves questions for me.  How does one diagnose TB in guinea pigs?  What health state were the guinea pigs in?  Was there a familial predisposition to respiratory illnesses for some of these?  What conditions were they kept in?  Etc.')
