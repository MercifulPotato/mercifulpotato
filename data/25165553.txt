In the end it will end up exactly like when the cloud providers disabled TLS domain fronting.<p>&gt; even though it will improve privacy for no downside for most people<p>It won&#x27;t. The big DoH providers will have nice behavioral data, on computer level, i.e. NAT is no longer a problem, they can distinguish separate device due to TLS session.<p>Privacy-wise, it is net negative. Few big companies will be getting data they didn&#x27;t have until now.<p>&gt; What &quot;trouble&quot; does it cause anyway?<p>You don&#x27;t know, so you will use scare quotes then?<p>It has problems with DNS zones that only some resolvers can resolve, and&#x2F;or are under ACLs so only local clients can resolve them. Your local network knows about them, the global ones don&#x27;t.<p>It has problems with split-horizon names. So now, instead of getting internal IP for a service, you will be getting external one, so your traffic will go to router and back.<p>It has privacy implications that you didn&#x27;t even began to think about.<p>Most networks are not coffeeshop wifi, where such behavior would be OK.')
