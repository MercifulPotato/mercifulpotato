It&#x27;s just now it backfires because technology changed in the way everyone can use it.<p>And then again, it is mass democracy, which was always a mistake, and if it didn&#x27;t exist many of the problems we have now won&#x27;t exist either, it&#x27;s entirely fair if voting is limited to landowners who have land giving no less than $X annual rent, the way it was in late 1700s-early 1800s America. And even more so when we have massive social programs so democracy becomes a death trap of freeloaders voting for even more free stuff.<p>What is the realistic exit from it? I believe that Chinese way relies too much on individual obedience so culturally impossible in any Western country. Returning to democracy for the elites and human rights for the (sub)elites too, is impossible because it&#x27;s a catch-22: people won&#x27;t vote for it.<p>Maybe something like Putinism is a good way out: keep democracy on paper but make sure actual voting is irrelevant, keep free speech on paper but make sure &quot;right&quot; content is ranked better than &quot;wrong&quot; (this is how Russian social media, which is KGB-owned, works, after VK.com acquisition). Of course it can&#x27;t also work without some countries remaining true democracies - just kept afloat, with their social programs, with massive amounts of stolen money - because the elites need safe places to live in, after all.<p>This way, we will return to the &quot;good old&quot; American system of 200 years ago - except geographically, rather than racially, segregated.')
