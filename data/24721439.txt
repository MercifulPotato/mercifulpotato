The same applies for time spent in the airport terminal, I&#x27;m always afraid to doze off there, lest I miss my flight.  And as you mention, missing a train is generally not a huge deal; I missed a few over the years and was always able to get onto the next train an hour of so later.  This flexibility alone gives huge peace of mind.<p>At the time I think I was paying about $40 or so between Philly and Harrisburg, one or two times a month.  Not as cheap as a bus, but well worth it I think.')
