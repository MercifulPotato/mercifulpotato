So in that sense this conspiracy theory situation &#x2F;should&#x2F; be an old hat.<p>Except this time it&#x27;s far weirder and more chaotic, because it&#x27;s not some coherent political entity pushing a long term agenda (although there might be some meddling), but rather a mostly crowdsourced fantasy world made up on the spot. Feels somewhat like a fever dream with its frantic twists and turns and absence of anything but short-term memory.<p>And starting from just a few &quot;trolls&quot;* and internet crazies on message boards&#x2F;social media it has developed into this huge trainwreck.<p>Must be disturbing to have relatives like this. I probably would have intervened early and installed web filters &#x2F; parental controls (this acquired an entirely new meaning) combined with education about the medium  where I could. Naturally this is no longer feasible for those too far gone.<p>At any rate, hope this gets fixed soon. Move fast and... have society break itself.<p>* At this point this really has become a euphemism')
