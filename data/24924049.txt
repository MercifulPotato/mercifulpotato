It&#x27;s a different song there thanks to Mesa.<p>&gt;opengl<p>Is not the most popular API, and AMD had, until recently, limited economic resources, which they mostly directed towards their CPU team and towards hardware. For their proprietary windows efforts, they needed laser focus on what&#x27;s most important: The newest and most popular APIs.<p>There&#x27;s money these days, and they multiplied the size of their driver team, but money spent on OpenGL would be indeed wasted, as there&#x27;s a pretty compelling solution for this API from the Mesa guys, in the form of an opengl implementation that&#x27;s on top of Vulkan: Zink.<p>I expect future GPUs and drivers (for all platforms) to absolutely not bother with opengl and simply ship Zink instead.')
