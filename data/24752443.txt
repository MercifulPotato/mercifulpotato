Sarcoidosis is around 25k cases per year in the US. Common cold is some hundreds of million cases in the US per year (on average an adult has 2 - 3 cases per year alone, children even more).<p>This is dangerous. People will misinterpret the result ordering - esp. as the page tells me it has 84% confidence. This will get misrepresented in a lot of minds.<p>Maybe one should use data on number of cases per year for ordering - like many doctors (I know) actually do in their heads when listening to symptoms.')
