It also became even more inappropriate for missionaries or members of clergy to show up at the door.<p>Not giving a huge percentage of one&#x27;s income also became easier to justify (or just try out, see how it feels) because church-owned infrastructure wasn&#x27;t being used.<p>With road trips and much of travel out of the picture, family tradition pressure also dropped for many.<p>So I&#x27;d guess that for a lot of people this has been a life-changing &#x2F; life-exploring opportunity in the other direction too, whether they resume normal faith-based activities later or not.')
