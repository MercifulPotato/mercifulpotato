Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[25446864], score=None, time=1608140797, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25443268, text='I use bspwm, which is similar to i3.<p>I mostly put 1-3 windows per workspace, and generally use one workspace per task. My &quot;main&quot; browser window is always workspace 1. My todo lists are always workspace 2.<p>I then have one workspace set up to default to floating windows for apps that tends to go crazy with them, like e.g. gimp.<p>The other workspaces are usually split into 2 or 3 windows, usually two columns with one window taking a whole column by itself and the other column split in two &quot;half-height&quot;. E.g. if I&#x27;m working on a web app, the browser will typically take up the biggest window. But I also have keybindings set up to let me easily move the active window left&#x2F;right&#x2F;up&#x2F;down (it will swap places with the displaced window). I tend to move windows into a bigger space more often than I resize them.<p>Getting windows in the same space is easy for the most part - windows open on the space I have active, but I have keybindings set up to move the active window to a specific workspace, and you can also define rules for bspwm that sets up predefined slots for windows that &quot;swallow&quot; windows that match certain criteria, if there are certain apps you always want on certain workspace for example.<p>Switching windows to floating if the wm doesn&#x27;t get it right is also just a keypress away.<p>bspwm can be fully controlled with a command line tool, so I also have scripts that will read a JSON file specifying a layout and recreate it and start the appropriate shells, browsers etc. I use the same plus an alias to change the name of the workspace based on the &quot;nearest&quot; project file working up from the last change of working directory on a given workspace. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it means that e.g. if I &quot;cd&quot; into a project, the workspace name changes to reflect the project name, which does tend to make it easier to keep track of what I&#x27;ve put on which workspace.')
