Wasting your own life on somebody who isn&#x27;t all there is not a great trade-off if there&#x27;s other options.<p>(My friend inherited a $2 million house for taking care of his gravely ill elderly relative, but that cost him 20 years of his life and meant he couldn&#x27;t have a career, family or life outside the house.
