In high school I always planned to enter the Informatics Olympiad (there are multitude of Science Olympiad in high school where you compete on city level, then regional state&#x2F;province lever, then nationally and ultimately on international level). Instead, I got hooked into biology and ended up competing on the Biology Olympiad all the way into the International Biology Olympiad.<p>When people asked me why a person that loves computer like me is getting into biology so much, my answer is how come anyone not getting crazy over biology? The rabbit hole is so deep, I can&#x27;t help but dig and dig just to satisfy my curiosity. When people heard about biology they always imagine endless recitation on taxonomy and stuff but like the author wrote, that&#x27;s not what biology is all about.<p>Alas, I ended up not having a career in biology-related field though. I&#x27;m a programmer through-and-through. But I did meet my wife through these event so it&#x27;s not all for nothing, and I still like biology.')
