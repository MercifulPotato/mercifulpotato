It seems you only have two choices:<p>- first season doesn&#x27;t pull enough viewers, it&#x27;s cancelled.<p>- first season pulls enough viewers, season 2 onwards take season 1 as a status quo they&#x27;ll basically never advance from, advancing the story so slowly that it almost feels like a sitcom where most characters end up at the exact point they used to be at the beginning so they can keep getting viewership.<p>I&#x27;m starting to see it with The Boys for example (WARNING slight spoilers next) Season 1 introduced a super dangerous environment where any wrong step could end the characters lives, by the end of season 2 it almost feels like a high school show because the main characters mostly bump into each other without consequences. If they need to kill someone they just introduce a new person a few episodes earlier so they can get rid of that one while the main characters stay healthy.')
