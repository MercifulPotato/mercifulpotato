Probably a lot of both, and maybe yes a bit too much of the former.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think the two concerns are all that neatly separable. I find it impossible not to notice the relentless campaign to put forth _vaccinating everyone with an experimental jab_ as the <i>only</i> legitimate escape from indefinite lockdowns and distancing. Evidence piles up in favor of easy &amp; cheap measures like vitamin D supplementation or ivermectin treatment having the potential to significantly reduce the threat of Covid and it just gets drowned out by media noise.<p>I view mRNA vaccines in much the same way as nuclear power: they <i>could</i> be an important technology to address our problems, if we could trust our institutions to adequately guard against their potentially enormous hazards or misuse. But we can&#x27;t. And while I haven&#x27;t decided yet whether I&#x27;m going to get the vaccine, one thing that will make me much more likely to fall into the &quot;refuse&quot; camp is if they decide to impose some kind of restrictions on basic freedoms and make travel or attending concerts contingent on getting a vaccine.<p>Even with all these concerns, if I was in my 90s, I think I would still find the danger from Covid so severe as to tilt the risk&#x2F;reward balance in favor of getting the shot. But I don&#x27;t find your relatives&#x27; approach absurd by any stretch.')
