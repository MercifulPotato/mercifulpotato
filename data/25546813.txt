Provided you heat your hot side to hotter then ambient, you can move heat around.<p>The problem with Venus is that &quot;hotter then ambient&quot; is already melting lead and significantly derating most other materials. We&#x27;re talking an incredible amount of energy and mechanical parts (it&#x27;s a heat pump) to do it.<p>I would be curious if there&#x27;s any possible Peltier design which might be able to keep up.')
