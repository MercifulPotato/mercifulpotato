The reason I came back this time was that our managing partner just told us we&#x27;ll be paying next year in our small outpatient clinic--truly unreal. I dream of a day when we could just use our own system, maybe something that I could even manage myself (maybe not realistic?). Bravo to the contributors of this project!')
