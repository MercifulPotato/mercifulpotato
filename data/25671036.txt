I do not know which option will lead to less death, neither do you,<p>What point were you making then? And yes, I think I do know which option will lead to less death, because I actually took the time to do some minimal research and the relevant information wasn&#x27;t hard to find or terribly ambiguous. It&#x27;s fine to have a contrarian opinion, based on some effort to ascertain facts and reason about them and we could then have a productive discussion on why our conclusions differ but from everything you said so far my current impression is that you made no such effort whatsoever.<p>&gt; However, a full lockdown will lead to more economic loss at least in the short term than a voluntary lockdown. Long-term, as I said, I don&#x27;t think any of us can say.<p>For some farcial definition of &quot;short term&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t say&quot; maybe, but for anything a sane person would care about (quarters or longer) we can just try to compare economic stats.<p>I mean to me it seems like the herd-immunity&#x2F;corona-is-a-hoax&#x2F;hands-off-response countries weren&#x27;t doing that hot economically either:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;sweden&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;sweden&#x2F;gdp</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-kingdom&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-kingdom&#x2F;gdp</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;brazil&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;brazil&#x2F;gdp</a><p>vs<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;new-zealand&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;new-zealand&#x2F;gdp</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;south-korea&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;south-korea&#x2F;gdp</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;taiwan&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;taiwan&#x2F;gdp</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;china&#x2F;gdp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;china&#x2F;gdp</a><p>&gt; You are in lockdown until you fill in some sort of form with the government, waiving your rights to hospital care in the case of catching Corona. This list is used to make decisions. This part at least is implementable.<p>Why would anyone in their right mind sign such a form, no matter whether they intend to flout lockdown or not? Not without massive penalities. How would you enforce them?')
