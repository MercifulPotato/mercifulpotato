That includes low-end Core-X, 2nd gen Threadripper, and Ryzen 9 CPUs (which is essentially HEDT for many use cases).<p>As it stands, there is no GPU that:<p>- consumes 75W or less of power (i.e. running only on PCIe power)<p>- has a modern architecture (with the latest codecs, display adapters, good perf-per-watt, etc.)<p>- has solid support from open source drivers.<p>Understandably, it&#x27;s a niche use case.  But AMD hasn&#x27;t launched a new GPU in that range for almost 4 years.')
