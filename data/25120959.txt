I’ve worked in a lot of big corporates, and negative value engineers are exceedingly common there. I’ve also seen them in quite a few early stage startups that don’t have particularly strong technical founders. In those situations the first technical hire will often become the technical leader, and if that person is useless then the technical direction of the company is doomed. Companies like that usually don’t last longer than a couple of years, but there are quite a lot of companies like that.<p>Startups that have survived long enough to get a product to market, and have a reasonably sized small team, would represent a survivorship bias against having negative value engineers. At which point they will have grow to the point of rotting under the weight of large-corporate inefficiency before any additional negative value engineers would be able to infiltrate their ranks undetected.')
