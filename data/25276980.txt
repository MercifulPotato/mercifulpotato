Markets being what they are, web applications are in vogue because they earn big money if done well.&quot;<p>Disagree. I really do love the speed of native apps, but there&#x27;s a very good reason the web has become the way most software is delivered. Web apps cost less to build, distribute and maintain for both publisher and user. Web apps are often, but not always, easier to install (just type a url in the browser, press enter, done), easier to learn, more interactive, and more likely to run on the device you own.  Native apps are a load of work for both the publisher and user, and that is just to get the app installed and running.<p>Maybe the current web isn&#x27;t what was envisioned. I&#x27;m ok with that.')
