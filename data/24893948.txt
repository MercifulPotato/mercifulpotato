I just made this change and some of my tests are now much faster. Here&#x27;s the result for one of the affected tests (averaged across 5 runs):<p>Before: 1.39 seconds<p>After: 0.62 seconds<p>I have this default line in config&#x2F;initializers&#x2F;devise.rb:<p><pre><code>    config.stretches = Rails.env.test? ? 1 : 11\n</code></pre>\nSo hashing user passwords was already very fast. But I&#x27;m also manually calling BCrypt in some other places, so these calls are now much faster as well.')
