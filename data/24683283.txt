This was my experience:<p>&gt; And how are kids even suppose to know about these schools at a young age? I would assume it&#x27;s the parents that needs to be knowledgeable and push their children to those admission exams.<p>Middle schools want to feed as many of their students to these programs as possible. When Johns Hopkins held an SAT for eighth graders, the teachers distributed flyers home and I heard about it on the morning announcements every day for two weeks. (If Virginia&#x27;s middle schools aren&#x27;t making students aware of their high school opportunities, that is very easy to fix.)<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the same as saying scoring in the top 1% percentile is within your control.<p>A topic of active debate within educational circles is whether we should tell students that intelligence is innate or that hard work&#x2F;&quot;grit&quot; is the most important thing. There&#x27;s some evidence that the &quot;grit&quot; story leads to better outcomes, so that&#x27;s what educational establishments prefer to tell students.<p>It&#x27;s likely, then, that &quot;you can score in the top percentile with enough hard work and determination&quot; is the official position of the school district. And who knows, it might even be true!')
