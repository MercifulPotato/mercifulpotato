Enough to fatigue most peoples&#x27; capacity for excitement I think, particularly in the cases where the company has interesting ideas but has not yet put anything into orbit.  SpaceX isn&#x27;t just talking about paper rockets, they&#x27;re also putting stuff into space regularly for the past several years.  It&#x27;s hard to compete with that for attention if all you have is neat ideas and a CEO who <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a media hungry controversial celebrity billionaire.  (Blue Origin almost has that, but I think they are too busy being secretive to nurture an army of fanboys.)')
