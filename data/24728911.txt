I was confused because I wasn&#x27;t port scanning anyone. I asked for details and an admin sent me a report generated by some seemingly off-the-shelf network admin software (forgot the brand), with a bar chart of all IP addresses I was frequenting -- rather creepy, honestly. Turns out I was renting ~20 servers around the world as PoPs for a personal project at that time, and regularly deploying code to all of them at once over SSH (all configured at port 22). Apparently regularly accessing ~20 servers at once over a single port was enough to be flagged as &quot;port scanning&quot;. I wonder if people doing actual security research over at the CS department were exempt from nonsense like this.')
