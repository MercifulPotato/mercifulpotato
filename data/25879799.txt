Basically, consistency was key:<p>Start the day with aminoacids + b-complex, water soluble vitamins on empty stomach work better.<p>Then a protein breakfast, like 4 eggs and some greens. Eggs are a good source of choline. Only now I&#x27;d pop a vyvanse, less aggressive&#x2F;spiky effect but also less anxiety and lasts longer on a neutral stomach.<p>Replace coffee with matcha. Has the caffeine + theanine for relaxation, and slower release. Happier gut as well.<p>Extended lunch break: small meal but time for a walk with my gf, light exercise, call a friend or errands, then slowly transition back to work and finish the day.<p>For dinner get your Omegas and Vitamin E (lowers inflammation), fat soluble vitamins do better on a full stomach.<p>Before bed maybe some Melatonin and Magnesium.<p>About supplements for brain fog, maybe try some extra B1 (Thiamine, there&#x27;s also Sulbuthiamine), Ginseng.<p>Get tested for anemia, even if the basic blood panel looks OK, just get a video doctor to hand you out an exam order for the usual suspects like ferritin, serum iron, plasma electrolytes, b6&#x2F;b12, d, c, folate. If it&#x27;s low but not anemia-level low, you could supplement, it seems pretty common with iron. Low Vitamin D won&#x27;t really change with those 800 IU pills, get those salts that have 50.000 IU once per week then retest after a month.')
