Conversely, I did briefly have a Parler account, and what I saw in my particular bubble did not fit that description at all - It was crypto enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and comedians. I&#x27;m not trying to imply that my anecdote is data or that Parler is some bastion of positivity, but the way your premise is stated only requires a single counterexample: <i>some</i> &quot;hate speech&quot; exists on Twitter, and not <i>everything</i> on Parler is.<p>You say, &quot;the purpose of Parler&#x27;s existence is (was) to facilitate communication that larger social networks stifle.&quot;  To me that sounds like the old adage that &quot;the Internet treats censorship as damage, and routes around it.&quot; At least five years ago that was largely seen as a feature rather than a bug.  But recently the tide of popular opinion seems to have shifted in general favor of censorship.  Undeniably there are some bad ideas out there, but I worry that the &quot;cure&quot; of censorship is a slippery slope that could very quickly become worse than the disease.')
