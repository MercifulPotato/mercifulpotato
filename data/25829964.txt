Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611030074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821637, text='<i>Most states spend a fraction of their budget dollars on family preservation efforts, even though more kids are removed for neglect than abuse.</i><p>The best solution to this kind of problem is making a more family-friendly society so we end up with fewer kids in foster care.<p>I don&#x27;t know how we get there from here. The past decade has really taken its toll on my faith in humanity and the past year has put the world at large through the wringer and trying to focus on doing something positive seems overwhelmingly hard and entirely pointless.<p>America doesn&#x27;t actually value having a functional society. It values &quot;heroics&quot; and that fact means we don&#x27;t want to actually take care of our citizens simply for existing. We only want to do something after it&#x27;s so bad, they need a hero to fix something and then <i>good luck with that.</i> It&#x27;s too far gone to ever really be functional again.<p>We need housing solutions. We need healthcare. We need to stop enriching the billionaires and giving money to charity while not taking care of ordinary citizens and no one wants to do that.<p>Some people want to provide UBI -- which I think will not take care of people -- or they want to claim that people who aren&#x27;t making it are just lazy or something.<p>Bezos gave about a billion dollars to his workers in 2020 as either Covid relief in, I think, June or as Christmas bonuses. It amounted to as little as $150 twice for part-time workers.<p>Then he was lauded for giving $10 billion to charity.<p>He could have given $10 billion to the people who helped make him obscenely wealthy, thereby providing a total of $3000 to his least paid workers and more for others and still given a billion dollars to charity.<p>Why do we need so much charity? In part because we don&#x27;t bother to take care of our people unless they are &quot;charity cases&quot; and then we still don&#x27;t really take care of them. (Yes, I know, he gave money to climate change. Irrelevant to my point.)<p>We actively turn our people into charity cases and then blame them when their lives don&#x27;t work and punish them and no amount of virtue is enough to make your life work for far too many Americans.')
