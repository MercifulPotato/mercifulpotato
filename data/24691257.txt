They get drowsy on longer drives like 1hr+, which is why any time we do road trips I drive for them. And all that &#x27;pull over and take a power nap&#x27; bullshit doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not grounded in any science to start with. I know both have tried coffee, breaks, stopping and taking a walk, etc. Of all those things, they said taking a nap is actually the worst because when they wake up they feel even more tired.<p>So their choices are: have someone else drive them, don&#x27;t drive beyond a 1hr distance range, or deal with the drowsiness. You can imagine how sometimes life just forces them into #3 even though both are keenly aware of their issue and do their best to mitigate it.<p>Tech to detect when they phase out and save their life is absolutely the correct way to go.')
