I have Sony a6400 as main camera and to be honest I can turn it on and record a video faster than I can with my iPhone, mainly because the dedicated buttons.  I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much of a hassle.  It has Wifi to get data off.  It&#x27;s pretty easy actually.  It&#x27;s worth spending and extra 2 minutes to do it so in 30 years I have nice video and pictures of family.')
