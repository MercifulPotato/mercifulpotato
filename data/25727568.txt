The point of section 230 is that facebook, twitter et al aren&#x27;t responsible for the post, the poster is.  But that doesn&#x27;t do any good in a world where there&#x27;s no KYC and anonymity and pseudonymity are rampant<p>Yes, it would suck for people who want the ability to be anonymous or pseudonymous (and there have been serious debates on this in the past over &quot;real name policies&quot;), but perhaps that&#x27;s a price we have to pay.<p>Someone can still create a service that allows anonymity and pseudonymity, but they will be responsible for the content, and not benefit of section 230 protections.<p>Free Speech is important, but Free Speech that lacks consequences to the speaker can be dangerous.  If we don&#x27;t want the social media companies to censor, we have to put the consequence of dangerous speech on the speaker, not on the social media companies.  Today, the consequence of the user&#x27;s &quot;dangerous&quot; speech seems to mostly fall on the service and hence their desire to censor.  Which is why even KYC while allowing anonymity and pseudonymity might night work, as the platform will still bear the brunt of the consequence, not the speaker.<p>Perhaps, it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference, i.e. Trump was never anonymous.<p>I dont know how it would impact their ability to work internationally, so as I said, it&#x27;s not a full thought idea, just an idea I&#x27;m throwing out there.')
