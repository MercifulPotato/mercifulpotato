Then someone concludes, like this article, that it is pointless &#x2F; to be avoided etc.  It would instead be better that you write an article where  you steelman X, then compare it to Y, and look at the comparative advantages.   Badly done X or Y should always be highlighted but not really used as a reason not to do X or Y. If you can steelman X and show that even best effort has far too many disadvantages, and there doesn&#x27;t seem a way forward to overcome them compared to other approaches, then sure, call it out. What I see is often new things have less history of people badly doing it compared to the old things that have a lot of examples of people badly doing it and they mistake that as the old thing as being bad.')
