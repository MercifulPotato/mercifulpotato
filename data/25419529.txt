We have to decide to draw a line somewhere. Even porn companies that feature of-age performers are highly exploitative and uncomfortably close to human trafficking - see the case of Girls Do Porn, and they&#x27;re just the one that got caught doing it.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to argue that some sexual behavior should be considered &quot;bad&quot; - voyeurism, selling yourself for money, extreme fringe interests&#x2F;fetishes, etc. I don&#x27;t buy the idea that Pornhub is just an innocent business trying to run their website. They have built an empire on human exploitation.')
