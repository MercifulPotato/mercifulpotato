I&#x27;m speculating here, so take my answer as sort of sci-fi premise. I think as the internet and IoT grows, it becomes more decentralized, it will be come unfeasible for all these nodes to communicate to some central nodes (i.e. servers), so we will move toward automated peer-to-peer communication, with some simple routing and optimization rules.<p>These of these nodes automatically detect, connect, and communicate with the nearest node. Think of it as bluetooth vs wi-fi hybrid of the future. The aim is to make a more resilient internet by eliminating single points of failure (i.e. AWS servers down), but the end result will be some sort of rudimentary network, that will lead to &quot;emergence&quot; of some sort.<p>I just realized I&#x27;ve been describing &quot;Edge computing&quot;.')
