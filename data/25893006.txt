I get offers all the time to buy my company. Almost all of them come from men (and yes, they all have been men so far) with very little experience in my industry. If I sold to them, I would make a ton of money... But it would almost certainly destroy a lot of value in the company itself. My clients would get worse service, and my employees would not have the promised growth and benefits. And I think I would lose the meaning and purpose my company gives me.<p>Avoid VC&#x27;s and outside investors like the plague of you can. Their desire for an exit will eventually force you into one.')
