Item(by='dsr_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605529725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110705, text='Classical physics is based on observations that humans can make with very low technology: polished metals and glasses, relative velocities up to a few thousand meters per second, timekeeping accurate to milliseconds in one location. Those observations lead to approximations which &quot;feel&quot; correct because humans spend most of their lives in those circumstances.<p>But at the edges of those circumstances, we see discrepancies not predicted by classical physics. That lets us know that classical physics is an approximation. The truth is that even in your car + thrown object example, the velocities do not actually add linearly -- it&#x27;s just that the difference between the linear approximation and the reality is tiny.<p>One analogy that might be helpful: consider every object in the universe to be moving at c, but for most objects that you encounter, the vast majority of that motion is forward in time rather than space. As you add energy to the object, it transfers that velocity from time-motion to space-motion.  Because c is so large compared to our usual experience, we have to look really hard to discover the change in time-motion... but it&#x27;s real. GPS uses satellites that are in a sufficiently different frame from the surface of the Earth, and requires sufficient time precision, that relativistic time difference calculations are required.')
