Item(by='mleonhard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610423148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741134, text='You imply that I am ignoring some important point of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 [0], but you do not state the point or how it makes the behavior of the Republican voters OK and not an attack on democracy.  Please behave in a more respectful way.<p>I reviewed the act.  It contains rules for handling the situation when a state has not properly selected its electors or certified its votes.  Pennsylvania did properly select its electors and did certify its results before the deadline.<p>The act allows congresspeople to submit written objections, with grounds.  The objections submitted on 02021-01-06 were the same lies that were rejected by Republican judges in Pennsylvania and the US Supreme Court.  You can read them in [1].  Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey eloquently explained the situation to the Senate [2].<p>I see nothing in the Electoral Count Act of 1887 that would allow Congress to throw out a state&#x27;s votes.  If you can find it, please reply.<p>Throwing out a state&#x27;s votes is unacceptable.  And it is unconstitutional, regardless of any acts passed by Congress short of constitutional amendments.  Our nation has democracy written into its core.  No party can throw it away with a vote.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;legislink&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;stat&#x2F;24&#x2F;STATUTE-24-Pg373.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;legislink&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;stat&#x2F;24&#x2F;ST...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;house-section&#x2F;article&#x2F;H76-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;hou...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;senate-section&#x2F;article&#x2F;S32-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;sen...</a>')
