Of course each person will have their own subjective view of those times.  I had ADSL in 1998, and before that I had 28.8kbps which wasn&#x27;t too bad since websites were very lightweight in those days.  I didn&#x27;t use IE unless I had to, as I had Netscape on my Macintosh.<p>I loved the smaller web, where almost everything you saw was made directly by people who cared about the specific content they were sharing.  Business websites were far more humble, and simpler.  Web design was super creative and sometimes silly or fun.  Further, I think search engines have degraded massively.  We had a sweet spot around 2005-2015 maybe?  But it&#x27;s been downhill since.  Google Search results are utterly terrible now, regressing back to ~year-2000 quality IMO.<p>Popups weren&#x27;t much problem because most of the time I just disabled JS anyways (especially since it slowed sites down a lot), and only turned it on when a site I was trying to use wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  I didn&#x27;t start leaving JS enabled until it started becoming a real limitation, and probably until the browsers started interpreting JS way faster.<p>I still think it&#x27;s crazy how much commerce is transacted online.  I understand, but it still blows my mind how everyone everywhere is using this shockingly unstable, insecure network to do... everything.  The recent SolarWinds hack is another example how fundamental the problem of security is across all networked digital systems.  Of course it&#x27;s a lot better today than it was in the 90&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s just one of very few things that has genuinely improved, IMO.')
