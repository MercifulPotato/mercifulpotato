It&#x27;s very effective at getting compliance across a society where our instinct is to look to our peers to figure out how to behave.<p>As others have said, what has made science effective at being a vehicle of growth and change is that it is empirical &#x2F; evidence based.  New ideas slowly diffuse and get accepted as evidence grows for their support (which can take a long while).<p>Decision making by evidence is also pretty much the opposite of natural human group behavior.  I recommend reading&#x2F;listening to some of the newer research on human psychology of groups.  It pretty concretely shows that people consistently choose group harmony + stability over converging on the truth &#x2F; correctness.  Basically in a group we value getting along with each other a lot more (being in agreement &#x2F; having consensus) than we value knowing what really is happening.  Also, scientists being humans are not immune to this behavior either which is why evidence based progress is slow and can be resisted by established groups for lengthy periods.')
