But then, I started running into problems in the real world that required more than 32 KB of memory to solve. When I moved to a laptop I had to relearn all of that knowledge again. Haven&#x27;t touched my TI-83 since.<p>It would be nice if the tools we learned how to use in school could also be useful in solving our problems after we graduate!')
