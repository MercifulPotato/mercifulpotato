Even if they aren&#x27;t, a reduction in revenue must be offset.<p>The fact that they aren&#x27;t charged taxes for use of the roads was the incentive. This is removing it in recognition that electric vehicles are now enough of a percentage of the fleet to affect tax revenue.<p>New Zealand does the same, with diesel and commercial vehicles already paying &quot;road user charges&quot; (RUC) to fund road maintenance. Petrol (gasoline) vehicles pay this tax at the pump.<p>EVs are exempt from the RUC until they represent 2% of the fleet.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transport.govt.nz&#x2F;area-of-interest&#x2F;environment-and-climate-change&#x2F;electric-vehicles-programme&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transport.govt.nz&#x2F;area-of-interest&#x2F;environment-a...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stuff.co.nz&#x2F;motoring&#x2F;107372241&#x2F;ev-drivers-are-bludgers-costing-nz-roads-7m-per-year" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stuff.co.nz&#x2F;motoring&#x2F;107372241&#x2F;ev-drivers-are-bl...</a>')
