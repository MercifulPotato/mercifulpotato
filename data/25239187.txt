The labor force participation rate has been consistently falling for a long time (at least 20 years) in the USA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;labor-force-participation-rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;labor-force-parti...</a>).  I&#x27;d argue that the data there still doesn&#x27;t cover the full force of what&#x27;s been going on: career positions have typically been replaced with a gig economy.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to see that the scope of automation could increase in areas that would more drastically affect employment in the short to mid term than the other developments we&#x27;ve seen in the last 20 years.  Either full long-haul automation or almost full automation with remote intervention could be a reality in the very near future, but almost certainly will be in 10 years.  Call centers will be almost completely automated.  Factories are automated to a much higher degree than they have been in the past.  Every industry is solving problems with software that increase efficiency of workers (ie, fewer workers needed) and that trend is accelerating.<p>We can always say &quot;this time isn&#x27;t different&quot;.  History tends to repeat itself.  My point is: the trend is already there to see and the evidence suggests that it may accelerate very soon.')
