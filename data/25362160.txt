There were over 3 million ballots requested for the general election in PA. PA, by the way, is a state that did not allow for mail-in ballots to be counted until the in-person elections were finished. Georgia was another. Both of them have Republican legislatures.<p>I&#x27;m sure you also took at face value the testimony of that drunk temp worker who complained about not getting enough to eat and then amending it with claims of pollbook issues. So much more believable than the Republican and Democrat poll observers who were there the entire time to watch each vote get counted.<p>There isn&#x27;t a state or precinct anywhere on the planet that does real time vote updates. They do them in batches. It&#x27;s why a state can lean a certain way and analysts are still confident they will go in a different direction: large population centers take more time to count, and in this case the votes were segregated due to a court order, so they couldn&#x27;t even mix those ballots up in PA.<p>The rest of us can&#x27;t help it if you&#x27;re willing to swallow a conspiracy theory because the candidate you support lost.  We can&#x27;t even really be bothered with it. The Republican legislatures will do a couple of things to assuage your hurt feelings, and then they&#x27;ll move on to the next thing on their agendas.<p>As for your threats of violence, nobody cares. You can deal with the US military after Jan 20th if you&#x27;re that angry about the election. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be responsive to your feelings.')
