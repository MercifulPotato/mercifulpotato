They sell to airlines what airlines want to buy. Airlines wanted a 737 with higher bypass engines and that&#x27;s exactly what they got.<p>Boeing deserves what they get for pushing a faulty design out the door but they didn&#x27;t do it as some nefarious cost cutting measure. They did it because American and Southwest said they wanted nothing to do with a &quot;797&quot; and threatened to switch to Airbus.')
