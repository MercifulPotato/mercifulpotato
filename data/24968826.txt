I haven’t read the actual claim, but it seems they’re basing their argument on a block of test code that uses a video containing RIAA copyrighted music. It’s sketchy at best, but there’s a reason BitTorrent clients make no mention of piracy sites <i>at all</i>; The MPAA and RIAA are <i>extremely</i> litigious and will use any opportunity they get.')
