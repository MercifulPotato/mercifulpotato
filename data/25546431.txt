On the wire, a v4 address is four bytes.  uint_32 is the natural type for this.  So when we start looking at cidr scopes, &#x2F;24 means the first 24 bits of those 32.  &quot;The first 24 bits of 4 bytes&quot; sounds wrong to me, &quot;the first 24 bits of 32 bits&quot; sounds logical.<p>So as I see it - 143267841 (or 0x88A1801) <i>is</i> the address, and quad-dotted decimal is a (slightly more) human-readable representation of it.')
