In general I think you&#x27;re going to need some balance between requiring certain outcomes and requiring certain specific implementation details. It might be possible to make an automobile out of sufficient thick and squishy parts that it could pass reasonable crash safety tests without having a seat belt, but it&#x27;s still not ridiculous for regulations to require that automobiles have seat belts.<p>(I have no idea where lidar for self-driving cars falls within that balance, although I can&#x27;t help but notice that human drivers do not utilize lidar.)')
