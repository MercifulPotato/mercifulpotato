Item(by='wtmt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606630446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25242138, text='&gt; What shocked was the speed of its intervention. Mr Goswami spent just a week in detention, and his case had hardly reached the lowest rung of courts, yet the country’s topmost judges ignored the court’s backlog of some 60,000 cases to schedule a bail hearing within a day of the anchor’s appeal. This is in a country where prisons hold twice as many inmates awaiting trial, some 330,000 people, as they do convicts.<p>This is a big problem. The Supreme Court has long ignored cases of higher importance (corruption of different kinds by the central government and the cronyism for corporates). It’s shameful that consecutive Chief Justices have harmed the country through simple delays and not hearing cases.<p>At this stage, the High Courts in the states have been doing a better job of upholding justice and freedom for citizens than the Supreme Court has done in the last decade.')
