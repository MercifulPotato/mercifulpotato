Being unconventional and &#x27;creative&#x27; while young is something passable and understandable... maybe even fashionable depending on where you live. But being of the same mindset and past your thirties is not generally acceptable, unless you have show a measure of financial&#x2F;professional success.<p>I would love to see PG write about this, if he has experience observing or living through these sentiments.')
