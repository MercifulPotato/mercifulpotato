That&#x27;s unacceptable for most communications.<p>Take everything you do on a phone call, over SMS, and over the Internet. Subtract anything personal, anything business related, anything involving copyright (e.g. watching a movie or listening to a song, even if you own it), and anything you don&#x27;t want associated with your identity (anonymous blogging). Also, I forgot to mention that broadcasting is also disallowed. You couldn&#x27;t just start telling poetry on a frequency without regard to anybody who may or may not be listening. You also can&#x27;t use the bands for any commercial purpose.<p>Anyway, after subtracting all that, what your left with is what people use the band for today. Which, I suppose, could still be considered &quot;general purpose.&quot; But when I said &quot;general purpose digital communications,&quot; what I had in mind were the sorts of things you use email or the web for. By volume, mostly music, videos, porn, ads, and private business operations.')
