The functions themselves never hold state, they just access the state that react holds for each component through hooks.<p>I think this confusion is further fueled by the fact that most people feel<p>render () {<p><pre><code>    return &lt;Button &#x2F;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n}<p>calls the `Button` function inside `render`, but what it actually does is that it registers the `Button` function in React, telling it &quot;here&#x27;s how you can create what I want&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t actually call the function. The actual call is done by React, if and when it wants to.<p>Hooks extends that idea by letting you say &quot;Here&#x27;s how I want to update my component&quot;.<p>The component functions you write in React are a &quot;description&quot; telling React how to create that component. With hooks you can now &quot;describe&quot; how to update that component with new changes. I feel like hooks force you to let go of the control you thought you had with class-based components. Whether that&#x27;s a good thing is up upto you.')
