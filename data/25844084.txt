For a rather glaring one, no, uops are not linked to OoO.<p>Secondly, it ignores the existence of uop caches that x86 designs use in order to not need such wide decoders. Some ARM designs also use uop caches, FWIW, since it can be more power efficient.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that fixed width decoding like on aarch64 isn&#x27;t an advantage; it certainly is. Also, M1 is certainly a very impressive design, though of course it also helps that it&#x27;s fabbed on the latest and greatest process.')
