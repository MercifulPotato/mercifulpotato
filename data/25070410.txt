The only reason was to inject mocks, and people hand-wrung for ages over it because the code to do so infects all the other code. Then people started to try and back justify it with IoC, but it&#x27;s never really been a convincing argument.<p>It&#x27;s also something that if you&#x27;re not working regularly with it can be very mysterious and when it fails, fails at run-time, quite inscrutably sometimes.<p>From my perspective it&#x27;s just  boilerplate magic that if you actually need it, fair enough, but if you don&#x27;t is a persistent, nagging, pain in the ass.')
