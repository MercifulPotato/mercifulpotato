There are, as I understand it, two justifications for this:<p>1. When students borrow money from the federal government, whoever they pay that money to is &quot;receiving federal financial assistance&quot;. This makes absolutely no sense.<p>2. When a government program intended to produce research does so by funding researchers, those researchers&#x27; employers are &quot;receiving federal financial assistance&quot;.<p>The second one doesn&#x27;t make sense either; it appears to be exactly analogous to saying that if the federal government engages private contractors to repair damage to the White House, those contractors are receiving federal financial assistance.')
