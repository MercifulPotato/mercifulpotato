We don&#x27;t do destructive code tests in production.<p>Normal vaccine trials is like normal software testing. Challenge testing is like running dangerous tests in production. Its faster at detecting a problem than normal tests, but ultimately not needed and can blow up badly. The argument for doing it during covid is that time was of the essence and its faster than normal testing procedures. Instead we opted for the safer slower normal testing procedure.')
