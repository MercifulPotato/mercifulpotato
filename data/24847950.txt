The &quot;public&quot; don&#x27;t get to decide directly because that&#x27;s what governments are for, but if a currency becomes lagal tender, people do have to accept it.<p>&gt; A private company gets to decide how and when we can spend our money.<p>No more so than before. Now you can <i>also</i> spend crypto when buying through PayPal. You can still spend crypto elsewhere and you can spend fiat with PayPal and elsewhere.')
