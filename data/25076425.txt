Whether I stay in bed until late, or work late at night.  It&#x27;s enough to predict whether I&#x27;m a &quot;good&quot; worker.<p>It also reveals whenever I travel, which coffee shops and libraries I frequent and what times of day.  It also reveals what time I open any of several video conferencing apps.<p>And the sort of thing some HR would like to browse when assessing job candidates.  They wouldn&#x27;t need to ask &quot;do you know X&quot;, they could just consult the Apple log of how often I run the relevant commands.  Things like &quot;we see you ran &#x27;git&#x27; an average of 145 times per day last month, tell us more about that&quot;.<p>And whether I&#x27;m running tools I &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot;.<p>All that seems quite sensitive and personal to me.')
