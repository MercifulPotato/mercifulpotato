I&#x27;ve been there on vacation for a total of 2 months. I&#x27;ve made friends in Tensta, Södermalm and in Östermalm and slept in all places.<p>If someone tells me that Östermalm is now a place where people rob you more easily than 10 years ago, then I have enough of a feeling how the social landscape changed. In Stockholm, I&#x27;ve experienced a couple of crime-ish situations in those 2 months that I didn&#x27;t experience to such a frequent or great extent in Amsterdam (where I live).<p>In short: it might be that things in Stockholm have gotten a bit more sour.')
