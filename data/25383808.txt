I think people can&#x27;t bear to have a mirror held up which exposes the naked &amp; ugly truth.<p>We all have individual stories about the convenience of AirBnB when visiting a new city, but I feel a lot of us are unable to see the bigger picture beyond our own selfish need for slightly increased comfort levels. We either deliberately overlook or are blind to the damage AirBnB and similar tech companies have wreaked on society.<p>Flimsy, selfish delusions of grandeur from tech wankers who just want to print money in fastest way possible with total disregard for the destruction they cause along the way but don&#x27;t worry, its &quot;disruptive&quot;! All to be lapped up and praised by people who were brainwashed into the Randian mode of thinking<p>I also find it quite amusing that some people come back with these replies of &quot;you&#x27;re just bitter&quot; &quot;jealous of the fact that they&#x27;re rich and you&#x27;re not!&quot; just continuously beating everyone over the head with this idea that there&#x27;s only one true way to measure success. As if, in questioning how that success was reached and the societal, ethical and moral issues it brings up are somehow not acceptable. I guess in pursuit of the American Dream no has no time for such trivial issues.')
