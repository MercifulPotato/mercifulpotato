It&#x27;s the Heisenberg uncertainty principle&#x2F;Fourier conjugate.<p>Let&#x27;s say you send a yo now, and then you&#x27;re going to send another one in 5 minutes. Then you decide to send a third in between. How much information does it contain? Less than a full timestamp&#x27;s worth, because the timing is constrained.<p>Once you are sending yo&#x27;s at the maximum line rate (certainly at least every nanosecond, it&#x27;s such a critical piece of infrastructure), sending or not sending an individual yo is down to one bit of information. The time component is basically completely gone.<p>In other words, you cannot know the precise position of a yo at the same time as knowing the precise momentum.')
