As in, he can start singing a song in the <i>exact</i> pitch he learned it -- close enough to sound in tune with the recording. This is accuracy to the discrimination level of trained musicians -- I estimate about 0.5% or 1&#x2F;10 of a semi-tone.<p>Oddly, or not, it took him several years to learn to hear music on a relative basis -- to hear C-G as similar to D-A. Transposed songs (Sinatra sings &quot;Something&quot; in F) sounded to him like completely different songs.<p>Now he has developed an excellent musical ear, and taught himself to play bass.<p>relevant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pianostreet.com&#x2F;smf&#x2F;index.php?topic=34782.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pianostreet.com&#x2F;smf&#x2F;index.php?topic=34782.0</a>')
