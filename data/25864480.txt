I did work a little bit with Boeing-777X ones.<p>It is not great, actually. PFD (primary flight displays) are cluttered and information-noisy. HUD is a much better tool for flying experience. Fortunately for civilian pilots, this is becoming more common now.<p>FMS (flight management system) has all the usability of IBM mainframes from 1960s and about the same performance.<p>The tasks that pilot have to do before the flight are rather simple: you have to input weather conditions, aircraft load and waypoints for autopilot. But with even the most modern FMS it is a tedious and frustrating process, you have non-intuitive control flow and non-qwerty keyboard. Also all text-based, non-graphical interface.<p>The better parts of aicraft UI are EICAS&#x2F;ECAM (engine information and alerts) - they are both useful and intuitive to understand, with emphasis on graphical indication.<p>A lot of hard to use bits are not from any technology limitations - modern aircraft displays are rather capable, but from the decades of industry legacy and expensive certifications required for any change.')
