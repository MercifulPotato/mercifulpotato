If you saw the probability swinging from 20% down to 0.1% a month out you should be suspicious.<p>A 90% chance in the election a long way out is suspicious if we think that the chance effects are large and roughly even-handed. Regardless of assumptions about the distribution of chance events though, multiple large swings are themselves suspicious because they each by definition imply the observation of highly improbable events.')
