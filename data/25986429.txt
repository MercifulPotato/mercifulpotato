This stupid myth that CPI inflation is bad for workers should die. Your comment is also wrong that inflation is above 2%. If that were the case nobody would have gotten angry that assets have outpaced wage growth. Assets outpacing wage growth is deflation except it is not denominated in dollars but rather in housing or stocks.<p>No, the fantasy economy (read the stock or housing market being pumped by easy money) should not be part of the CPI inflation rate because it&#x27;s not real. The entire point of CPI inflation is to measure the real economy.<p>Supply side economics are generally done to combat inflation, demand side economics are generally done to increase inflation and what we need is a stimulus on the demand side because there is already an oversupply of labor.')
