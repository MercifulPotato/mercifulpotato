I suppose shouldn&#x27;t have assumed that you would know that the New Deal involved raising revenue. Concise data from the 1930s isn&#x27;t super easy to come by, you are going to have to look at broader economic trends and make your own conclusions.<p>&gt; Literally everything you have mentioned is several times older than something from 1990. Also... it was introduced in 1984, 1990 is when they reversed it because it was so bad.<p>* Sweden GDP, 1984 (2020 dollars): $108,000,000<p>* US GDP, 1984 (2020 dollars): $4,000,000,000,000<p>The U.S. also has much greater reach into the financial markets since we control a lot of them. Older is better - more time to see the long-tail effects of policy.<p>Regardless of whether FTT would work or not, it&#x27;s a single tactic (small picture), when we already successfully tax wealth in various ways (estate, property taxes). The big picture is breaking the power of concentrated financial power, and taxation is an obvious method. Nit picking specific policies seems to be a favorite bad-faith tactic to avoid acknowledging that the issue is an issue, which would then require the nitpickers to suggest ideas themselves, instead of just criticizing.')
