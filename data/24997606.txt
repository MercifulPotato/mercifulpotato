I mean, that should still be possible, right? Set up a name for the routers IP, and have it forward the connections statically.<p><i>IPv6 on the LAN is quite a pita due to the massive &quot;random&quot; prefix, gone are the days of easy addresses like 10.0.0.12.</i><p>Or just use the hostname? Sometime a couple of years ago, local names just started working, sort of on their own. My Synology is nas.local, Linux boxes are reachable using their configured hostname, even my elderly printer shows up as vigor2.local.')
