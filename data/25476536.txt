But have similar medicines been given to a million people? Have those been tracked for three decades? We&#x27;re talking about scaling that up by a factor at 10-100+, and giving it to millions of healthy people with many decades of life ahead. What if some serious adverse reaction happens ten years later, to 0.1% of the 20-year olds who take it today? Worth it?<p>The efficacy of the new mRNA vaccines is fantastic. It&#x27;s a no-brainer to give them to people with a high likelihood of having a serious covid case.<p><i>Maybe</i> it&#x27;s justified to also give it to everyone else, to mitigate the economic effects of the epidemic. But asking this question is qualitatively different than what you hear from people who are normally skeptical towards vaccines. This is a completely new type of prophylactic, there is potential of an unknown unknown.<p>I&#x27;m typing this contrarian comment mostly to document that I&#x27;ve thought about it, in case, heaven forbid, we make a horrible discovery about it in 2025.<p>Honestly - aren&#x27;t there researchers working in the field thinking similar thoughts? Is it such a taboo interjection that they don&#x27;t dare speak it out loud out of fear of being compared to antivaxxers? I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s an excessively cautious concern.')
