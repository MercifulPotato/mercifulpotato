I love emacs, Firefox, bash, zsh, nginx, postgres, llvm, linux, freebsd, and many other packages. But, I think that there are two points to be made with regard to commercial software.<p>1: Domain specific programs, and polish. Logic Pro X, Final Cut Pro X, Ableton, Cubase, Premier Pro, are are excellent pieces of software that people pay for and use every day. Where is the free software equivalent that isn&#x27;t glitchy and has a usable, slick, ui? The more specific the case gets, and the less related to systems a Free Software project is, the less likely it is to exist or have any polish. I can list Postgres, Redis, Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, NodeJS, WebKit, SpiderMonkey, LLVM, GCC, Binutils, Busybox, etc., but where is the free software iMessage, Google Docs, Discord, iTunes, Steam, Google Maps, etc. There may be some of these projects out there for what I just listed, but none of them have a userbase as big as that proprietary software. The only things I can think of are VLC, Blender, and Android.<p>2: Free Software can only exist with Commercial Software. How many people that work in Free Software are software engineers working at a corporation? What pays for this Free Software to exist? Microsoft hosts github, big enough Free Software projects have budgets and employees at other companies paying for all of it.')
