You&#x27;re restricted to only one platform, which limits your ability to collaborate with anyone not using that platform.<p>Asking someone to actually install an app is also itself a huge barrier.<p>Installation of native apps on desktop is a nightmare requiring at least two or three steps, which is unforgivable to most users in 2020 for anything approaching consumer or collaboration software. For that kind of software anything with more than one step in 2020 is broken and unusable. Nobody is going to jump through hoops just to <i>view a proposal</i> or something.<p>Mobile OSes made this somewhat better, but not much. App stores are slow, hard to search, and a nightmare for developers which discourages things from being written for them. Users also dislike installing mobile apps now as they assume, usually correctly, that any mobile app is so riddled with spyware it&#x27;s borderline malware. Each install is yet another thing that&#x27;s likely to be sucking your contacts, spying on your clipboard, tracking your phone usage, and sending your location to ten different adware monetization platforms.<p>Nothing compares to the ease of entering or clicking a URL and <i>bam</i> you&#x27;re there.')
