But after having learned them, I have a lot of trouble explaining how I got there. I can&#x27;t <i>remember</i> why it was hard anymore, as it just seems easy to me now. This is a large part of why I don&#x27;t enjoy writing documentation or teaching others. Point being, I know about this problem in me, it&#x27;s not a blind spot, there&#x27;s just not a lot I can do about it.')
