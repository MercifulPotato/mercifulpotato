Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604528377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993238, text='&gt; I thought the difference between Medicare advantage type plans is that it is an HMO type of deal where you can&#x27;t pick your own specialized treatment centers and have to jump through a lot of hoops for complex medical issues and drugs as opposed to original PPO resembling Medicare (80% costs) + medigap part F? (remaining 20%) + part D for drugs.<p>Nope, Medicare Advantage plans are usually just PPO plans on a nationwide insurance marketplace that covers the Part A, Part B, and Part D benefits. By default, &quot;Original Medicare&quot; is just a government run version of that which only covers Parts A and B. That plan is also not &quot;free&quot;, per se, as the beneficiaries still have to pay a monthly premium â€” it&#x27;s just that the monthly premium covers Part B benefits, and Part A benefits are all covered by FICA taxes. I think(?) there are also some HMO MA plans. Seniors are now on average choosing Medicare Advantage instead of &quot;Original Medicare&quot; more often because they happen to like the varieties&#x2F;options. If you don&#x27;t care about those options, you&#x27;re still entitled to Original Medicare just like you did with your parents.<p>The closest the tech community has probably gotten to Medicare Advantage, as a concept, is Chamath&#x27;s recent SPAC taking Clover Health public. They&#x27;re an up and coming MAdv payer, and appear to be growing pretty quickly. Oscar Health, another hip tech company, has a big Medicare Advantage business as well.')
