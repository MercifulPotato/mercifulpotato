Why were ES6 classes and hooks invented? Why did JS add arrow functions and `async&#x2F;await`?<p>Sorry, but all of these are mistakes. I predict that hooks will not survive the battle of time as well as react as a whole will. Arrow functions are mere syntatic sugar, but async&#x2F;await was a mistake.')
