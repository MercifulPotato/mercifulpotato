We have seen this in much Android phone hardware (a year or two of updates, usually not including a major version), and I see it in my Android TVs (Sony). Even Apple, which IMO has a track record of longer support, has done it with Apple TV recently, and Sonos threatened it with perfectly fine working old hardware until outrage forced them to change plans.<p>All in all, I prefer less integrated things with clear responsibilities that work together under well established protocols. I want a dumb TV with good HDMI and other specs, to which I can connect whatever display device I want (or many). I want my car to be perpetually supported (unlikely beyond Tesla) or a simple display (Android Auto or Car Play or whatever) so I can upgrade the thing doing the display whenever I choose.<p>Of course, if Ford committed to having a computer module that could be upgraded occasionally for the price of a mid-range phone, and commit to supporting it for 25+ years, that would be okay too. My Acura is in its 12th year and because it is so &quot;dumb&quot; I haven&#x27;t felt any urge to upgrade it. My (2020) Tesla gets updates probably monthly via WiFi. It changes too much IMO; I want stability from my cars and devices, but honestly the changes are almost all improvements in my (software engineer) opinion.')
