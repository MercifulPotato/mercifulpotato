I also bootstrapped a digital health startup called AnywhereMD with a team of physicians.  At first it was a triage app that evolved into a messaging platform.  The triage had a similar value proposition; get people to the optimal point of care and they   will avoid unnecessary and costly ER visits.  Self insured employers and accountable care organizations would reap the savings and therefore pay per employee or insured per month and drive people to use AnywhereMD before deciding where to seek care.  We were bootstrapped and had a hard time convincing large companies that we were legitimate since we were so small.  The biggest parallel I can see is that in healthcare, cost savings and better outcomes are obscured, hard to see, delayed etc.... So itâ€™s not easy to prove value and then capture some of the value  for your self.')
