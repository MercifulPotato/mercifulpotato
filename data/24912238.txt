It had about 400 simple pages with artificially slow API responses to get an idea.<p>- you can prerender a decent amount of pages no probs<p>- you can prerender only a subset and then have Next render the necessary pages on the server upon request<p>- as the page is being prerendered, you can send placeholder content, so ttfb is low<p>- linking to a non-prerendered page within Next will prefetch (and thus prerender) said page as soon as the link is in the viewport (can be disabled)<p>- in Vercel you can set the branch name as an env variable. I set it to prerender almost nothing during build time if the branch name contained “hotfix”<p>So far I think it is worth serious consideration. Will it work for you? I dunno. But it’s a breeze to set up, quick to learn, and run some experiments of your own.')
