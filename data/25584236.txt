Item(by='screye', descendants=None, kids=[25586676], score=None, time=1609351911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581437, text='&gt; This is just a totalitarian mob justice that is also prevalent in alt-right circles<p>Agreed. However, people in alt-right circles have no power in tech peer groups. The totalitarian mob-justice wing of liberal circles has all the power. Be that Robyn-De-Angelo and Ibrahim Kendi being paraded around these firms despite having incredibly extreme ideas or people like Anima leading committees at the top of CS hierarchy.<p>If I was in rural kentucky working in a coal mine, I would be shouting about how the reactionary wing of the right has completely taken over discourse. But, I&#x27;m in tech&#x2F;grad-student&#x2F;urban&#x2F;academic circles, so I speak about the bad actors there.<p>&gt; There is nothing left-wing in American politics, much less “hyper-liberal”.<p>I was careful to never mention the word &#x27;left&#x27; in my comment. Hyper-Liberalism and Left ideology are tangential to each other. This wing of ultra-prescriptive &#x2F; thought-policing &#x27;hyper-liberal&#x27; left is very &quot;North American college campus phenomenon&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t map onto left movements around the world at all.<p>Note that this is very much a social movement. So, the economic aspects of left-ideology are only important insofar as to facilitate the social aspects of the movement. So, I reserve my criticisms of it to the social goals of the movement and their &#x27;ends justify the means&#x27; approach.')
