Thankfully, my celebration of this outcome is wholly irrelevant to Apple&#x27;s decision-making process, as I neither work for Apple, influence Apple, nor participate in any app store review processes on behalf of Apple, or any other either. So you may take comfort that had I exerted any effort to push my view — which I haven&#x27;t — it would have meant just as much to the outcome as our discussion here in this thread: Absolutely nothing whatsoever.<p>Demeaning me with the phrase &quot;pushing your puritan views&quot; is is tasteless and inappropriate, and makes incorrect assumptions not only about the root of my objection but also about the belief systems surrounding it. You are wrong about both.')
