Item(by='Pfhreak', descendants=None, kids=[25837616], score=None, time=1611083351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837238, text='&gt; Antifa and BLM burned and looted for months<p>This sentence fragment appears deliberately vague and it assumes the conclusion. Compare, for example, &quot;The Capitol Attack&quot; vs &quot;Right Wing Violence in America&quot;. One references a specific event with specific actors, the other is a vague non-specific description of a phenomena that may or may not exist.<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to be more specific -- which instances of fires and looting do you feel were not adequately described as attacks? Who is failing to describe them, again, specifically.<p>Right now, this does not read like you are interested in discussing this in good faith.')
