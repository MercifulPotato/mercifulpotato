I&#x27;m an online marketeer. For a while now I&#x27;m a hobbyist PHP dev. I enjoy it a lot, but obviously my experience is limited. I&#x27;ve created some small projects in object oriented PHP.<p>Anyway, i&#x27;m thinking about trying to get a job as a junior PHP dev.\nWhat skills do you think are necesarry to succeed? It&#x27;s probably a bit hard to put in text - I mean, how do you quantify the skill level you need?\nStill i&#x27;m very curious what you think.<p>By the way, I&#x27;ve always coded solo. So no experience in working in a team of devs. Also, i&#x27;ve never worked on a project that I didn&#x27;t start myself. So no experience in working in an existing code base. Do you think that&#x27;s a problem?<p>Thanks! \nImperistan')
