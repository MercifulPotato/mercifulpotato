As presented, the approach didn&#x27;t seem to handle unary operators.<p>I probably should have noted that I am already familiar with Pratt parsing, which seems like something that isn&#x27;t actually brain-dead simple and obvious in the same way (which is why it was worth writing a paper about in the 1970s.)<p>Hoping for a reply from the original author to recommend a simple approach to add unary operators.')
