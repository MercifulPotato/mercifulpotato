They don&#x27;t offer open APIs that allow users to choose among different and open user interfaces. They are owned and operated by private companies.<p>None of this is true. All these services have pretty fully-featured APIs and several independent clients.<p>Even otherwise, the fact that some of them may not exist at some point in the future is a terrible reason to not use them at all. I still find tons of relevant content in hosted forums from the 90s and 00s, and more recent ones like Stack Overflow and Github.<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident that most of the services he is complaining about will last longer than his own blog post.')
