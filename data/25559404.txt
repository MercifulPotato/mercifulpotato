Their editor, Gutenberg, is the <i>worst</i> thing I&#x27;ve ever worked with. It&#x27;s super laggy once the post even gets halfway long -- I&#x27;m talking multiple second delays in typing and it appearing on screen. It&#x27;s so bad I&#x27;ve taken to editing my stuff in Pages&#x2F;Word.<p>Which leads to another issue that <i>it doesn&#x27;t keep the formatting when I try to copy-paste</i>. It&#x27;s just such a mess and it&#x27;s almost given me to give up on this project or move away from Wordpress entirely. The editor is so God-awful I don&#x27;t see how <i>anyone</i> can use it and like it.')
