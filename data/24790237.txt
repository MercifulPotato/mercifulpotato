UWP sucks really bad and it does reduce the reliability of the system, especially when UWP-type things end up in the shell (e.g. start menu and action center).<p>I will point out that File Explorer includes a shortcut for opening PowerShell at the current directory, which can be triggered through the File menu or alt-f-r.<p>Its worth highlighting that Linux isn&#x27;t an option for everyone. I personally prefer the design to Windows 10 and hate Microsoft&#x27;s anti-consumer stance. I&#x27;d love to confine it to a VM that I only run when I need something specific. Unfortunately, Ubuntu at least cannot handle using Intel graphics with Nvidia graphics in a mixed-DPI setup (one monitor 1080P, one monitor 4K). I think this is a reasonably common setup. Running a kernel update is also troublingly likely to render the system unbootable (it has happened multiple times on Ubuntu, zero times on Windows; I&#x27;ve done many orders of magnitude more Windows work than Ubuntu work).<p>I feel slightly jealous of the folks who are feasibly able to run Linux on the desktop without compromising on hardware.')
