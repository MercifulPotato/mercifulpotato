Because at 8 strings, you’re already hitting 2 semitones above the standard bass’ tuning (E standard). At that point, if you want to go lower, why not just use a distorted bass guitar? Maybe I just don’t like the muddiness of the <i>guitar</i> distortion sound of the extremely low notes (bass distortion has a different sound)?')
