Which is that when you think you can’t do something your brain is often <i>lying to you</i>. You want to be lazy and find a way around the problem, but often you can complete the task, it is just challenging and thus parts of your brain wish to avoid it. The solution for me is to identify that my brain is lying to me and doing the things it tells me I can’t do. Alternatively sometimes this manifests as fear and all I have to do is to follow my fear.')
