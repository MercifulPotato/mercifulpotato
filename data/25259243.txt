There are always naysaysers. We got death threats when seatbelts were legally enforced.<p>That&#x27;s not to say public policy is always correct.<p>But what we talk about in inner circles, what we publish ... should be open. We shouldn&#x27;t be oppressing such-and-such periodical because they say this or that.<p>Unfortunately, publications do make their way into the headlines as Fox and CNN pluck, selectively from the stack and misrepresent findings to suit their narrative.<p>Which may in fact point at the real problem ... making better firewalls between &#x27;serious discussion&#x27; and &#x27;public communications&#x27;. Scientists don&#x27;t like being misrepresented either.')
