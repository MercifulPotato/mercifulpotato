The only problem was a small handling issue that appeared at very steep climbs because of the new engines. And because they wanted to keep the same type certificate, the MAX had to handle exactly the same as the &quot;old&quot; 737, so they introduces MCAS to adjust the &quot;maneuvering characteristics&quot; automatically. Which was so badly designed that it led to the crashes. So the problem is not with the basic 737 design, the problem is that the new MCAS was much worse than the problem it was supposed to fix.')
