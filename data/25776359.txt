I know people believe that ML can still scale in funding (for even bigger models than GPT-3 with current hardware) but that shouldnâ€™t be our hope. I also can not imagine that the exponential efficiency increase in architectures with optimized structure can continue for a couple more years (happy to be proven wrong here). Also the scaling in dataset sizes will ultimately halt (or might be already) for supervised learning which might give a bump for reinforcement learning where there is usually unlimited data (due to simulation)')
