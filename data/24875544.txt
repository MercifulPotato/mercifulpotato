It also includes a lot of documentation in the report. For example, recon data. They could also include we checked X for Y but did not found any issues. Nothing is 100% secure, and if you don&#x27;t find anything after extensive manual testing it is, well, going to be a boring report, because you still have to document everything. It also feels like a failure (which is why the honeypot was a little bit mean, though clever as well given goal of post).<p>CEH is a joke btw. No serious pentester puts that on their resume. Its a waste of time to get thst certificate. OSCP is the gold standard.<p>In short, you pay peanuts you get monkeys and CEH is a red flag. OSCP is a green flag.')
