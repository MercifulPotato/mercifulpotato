Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611301533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868510, text='<i>&gt; You hear this all the time on message boards</i><p>To be clear, the norm I am describing has nothing to do with &quot;message boards&quot; or even with the Internet. It has to do with the stated justification for journalists publishing information about people that they would rather keep secret. That justification is &quot;the public&#x27;s right to know&quot;. That has always been the stated justification, for as long as there have been journalists. And in cases where that justification did not apply, journalists were supposed to <i>not</i> publish that kind of information. That is not something that Internet message boards invented.<p>Alexander&#x27;s point is basically that the mere fact of him writing a blog, even a blog that got popular, did not mean the public had a right to know personal information about him that he chose to keep secret. (Yes, I know it wasn&#x27;t actually secret, but it was still, as he notes in the article, quite a bit more secret than it would have been once published in the NYT. More on that below.) I agree with him.<p><i>&gt; it&#x27;s at times been an article of faith around here that reference checks aren&#x27;t OK, unless they&#x27;re directed specifically to people candidates provide as references</i><p>I agree there is no such &quot;rule&quot; in reality, but this has nothing whatever to do with journalism or journalistic norms, which is what is involved in Alexander&#x27;s case, so it&#x27;s irrelevant to this discussion.<p><i>&gt; In reality, people can share unfavorable information about you for their own reasons and, as long as that information isn&#x27;t false, there really isn&#x27;t much you can do about it. Nor should you be able to! You can&#x27;t coerce random people into not sharing true things about you.</i><p>In terms of what people <i>can</i> do, yes, you are absolutely right. People <i>can</i> do these things, and there isn&#x27;t much one can do to stop them.<p>But that in no way means they <i>should</i> do these things just because they can.<p><i>&gt; You italicize &quot;blog&quot;, like there&#x27;s some important norm of &quot;blogging&quot; that was violated here</i><p>No, I italicized &quot;blog&quot; to make the point that <i>it&#x27;s not a big deal</i>. It&#x27;s just stuff that someone wrote about stuff that interested him. It&#x27;s not nuclear weapons secrets or diplomatic communications or official pronouncements whose provenance needs to be verified. In short, it wasn&#x27;t the kind of thing where &quot;the public&#x27;s right to know&quot; was even involved.<p><i>&gt; Alexander wrote that blog for years under his own name</i><p>No, he wrote a <i>different</i> blog, which, as he explains explicitly in the article (and as you note), he took down when he realized that having it under his own name was causing issues. The blog of his that the NYT wanted to write about was <i>not</i> the one he wrote under his own name, and had no visible connection with that older blog of his; what&#x27;s more, the NYT article had nothing to do with that older blog of his, and as far as I can tell, the NYT wasn&#x27;t even aware of it. So the fact of its existence is irrelevant to any judgment about what the NYT did.<p><i>&gt; where&#x27;s the line between me and Alexander?</i><p>Simple: Alexander wasn&#x27;t running for office. Or doing anything else that would imply &quot;the public&#x27;s right to know&quot;. He was just writing stuff.')
