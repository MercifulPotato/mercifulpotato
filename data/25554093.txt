Why stuff bonds with shit? Because there are buyers who will spend 1bn dollars on a bond tranch without doing 10k in analysis of the underlying. Not just some buyers, a huge market of them. If people had done a little due diligence 5 years earlier, the crisis would have been 20 times smaller. It would have been a minor story on page 27 of the finance section.<p>Social media algos are the same. They recommend conspiracy bs because there are 1million morons glugging it down for every developer pushing it. They fund his bonus cheque.
