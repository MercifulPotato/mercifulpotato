California is far and away the #1 destination of educated and wealthy domestic migrants, especially from &quot;red states&quot;, by which I assume you mean states that habitually vote for Republicans. Pick any MAGA-infested den of ignorance that you prefer, and the story is the same. I choose Sioux Falls, SD, which has an overall negative net domestic migration that is extremely negative among people with some college, college degrees, and post-graduate educations but positive among people with high school diplomas and high-school dropouts. Bay Area domestic migration is the complement of this process: very positive among post-graduates and college grads, very negative among high school and less.<p>Same basic story if you break it down by income levels.<p>Why is this? There are large classes of people who can&#x27;t stand to live in the MAGAsphere, and I mean huge classes of people like females, people of color, homosexuals, and non-christians. Whenever these people scrape together enough money to do so, they escape to a jurisdiction that recognizes their personhood, whether that be New York, California, or Austin.')
