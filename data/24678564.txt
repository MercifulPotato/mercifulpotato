I know that a number of objectively hateful subreddits were not banned because they were hateful of people &quot;in the majority&quot; (whatever that means).<p>An archived copy of Reddit&#x27;s &quot;Account and Community Restrictions&quot; from the time of the ban reads as such [0]:<p>&gt; <i>While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example,</i> the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority <i>or who promote such attacks of hate.</i><p>The question here veers into the territory of whether Reddit is a &quot;publisher&quot; or &quot;platform&quot;. Their editorial decision to ban certain kinds of loosely-defined &quot;hate&quot; seems to clearly point to them being an editorializing publisher of content. This, in addition to their editing of user&#x27;s posts criticizing their core team [1] and other such egregious acts.<p>There&#x27;s no compelling reason for me to believe Reddit acted in good faith.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200701001008&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddithelp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;categories&#x2F;rules-reporting&#x2F;account-and-community-restrictions&#x2F;promoting-hate-based-identity-or" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200701001008&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddi...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;reddit-ceo-edits-user-comments_n_5839cf32e4b000af95ee5b68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;reddit-ceo-edits-user-comment...</a>')
