Item(by='darksaints', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601751925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24673736, text='Out of all non-landlocked countries, only two do not belong to, and therefore are not technically regulated by, the International Maritime Organization: Micronesia and Taiwan. So unless they are registering your ships in those countries (most cruise ships use flags of convenience for tax reasons, not regulatory reasons), they are playing by those rules, even while in international waters. And by doing so, the NOx and SOx are cut drastically.<p>I don&#x27;t think cruise ships are great. Even if they were fueled by pure renewable or nuclear energy, there are still problems, ranging from invasive species taking trips across the world in bilges, nutrient-concentrations from black water dumps leading to overgrowth zones of marine plants, destroyed coral reefs from massive anchor chains, and garbage pollution that makes its way off of poorly contained balconies. But again, this is a problem of regulation. They are all fixable problems.<p>I also should mention that I find most arguments about cruise industry labor policies to be extremely hypocritical and elitist. People will complain about how they make their workers work long hours for little pay, but won&#x27;t lift a finger to change it. Open up our borders, give them an option to work somewhere that has actual labor laws. Hell, when these cruise ships come into US ports, we don&#x27;t even let the workers off the boat, for fear that they might illegally stay permanently and have a better life with labor laws and living wages inside our borders. We take away all their better options, but then complain that unethical companies take advantage of it?<p>Basically, I agree that the cruise industry is dirty, unethical, and run by despicable people. But the actual problems they present to the world are also fixable by the world, and cruises don&#x27;t necessarily need to be banned to do so. I&#x27;d prefer they fix their problems, but I still want them around  so that the high school dropout machinist with 4 kids can go on regular vacations with his family and realize his dream of visiting 30 countries before he dies.')
