I didn’t believe in this project when I first read one of his initial “I want to make a proglang” articles.  Just one guy?  And he doesn’t have a programming language background?  And he wants to make a language which can be used instead of C, the most hard to replace programming language (apparently)?<p>I still haven’t tried it myself.  But I see now that there are plenty of people who have made an informed choice and chosen Zig over the other systems programming languages.  So obviously they must be doing something right.  Obviously Zig has something that system programmers like.<p>So, props!')
