I also have a touchpad on my XPS that feels just as good as a Mac.<p>To boot, I haven&#x27;t had to touch a config file related to input devices or output devices a <i>single</i> time using Arch&#x2F;GDE&#x2F;Wayland.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d probably still be running linux in a VM on my laptop if it weren&#x27;t for Wayland.<p>If X is your opinion of &quot;stable and working&quot; then I don&#x27;t want any part of your systems.')
