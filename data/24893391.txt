Our reinsurer is based in Bermuda and given the population is only 64K and has very few unemployed actuaries, it is hard to scale the reinsurance business via hiring people. Thanks to Estuare monthly operations related to high value contracts with insurers can be fully automated and allow the business to scale. Given that the insurer and reinsurer can both introduce new data and eiter sides used to do extremely complex calculations in a spreadsheet to validate how much money needs to flow in which direction each month, the process would take weeks due to often human error. With Estuare the process now takes minutes and is fully auditable, which for contracts that can run 50 years is important, as well as allowing previous data updates to be incorporated immediately instead of once a year.')
