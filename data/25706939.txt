NERF is pretty amazing but isn&#x27;t real-time like SDF raymarching. Tetrahedral meshes are interesting as well.<p>One of the best Siggraph papers from last year was Monte Carlo Geometry Processing <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~kmcrane&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;MonteCarloGeometryProcessing&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~kmcrane&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;MonteCarloGeometryPr...</a>. It doesn&#x27;t introduce a new representation, but does introduce a new way to render various representations by sampling them in a unified way')
