My kids play No Man&#x27;s Sky with me and the 12 core 2920X handles it no issues whatsoever even though the game is atrocious optimization wise. Should have gotten a 16 core so we all three could play on same box.<p>X&lt;3|4|5&gt;70 boards should allow 2 GPUs in separate IOMMU groups. My old system was a 1700X on ASUS Prime x370 Pro with 2 gaming VMs. Only issue with x?70 boards is the IOMMU groups for USB controllers. On the Prime x370 Pro, only one USB controller is in its own IOMMU group, so second VM needed a USB passthrough.<p>On the Threadripper, due to the vast amount of PCIe lanes, on the Asrock Taichi x399, I got two USB controllers in their own IOMMU groups and each of the 4 PCIex16 slots it&#x27;s in its own IOMMU group.
