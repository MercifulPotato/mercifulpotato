Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25018208], score=None, time=1604722691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012156, text='&gt; Honest question:<p>People who start with &quot;honest question&quot; usually are not being honest.<p>&gt; The only argument I&#x27;ve heard was &quot;well most present-day hunter-gatherer societies are like this&quot;<p>Not most. All of them as far as I know. And that isn&#x27;t the only argument. It&#x27;s human physiology. Men are built to fight&#x2F;hunt&#x2F;etc. We can swing swords harder, throw spears further, pull bow strings further, run faster, etc. Not to mention our closest kin, the chimps, also have have male hunting parties. So it&#x27;s highly likely, this structure has been around for millions of years, even before we became humans.<p>&gt; which is incredibly weak<p>How the hell is that weak? It&#x27;s absolutely conclusive.<p>&gt; (not all such societies are like this, and they also evolved along with modern society and probably weren&#x27;t frozen in time for 10000 years)<p>Well then find such societies. Go find a hunter-as-female&#x2F;male-as-gatherer society. Just because you wish it were true doesn&#x27;t make it so. On the one side, we have a mountain of evidence. On your side, nothing.<p>The hunters in hunter-gatherer societies also served as &quot;warriors&quot; to protect the family&#x2F;tribe&#x2F;territory. So a female-as-hunter tribe&#x2F;society wouldn&#x27;t last long in the &quot;wild&quot;, if they ever existed.<p>Modern weapons make it easy for women to hunt, but even today, it&#x27;s primarily the males that hunt.<p>Why create a throwaway for this question? That&#x27;s what I find the most bizarre.')
