I moved into to IT&#x2F;Security from another sector, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out my endgame. At least at my company, there aren&#x27;t any jobs I covet. Most of the higher ups don&#x27;t impress me, and they don&#x27;t seem to know what&#x27;s going on in their company very well. It seems like if I moved into leadership, I&#x27;d have to spend a lot of time lying-via-powerpoint. (that is, taking a complex problem, and both simplifying and misrepresenting in a powerpoint which shows &quot;progress&quot; happening.)<p>I wasn&#x27;t a loser in my old career, and I don&#x27;t want to be a loser in tech. But, it seems like everyone is a loser here. IT&#x2F;Security is seen as a well-paid janitor; someone you need, but not someone you really care to learn about. Worse, becoming &quot;important&quot; in a company seems to be useful only in so far as you have sway at that particular company. ie, it&#x27;s a lot of work for some very local, and very useless prestige. And worse, there&#x27;s no external meaning other than your own status. Why do I care if I have a little fiefdom within company walls? Nothing worthwhile is being accomplished, it&#x27;s just more sales.')
