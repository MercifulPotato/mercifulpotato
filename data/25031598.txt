What a lot of people miss is the purpose of the election college and the fact that it is working exactly as designed, framing it as &quot;voter suppression&quot; is an unfortunate way to frame it.<p>The founders anticipated most people living in cities and so used the college to give more weight to rural votes. It can be argued they miscalibrated but America would be much less conservative if we decided the presidency by popular vote. Change the system and you&#x27;ll be handing the country over to city dealers, the fact that people that live in cities call themselves Democrats in cities DOES NOT mean there is voter suppression of democrats.')
