SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 is an orbital rocket which is a much, much more difficult achievement. But only the first stage of the Falcon 9 is reusable, with the second stage begin lost on each launch. The Starship rocket under development is being designed to be fully reusable with a quick turn around like an airplane. In fact SpaceX hopes to see Starship used for quick intercontinental trips on Earth.<p>Blue Origin is building a large re-usable rocket like the Starship called the New Glenn, but its first launch date keeps slipping. I would guess that Starship will be launching first but it is really cool that two groups are working on such rockets.')
