On windows thats easy, control + delete.<p>On macOS it&#x27;s option+delete.<p>&gt; On Mac, somehow I never remember how to do it and end up deleting the entire line of text. It&#x27;s just stupid.<p>It&#x27;s stupid that the shortcut on MacOS is different than on Windows and you can&#x27;t remember it?<p>&gt; Also, want to delete a file? Yeah that&#x27;s going to be a different keystroke, the delete is only for text.<p>AFAIK there is no macOS shortcut to delete a file in Finder. There is a shortcut to move a file to Trash. This is a different action than deleting text (there is no Trash for text), so I think it&#x27;s fair to use a slightly different shortcut (command-delete).')
