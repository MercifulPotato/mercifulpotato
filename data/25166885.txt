This makes it great for documentation (with examples you can actually execute), as an output format for automated reports, as a scriptable Tensorboard, as a platform for interactive articles, and for educational purposes (tutorials, homework).<p>Python works for stuff that was written for it purposefully. \nSome python libraries work great: numpy, matplotlib, pandas. But many others are not supported directly and can be installed through micropip, but that&#x27;s quite confusing! These are the issues with Pyodide currently:<p>* All python code that is executed is synchronous, which means it can not make requests (or call sleep). You can actually make a request using pyodide.open_url(&#x27;path&#x27;), but that makes a synchronous request which isn&#x27;t really a good idea for anything but small files. I believe asynchronous Python is possible, recent versions of emscripten support it, but it needs someone to put the pieces together (which is not easy!)<p>* Some packages are huge without being split up. Scipy is actually the only one that&#x27;s really problematic, I believe it&#x27;s around 80MB? It should be possible to split it up (into scipy.interpolate, scipy.stats, etc)<p>* Micropip is asynchronous, so you get a promise when you use micropip.install(&#x27;my-package&#x27;), but you can&#x27;t &quot;await&quot; it.<p>* Loading Python initially freezes the browser for a second or two.. not a great user experience.<p>* Libraries which are not pure python currently need to be manually made compatible with patches - including torch.<p>Python in the browser (not just in Starboard) needs more love. This is powered by Pyodide[0] which has been making steady progress, but the project is without corporate backing since Mozilla&#x27;s change of direction. Perhaps Observable can allocate some of their funding towards supporting Python in their notebooks too through this project? Also consider this a call to action for other contributors who want to see Python in the browser become a reality :)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iodide-project&#x2F;pyodide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iodide-project&#x2F;pyodide</a>')
