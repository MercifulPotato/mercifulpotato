Your only shot at a decent income was taking bribes (the medicine is socialized, so doctors are in charge in state&#x27;s resources and, when bribed, will direct them at you) or starting a private practice, but for that you&#x27;d usually have to be 40+ years old.<p>And yet, people did become doctors and worked hard. It was still a respectable profession, and hard to get into. Maybe Poland is (or was) just less materialistic than the US.')
