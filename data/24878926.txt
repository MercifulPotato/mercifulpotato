Item(by='vladvasiliu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603544419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878659, text='I can&#x27;t comment on the behavior you noticed other than saying that the devices seem defective to me, but I may be wrong.<p>&gt; Newer Apple devices&#x2F;iOS supposedly prevents overcharging, that might also explains Sidecar integration with macOS.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on Li-Ion batteries, but my understanding is that this is a separate issue.<p>What this does ins&#x27;t preventing <i>over</i>charging, it just charges the battery less than what it&#x27;s fully rated for, the idea being that you&#x27;ll probably not need the full charge, hence the description of that iOS feature saying it tries to learn when you use the device to know when it needs to be fully charged.<p>My understanding is that LI-Ion batteries may see less degradation if they aren&#x27;t always charged to 100% of their rated capacity, especially if this capacity is &quot;pushed too far&quot;, for example by manufacturers looking to extract the longest possible advertised battery life for a device with the smallest possible size. This is something that I expect most phones and tablets to attempt to maximize.<p><i>Overcharging</i> would mean, to me, attempting to keep on charging the battery once its rated charge has been reached. The point of my original comment is that I don&#x27;t believe that leaving a device plugged in after it says the battery is at 100% would keep on trying to charge the battery, as was the case for example with &quot;dumb&quot; NiCd and NiMH chargers. The battery control circuitry would stop charging once it deems the battery full, so leaving the device plugged in would simply have it use the power from the mains instead of from the battery. Which should actually help with battery aging, since it eliminates &quot;useless&quot; cycles (useless because the device doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to work on battery since mains power is available).')
