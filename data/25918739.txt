It is oligopolistic within some domains, but as we&#x27;ve seen with the Covid vaccine, there are at least four nation-state domains (<i>e.g.</i> Russia, China, India and &quot;the West&quot;) operating competitively, and within those domains, there are varying degrees of competitiveness (<i>e.g.</i> Pfizer vs. Moderna vs. AstraZeneca).<p>If you have a cure to something everyone else can only treat, you&#x27;ll make a money selling the cure and taking your competitors&#x27; market share. Because if you don&#x27;t, they will. It&#x27;s a classic cartel &#x2F; prisoner&#x27;s dilemma problem with the added explosive of a multi-decade patent-protected monopoly for the first mover.')
