If you&#x27;re making claims, especially in a discussion that is perhaps contentious or controversial, it is absolutely your responsibility to back up these claims. We shouldn&#x27;t have to do all the work to decide if true or to begin debunking them, especially if the evidence for your claims come from unreliable and shady sources.<p>If the response is &quot;just google it&quot;, or &quot;the facts are out there&quot; then I&#x27;m flipping the bozo-bit on you.')
