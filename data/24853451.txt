Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603323116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853395, text='Yea - but it should still be possible to structure such a compact in a way where you wouldn&#x27;t create loser states - let&#x27;s say you target 80% buy-in of states (by representative numbers) before activating and you&#x27;re talking about the house (the same rule goes for the senate but the activation might fire at a different time) - The only scenario that would really flub the system is if the 20% of house seats not covered by the compact went all to one party (say the purple party) in close races while the green party and yellow party split the vote otherwise - in that case maybe the purple party won 11% of the popular vote and thus is over-represented by the 20% of control they have.  Still the other states could balance the math to split the remaining 80% appropriately.<p>Additionally, as long as that proportion is significantly high enough (say above the 66% mark) the two parties that were partially disenfranchised would still be left sharing a strong majority in the house between them and, if something similar happened with the senate, they could coalition up and force through a congressional amendment that would bring the remaining portion of the country in line for the next election.<p>The Interstate Voting Compact couldn&#x27;t be precisely similarly applied to congressional elections, it&#x27;d need more momentum behind it, but there is a way for the math to work out.<p>All that said, IANAL and I have no idea if the legal shenanigans used to make the IVC binding could also be utilized for a similar movement around the house and senate.')
