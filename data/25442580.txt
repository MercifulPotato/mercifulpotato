It&#x27;s stories we tell each other rather than a fundamental unassailable truth like gravity. That means that no matter how good the economic idea - it&#x27;s also immeasurably a bit wrong. We can say behaviours and outcomes are extremely likely without ignoring they don&#x27;t always hold true.<p>But what does that mean for your suggestion that the framing is wrong here? You&#x27;ve based an opinion based on something potentially untrue.<p>To make it more concrete, you cite the laffer curve. Where do communists exist on the laffer curve? Right where the curve suggests 0% income they&#x27;re getting 100% income. What&#x27;s exactly wrong or off by the full 100% - the laffer curve or that communists exist?<p>To give another concrete example, you said:<p>&gt;&gt; People adjust behavior based on the tax level<p>Irrational actors do exist. They can be irrational (in the economic sense) for more reasons than just a lack of information too.<p>I&#x27;ve become really concerned by the certainty i see expressed in some economic views, some of them are really persuasive, if you ignore that they&#x27;re built on a metaphorical foundation of sand.')
