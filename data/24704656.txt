This will prevent lots of people from getting their green cards (if not shut down by courts).<p>I’m currently in the process of applying for a green card. This really sucks because I’m relatively young, just moved to the US from Germany 3 years ago and thus probably not in the upper 5% percentile for Staff Software Engineers in my area (surprise surprise). It’s disheartening to see so many negative comments here on HN. This does not apply only to staffing agencies but to most people in tech that don’t have a green card.')
