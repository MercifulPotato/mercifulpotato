When I go without my meds, I&#x27;m in a really bad mood the first day and get much worse the following days.  That said, I don&#x27;t have an addiction <i>disorder</i>, because it doesn&#x27;t impair my ability to work, maintain relationships, pursue goals, or remain healthy.  In fact, it does the opposite.  That&#x27;s why my doctor prescribes them.<p>(As an aside, the reason I&#x27;ve gone days without meds is because my insurance company has a harmful policy of requiring &quot;prior authorization&quot; from the same doctor who prescribes the pills, and more than once I&#x27;ve found out it needed renewed from a pharmacist who was only allowed to try filling it the day I took my last pill.  I&#x27;m tired of this incredibly helpful medication, and the people who depend on it, being thought less of.)')
