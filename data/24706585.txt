You have many false positives (and depending on test quality also false negatives).<p>The only real solution is a combination of complex problem solving settings and individual evaluation by a teacher or similar role. You have to find out what is going on inside the person&#x27;s brain, <i>why</i> they chose this or that answer - essentially by talking to the person.<p>You&#x27;d need AGI to tech that.<p>A step in the right direction would be to abandon single-number scores and introduce more differentiated numbers for different properties of learning, knowledge and so on.<p>Even better would be assessment of individual learning progress instead of objective result, though this is a hard sell as long as there is a labor market. Employers will want to have an easy metric for comparison of different candidates. Objective scores produce perverse incentives: Say I&#x27;m bad at math (school grade E level) , but I am motivated to improve. I work my ass off trying to learn after school etc.,  and after 3 months I&#x27;ll write another test. Now I get a D. Objectively still a bad result, almost guaranteed to demotivate me after months of hard work, despite the <i>relative</i> progress being substantial. A grade reflecting the relative progress would reward effort, which usually is what educational settings want to foster.')
