In his book Graeber goes onto length on how this dialetic of &quot;compensatory consumerism&quot; has been established throughout society, going all the way back to the Protestant work ethic, the labor theory of value, and then the scientific management of Taylorism. He doesn&#x27;t just critique the phenomenon of bullshit jobs as simply &quot;blame capitalism&quot; or &quot;blame the workers&quot;, it&#x27;s far more subtle than that, and I would recommend reading the full book if you are curious about it.')
