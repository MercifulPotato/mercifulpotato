Washington almost had a non compete ban, and hopefully it goes through next time.<p>I would never consider a state that didn&#x27;t even have parental leave benefits, simply because I would rather my descendants live in a state with some level of protections for employees versus employers.  Although a mix of California&#x27;s laws about overtime pay, giving option of sitting, non competes, and personal projects plus Washington&#x27;s minimum wages for both hourly and salaried exempt employees would be ideal.')
