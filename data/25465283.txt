It would actually be difficult to re-implement it in such a way that it is passes the tests, but is incompatible.<p>Would it be as robust? Absolutely not, unless all the OS interaction code were transcribed directly.<p>But Rust has no compiler that targets anywhere near the number of platforms SQLite is deployed on, and never will. The best that could be hoped for is that most such platforms would no longer be used, by the time the transcription is done.')
