If you&#x27;re belief is that it&#x27;s logical, it must be an argument we can discuss, backup with data - etc.<p>So to that end, the reason i&#x27;m liberal is that i believe there is a balance between social safety nets and capitalist incentives. In my view, we are currently the conservative dream. Very few protections for workers, less and less than years past - with increasing benefits for corporations that see little to no benefits trickled down to the workers. Walmart and Comcast are what i see as the natural result of conservative practice.<p>I simply want what will result in the least suffering. Yet i see suffering in mass in the very pro-0.01% behavior. Walmart does great in this environment - it&#x27;s employees, less so. Worse yet if you lose your Walmart job, as the safety nets are being dismantled left and right by conservatives.<p>So, what reading would you recommend i do to show me that fiscal conservative behavior here and that further more reducing lower&#x2F;middle class protections is beneficial to them?<p>I certainly do not claim to know all, or any, answers. All i know is the state of the poor is very unsettling to me in America. What reading would you suggest?')
