Noticed that neither the buyer nor the seller manipulate bitcoin. No address, no transaction on the blockchain. It shows bitcoin on your account but in reality, it was a euro to dollar transaction.<p>Most likely you will be able to have a bitcoin account too, but again, dollars in, dollars out. If bitcoins raises in value, you get more dollars, if it crashes, you get less, but you never get actual bitcoin.<p>Edit: And BTW that&#x27;s the reason why most people are using cryptocurrency for, as an index like gold. Besides criminals, few people use it to make payments.')
