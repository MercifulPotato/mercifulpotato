A 150mph train requires shallow curves and therefore won&#x27;t run on an existing freight right-of-way.  If not for that, it would be pretty straightforward to build.<p>Meanwhile, a plane ride from Portland to Seattle is 30 minutes and cheaper anyway.  There&#x27;s no incentive to invest in high speed rail.')
