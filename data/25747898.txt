Hamstring might not be fair to <i>&quot;Intel Compiler&quot;</i>, as it was designed for Intel in the first place. Unfair Comparison would be a more valid description. i.e The problem is not with &quot;Intel&#x27;s compiler&quot;, the problem is with the benchmarks and marketing.<p>2. Keep in mind fastest Single Threaded benchmark is still somewhat true considering Intel can turbo up to 5Ghz.<p>3. TDP comparison between AMD and Intel are meaningless these days. They have different definition of TDP.<p>4. So if you put 2 and 3 together, that is like saying they have the fastest Laptop processor by overlocking it to 5Ghz with a higher energy usage within limited time frame.<p>Final Note: Generally speaking one should avoid wccftech unless you know precisely how to read into their rumours and findings. ( Unless their source are official like in this case ) Anandtech is a much better source.')
