By IP? With most content served by a CDN or DDOS shield already, that&#x27;s arguably fine; most meaningful on the customer IP where you&#x27;d want fairness across customers anyways. Or do you mean internet providers will privilege their own content? Already happening, to the extent allowed by law (I&#x27;m looking at you, FCC). Not likely to change with HTTP&#x2F;3 - empirically, needs to be addressed by regulation and not technology.')
