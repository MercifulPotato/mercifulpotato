Item(by='c0l0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611127788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841861, text='&quot;Should&quot; is such a beautiful concept ;)<p>The McAfee-based proxy we have SOMETIMES (I guess it depends on the content-type and the length of the upstream response) renders a kind of &quot;intermediate&quot; HTML document as the response body, where the human user is supposed to click on a link that makes the UA download the originally requested resource from an internal, ad-hoc mirror. I guess that is due to some virus scanning snake oil.<p>At any rate, what the packages at Amazon did there is just right up in &quot;that is crazy&quot;-territory.')
