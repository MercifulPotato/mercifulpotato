Item(by='szc', descendants=None, kids=[25955461], score=None, time=1611907741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950976, text='This could be evidence that the often used trope that &quot;open source&quot; software is more secure because there are more &quot;eyes&quot; looking at it is false or just misleading.<p>If everyone using &quot;open source&quot; believes someone else is looking at the code for security problems, who is it that actually is? (conjecture, not enough of the &quot;good&quot; people. Sad face)<p>Snark aside, a code base can consist of many millions * N lines of code. I am skeptical of the numbers presented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;millions-lines-of-code&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;millions-lines-of-code&#x2F;</a> but it can be used as a starting point.<p>How many lines of code can a human security auditor process in a day, 2000, 3000? At what point does system complexity &#x2F; other component interaction cause failure? What is the rate of change for the code base?<p>How many capable human security auditors exist in the world? How many can you hire?<p>My personal opinion about how to get a human to identify problems is that they have to be able to build very accurate &quot;mind&quot; models of how complex software behaves. My experience tells me this is a very difficult skill to teach to adults. My feeling is that it is tied to how an individual perceives, models and transitions between real and abstract things.<p>Using computers to &quot;solve&quot; this problem seems like it is the answer, but doing so requires humans and human interactions with entirely disjoint skill sets to make it happen. I don&#x27;t think the current way that &quot;security problems&quot; are handled is going to suddenly make this happen. Opinion: &quot;Open Source&quot; software vendors will find it difficult to get any traction on this problem.<p>Hiring Problem: If human security auditors find a problem and prevent it from ever being known, how do you quantifiably measure their effectiveness and justify the costs in employing them?<p>Fictional-Exec: &quot;We&#x27;ve not had a security problem in two years, why are we paying XXXX for all these security people? What are they doing?&quot;<p>TL;DR (at the end :-): This is not surprising. Other surprises will continue to happen. This is why the &quot;security industry&quot; has lots of players peddling some quite awful products. It is easy to backwards-sell a product if if has been &quot;taught&quot; a specific problem.')
