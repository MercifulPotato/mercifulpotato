Item(by='lemming', descendants=None, kids=[25623141], score=None, time=1609618362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614966, text='I develop Cursive - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cursive-ide.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cursive-ide.com</a>, a plugin for Clojure development in IntelliJ. I started working on it seriously in 2014, started selling it in 2015 after about 2 years in beta (during which time I had a daughter) and it has provided all my income since then. The sales are more than my salary + bonus (but less than total comp) at my last job at Google. This year is the first year that sales have dipped slightly, probably due to COVID and a better competitor for VS Code, but it&#x27;s still very profitable.')
