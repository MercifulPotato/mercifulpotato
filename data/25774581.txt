Anywhere outside of Munich €100k is a really high salary for a software engineer. Not impossible to get, I know of a few companies that offer that kind of compensation or even higher and are located in Berlin (though all of them have their HQ in the US), but that&#x27;s very high income compared to the rest of the market.<p>In any case, the point is that with €100k&#x2F;year you can really have way more than a decent life.
