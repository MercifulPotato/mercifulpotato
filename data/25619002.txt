This was contemporaneous with the US effort to support the Syrian Kurds around Raqqa. But Idlib is quite far away.<p>Secondly, Airwars.org does not show US strikes in that area and the US insists coalition forces in general did not have any air strikes at Idlib during the time in question.<p>Finally, I do not find the title to be a fair summary of their argument for dismissal:<p>&gt;Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this suit.  Plaintiff alleges that he was in the vicinity of five near-misses in Syriaâ€”a nation with an ongoing civil war.  But he alleges no facts specifically linking the United States to those attacks.  The most he offers is an unsupported assertion that one attack involved a type of missile used by the United States, among other countries.  And he likewise fails to plausibly allege that any of these attacks, even if attributable to the United States, actually targeted him.')
