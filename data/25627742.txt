On most days I would be told to just put it in some random dumpster, no receipt written up and no vehicle weigh in&#x2F;out or anything. I figured that was just the process until one day I was told to take it to a specific place where there was other styrofoam being collected, my vehicle was weighed in&#x2F;out and a receipt generated. Who knows what they were doing with it on those other days?')
