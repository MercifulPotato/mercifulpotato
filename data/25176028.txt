Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606035473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175207, text='A glass of fortified milk (only full-fat milk is commonly fortified, this is something parents tend to avoid due to the FDA fat paranoia) is only 10% of vitamin D needed per day. And it&#x27;s not clear if that dose is <i>actually</i> sufficient even in the unlikely event that 10 glasses of milk are consumed. I, for example, take 2000 IU of vitamin D daily and my bloodwork shows vitamin D smack dab in the middle of the &quot;normal&quot; range. According to Kaiser Permanente this &quot;indicates supplementation&quot;, which tells me that this &quot;normal&quot; vitamin D is actually not normal at all, and most people are deficient. Coincidentally I do believe I had COVID in March of this year. My only symptom was the loss of smell and taste for a couple of days. Not even a fever.  I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it, since these symptoms weren&#x27;t known at the time.<p>This is anecdata though, so it doesn&#x27;t really mean anything.')
