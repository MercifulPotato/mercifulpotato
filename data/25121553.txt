At Stripe he did amazing work, but it was mostly organizational. He built a world class team, defined a set of short, medium and long term goals that enabled the company to reduce risks over time, had his team build tools to measure that risk and held them accountable for moving the needle.<p>That is to say, he did executive level work. I imagine heâ€™ll do similarly great work at Twitter, setting them up for long term success, just as he did at Stripe')
