What&#x27;s the difference between a &quot;tax deduction&quot; and paying with &quot;pre-tax dollars&quot;?<p>Do they mean if for example a company pays $5000&#x2F;year in employee insurance, they can subtract $5000 from their tax bill? If so, that&#x27;s a tax credit right?<p>As I understand it, a &quot;tax deduction&quot; is a deduction on taxable income (in the case of an individual) or profit (in the case of a company).')
