Half of the half-bakedness is due to lack of MTA protocol support for MUA interactions on the receiving side.<p>pop3 was never meant as a spool for MTA to MTA email transfers, but was instead meant for an MUA to access. It&#x27;s not fetchmail&#x27;s fault that the envelope TO isn&#x27;t available via pop3. That, at the time, email service providers bolted on entire domain delivery to a single mailbox, and then users of those services put multiple recipients behind that single mailbox. Fetchmail made this work as best it could. Also missing at the time was any kind of serious connecting-client-as-MTA or MTA-to-MTA authentication (rather, relying on DNS and TCP!), which might have made async, receiver controlled MTA initiation more workable.<p>This was also due to common SMTP MTAs not having good (or at least easy&#x2F;obvious to configure) store-for-later-pickup functionality where an MTA could query for email destined for itself rather than be always-on connected to the internet waiting for another MTA to initiate  delivery. Fetchmail filled a hole that existed in email delivery at the time, but it was really a hole that should have never existed. The quality of the fetchmail code is another, albeit serious, issue in itself.<p>These days we have a better understanding of the differences between MTAs, MSAs, and MUAs.')
