Say you order a truckload of USDA Choice tenderloin. Meat quality is continuous, so really, USDA Choice refers to a range of quality; some Choice meat is on the lower end, almost Select, and some Choice meat is on the higher end, almost Prime. It would be a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability if the seller sent you a shipment of tenderloin that was all at the low end of the Choice range.

A particular contract can by its express terms lay down a different rule, such as disclaiming any warranty (as-is) or specifying its own terms of warranty (an express warranty).<p>[1] What you described is just a straight-up breach of contract, even in the absence of a warranty. If you order USDA Choice meat, a shipment of USDA Select meat is such a breach of contract. In agriculture, and especially outside of meat, some of a shipment will always fall <i>outside</i> of the quality range. This is dealt with in the grading definition.
