The thing that makes systemic&#x2F;structural racism systemic&#x2F;structural is that you&#x27;d have to radically change of the normal order of things to address the underlying problem. It&#x27;s not personal, and it therefore can&#x27;t be fixed by a few personal actions. It has to be fixed at the systems level.<p>BigCorps <i>can&#x27;t</i> change anything about systemic racism because they <i>are</i> the system.<p><i>&gt; Focusing on things they can reasonably change is a legitimate approach.</i><p>&quot;Mandatory HR training made me rethink my views on systemic racism&quot; -- no one ever.<p>In fact, I&#x27;m 100% convinced that these diversity trainings are actively counter-productive to actually changing any minds.<p>If you take structural racism seriously, then the idea of BigCorp &quot;doing something&quot; about structural racism via HR lectures to low level employees is prime facie absurd. Cindy in accounting can&#x27;t do shit about structural&#x2F;systemic racism... that&#x27;s kind of the whole point of distinguishing it from more personal forms of discrimination&#x2F;prejudice.<p>Training on systemic racism might make sense for powerful people with the ability to effect the functioning of systems over years&#x2F;decades. Politicians, boards, CEOs, execs, VCs, maybe some managers, etc. And it&#x27;s the sort of thing that activists should try to explain in public forums.<p>But at the individual contributor level, a much simpler regimen of &quot;what is explicit discrimination&quot; + &quot;we will fire you for overt explicit discrimination because it is illegal and not aligned with our corporate values&quot; + &quot;dear god don&#x27;t do stupid shit like wearing blackface to the company party&quot; + maybe a short module on implicit bias is much more effective. Because that&#x27;s the sort of material is actionable at the IC level, and it&#x27;s the sort of thing people are open to being told by HR drones.<p>Half day trainings on systemic racism for Cindy in Accounting or Bob the Admin Assistant makes no god damn sense, and probably does more harm than good.<p>Like, seriously, HR is not the right place for this conversation. You&#x27;ll lose more people than you gain by shoe-horning such a complex topic into a BigCorp training module. Stick to shop ethics.')
