Now what?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Facts:<p>* GCP + Elastic Cloud have an acknowledged (in writing) bug that is charging us 10x the proper amount. It started early on New Years Day and affects clients using Elastic Cloud purchased through Google Cloud&#x27;s Marketplace.<p>* We are a bootstrapped startup with ~$1M ARR (launched product in May 2020). Still growing and just recently breakeven.<p>* Google has tied up 100% of our cash with their auto-bill. Credit cards are full ($32k in charges in a week).<p>* I laid off two people because I couldn&#x27;t pay them. Everyone else is due a paycheck at the end of the month.<p>* Google is still charging us 10x normal rates every day. Elastic is &quot;working to fix the issue.&quot;<p>* We can&#x27;t get off Elastic Cloud because we can&#x27;t increase quotas for machines until... we pay our GCP bill.<p>I always thought the stories on here about Google were 1 in a million... but here we are.<p>&quot;Support&quot; on both sides is a stone wall. What should I do to save this company and all our jobs?')
