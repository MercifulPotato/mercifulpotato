Are you trying to say that Stripe is violating their own policies by offering a clearing-house API to facilitate their customers getting loans from banks?<p>Or are you trying to say that a Stripe <i>customer</i> would be in violation of Stripe&#x27;s policies, if they used this facilitaton-of-loans to provide loans to <i>their own</i> customers?<p>Because I think the first statement is obviously false; and the second statement is obviously true, but vacuous — in that that&#x27;s <i>not</i> the service that Stripe is offering. (Or, I mean, it could be in special cases, but it&#x27;s not pitched that way because for most companies doing that would be <i>a legal impossibility</i>.)<p>Obviously, Stripe can hook your company up with a bank; and obviously, that bank can offer your company some loans. Those two processes, separately, are entirely normal things that happen every day in the financial world. Combining them doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>Obviously (to me, at least), your company <i>cannot</i> take a loan offered by a bank, and repackage that same loan to your own customers as part of your offering as if it was from you, with your company controlling+mediating that relationship — at least, not without you yourself being legally reclassified as a bank. (Which is why that&#x27;s not what <i>Stripe itself</i> is doing here. They&#x27;re just facilitating already-legitimate transactions between banks and businesses, without owning or mediating those transactions.)<p>And that fact has nothing to do with any company&#x27;s policies, Stripe&#x27;s or otherwise; that just has to do with what activities are only legal for banks to do. <i>Stripe</i> isn&#x27;t filtering these customers out. They&#x27;re just telling them that they can&#x27;t take do X with service Y Stripe provides, because they&#x27;re not banks, and only banks can legally do X, regardless of <i>how</i>.')
