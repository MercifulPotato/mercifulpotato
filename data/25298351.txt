This is a neat car and all, but pretty much everything from a laptop to an LED Christmas tree or coffee maker goes into the same room and has the same measurements taken.<p>As for &quot;bricking traffic lights?&quot;  They would have to be pretty sensitive to react to this.  Although you can hear weird noises on an AM radio, the gain from emf to audio is around 200 dB.  In other words, you have to try <i>just to hear it</i>...<p>In order for signals that far away to influence the switching circuits of traffic light LED voltage regulators, the current flow would have to be somewhat near a lightning bolt....  (current is prop to magnetic field strength and thus induced current strength that would &quot;brick&quot; or interfere with infrastructure.  Let&#x27;s do some envelope math...<p>~1900 HP  =~ 1900*750Watts.  @720 Volts -&gt; ~~1900 A or 1.9kA\n(This is astonishingly crude.  please bear with me or supply more accurate calcs)<p>Let&#x27;s look up lightning bolts [0]\nSeems their current ranges from 0.1 kA to 200kA.  So I was probably overly skeptical&#x2F;cynical in my initial assessment.  Maybe this car&#x27;s peak horsepower could generate a field as strong as a lightning bolt!  gulp.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypertextbook.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;1997&#x2F;BrookeHaramija.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypertextbook.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;1997&#x2F;BrookeHaramija.shtml</a>')
