I use it a few times per month while working on open-source projects like Reposurgeon and Flex, so I&#x27;m not revealing any trade secrets by uploading those recordings. I&#x27;ve learned that the database built by Pernosco from a large recording can be 100GB and take an hour to generate on a 36-core AWS instance. $4 per debugging session is a pretty reasonable price compared to buying that hardware myself.<p>And they are offering an on-premises solution, running on your own hardware. For a tool this good, the price for that is bound to be large enough to give individuals like us reason to think twice, and then probably a third time. Given the potential time savings, I think that it should be easy for even a small company to justify the purchase.<p>On the gripping hand, this is non-Free software. Some will avoid it primarily for that reason, and I can&#x27;t really fault them for sticking to their principles. I think that it&#x27;s entirely possible that Pernosco, or debuggers like it, could effectively eliminate traditional debuggers like GDB. GDB would still exist and still work, but without the nearly-omniscient viewpoint that Pernosco offers very few will bother to use it. It&#x27;s like looking through a keyhole. I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot over the last few months.')
