Perhaps some could change my life or the world but now they&#x27;re lost to oblivion.<p>Guess what&#x27;s I am doing right now? Googling for a good generator of cool-looking gibberish words which would provide a steady source of meaningless names for my projects.<p>I would rather use UUIDs if they were not so hard to read and memorize.<p>I also love my project names to sound ironical so nobody would take them too serious, expect much and judge too hard. E.g. I actually find &quot;git&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;[1], and &quot;gimp&quot; perfect names (whoever doesn&#x27;t know - try find out what do &quot;git&quot; and &quot;gimp&quot; words mean besides the respective software products).<p>Anything can be renamed (or left as it is) once you grow in confidence the actual project can probably succeed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22303710" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22303710</a>')
