So instead of referring to some data structure by its general concept with immutable data structures we are a lot more specific with respect to the identity represented by the name, here the name represents a version.<p>This is useful because, for example, you stop having the &quot;unmanaged references&quot; you were talking about because now since you are pointing to a version of the data and not the data itself you can be sure of what you are talking about.')
