Item(by='civilized', descendants=None, kids=[25784686], score=None, time=1610643491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775872, text='Just my personal experience, but the people at my company titled &quot;Data Engineers&quot; basically can only be trusted to (very slowly) move data around, while the people titled &quot;Data Scientists&quot; have to do all the cleaning work to make the data suitable for analysis and modeling, in addition to doing that analysis and modeling.<p>Is the point here that data scientists are doing too much of the work that should be handled by data engineers? If so I agree, but there are some org barriers. For one thing, our data engineers are not accountable to any particular project. All we can do is send them tickets to move data around, and it already takes them weeks to move a table from one database to another. I can&#x27;t imagine the headaches if we gave them anything nontrivial to do.')
