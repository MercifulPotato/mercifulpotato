Just looking at wikipedia, 5.25&quot; was introduced in 1976 not clear at what capacity but it fairly early on settled into 360KB. The 3.5&quot; was introduced in 1982 at 720KB with 1.44MB broadly used by late 1980&#x27;s. The Zip drive was introduced in late 1994 with 100MB capacity and was later expanded up to 750MB.
