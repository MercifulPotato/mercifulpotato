So this factor should be controlled or should be investigated by the organization&#x27;s manager, for example, HR staff, psychologists.<p>My last job could be described as “workaholism” but what was really going on was<p>1) my manager had a toxic relationship with their manager and were unfairly overworked<p>2) they passed this attitude on to their subordinates<p>3) the really ugly part: although my manager had high <i>expectations</i>, they were not very good about actual enforcement, so work from “underperforming” (&lt; 45 hr&#x2F;week) teammates was dumped onto “adequate” (&gt; 60 hrs) employees, without any planning or accountability - or, crucially, any flexibility. I had never had a boss who took less responsibility for their worker’s projects.<p>Speaking for myself: I have a serious mental illness and not a lot of economic stability. So although I am a decent programmer (when I am well) I am very susceptible to stress-related illnesses. In November and December I ended up losing about 20% of my body weight, entirely  due to work stress, and had to resign. I really tried my best to get my boss to listen and didn’t have the heart or strength to drag them into HR :(<p>Just an ugly situation when managers don’t take responsibility for the health of their employees. Especially when the issue is their own stress and inexperience versus greed.')
