If you have the level of expertise that comes from real understanding of six different fields attained from five years of good work in them you might literally be the only person with that combination of skills. There are definitely under a 1,000 of you. If you have 30 years of experience but maybe five of real learning then you’re presumably competent but you’re not super special, just competent and known to be competent. After 30 years in the same field you could be one of those people with serious deep expertise. Those people are valuable but the market is thin. You need to make your skills known so work finds you through your network, or you need to become a consultant in spirit if not fact and <i>sell</i>. Loudly trumpet your expertise.')
