If that&#x27;s not a scam, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>But they&#x27;re not. There are 2^32 planets. A planet is the minimum unit of <i>personal</i> identity and is meant to correspond to a &quot;responsible adult human&quot;. Within a planet you can have 96 bits of sub-identity, if you want to have things subordinated to your own identity (e.g. your IOT stuff, your phone, your router, your car, your kids, whatever). No one is buying a 128 bit identity.<p>You can buy planets right now for $10-$20 on opensea. $20 * 2^32 is about 10% of the annual military budget of the United States, not several orders of magnitude larger than the total economic output of the known universe.')
