I&#x27;m not a journalist. If I share something and add context and get perspectives other than my own I performed the work of a journalist. If I do this with some regularity I am a journalist, an amateur journalist but a journalist.<p>One of the key points of journalism is sourcing. You&#x27;ll notice professional journalists, even in the middle of a war zone or natural disaster, will do interviews and try to get a larger context of events. They do this even when they&#x27;re literally in the middle of an event and documented it themselves.<p>Anyone that went through journalism school is taught just because they see a thing it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they know or understand what they saw. Their eye witness account is as unreliable as anyone else&#x27;s so they not only admit to that fact but actively try to get other accounts to find all the common elements and context.')
