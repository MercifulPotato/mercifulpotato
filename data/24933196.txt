A relatively tiny number of these find their way into developer boards. The economies of scale mean they can be very cheap.<p>RISC-V doesn&#x27;t have this ... yet ... but there are several Chinese manufacturers currently making millions of chips for consumer devices with those going through foundries right now. So sooner or later the economics will work out for a &quot;RISC-V Pi&quot;. I&#x27;d be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t exist by 2022.<p>For now this SiFive board is IMHO the best PC-like developer experience for RISC-V. [Disclaimer: Red Hat works with SiFive]')
