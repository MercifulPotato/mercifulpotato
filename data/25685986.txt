They have been our equals in spycraft through the cold war, and due to the current Russian president being ex-KGB it&#x27;s safe to say they are probably very favored in their current administration. Espionage is one of Russia&#x27;s core competencies, it&#x27;s just how it is.<p>(Note I&#x27;m talking about espionage in the information gathering sense, not the overthrowing of regimes action movie sense)')
