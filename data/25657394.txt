But no, European countries can&#x27;t realistically take too many measures, mostly under the threat of economic and political retaliation. No more than Chinese citizens are free to take whatever actions they see fit against their leadership. We&#x27;re <i>all</i> free to take any action we want but it&#x27;s not freedom if we can&#x27;t exercise it out of fear of retaliation.<p>You can see this in action with most EU countries disagreeing with many sanctions imposed on US enemies but eventually caving under pressure from the US. Or when having to switch the frequencies used for the Galileo system to something that could be more easily jammed by the US.<p>The US is exhibiting towards other countries the same kind of tyrannical behavior bent on maintaining power that the Chinese leadership is exercising towards its citizens. It&#x27;s the age old need to maintain power, and the more power, the further you&#x27;re willing to go to maintain it. From a global surveillance exercise where every human is spied on relentlessly, to meddling into most countries internal affairs to the point of changing regimes to suit them, to oppressing their own citizens. These are all publicly and officially documented issues. It&#x27;s all great if and only if your interests align.<p>If you cannot acknowledge this then you are certainly not prepared to have a discussion beyond &quot;we&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re bad&quot;.')
