Hate speech and Holocaust denial are censored in Europe generally, and a majority of people in those countries today <i>do</i> say support these bans (i.e. they say &quot;thank god&quot;). Because they saw the kind of hateful thinking that led to WWII, and how shockingly easy it is for people to be convinced of revisionist history, and don&#x27;t want that to be repeated.<p>Similarly, libel laws function effectively as censorship, but are widely supported. I think most of us are happy that newspapers can&#x27;t maliciously print lies about common citizens.<p>(Edit: love that I&#x27;m being downvoted for this -- apparently people don&#x27;t like these objective facts?)')
