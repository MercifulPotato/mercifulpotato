There&#x27;s such a disconnect between economics education in school and where people end up in reality.<p>Remember folks, supply is only half the picture. Velocity of money matters. They <i>both</i> matter. [1] Supply went up, velocity went down, net 2% inflation. The fed nailed their target. Once velocity goes up printing will slow, or reverse, to maintain the - wait for it - 2% target.<p>2%. Not 25%. I mean are you telling me you paid $4 for a loaf of bread last year and now it&#x27;s 5 - and <i>nobody noticed</i>?<p>Compare the performance of both BTC and other speculative assets, and stocks, in USD. That&#x27;s the only one that matters, because taxes.<p>&gt; Another related one is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fiatmarketcap.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fiatmarketcap.com&#x2F;</a><p>Holy moly is this one off base. <i>This</i> is <i>not</i> how you compare currencies. China has 4X as many people as America does. There&#x27;s local and regional differences in the cost of goods in the area.<p>You can compare currencies in a lot of reasonable ways but this sure ain&#x27;t one of them. A good way is something like the way DXY (the Dollar Index) is calculated - it&#x27;s based on the relative strength of the dollar compared to a basket of other foreign currencies. But this in and of itself is <i>also</i> not a meaningful number in the sense that the relative strength of a currency is a knob - turn it one way, and you favor exports over imports, and the other way, imports over exports.<p>You can also convert to a neutral currency like USD then compare the PPP factor - which shows you how far a neutral dollar goes in one country vs another, and this varies based on market conditions, regional conditions and local conditions. In some island nations, the dollar won&#x27;t go as far as goods are expensive. In Canada, it goes much longer. [2]<p>Currencies. Do. Not. Have. Market. Caps. Equities have market caps. You measure market caps of companies in terms of currencies. Why? Because if you have a $1B market cap in equities and you start selling, you&#x27;ll be left with way less than $1B in hand - selling increases supply. If you sell $1B in currency you get <i>exactly $1B dollars</i>.<p>Comparing money supplies between different countries based on number of units issued, are you serious? It&#x27;s an utterly and totally meaningless number. It means <i>nothing</i>.<p>You&#x27;ve given me a headache. It&#x27;s not often you see stuff just so plain wrong on HN.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;v&#x2F;velocity.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;v&#x2F;velocity.asp</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indexmundi.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;PA.NUS.PPPC.RF&#x2F;rankings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indexmundi.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;PA.NUS.PPPC.RF&#x2F;r...</a>')
