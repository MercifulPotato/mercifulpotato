Item(by='kfinley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605159537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065846, text='&gt; The problem is that you can’t use the 16” with an external display and the lid open without the fans spinning at full speed.<p>I had the same problem, when connected to a USB-C monitor I wanted to use the keyboard, but not the built in monitor. Even with the display backlight off the fan would still run. After a lot of searching I found that you can disable the built in monitor by:<p>- Booting into recovery mode \n- Opening Terminal \n- Entering `sudo nvram boot-args=&quot;niog=1&quot;` \n- Restarting \n- Close the clamshell  \n- Plug in the external monitor \n- Open the monitor<p>I hope that helps.')
