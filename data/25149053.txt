Haven&#x27;t used it since my shift to Linux in 2006, but it used to be the only editor worth talking about for Windows.<p>I was blown when I discovered column mode. I think I learnt to think about editing as an operation through it. It&#x27;s carried forward to my vim usage now as well. I&#x27;ve seen Devs not make maximum use of these features and while I do respect their choices, I have to (embarrassingly) admit, it annoys me. I don&#x27;t show it of course, but whenever a junior comes to me and asks me how I type fast or how I use so many shortcuts I make sure I take the time to teach them.<p>I owe that paradigm largely to Notepad++. Owe the dev a lot.')
