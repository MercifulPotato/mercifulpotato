It is an excellent license when used strategically and I think it&#x27;s dismissed as too extreme too often.</i><p>Unfortunately, the startup&#x2F;business world has largely taken over most forms of open source development, and they&#x27;ve put a lot of pressure to change the default license for new projects from (A&#x2F;L)GPL to ASL. That change enables a lot more exploitation of software projects and open source software developers and it&#x27;s almost embarrassing how often open source projects and commercial open source entities are surprised when it happens.<p>I wish we could live in a world where the default was to contribute with time and&#x2F;or money to support each other, but we don&#x27;t. If we did, I think we wouldn&#x27;t even <i>need</i> share-alike licenses. But we don&#x27;t, so we do.')
