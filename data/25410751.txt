Reduces visual noise—status line usually shows current line number anyway, jumping to a line might take a second and I found I don’t need to know my line numbers more frequently than once per month or so.<p>What I do like to enable in an editor is visible whitespace characters (helps notice levels of indent, for example). In Vim that can be accomplished with:<p><pre><code>    set list listchars+=space:•\n</code></pre>\n(Might take some tweaking to make whitespace appear subtly enough, depending on your color scheme.)')
