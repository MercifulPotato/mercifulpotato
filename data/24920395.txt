Yes. It&#x27;s a complex language, but it is extraordinarily powerful and meant to be used when nothing else will do. It is not a suitable language for novices to write production quality code in. But in the hands of an expert, it can do some amazing things. Rust is nice, but its performance still doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to C++ for many tasks. When you need to build extremely high performance systems that are also very complex (think CAD software, simulation etc.,) C++ is simply unbeatable. Also, once you&#x27;ve mastered C++, you will find Rust fairly easy to learn.')
