It is as simple as that.<p>If USA wants to change the game (they don&#x27;t) they can ban all corporate donations (aka legalized bribing), allow only donations by individuals, and then impose&#x2F;enforce a limit of $10-25-50k per person (or something reasonable). Anyone playing tricks to game that rule get a penalty of x20 the excessive amount donated (e.g. via others). Also put all donations in public record. As simple as that.<p>It makes no sense to me that you (USA) spent $14bn [0] on this election.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;2020-election-spending-to-hit-nearly-14-billion-a-record.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;2020-election-spending-to-hi...</a>')
