Item(by='aerovistae', descendants=None, kids=[25401098, 25397653], score=None, time=1607758442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396245, text='Frightening and disturbing movie. It&#x27;s very dark, very realistic. Unless you&#x27;re very hardened against watching realistic depictions of death it will likely leave you clenching your fists and feeling tense. Similar to Spielberg&#x27;s Munich. It is not a thriller or anything like that, it has none of the fantastical over-the-topness of a fictional story like Se7en-- it&#x27;s a very cold depiction of truth.<p>By the way if you liked this movie, plug for Bong Joon-Ho&#x27;s Memories of Murder, which is terrific (and much less difficult to watch.)')
