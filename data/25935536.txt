I know only Teslaâ€™s can use the Supercharger network at this time. Is this because other EV cars would be damaged by the power of these Superchargers? Are they designed to be charged at such a high rate? I know the V3 pushes 1000 mi&#x2F;hr. A recent v2 I used was pushing in the 300 mi&#x2F;hr range.')
