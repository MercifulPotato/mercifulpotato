I&#x27;m certainly not saying violent acts should be ignored. What I am saying is that it&#x27;s important to prosecute criminals, not members of a radical group. That needs to be a clear message. Law enforcement is targeted at criminals, not groups of people. The radicals will try to paint any government action as unfair oppression, so it&#x27;s important that the reactions do not overreach, or you get the dynamic I described above.')
