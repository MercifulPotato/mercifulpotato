So that would make my going rate be &gt; 800 USD &#x2F; day. This is in a country where 50K &#x2F; year is a decent developer salary.<p>I do not believe you can find pen testers worth their salt who would cost _less_ than a non-distinctive developer. At least not one who will do more than run some automated report over all your endpoints.')
