Clearly, if an employer of 30k people is finding sellers of labor to agree to a lower price in certain areas, then sellers of labor in that area are &quot;worth&quot; that much.  Similarly, the employer of 30k people isn&#x27;t paying people more in certain areas for no reason either.  They must have ran out of options for cheaper labor before they decided to pay more.')
