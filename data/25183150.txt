If not, then you have to be outspoken and vocal in other political issues in other countries like China, Israel, Palestine, India, Iran, Russia, France, UK, etc.<p>One can argue that we can limit our political activism inside US (btw, I&#x27;m not an American). Fair enough. But even if we do that, there are a lot of political issues in US. Let&#x27;s say one employee cares about racism issue, then there is another employee who cares more about environment causes, and finally there is another employee who cares more about censorship. At one point, the resources of the company will be spread too thin to support all of these causes.')
