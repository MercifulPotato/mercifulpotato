Once you get muscle memory for the shortcuts to move between windows and workspaces, resize and toggle fullscreen windows you can start really flying.  The built-in cheatsheet mentioned by the parent poster helps to get there.<p>Bonus: when I&#x27;m sharing my desktop with a work colleague (they all use Macs) I often get asked how I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing so fast.<p>I do sometimes still get a little frustrated when I want to reorder windows in a workspace.  It can be done but feels a bit like solving a Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  It would be nice to be able to do things like:<p>1. Rotate the windows (either direction) that touch all the screen edges and then inherit the window size that the window moves into.<p>2. Be able to flip window sets that touch the side edges, eg swap all the windows on the left with the right.')
