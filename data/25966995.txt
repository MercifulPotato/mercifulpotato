But things like short-interest is a public number and the hedge funds self-admitted to being short these stocks--it&#x27;s not like they went around saying &quot;I got a secret tip that a hedge fund is very short this stock, let&#x27;s buy it&quot;.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t it be obvious that just taking the opposite trade to a hedge fund can&#x27;t be market manipulation, unless taking the same side as a hedge fund would also be market manipulation?')
