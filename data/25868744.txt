Suppose Elastic does lose control of their codebase, and it winds up getting maintained entirely by AWS. Then what&#x27;s to stop AWS from taking their forked Apache2 code closed-source? Bam, no more ElasticSearch. Without professional maintainers, CVEs will pile up and it will gradually become abandonware.<p>Suppose Elastic had used GPL instead. Then Amazon&#x27;s hands are tied to a greater extent, but we still lose out. If AWS is the one maintaining ElasticSearch, then ES will steadily become more and more nichely-suited to being a part of the Amazon cloud and less suited to a self-hosted use case. Users can patch it for their own use-cases, but they&#x27;ll never be able to make it as good as it would have been if there were full-time maintainers supporting them. The commons still become less rich.<p>The dream is that Elastic can keep maintaining ES but ES remains Apache2. Given AWS&#x27;s presence in the market, it seems like that&#x27;s not an especially viable option. For Elastic to keep maintaining ES while switching ES to a more restrictive license which doesn&#x27;t prevent normal use cases but hamstrings AWS is less desirable, but still preferable to Elastic folding, because ES remains a tool which we can all use and patch as needed to power our own services.')
