What&#x27;s to stop a native application from downloading a huge update as soon as you connect to 3&#x2F;4&#x2F;5&#x2F;G? IOS and Android have ways of controlling this and mobile apps are written with this expectation from the ground up. Which is why I expect OSX will continue to converge with IOS&#x2F;IPad OS and provide a more managed environment for apps to run in.')
