While programming languages don&#x27;t have to be purely textual, they primarily are, and this is a big constraint on typical programming language design. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been quantified, but there is certainly a qualitative ceiling to what&#x27;s possible with typical text-based syntax. That&#x27;s why most languages are just permutations of what exists, and there&#x27;s always limits.<p>We have such rich ways to express information and interactivity, and these are nearly completely ignored by the PL community. I see hybrid programming languages and environments, that are part visual and part textual, as the future in the same way that languages like Fortran and Lisp and then text editors and text-based IDEs were once the future.')
