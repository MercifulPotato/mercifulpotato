What if the word were “header” instead, its just another arbitrary keyword at the end of the day.<p>After writing that out, it seems using words instead of symbols is actually more difficult, because of ambiguity (title vs header, which was it again?)<p>Regardless, kudos to author for putting together and releasing something they believe in. I hope they are able to take the criticism constructively and learn from it too :)')
