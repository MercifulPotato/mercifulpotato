Especially if China decided to strike-first with an art-of-war, covert and&#x2F;or subversive type attack on society&#x2F; culture (and not military).<p>I guess my overall point is:<p>I&#x27;m more concerned with lack of parity in the non-traditional and non-military <i>cultural</i> warfare possibilities that a conflict with China might present.<p>Not so-much with overall military capabilities, even as military-tech approaches parity.<p>And that the US will once again find itself &quot;fighting it&#x27;s previous war.&quot;')
