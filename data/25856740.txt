Item(by='GolDDranks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611217845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25845913, text='&gt; Indexing of natural collections is based on cardinality, not ordinality.<p>You are exactly right. But does it make sense? I&#x27;m not sure. &quot;if it only has a 0th element&quot; isn&#x27;t in my mind, a relevant question in the context of cardinality, since the answer is the same if it only has the &quot;1th&quot; or &quot;2th&quot; or &quot;3th&quot; element. (Sorry, picked up the habit of &quot;misusing&quot; &quot;th&quot; from another post in this thread.) The base case of indexing is &quot;the start of the list&quot; whereas the base case of cardinality is &quot;empty collection&quot;. But should you define the concept of indexing by making an equivalence between cardinality and indexing by &quot;cardinality of collection of elements from the start of a list to the current element (inclusive)&quot; is, in my mind, something that doesn&#x27;t _necessarily_ make sense.<p>I admit that it&#x27;s awfully lot about choices and habits, but at least I find &quot;unpacking&quot; the arguments this way interesting and educational.')
