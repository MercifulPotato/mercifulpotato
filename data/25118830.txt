I would like to receive the thing right now. I don&#x27;t think people appreciate just how big it will be.<p>For context: right now, I&#x27;m in Algiers, Algeria, with an ADSL connection of 4Mbps paid around $30&#x2F;month for home usage. Recently down to $15&#x2F;month, but the. 2Mbps for businesses is $77&#x2F;month. Now, I&#x27;ve tried numerous times to upgrade this.<p>Fiber was priced at around $190&#x2F;month for home usage, with many people showing upload is capped at 1Mbps. Yes, that&#x27;s &quot;one megabits, not megabytes, per second&quot;. Even then, I was willing to get it.<p>20Mbps for business is ... $505&#x2F;month. It&#x27;s cheaper for home use at ... $77&#x2F;month recently for 100Mbps, which is a price drop from $190&#x2F;month a month ago... <i>if you can get the company to install FTTH, and if you live somewhere &#x27;with DSLAM&#x27; as they say</i>. They can&#x27;t serve downtown.<p>ADSL and fiber are only available through the state owned company, <i>of course</i>, which also proposes Wimax, and 4G. Other carriers have 4G. Doesn&#x27;t work where it matters. Plus it&#x27;s capped. There were competitors in ADSL and Wimax, they were closed and had trouble with the regulation authority which oversees all.<p>I once needed someone remote to be on video call with a physician. ADSL went down. I sent &quot;airtime&#x2F;4G&quot; credit to 8 numbers belonging to people who were present so they could have &quot;internet&quot; and be able to make the call. These numbers were of the three different carriers. No internet.<p>Starlink will be huge: bypass state monopolies, bypass regulating bodies. People will pay off customs agents to get receivers in if authorities try to restrict their imports, and there will be a black market for that if that happens.')
