Challenging, but doable in developed countries, but still may slow down mass rollout. Not feasible in many developing countries.<p>True but it&#x27;s also a bit more complicated than that. The YouTube channel Wendover Productions has a great video on the subject: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=byW1GExQB84" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=byW1GExQB84</a> (skip to 5:01 for the talk about the cold chain).<p>TL;DW, there are other factors:<p>- Whether the hospital is able to maintain the vaccine at the required temperature (many, especially the smaller ones, don&#x27;t have the equipment)<p>- This is medical technology and unproven options (like buying a random box off Alibaba like someone suggested) are unlikely to be used<p>- Pfizer (vaccine in TFA) has developed a shipment container that uses dry ice and lasts 10 days but it can only be opened twice a day, for less than a minute at a time, so facilities administering vaccines need to be able to accurately predict how many they&#x27;ll administer in a given day<p>- Pfizer&#x27;s box is only built for multiples of a thousand doses and only lasts 10 days so isn&#x27;t well-suited to smaller areas that can&#x27;t administer 1000 vaccines in 10 days')
