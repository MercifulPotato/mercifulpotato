Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=[24900201], score=None, time=1603738737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893344, text='&gt; Can you point me to a claim from the Bidens or law enforcement that the information was hacked?<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any claim from them. I thought the claim of the hack comes from the NY Post article itself where they said the shop owner made a copy of the hard drive.<p>&gt; What are your thoughts on the Trump tax records which were criminally released to the NYT not being censored?<p>You&#x27;re using the word &quot;criminally released&quot; but that is an unproven fact, the times claims that &quot;all of the information The Times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it&quot;. Now I wonder how that can be as well, but at least that&#x27;s the statement.<p>So at least from the perspective of being a small time employee of Twitter that has to work on moderation, I can see them looking at both article and thinking the first one talks about a hard drive being copied by a shop owner and leaked. While the other is nebulous on the origin but claims it was legally obtained.<p>This is obviously all speculation. But that be my thoughts, that I can see how the policy might have applied to one and not the other.<p>I also have to think that it coming from the NY Post must have contributed. I don&#x27;t assume Twitter reviews every tweet manually, and I can see how NY Post is more likely to get flagged than NY Times.')
