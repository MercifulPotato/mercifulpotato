It&#x27;s really unfortunate that in some circles, someone can&#x27;t say or express conservative views without being lumped into the radical right-wing Trump Patriots. Similarly, some can&#x27;t express liberal views without being lumped with radical left-wingers. And as a result of this, de-platforming the right-wing extremist is commented on as &quot;silencing half the country&quot; which just isn&#x27;t true.')
