If several humans, then the road would be changed, just like this. The process seems sound, but maybe the changes that make it more human-friendly make it more machine-hostile.<p>New thinking is needed on how we retrain machines after the change, as it necessitates uniformity - the machine would benefit with fewer variations in cattle grids for example. I reckon a simple change to the road markings for all cattle grids would be enough to make them logically identical - be it paint or signs or some other physical indicator.')
