It&#x27;s just insane the amount of money the government will spend on crap.<p>The field I work in is pretty small and I know a decent amount of the developers that use it.  One project I worked on for the government, I showed up on day one and ran into a few people that had either no desire or no ability to do development work.  And they were in team lead&#x2F;senior roles.<p>Then, come to find out that you can&#x27;t do anything for the project until you have a background check.  And, by anything, I mean anything.  No meetings, e-mails, or anything with an armed guard enforcing it.  So there was an office full of people billing out at $200+ an hour for months doing literally nothing.<p>Then, come to find out that the way they wanted the software couldn&#x27;t do.  Like within an hour of hearing the requirements and what they were building I knew that it (1) wasn&#x27;t possible and (2) the design they chose had fundamental flaws.  Several years of effort and 10s of millions of dollars later they gave up on it.<p>The government is just a big whale to dumb and&#x2F;or lazy to defend itself while a gigantic swarm of consultants&#x2F;vendors are feasting like sharks&#x2F;')
