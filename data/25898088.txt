TRBL matches 12o&#x27;clock, 3o&#x27;clock, 6o&#x27;clock, 9o&#x27;clock. It also matches N E S W going around the circle<p>I agree that I&#x27;m more familiar with left being first but then should it be LRTB or LTRB.  LRTB is common to say. But many APIs take x,y first which would arguably be LT.<p>Basically I think you could justify almost any order')
