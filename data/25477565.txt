You can’t name bands anymore, because explosive popularity is the realm of the individual artist.<p>Even massive individual artists, disappear into relative obscurity when they move into a band format (John Mayer).<p>Kanye, Taylor, Nicki, Lizzo, Justin, Drake, Ariana, Billie, Miley...<p>Even hip-hop, which seems like a distinctly individual genre, used to be ruled by groups. NWA, Wu-Tang, Roots, etc.<p>Our current culture over-values individuals and loves the myth of the one wo&#x2F;man show. Teams are boring. Give us someone to follow.<p>You see this with founders too. Even if the company was created by a team, there must be one figurehead.<p>I guess this is because so much of marketing is aspirational. Most people try to purchase the identity they want. It’s easier to sell an identity with an actual person.')
