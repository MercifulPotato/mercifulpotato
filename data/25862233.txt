On WinNT, user accounts and groups are just abstractions for providing SIDs for your access token -- there are SIDs like NT SYSTEM which don&#x27;t <i>have</i> a correlated user account.<p>The important bit is you can create a process that can&#x27;t accidentally fandango on core and overwrite all the system files. You have to elevate privileges -- even if there&#x27;s no prompt for the user, the application dev still has to intentionally request admin rights to touch sensitive files.<p>All that aside, though, it&#x27;s a lot easier to fake &quot;no user accounts&quot; like Windows did and just have no password, than to <i>genuinely</i> have no privilege separation and try to retrofit it on later. If you&#x27;re trying to market a brand new OS with new APIs that has no compatibility with anything, even in the 90s, I&#x27;d expect some kind of plan for at least <i>optional</i> security. Anything at all!')
