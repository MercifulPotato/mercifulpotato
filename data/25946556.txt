This is why WFH isn&#x27;t going away. Even people who are required to go into the office periodically might find themselves sharing temp space with others who use the same (reduced) space on alternating days.<p>As you can tell from this comment, I love WFH and will never go back....and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll have to. While the poor office dwellers are sitting in their cars, I&#x27;m enjoying a nice morning run.')
