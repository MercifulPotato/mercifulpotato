Probably fairly soon.<p>History is generally a pretty good guide to the future.<p>Will every single person who smashed windows, beat on people with pipes and bats and went looking for Congresscritters to take hostage show up at the inauguration with RPGs to kill as many people as they can?  I don&#x27;t know.<p>I can&#x27;t say for sure, but since they&#x27;ve already shown themselves to be angry, violent and willing to harm&#x2F;kill others, it&#x27;s a pretty good bet that a significant number of those people <i>will</i> attempt violent action against their perceived enemies in the future.<p>Why is that an unreasonable assumption to make?')
