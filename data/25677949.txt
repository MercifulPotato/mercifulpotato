You&#x27;re looking at 1kW electrical maximum. The one on mars lander Cruiosity provides about 100W electrical power nominal.<p>But the main reason is that people are stupid and some would inevitably pull theirs apart and contaminate their surroundings with pretty nasty radioactive material. There&#x27;s no engineering or practical reason why we wouldn&#x27;t have RTGs for a heap of civilian applications, the reason is that people suck.<p>NASA is currently working on a &#x27;micro&#x27; scale fully self contained fission reactor for the next mission to meet the higher power demand of the craft.')
