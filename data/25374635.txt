You will notice that the Senators aren&#x27;t asking the creators of Gab to crack down on crackpot theories on their platform either.</i><p>That&#x27;s an interesting theory. Someone else might argue they are targeting YouTube and Facebook because there are more swing voters on these platforms and because these platforms are far more viral than Gab or Storefront.')
