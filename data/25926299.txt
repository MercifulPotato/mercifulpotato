Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611741823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925455, text='&gt; Statically typed languages create a lot of complexity from being entirely dependent on types being correct in a static sense rather than at runtime.<p>Nonsense. It&#x27;s very easy to use a runtime cast if and when you want to, even in Haskell. You&#x27;re in control of exactly where typechecking doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>In contrast, in a dynamic language with optional typechecking you have basically no guarantees. Even if 99% of your codebase is typechecked, you have no idea what errors might be lurking in the other 1% or how far they might propagate, since a type error can show up essentially arbitrarily far away from its actual cause. It&#x27;s the worst of both worlds - you pay all the costs of a static type system but get hardly any of the benefits.')
