A lot of humans struggle with complicated functional programming code, which is why it is not as popular.<p>I agree, but I wouldn&#x27;t say people struggle with &quot;functional programming code&quot;, they rather struggle with the concept in general. In that sense, functional programming is like higher mathematics: it&#x27;s a great tool to solve many problems in a very efficient way, but it&#x27;s also difficult to learn and everyone of us reaches a level where they can&#x27;t advance anymore at some point. Some sooner and some later.')
