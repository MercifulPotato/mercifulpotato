I have never used a watch with a touch screen function, but I read oppinions of the watches made by fitbit after they aquired pebble, that it was a mix of touch screen and buttons. \nletting this have both technologies while being open source leaves a lot of room for developers I would imagine. But leaning onto what I read about those 3button fitbit watches I hope there will be a future version with 4 buttons.')
