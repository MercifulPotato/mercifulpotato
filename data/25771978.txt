My experience at Sony was about 1:25, but other big dumb companies I have worked for have met and exceeded the 1:40 rule. It is amazing how process generates dead weight and worthless humans and nobody seems to care.<p>At one point I posited that Sony USA were merely a political pawn for Sony Japan.
