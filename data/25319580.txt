The problem is not so much how to share the code, you can still use email or some other centralized federated service to communicate with peers. Hell, you can even use S3 to store your backups and EC2 to run CI. The main issue is owning the platform that hosts your code, issues, and other artifacts. A hybrid system that allows you to host code with peers while integrating with existing infrastructure services would be more robust and an easier sell.')
