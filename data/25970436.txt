Why is this?<p>• Is it a difference of display model? Where&#x2F;when compositing is done? Is X11 really that high-overhead of a protocol, that putting a “compositor in your compositor” like Parallels’ video driver does, can do better?<p>• Is it that macOS GTK apps are relying on macOS as the window manager &#x2F; window decorator (which those apps were never heavily tested for), while “coherence mode” GTK apps are bringing their own DE (GNOME or what-have-you) along with them onto the macOS desktop, which “knows” what to do with those apps much better?<p>• Something else I’m not thinking of?')
