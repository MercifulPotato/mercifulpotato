Heck I didn’t mention it but you could crowdsource the money for all I care... Point is, alternatives exists that are less predatory then shareholders and investors.<p>&gt; No bank is going to loan $100M to a complicated startup<p>(Since we are both just trying to win this argument) Perhaps startups that need $100M to get started, and are unable to crowdsource, loan, or community fund that amount simply should exist. Or at the very least, perhaps it should downscale to a more affordable price, earn some profits and scale up as the profits turn in. I’m not gonna cry for a hypothetical startup that failed because they couldn’t raise $100M before they even began the work.<p>&gt; You can’t have a bootstrapped Google or Airbnb or Square.<p>So what? I see people complain about Google and AirBnB all the time on this very forum. These are massive companies that have shown predatory and monopolistic behavior time and time again. Maybe the business world would be better if we didn’t have any tech giants. And instead, smaller tech companies would have to collaborate on big scale projects.
