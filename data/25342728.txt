Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607411556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339033, text='&gt; After utilities you&#x27;re easily over $4k a month. If you scrimped you could maybe keep your other household costs under $500 a month (realistically you&#x27;re looking at $1k). So you&#x27;re looking at a take-home of $4.5-5k to just stay afloat<p>This is more than accessible to tech workers at public companies. A 150k income is going to be ~7k a month after taxes. Tier one employers pay significantly more than that to new grads, and pretty much everyone reputable in the bay pays more than that to experienced people. So yeah, single income can absolutely afford a home.<p>Obviously someone with student loans can&#x27;t do that as quickly, but otoh a dual income family could put $2M down in cash before they turn 30 given moderate success. (Or another way of looking at this is a moderately successful mid-20s SWE can bank 100k&#x2F;yr after all expenses and retirement savings, without budgeting strictly. That&#x27;s ridiculous)')
