We&#x27;re running an older version of Office (2016?) at work with Windows 7. Thse are supported by MS via the extended support contracts. It will be upgraded shortly. \nBasically I get blue screens, rendering issues, slowness, freezing, crashing, random glitches. I regularly lose emails. The changes to Outlook are abysmal too. When a meeting invite I&#x27;ve accepted is amended (e.g. a &#x27;Starting in 5 minutes email or update&#x27;), the calendar invite is no longer accepted so the reminder doesn&#x27;t pop up. Whomever decided that un-accepted invites shouldn&#x27;t pop up, has caused so much upset, tears and hate.\nI would describe my windows machine as entirely useless. It has got so bad that I use my iPhone to respond to emails and to use the calendar features.\nI&#x27;ve been considering learning some .NET to write a pop up app that is always on top so that when there&#x27;s a meeting it shows up. Has anyone done that? It seems pretty basic.')
