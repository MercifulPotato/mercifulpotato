It&#x27;s still there, and it&#x27;s still the natural way to write the base-level components (divs and spans).<p>But at the next level up, it becomes really clear that &lt;Foo x={1}&#x2F;&gt; is just syntactic sugar for Foo({x:1}), since Foo is just a function.<p>A lot of my code starts life as some chunk of a complicated render that gets refactored into a function. Then that function quickly becomes a React function component.<p>Next clean-sheet project I may try react without JSX. But I still rely heavily on newer ES features, so there may still be a cross-compile stage of the setup. While create-react-app is depressingly heavyweight, it is really fast and new JSX projects go up in a minute.')
