However, as traffic grows and so does your customer base and server locations, it would be nice to use a dedicated DNS provider, as they&#x27;ll already have the infrastructure set up to handle a significant capacity of DNS resolutions quickly, as well as servers around the globe to do so efficiently. In addition to the speed, it&#x27;s usually also less expensive than setting up and maintaining multiple DNS servers of your own around the world.')
