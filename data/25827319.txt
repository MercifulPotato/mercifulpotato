You buy leveled insurance, you have to pay some out of pocket, etc.<p>I moved from the US to Switzerland so maybe I can offer some anecdotes here. You&#x27;re basically right in that it&#x27;s a slightly cheaper version of the US system. However, some things that I didn&#x27;t have to pay for in the US such as calling am ambulance without riding in it or seasonal flu shots do cost money here ($500+ for an ambulance to show up in the middle of a large city...), but I think these small lapses are overshadowed by expensive inpatient treatment being essentially completely covered minus some reasonable deductibles as well as outpatient treatment that is usually partially covered depending on the insurance plan.<p>The positives compared to the US largely revolve around necessary and typically expensive treatment being far more likely to be covered under insurance with relatively low copays and deductibles. The downsides in common with the US are the administrative hassles of dealing with an insurance company and its own billing middlemen (e.g. a COVID test was improperly billed to me which needed to be sorted out), the large monthly premiums for most people (~$250 is typical except for those who qualify for subsidies), and the lack of clarity over what and how much of anything is covered even when the billing is done correctly.<p>Do I call an ambulance? Do I go in to see a doctor? Will I end up with a massive charge? I&#x27;d prefer a single-payer or completely comprehensive system for this last point alone.')
