Since there&#x27;s such a limited pool of buyers, the price is essentially whatever the next buyer is willing to pay for it.<p>Same goes for buildings - If I decide to pay $5MM for a $1MM house, just to park my money in it, I better find some buyer whose willing to pay in the same price-range, or else it&#x27;s gonna be a substantial loss. Driving up prices, and keeping them artificially high, is not sustainable - unless the area happens to see some major influx of people, and the demand starts to grow organically. Bonus points if it&#x27;s a very difficult area to develop in, which limits new buildings &#x2F; real-estate development.<p>But as for the reasons, who knows - could be:<p>- Tax evasion in their native country \n- Ill-gotten gains they want to hide, or money laundering \n- Alternative investments')
