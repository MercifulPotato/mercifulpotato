Your morning meeting will be at 17:00 UTC (for example), but it will still be “morning” in the SV office, and “afternoon”&#x2F;“multiple hours past sunset”&#x2F;“go away I’m asleep” for your offshore team (wherever they may be located). Changing the digits our clocks represent will only simplify those clocks, but it won’t, it can’t, it shouldn’t change business hours to 9-17 UTC everywhere. Because why would half of the world sleep when it’s light outside? Just because Europeans set UTC as a time zone and 23 as the time to go to sleep?')
