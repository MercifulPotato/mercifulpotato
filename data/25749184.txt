The author wants Canada to be like the US, but they are fundamentally different countries with fundamentally different ethos.<p>The motto of the US govt. is “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Contrast that to the Canadian motto of “Peace, order and good government.” The rest flows from this difference in perspectives.<p>As for Montreal being a tech hub?
