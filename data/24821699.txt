It would be equivalent to a point mass if the Earth were a perfect sphere of uniform density, but it isn&#x27;t. In reality it&#x27;s a potato like mass blob that&#x27;s approximated by what geodesists call the &quot;geoid&quot;. So in order of approximations the path of a ball thrown on earth is a parabola -&gt; ellipse -&gt; numerical integration of 6-dof initial conditions and  spherical harmonics approximation of the earth gravity field.')
