The way that it&#x27;s being used as a distant future utopia is like the way promises of Heaven are used in Abrahamic religions to convince people to suffer in the here and now.<p>A lot of people would choose to suffer some now in order to go to some peaceful space colony where they don&#x27;t have to live with any of the consequences for our biosphere. They&#x27;ll just get to go live in a different one. The reality is that if we continue to ignore the very real problems on our planet we won&#x27;t ever see the day that we&#x27;re living on other planets.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that there are real, quantifiable benefits to space exploration. Most people who believe it&#x27;s important don&#x27;t know anything about those benefits, and they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s important because of that. It&#x27;s all about the promise of a &quot;heaven&quot; in the sky in which they won&#x27;t have to struggle anymore.')
