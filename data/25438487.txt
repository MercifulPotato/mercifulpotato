It is precisely designed for an operator abstracting away the details of the machine&#x27;s electrical schematic and every component. It is <i>user focused</i>. GraphQL is like opening up the entire machine, stripping off the panels and working on live circuits.<p>IMO GraphQL is great to quickly develop something. If your front-end is making 18 queries to REST API and you&#x27;re making a case for how awesome GraphQL is, I think perhaps your REST API design needs to be properly thought out. I personally like to start with GraphQL, once everything is ready and I know what I want, write proper API endpoints. They can be REST-ful or REST-less. One API call for one function the front-end needs to perform.<p>If the wiring in the machine changes and need fancy brushless motors are added, the operator doesn&#x27;t need to worry about it. They can always replace the control panel with a new v2 version if they want additional features, but we guarantee that v1 version will continue to function. This is beautiful design.<p>APIs don&#x27;t have to be REST-ful and they should not be some kind of an analog of the backend database schema. API - it is in the name, &quot;Interface&quot;.')
