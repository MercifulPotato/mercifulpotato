Whilst I&#x27;ve observed greater mask compliance, shops, cafes, bars and restaurants have been packed. I&#x27;ve been to bars freely serving alcohol with no need to buy food, just like the old days. Definitely seeing rule breaking.<p>And I&#x27;ve had a friend who wanted to beat the travel restrictions by leaving London before midnight. That&#x27;s rule beating.<p>I see it everywhere.<p>A PSA because it&#x27;s important: I can promise future you would rather remember &quot;dang, do you remember that shit Christmas we had to stay home?&quot; over &quot;dang, do you remember that shit Christmas that someone accidentally gave Mum covid and she died because we REALLY wanted Christmas with the family in the middle of a pandemic&quot;. It really isn&#x27;t worth it. Not right now. Just be patient and wait.')
