I&#x27;ve seen various instances where a macro doesn&#x27;t add much expressiveness over the plain old functional approach.<p>Granted there are many areas where macros are very powerful. Ecto is a perfect example of when macros make sense. Adds a lot of expressiveness to build queries which is worth the cost of macros.<p>Also should note that I love Elixir. We are using it in production to power all of our backend systems :)')
