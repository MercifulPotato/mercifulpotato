I remember when I was starting out I used to watch a lot of Jonathan Schrantz videos out of sheer interest and I ended up picking up quite a lot of ideas and principles all the while having fun. So definitely check out some [1] of his Saint Louis Chess Club lectures! He also has his own YouTube (as well as Twitch) channel [2] where he mostly goofs around and beats not only strong players but also chess engines with incredibly dubious openings.<p>On a different note, in case anyone finds it helpful, here&#x27;s a CLI tool [3] I wrote last week which you can use to build opening repertoires. The intended use case is to 1) download the games of a chess player from a website like openingtree.com, 2) run the tool on the fetched PGN file to generate an opening repertoire, and 3) import the output into a study tool like lichess or chessable.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dxUuueHFfFs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dxUuueHFfFs</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;JonathanSchrantz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;JonathanSchrantz</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zcesur&#x2F;opening-repertoire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zcesur&#x2F;opening-repertoire</a>')
