The subtraction of 1 internally is not necessarily gonna be there once the code gets compiled.<p>Theoretically one can optimize it - though <i>only</i> when one can statically infer the index <i>and</i> the compiler decides to inline the array access function. If you can&#x27;t do that, the best you can hope for is a fast CPU instruction like LEA or something.<p>In theory one could make a lot of things fast, in practice they rarely are, and it&#x27;s always better to avoid problems now than to pray later.')
