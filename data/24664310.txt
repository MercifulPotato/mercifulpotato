I don&#x27;t think it should be a power, but I know way too many people who don&#x27;t have it, and watched a number of them go through a bunch of bad excitement followed by regret.<p>If it&#x27;s not someone including you in a spontaneous social activity at the last minute, just say no. They know that if you have time to think about it you&#x27;d realize it wasn&#x27;t that great, which is exactly why they aren&#x27;t giving you time to think about it. It&#x27;s an attempt to evoke the same feeling of scarcity you experience when your buddy says, &quot;Hey there are only three beers left. Who wants one?&quot; to a room full of people.')
