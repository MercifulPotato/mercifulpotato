In addition all kids activities are in the shared calendar as well. So it is also easy to keep track of play dates, and sports and school activities. I haven’t gone as far as actually including other parents in these calendar items but we do (well did) for friends. Then we also include address details and such. This has saved us discussions on the exact time and place. “I thought it was next week!” or “where will we meet for pizza again?”<p>Recurring items with friends have proven tricky. The things that are regular enough are engrained so do not need a calendar item. Others get skipped or cancelled so very little use there.')
