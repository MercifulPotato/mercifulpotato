They were quite easy to use; not any harder than configuring WiFi is, and <i>much</i> more reliable. Less convenient as far as choosing locations, though.<p>&gt; And installing drivers which then crashed or hung your computer?<p>I&#x27;ve been using PCs since before OS-level printer drivers were a thing and through the whole era where they were, and I&#x27;ve never had problems with printer drivers on PC (well, outside of mismanagement by IT on work computers.)
