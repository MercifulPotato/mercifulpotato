On standard Android installations Google maps activates the maps timeline recording for you and it&#x27;s creepily good at guessing to which shops you&#x27;ve been and by what means, etc. You then get frequent notifications that push and nudge you to review and answer questions about places (wheelchair access, confirm opening hours, business type, inventory, add photos, reviews, etc). The whole ordeal is quite gamified with contributor level and stars earned on your profile badge. It&#x27;s designed to have GMaps&#x27; data as much as possible enriched by users.')
