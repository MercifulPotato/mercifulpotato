You are attacking a straw man. I was simply giving the highest possible upper bound to the expected number of deaths from vaccination.<p><i>&gt; a large portion of the population is still unsure after the phase 3 trials</i><p>Yes, and why is that? Because despite all of our &quot;respected&quot; institutions saying that the vaccine is safe, <i>many people don&#x27;t believe them</i>. Why not? Because they know that those same institutions <i>lied to them</i>, repeatedly--and not just in general, <i>specifically</i> during the whole COVID crisis. So why should people believe those institutions now?<p>In other words, we have a problem <i>with the status quo</i>.<p><i>&gt;  If, on top of that, you had widely reported and exaggerated (&quot;free speech&quot; at work) reports of side effects, the percentage of willing volunteers falls dramatically.</i><p>Who would be reporting and exaggerating the side effects in a way that everyone would hear about? The mainstream media. In other words, the problem you describe is <i>the status quo right now</i>. So the status quo in this respect obviously needs to <i>change</i> since it makes us as a society stupid, unable to even consider courses of action that, in hindsight, would have been obvious and dramatic improvements over what actually happened.')
