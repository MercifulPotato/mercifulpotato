NX is totally fine for the applications it was built for. I appreciate the simple API and the flexibility of using pure Python. There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so popular.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in graph neural networks, so can&#x27;t really say much about the novelty of Node2Vec. But I do think it&#x27;s often misguided to judge scientific work as trivial or incremental in retrospect. Specially in a relatively young field like deep learning, where four years (Node2Vec is from 2016) is a <i>long</i> time.')
