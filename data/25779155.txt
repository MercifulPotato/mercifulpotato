So what are my options since Apple keeps such tight control on everything? Plug in nightly to iTunes or libimobiledevice? Stand up an iTunes server for LAN backups requiring Windows or macOS? What about the 30-40% of nights I’m on the road?<p>I’m all for ditching iCloud for backups but Apple has made it really inconvenient to do automated backups with anything but iCloud. Libimobiledevice is slowly working towards LAN backups so we’re getting there but then I’m still in need of mDNS reflection to make it happen over WAN.<p>I’ve made efforts into tying as much of my data to self-hosted solutions as possible but full device backup on your own hardware is still a gaping hole in the iOS ecosystem.')
