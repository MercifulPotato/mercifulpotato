It seems to have been an employee&#x27;s personal repo containing company code that they accidentally made public.[1]<p>The original URL of the file with credentials in it was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xkozus00&#x2F;mib-importer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Src&#x2F;Lib&#x2F;PurgeApp&#x2F;PurgeApp.exe.config" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xkozus00&#x2F;mib-importer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Src&#x2F;Lib...</a> .[2] That is, the credentials were part of a utility&#x2F;library that was only being referenced by the project, but it was still included in the repo.<p>SolarWinds historically hasn&#x27;t provided a tool to import arbitrary MIB files into their product. Customers seem to submit them to SolarWinds support, and if support agrees, they seem to use internal tooling (presumably the mib-importer) to import them into the official MIB database.[3]<p>Building some sort of official release data could easily require the use of a signing key, and a company that uses &quot;solarwinds123&quot; as their code-publishing password seems likely to use the same key for multiple purposes, but I didn&#x27;t find any conclusive evidence, and it&#x27;s certainly possible the two incidents aren&#x27;t related.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;savebreach.com&#x2F;solarwinds-exposed-ftp-credentials-back-in-2018-says-security-researcher-vinoth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;savebreach.com&#x2F;solarwinds-exposed-ftp-credentials-ba...</a><p>[2] The Wayback machine has a few entries archived, but none of the interesting&#x2F;conclusive information, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;*&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xkozus00&#x2F;mib-importer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;*&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xkozus00&#x2F;mi...</a>*<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.solarwinds.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;success_center&#x2F;NPM&#x2F;content&#x2F;Core-Downloading-the-SolarWinds-MIB-Database-sw3581.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.solarwinds.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;success_center&#x2F;NPM&#x2F;c...</a>')
