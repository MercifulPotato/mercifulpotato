You may pronounce that Statement A is in contradiction to Statement B but it my be only true in some sense and the whole thing collapses because you made a hidden implicit assumption that turns out to ruin the whole nice house of cards.<p>Its easy to come up with those logical games, see proofs of God&#x27;s existence.<p>If you can make those statements precise enough you get mathematics. If you cannot, you&#x27;re better off doing empirical work and leaving the possibility open that you&#x27;re wrong in some fundamental way. You my proclaim that either A or B is true and in 20 years it turns out that &quot;hmm, things don&#x27;t really work like that, neither A nor B is really true or it depends on how we look at it but generally this just wasn&#x27;t a productive way to approach the issue in hindsight&quot;.<p>Its a bit like presenting a measurement result with too many decimal places, giving the impression of high precision when it&#x27;s unwarranted. In the same way the principled structure of philosophical musings makes them look more definite than they actually are.')
