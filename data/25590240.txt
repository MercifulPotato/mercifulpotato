It was called &quot;btcnow&quot; and it launched in maybe June or July of 2011. I pretty much glued a google checkout widget to a Bitcoin dispenser, but people loved it. You could use your normal google account to buy coins, and three seconds later they were in your wallet. I was selling maybe a hundred or so bitcoins a day for a couple years, but the insane levels of fraud ensured that it was never profitable. It didn&#x27;t really matter, the goal was always to make it as easy as possible for people to get started playing with Bitcoins.<p>Eventually BitInstant came around they actually had people that were paid to deal with this stuff, so they did pretty well. Then the dude that ran it went to jail, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the fact that I got out when I did. Coinbase came around shortly after and they did a much better job than I ever could.<p>It was never more than a hobby project, and I would twiddle with the website, buy coins to restock the dispenser, answer support emails all on the train to and from my day job every day. Good times.')
