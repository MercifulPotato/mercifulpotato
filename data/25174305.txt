IMAP is a big complex but also widespread protocol that is well-known, supported by any email client and has server library available for Go. Some of IMAP disadvantages come from incomplete client implementations, not protocol flaws, as JMAP developers want to convince you. I do not expect wide JMAP adoption in next several years, therefore the decision was made to prioritize improving IMAP implementation.<p>&gt; If somebody insists on having JMAP, I recommend looking at Cyrus email server, perhaps write a Go library for its SASL delegation protocol so it could be used with maddy just as easy as Dovecot.')
