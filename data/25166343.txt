Nobody sets out to design something deliberately unreadable. It usually means that it conforms to the author&#x27;s personal flavours and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that but the implied &quot;everything else is unreadable&quot; subtweet doesn&#x27;t really help anything. Case in point:<p><pre><code>    each planets() (planet){\n        println(&quot;Hello &quot; + planet + &quot;!&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI bet that the double () () here leads to some pretty unreadable code outside of this happy path. But that&#x27;s just my opinion, not some objective truth')
