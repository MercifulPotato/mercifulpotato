When you&#x27;re accused of a crime in a society, we don&#x27;t just tell you to read abstract law.  We tell you exactly what you&#x27;ve been accused of, such that you can defend yourself appropriately.  There is this basic principle in English law that states:<p>- It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.<p>What&#x27;s been happening with many of these companies is that many guilty actually do escape, whilst many innocent actually still do suffer.')
