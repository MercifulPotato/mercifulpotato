However, I might consider a rendition of &quot;Canzonetta Sull&#x27;Aria&quot; by Britney Spears and Madonna to be &#x27;incorrect&#x27;, and this has less to do with their image than with their voices.<p>By all means, one should sing old songs, and for many purposes remember Chesterton&#x27;s dictum that &#x27;anything worth doing is worth doing badly&#x27;. But if one is going to market an album of X sings Y, it is well if X actually can sing Y close to tune.')
