Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605406201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096877, text='Probably around a decade ago I was diagnosed with a slew of things and put on, among other drugs, SSRI&#x27;s. I never felt depressed at time. Interestingly, I felt angry, powerless, etc. but not depressed. The drugs really didn&#x27;t feel like they had any effect on my mental state or behavior.<p>Then maybe around 2017-2018, after living mostly in isolation (outside routine requirements like work, etc.), things started to go downhill. I spiraled into a period of what I&#x27;m sure is depression. Since, then? I might be able to crawl out of it every now and then (around mid-late 2019-2020 I had some sort of strong resolve come over me that lasted a few months) but ultimately just return a depressed, monotonous and sedentary state. I&#x27;m generally good enough and keeping together in public, but in my private life it&#x27;s on full display display. The pandemic did good work to undo everything I had tried to fight it, but the isolation isn&#x27;t anything new and I&#x27;d likely have returned to it in my own eventually.')
