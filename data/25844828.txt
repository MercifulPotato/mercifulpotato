As I look at my screen now I am vertically constrained by the tabs, the Url bar, the bookmarks bar and the status bar and task bar and all I want to do is go down vertically to read more from the comments and articles, I have to scroll to utilise that vertical space. Conversely horizontally I have a large areaa of grey and white space wasting around 50% of the screen with literally nothing in them.<p>I don&#x27;t want the text wider but boy do most websites do a terrible job of utilising the space I actually have. Reality is reading on 16:9 is horrible, it is too wide, text is better on 9:16. Very wide paragraphs are hard to follow. For work purposes I would probably be better off turning the screens and you see that a bunch in offices.<p>16:9 however is substantially better for gaming and movies than 4:3 ever was. The super ultra wides are amazing for gaming as horizontal space is the most immersion impacting.')
