Timestream is another case of AMS trying to make something for the sake of having it (see here Kinesis instead of just doing Kafka and many other products) instead of just adopting something industry standard. That isn&#x27;t to say they don&#x27;t do some good stuff just they also ship a lot of crap, very much 2 tiers of products in the AWS catalog.<p>I would eventually like to see comparison for a more analysis heavy workload vs Druid though.<p>Simple metrics workloads like what Timestream and Influx do aren&#x27;t really of interest when comparing to Timescale ability to do JOINs and use other SQL and PostgreSQL specific functionality.')
