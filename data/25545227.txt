More than the material change, I didn&#x27;t expect it would improve my life so much -- saving money, time, increasing connection to family and control over my career, plus being invited to communities like food deserts who can benefit most from such transitions. I would bet most Americans could reduce about 70 or 80 percent with simple improvements they wish they did earlier. Most Silicon Valley types maybe 90 percent before any difficult decisions.<p>My podcast and nonprofit&#x27;s missions are to help people realize they&#x27;ll like the change. Everyone presents sustainability as a burden, chore, or sacrifice. In practice, it&#x27;s the opposite, but no one tries so haven&#x27;t experienced it. They think not flying means not working or seeing their family.<p>We&#x27;re creating systemic change by leading well-known people to change, publicly so listeners have role models. Community influences people more than facts and figures, so we&#x27;re focusing on people in everyone&#x27;s communities.<p>Many opportunities for rewarding change.')
