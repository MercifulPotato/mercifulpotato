Its not a sharp edge and its a very mature beta, but there&#x27;s a sort of agreement you sign your name to when you buy a Mac.<p>Complaints that you commonly see about Apple products are, I find, similar to reading complaints when you&#x27;re apartment shopping: those who complain have reason to do so, and those with good experiences don&#x27;t necessarily feel the need to write about them.<p>For instance: those who experienced botched Catalina upgrades that caused Mail.app issues? I never experienced that, and I&#x27;ve two significantly sized accounts attached. In fact I upgraded my last machine from High Sierra to Catalina with no issues at all. The &quot;beta&quot; parts of macOS that people call out are just never things I&#x27;ve fought against - and I run a fairly custom-ish setup to boot.<p>On that same note, I could throw a rock and find a KDE user who complains about KMail having issues... but you won&#x27;t find many KMail users saying &quot;yeah it just works and life is great&quot;.<p>Software is complex. I wouldn&#x27;t call macOS &quot;beta&quot; and by the same token I&#x27;m not going to label other OS&#x2F;DE combos that either.<p>(They also fixed the keyboard, so I&#x27;m over that complaint. Would I prefer the ThinkPad keyboard? Absolutely. But the new one works fine and fits the design aesthetic of the device.)<p>tl;dr: The only &quot;agreement&quot; I find myself signing is that the thing looks and feels, and functions, like a premium product. I find myself endlessly frustrated that if I go car shopping for a premium item, I have different options... yet I just don&#x27;t feel like I have this with computers.<p>&gt; No one is going to win here because no one else can have Apple&#x27;s market. The incentives to win on the PC side are just too different.<p>This is exactly why I&#x27;m saying that my ideal product wouldn&#x27;t compete with the PC market. I fully recognize that&#x27;s a losing battle.')
