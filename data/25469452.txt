I ended up using ORY [0] at my startup as we had slightly different auth needs, but FusionAuth was a top contender.<p>It&#x27;s strange to me that Auth0 has so much market dominance. Are they a case of VCs subsidizing a subpar product, combined with aggressive (and bordering on false) marketing, or do they really have some unique product? Their pricing seems ridiculous to me; I can&#x27;t imagine someone doing an analysis between Auth0 and alternatives, and choosing Auth0.<p>But seeing Atlassian switch to them made me think I may be missing something... It would be interesting to hear your analysis of why Auth0 is so prevalent!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ory.sh&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ory.sh&#x2F;</a>')
