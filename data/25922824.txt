More than once I&#x27;ve unloaded a pallet a box at a time from the back of the trailer while the driver was pissed he had to tip the boxes over onto my shoulder. If you ever have to hire an excavator for other reasons, it isn&#x27;t a bad idea to have an outdoor &quot;hump dock&quot; built... the other option is a forklift!')
