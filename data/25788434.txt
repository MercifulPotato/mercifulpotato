In my opinion, neural networks are used in the wrong way when it comes to natural language processing such that they make the whole understanding process too opaque. Instead, I&#x27;m trying to consider the NLU pipeline as a graph problem for which I can use any model to speed up the search but where it can work without it as well.<p>It&#x27;s a long shot and a big topic, but I&#x27;ve managed to enjoy it along the way so far by coding different NLP algorithms (CYK parser, dependency parsers, tokenizer, etc.) and trying to publish some of the code (C#) I made as NuGet libraries for others to use.')
