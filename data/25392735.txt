The root of the matter is I don&#x27;t, personally, trust the people doing the selling.<p>It varies by region but where I&#x27;m from, back in April-ish, we were sold: &quot;just two weeks of lockdowns and the virus will die out! everything will be back to normal!&quot;. So we did. Businesses shut down, transit basically stopped running, our downtown core was a wasteland. Everyone parroted &quot;stay safe, stay home&quot; back and forth at each other and sat at home for a few weeks. It sucked, everyone had a bad time, lots of busineses had to go out of business, but we all were told it was for the greater good and it&#x27;ll be worth it. And... it didn&#x27;t do shit.<p>Now here we are again. Odds on, in a few months, it&#x27;ll be either &quot;turns out this vaccine doesn&#x27;t protect you as well as we thought&quot;, or &quot;turns out it only protects you for six months&quot;, or &quot;turns out the virus mutated so the vaccine isn&#x27;t effective at all anymore&quot;? In exchange for, what, testing not only a new vaccine, but a whole new method of vaccination on yourself? Whether that&#x27;s worth it to you or not is a personal choice, but &quot;it will literally save lives and end [the disease]&quot; is firmly TBD.')
