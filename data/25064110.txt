Only a server can analyze 10,000+ pictures, identify faces, organize by date. All in a slick and fast UI.<p>How big is your photo library? I have about 100GB and that’s all worked perfectly well on iOS&#x2F;macOS for many years - even on the old 2010 MacBook Air I used until it stopped getting security updates.<p>You can see a difference in quality but it’s a judgement call: Google Photos definitely indexes more things in pictures but it also has a much higher false positive rate - for example, it took until 2018-19 before searching for “cat” didn’t have two pages of results for my dog before any actual cats.')
