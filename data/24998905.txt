In early 2013 Intel stated Broadwell 14nm would be out that year. It didn&#x27;t come out until Q4 2014. And Intel&#x27;s Fab 42, which was originally scheduled to open in 2013 as their first 14nm fab, only just opened this year. Intel ended up needing to re-fit existing fabs to be 14nm instead.<p>So before they faceplanted with 10nm Intel first stumbled with 14nm. 2 generations in a row of issues.')
