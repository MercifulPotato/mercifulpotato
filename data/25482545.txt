There are other reasons to run your own instance, but honestly I think most of them come down to the hacker novelty factor. One noteworthy one is having total control over your own data, I guess. Depending on the provider it&#x27;s not always simple to export all of your data to migrate somewhere else if you ever want to.<p>For folks who would use nextcloud if they didn&#x27;t have to care about all this server admin stuff I would definitely recommend Hetzner. Cloudamo [1] is also a good option with servers in North America, for people there who care about location.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudamo.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;nextcloud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudamo.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;nextcloud</a>')
