Do you need some special instructions like add+multiply, or some bit permutation? You can add some.<p>There&#x27;s no need to reconfigure it very fast, or per VM; not having to reboot the hypervisor OS would be enough. But it e.g. would allow to change the type of instances a particular server can offer, adjust to demand, and so overprovision less.')
