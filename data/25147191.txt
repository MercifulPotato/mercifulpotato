Even if it&#x27;s more commonly allowed, I suspect that there is a measurable reduction in productivity for &quot;work from home.&quot; That would tend to offset the COL differential, so that salaries wouldn&#x27;t equalize completely across the country. It still may pull salaries down in the high COL areas though, due to increased competition from the labor expanded market.<p>One possible interesting side-effect: it may result in &#x27;democratizing&#x27; tech to some extent, if enough seed populations of engineers remain in the lower-COL areas and continue to work remotely.')
