At which point you have to ask: <i>who</i> is journald for? In the server environment, you&#x27;re going to send everything to Splunk or whatever.<p>Which just leaves desktop users to deal with the headache that is journald. Desktop&#x2F;workstation users don&#x27;t care about tamper detection, corruption, or any of that nonsense. If there is corruption going on, I doubt they care that their boot logs are invalid. I&#x27;m 100% sure they care more that their 3D render that took 30 hours to render is now corrupt, or some other asset or document.<p>And in the rare case they <i>do</i> need to dive into the logs, they aren&#x27;t going to want to re-learn journalctl again.<p>journald is a solution to a 1990s problem that no longer exists.')
