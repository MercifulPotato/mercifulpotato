None of them are really willing to pay much for 3rd party code and they need $$$$$$$$$$$$$ of support because they are new.<p>For example make a JSON serialization library and you&#x27;ll be asked &quot;how do I spawn enemies from JSON&quot; which is arguably entirely orthogonal to your library but don&#x27;t answer and get downvoted for bad support. Do answer and you&#x27;ll just be asked more questions about how to adapt your example to their personal project and you&#x27;ll have to teach them programming in the process.<p>These incentives make it almost impossible to make money selling 3rd party code (plugins&#x2F;add-ons). If you charge what it should really cost given the amount of work put in the market won&#x27;t bare it. If you charge what the market will bare you&#x27;ll go broke.<p>Maybe Unity should split the market into &quot;Pro&quot; and &quot;Hobbyist&quot; and the Pro market would have prices more inline with what it actually costs. Check out the prices of libraries like Radgametools.com (you&#x27;ll have to google the prices) for comparison.')
