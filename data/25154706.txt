[1]<p>If that&#x27;s not setting off bullshit alarm bells in your head, I don&#x27;t think anything will. No, it&#x27;s not reasonable to believe that Russia is responsible for someone leaving their private property at a repair shop. But people eat that garbage up because they like to hear it. So much so that it even was seriously mentioned in one of the debates. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it makes no sense.<p>Republicans have not-so-fringe QAnon and Dominiongate weirdos. They&#x27;re insane. Democrats have not-so-fringe Russia conspiracy theorists. They&#x27;re dumb.<p>The only way to narrow the whole spectrum of misinformation is to call things fairly when we see them. Nothing is ever going to get solved unless people are able to critique the fringe of their own side as strongly as they critique the fringe of the other side.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;hunter-biden-story-...</a>')
