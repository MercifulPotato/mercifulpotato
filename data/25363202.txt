For example, the Cal State system (largest public university system in the world) is pretty darn affordable if you&#x27;re paying in-state tuition and commuting from home. Cal State San Bernardino doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of fluff. Just a bare-bones commuter school that gets the job done. Excellent value.<p>The UCs go up in price, but they&#x27;re also literally world-class research institutions.<p>Let&#x27;s focus on funneling more people through a community college&#x2F;Cal State type system where they&#x27;re graduating with a reasonable education that helps contribute to a well-educated and intelligent society, while not saddling people with monumental amounts of debt. And if they choose to continue their education and become specialists, they can go to grad school at a larger research university. I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s what the CC&#x2F;Cal State&#x2F;UC system was originally intended to be. We&#x27;ve just sort of strayed from that path.')
