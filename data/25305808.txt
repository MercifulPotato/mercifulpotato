Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607106137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303780, text='&gt; Is this explicitly different that animals that are trained to help with say PTSD?<p>Yes. As you say those are service animals, meaning they are trained to actively help e.g. a service animal could be trained to detect acute distress and actively insert themselves into the situation. An ESA is just support.<p>&gt; I also mentioned in another comment below that my general interaction with ESAs is people using it as a loophole to take their pets places and causing issues for people with service animals.<p>I completely agree that this is a huge issue. Although people will also misrepresent service animals as most states have no sanctions about that (it&#x27;s rarer because there are usually expectations about service animals, and the available &quot;range&quot; is extremely limited e.g. a cat or a cockatoo can not be a service animal).')
