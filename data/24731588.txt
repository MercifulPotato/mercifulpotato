My company is currently filing for my Green Card and we&#x27;re at Step 1 (Prevailing Wage Determination) of the process. Considering the rule change announced by administration yesterday, I&#x27;m not sure if my base salary will satisfy higher percentile requirement for my level.<p>My Question is :<p>1) Do these changes apply for PERM filings?<p>2) If base salary doesn&#x27;t meet requirement, can PERM filing happen at different level even though H1B was approved at higher level (ex : level 3 approval on H1B, level 2 filing for PERM)')
