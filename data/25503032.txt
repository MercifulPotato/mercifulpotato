I offered &quot;Lights&quot; as a design requirement unique to vehicles with respect to phones. Without any explanation it leaves the door open to a surface level counter point &quot;Phones also have lights&quot; that requires a functioning brain and the most basic level of reasoning. Lights on modern vehicles (high beams, low beams, DRLs, blinkers, brake lights) are certainly not simple components, especially those on vehicles sold in the EU where the regulatory body has taken up new technology much faster than in the US. This wasn&#x27;t a dumb point, cell phone lighting requirements are child&#x27;s play compared with the requirements of a vehicle lighting. It is 100% valid, but was also placed as bait as explained above. Make sense?')
