Notice how that&#x27;s also allowed in the human domain (shooting a human who is threatening your life).<p>I think for anyone who feels like the trade off between getting good nutrition and hurting animals in the process is acceptable, must learn what the current treatment of animals is, and not turn a blind eye, thinking it&#x27;s &quot;decent enough&quot; for the tradeoff to work.<p>I strongly recommend everyone watch <i>Earthlings</i>.<p>The moral discussion you are trying to have at some point becomes uninteresting to me. It begins to sound akin to &quot;what if, hypothetically, slaves enjoyed being enslaved?&quot;. It&#x27;s not a bad question to ponder, it really probes deep at some of our hidden assumptions, and we can learn something about morality while thinking about it. But I&#x27;m currently more interested in the <i>absolute moral catastrophe</i> that is happening now: billions of animals are being tortured every day, and so many people are unwilling to decrease the amount of money they give to the corporations that do the abuse.')
