See below.<p><i>&gt; We already know that energy isn&#x27;t conserved at those scales.</i><p>This suggests that what you mean by &quot;light loses energy over cosmological distances&quot; is that the universe is expanding while the light travels, and in an expanding universe, total energy is not conserved. That is true, and that <i>is</i> the redshift due to the universe expanding--it&#x27;s not something different.<p>If, however, you are working from the hypothesis that the universe is <i>not</i> expanding, then energy <i>is</i> conserved even over cosmological distances, so I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by invoking &quot;energy isn&#x27;t conserved&quot; as an explanation for the redshift.<p>If you&#x27;re referring to the &quot;tired light&quot; hypothesis, that&#x27;s been known to be unviable for decades.')
