And by that, I mean a solution that a team can reasonably use across Linux, Windows, and Mac. The simple reality is that, there is Docker and absolutely nothing else that comes close to working everywhere. Yes, it&#x27;s not perfect but everything else is far less perfect. Static binaries are far too limited; most software requires lots of files spread all around the file system.<p>I did a project last year at a company that had dockerized their build, CI, and CD infrastructure. They had dozens of git projects with make files that triggered actions using docker. It was great. No need to install anything complicated; just works everywhere with just a minimum of scripts installed from a single internal repository. They did some nice hacks to work around some of the things mentioned in the article. Including using virtual box on macs to work around the filesystem limitations. This really becomes a show stopper for large complicated builds that are very io intensive.')
