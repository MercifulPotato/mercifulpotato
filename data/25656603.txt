I do not like the idea of using a turing complete language to define your builds. Every Gradle project I worked on eventually devolved into build code insanity.<p>Give me any maven project and I can figure out how to build it and modify dependencies and stuff within minutes.<p>With Gradle, it can be an hour of messing with code if the project maintainers got creative.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a project that maven, with it&#x27;s mostly fixed build setup, couldn&#x27;t handle. Having a turing complete build script is like turing complete cooking recipes. Pointless and definitely going to create more problems than it solves')
