Imagine if you had the fingerprints and the algorithm.  This can&#x27;t possibly be a cryptographic hash (too fragile); it&#x27;s got to be possible to find &quot;collisions&quot; that have no relationship to the original image, and probably don&#x27;t even look like images of anything at all.<p>Imagine the chaos someone could cause.<p>It&#x27;d be like back in 2010ish when somebody encoded a bunch of malware into bitcoin transactions: every bitcoin node running any kind of antivirus software was immediately kicked offline.  Many AV programs deleted their owners&#x27; copy of bitcoind.  It was madness.  Forced the bitcoin developers to store the blockchain on-disk xored with a different random number unique to each computer.')
