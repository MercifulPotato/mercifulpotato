A knight is basically a medieval super-soldier: an individual with a huge amount of ongoing personal+state investment going into their ability to project power on the field.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t really correct. Most knights didn&#x27;t have a huge incomes (if they did they would become Lords).<p>A Knight wasn&#x27;t a military position - it was primarily a class and status designation, which came with some military obligations. These could be met by supplying another person to your lord to do the fighting for you.<p>Often a Knight would supply their lord with their younger son for example, since their older son would be the heir.<p>To become a knight in the medieval times in the UK you needed an income of 40 pounds a year[1] which converts to around 30,000 pounds&#x2F;year these days.[2]<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t there be mass resentment within a lazy knight&#x27;s power structure, that would lead to said power structure toppling or mutiny-ing?<p>Yes, indeed peasant revolts were a thing. And a lot of most knights &quot;fighting&quot; involved hunting down rebellious peasants armed with sticks.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Were-Medieval-English-knights-wealthy-How-rich-were-they-compared-to-other-ranks-of-nobility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Were-Medieval-English-knights-wealthy-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&#x2F;currency-converter&#x2F;#currency-result" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&#x2F;currency-converter&#x2F;#curr...</a>')
