Also, depending on the size of the company, the recruiter may have a good idea of who this is coming from.<p>A couple of suggestions:\n1. Send these sorts of messages to the recruiter&#x27;s boss&#x2F;head of recruiting&#x2F;head of HR. If the recruiter is ghosting out of laziness when they should not be, then making management aware of it will solve the problem. If the recruiter&#x27;s told to do this by management, then management at least becomes aware that this policy is aggravating people.<p>2. Public shaming - make this a site where people can publicly name recruiters&#x2F;companies who engage in this behavior. If companies see themselves incurring reputational damage from ghosting, it&#x27;ll stop.')
