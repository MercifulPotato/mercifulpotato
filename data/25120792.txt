This isn&#x27;t just any random feature Google disabled, it&#x27;s security-related behavior that is discouraged to rely upon by MySQL themselves. This is a big caveat, and is something that I would never recommend anyone to do, especially not when you&#x27;re planning on outsourcing the management + maintenance of your database.')
