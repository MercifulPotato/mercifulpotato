Just your &quot;best estimate&quot;? It&#x27;s dismissive of Apple&#x27;s uarch for what reason?<p>Arm has architecture licenses, unlike x86: anyone could&#x27;ve designed an Arm CPU from the ground up. NVIDIA tried, AMD tried, Intel tried, Qualcomm tried, Samsung tried, Huawei tried, etc. Everyone had a chance (and they still do). Arm is the most level playing field available in high-perf CPU design.<p>And &quot;50% process technology&quot; is an exaggeration even embarrassing for HN. The A13 was built on 7nm and still beat perf&#x2F;watt of any x86 CPU and total 1T performance rivals Tiger Lake. A14 &#x2F; M1 are a natural evolution of that same uarch.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;perf-trajectory.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;perf-trajectory.png</a><p>What really breaks down your argument: Samsung has had nearly every advantage as Apple, yet its Exynos line is some of the worst-perf&#x2F;watt Arm uarch today: its own OS (Tizen), its own foundry, its own phones &#x2F; tablets &#x2F; laptops, and a massive conglomerate for funding. What happen to Samsung? What money doesn&#x27;t Samsung have? Hell, Samsung is even MORE integrated than Apple, as Apple still needs to outsource its fabrication to TSMC.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Samsung is giving up on its uarch and moving to Arm stock cores (X-1, A78, A78C, etc.), just like Qualcomm + NVIDIA.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.samsung.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2018-results" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.samsung.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;samsung-electronics-announce...</a><p>Don&#x27;t tell me &quot;you need trillion dollar valuation to make a top-class CPU&quot;. AMD was nearly bankrupt 6 years ago and now has the fastest general compute x86 arch in the world.<p>This argument reeks of &quot;well, if Apple has the fastest CPU uarch today, then I&#x27;m going to ensure everyone else has an excuse.&quot;<p>Apple didn&#x27;t even have an Arm architectural license, much less a custom high-perf CPU, 13 years ago. 13 years from &quot;never designed a high-perf CPU&quot; to &quot;dominating x86 perf &#x2F; watt while at the heels of total perf&quot; is actually notable and actually impressive.')
