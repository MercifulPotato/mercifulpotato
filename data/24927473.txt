Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[24927590], score=None, time=1603948313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927284, text='&gt;Where I think this falls short is that, when spinning up a new project, you&#x27;d start with a blank page, so people _don&#x27;t_ have the opportunity to determine whether they disagree with your moderation style until enough bad things have actually happened. Why not carry over your learnings from previous projects?<p>If every single project on GitHub right now removed its CoC, how much would really change over the next month or two? The vast majority of people know what&#x27;s generally acceptable or unacceptable, and the vast majority of open source project owners share that sensibility. There may be a rare case of a project owner who thinks saying &quot;hi, it might be better to do [X]&quot; is offensive, or a contributor who thinks it&#x27;s okay to say &quot;this code is fucking terrible, you&#x27;re a moron&quot;, but unless you&#x27;re dealing with Linus Torvalds or someone else really unusual, it&#x27;s almost never a concern.<p>When contributing to a project with such a blank page, you run the risk of encountering that odd project owner who seems to diverge from almost everyone else in the community, but I think the risk is so low and the impact so minor that it&#x27;s not worth worrying about it much. And if it&#x27;s truly a concern for some reason, you can just click on the owners&#x27; other projects or Google their names&#x2F;monikers to see if anything concerning comes up.<p>I definitely think project owners should moderate shitty behavior, and I think for other sorts of communities (like message boards) there might be stronger requirements for somewhat more explicit rules, and if a particular project for some reason has had more than one instance of behavior the owner finds unacceptable but contributors don&#x27;t then it makes sense to explicitly clarify some things, but in general I don&#x27;t really understand all of the bureaucracy surrounding this.')
