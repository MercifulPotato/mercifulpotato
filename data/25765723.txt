I don&#x27;t think any open source desktop is special in this regard, the same rules apply. I am not sure what you&#x27;re trying to point out by saying that some developers work for Red Hat, the same rules apply to them. If they want features implemented, they write the code and they submit it upstream. What else should happen here? Should they just stop submitting patches and let upstream stagnate?')
