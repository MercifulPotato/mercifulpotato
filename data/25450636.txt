And I&#x27;d further argue that playing &#x27;one opening&#x27; when you only know 2 or 3 moves is not really playing any opening, so it doesn&#x27;t matter (much).  I&#x27;d also say, learning the main opening principles: develop your pieces, don&#x27;t move a developed piece a second time (with a few exceptions), castle as soon as possible, is probably more important than any particular opening repertoire.')
