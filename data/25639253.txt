We are reinventing build engineering with an on-demand SaaS Platform and CLI tool that lets developers automate the building of any runtime environment using any open source language ecosystem on any platform. Right now we support Python and Perl and we&#x27;re hiring to add more languages and packages! Weâ€™re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to build it.<p>The Build Engineer positions are coding positions where you work on tools that do distributed builds. We&#x27;re also looking for an Elm Developer.<p>I&#x27;m a Team Lead here at ActiveState, though none of the open positions are on my team right now. Please email me at autarch@urth.org if you have any questions.')
