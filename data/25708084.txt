I remember when I was installing the repo, my manager told me to use the Lenna image, and I asked him what it was, and he said &quot;don&#x27;t google it on a work computer!&quot;.<p>He explained to me the origins, and actually gave me the image file from a flash drive, just to minimize the likelihood of me getting in trouble. While obviously the normal Lenna image itself is fairly innocuous, he was afraid that porn might come up if I were to look up anything in Google images, which probably would not look great on an intern&#x27;s computer.<p>In hindsight, maybe it&#x27;s best to not use images that could risk getting anyone in trouble, not to mention that it probably breeds a &quot;boy&#x27;s club&quot; atmosphere.')
