They might have great designs but they haven&#x27;t matured their processes.  They haven&#x27;t spent years fine tuning their QA processes so these things slip through.  One off type stuff like this and designs that are generally less manufacturing optimized designs coming from them are not surprising.<p>I don&#x27;t see why all the fanboys get their panties in a knot when people point this out.  To everyone who actually knows anything about cars or manufacturing it&#x27;s kind of a nothing-burger that everyone expects will slowly go away with time.')
