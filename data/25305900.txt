Instead of relying on her research work and data, she routinely try to shut down the opposite side&#x27;s &quot;matter of fact&quot; statements.<p>In contrast, the proclaimed &quot;bad&quot; guy, Jeff Dean, never do that. I know a co-worker who is level 4 engineer, reviewing Jeff&#x27;s code changes, with Jeff never show a slight hint of his status. At the moment Jeff is level 11 engineer.<p>If Timinit could be that patient, then given enough time, she will make impact equal or beyond Jeff as in pure engineering. Instead, she tried to let loose her emotions.<p>Her continue staying at Google and the ethical AI research community would become a long term risk and overall negative factor, given the trajectory. That&#x27;s my pessimistic prediction.')
