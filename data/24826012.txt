You never said it, but where many people go wrong is when they say &quot;I&#x27;m modifying my behavior to avoid any potential for a perceived slight, <i>and you should too.</i>&quot; Such behavior policing is toxic.<p>I used to have a severe anxiety disorder that partly stemmed from being overly sensitive about what other people thought about me. I had to consciously dampen down that part of myself, and I feel much, much better about it.<p>I think instead of getting individuals to avoid offending others, we should instead foster a mentality of resiliency. People get offended far too easily nowadays. They should learn how to stop caring so much about what other people think.<p>Of course there&#x27;s a line beyond which you&#x27;re just a jerk, but to me, just saying &quot;hey guys&quot; doesn&#x27;t cross it. But that&#x27;s just me, and I&#x27;m in a region of the country where &quot;hey guys&quot; is acceptable.')
