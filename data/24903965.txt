It&#x27;s both true but also severely under-estimates the significant influence of Newton on modern physics.<p><i>&gt;&gt;  to give more nuanced analyses</i><p><i>&gt; It is not a matter of something being &quot;nuanced&quot; or not. It is instead that the vast majority of modern day economists do not take Marxian economics seriously at all.</i><p>I gave one specific example: management schools still draw from labor theories of value to explain competitive pressure and price discovery in the service sector. There are hundreds of other examples like this.')
