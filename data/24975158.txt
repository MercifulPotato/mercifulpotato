The very act of changing state is an imperative style by definition. The purpose of mutable state is for it to change. So mutable state = imperative instructions.<p>&gt;You don&#x27;t have to listen to me, but you should seek out a second opinion from a competent person who can get through to you.<p>I&#x27;ll throw that advice back at you. But you don&#x27;t need to find that person. I&#x27;m right here in front of you telling you how it is.<p>&gt;Everything I said in my last post is basic, well-understood computing knowledge. If you want me to disagree with it, you need to find yourself a competent computer scientist to aid you in framing your ideas in a way that is comprehensible with respect to the subject matter.<p>Yeah but you didn&#x27;t account for the practical parts of computing. The theoretical parts often deal with machines that can&#x27;t be realized in reality. It&#x27;s pretty much common sense. How do you represent a function call without mutable state? How can you have a machine do an algebraic operation without mutable state? The very act of holding that information in state requires a state change meaning to even load a lambda machine with a program requires an imperative instruction.<p>We&#x27;re also in a corner of computer science that isn&#x27;t formally well defined. A language can be formally defined as pure but there&#x27;s no formal theory for systems design and how the system overall influences the content of a pure SQL string in Haskell.<p>I define a haskell sql string to have syntactically correct SQL. The external requirements of my database are forcing me to define a string this way, is that a side effect? There&#x27;s no formal rules in literature so it&#x27;s just raw talking points... you won&#x27;t be able to find an official source stating who&#x27;s right or who&#x27;s wrong.')
