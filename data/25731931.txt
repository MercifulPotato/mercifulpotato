This came close to being a dramatically worse event.<p>I remain unconvinced about how close that actually was, nor have I seen a compelling case that it was <i>that</i> close actually made.<p>Further, before it becomes close to &quot;executing the Vice President&quot;, you can bet shots are going to actually be fired.
