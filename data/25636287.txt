I don&#x27;t understand the &quot;why&quot; of any of it anymore.<p>The far-left folks are pro lockdown but also want to help the underprivileged. No one is hurt worse by lockdowns.  They want to defund the police, and yet by now even the hardened ideologue can admit that less police is maybe not a great plan. The left is anti-authoritarian but engages in almost textbook authoritarian behavior. (Cancel culture, democratic governors having emergency powers for 9+ months now etc etc)  They hate capitalism but enjoy the byproducts (my most socialist friends can&#x27;t get enough of Amazon prime - the irony is completely lost on them).<p>There is just no way to reconcile the platform.  It is completely incoherent.')
