This articles summarizes that debate. [1]<p>&gt; This article considers three answers to the question whether electricity access should be a universal human right. A first position is that there is no human right to electricity but perhaps contractual rights related to various societies. A second position is that electricity is a derived human right, a right based on other rights, grounded on rights such as the right to adequate housing. A third position is that there is a universal human right to electricity. It is argued that the second position is the strongest since it supports the idea that humans often need access to electricity but avoids the stronger claim that all humans must have this access. The latter claim faces the challenge that rights language should focus on the needs of humans and not be extended too far to include everything that could be beneficial for humans. Such an extension might diminish the attention on the actual aim of human rights: That all humans should have a good enough life.<p>I agree with those assertions and it&#x27;s why I think that neither electricity nor the internet are universal human rights.<p>Contrary to such universal human rights as the right to a family, liberty, recognition as a person before the law,... which should be read as first principles that ought to be applied in human interactions, rather then claims to specific commodities. [2]<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean those things aren&#x27;t important. Access to the Internet has gained in importance. Instead, human rights are a moral framework that ought to  underpin the governance of that access. And that&#x27;s what makes all the difference.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;13642987.2019.1671355" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;13642987.2019.1...</a>   \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;</a>')
