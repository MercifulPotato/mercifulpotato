Over the past ~20yrs, America has cannibalized our middle class to enrich the 1%.  Expensive, manned Mars missions are an absurd luxury to the many who can&#x27;t afford healthcare, whose small business has gone bankrupt due to COVID, or has to wait in food lines to feed their family.<p>It&#x27;s quite possibly the case now that manned Mars missions will have to be handled by the private sector, which as someone above commented, is already working towards that.')
