This means massive scale (100s billions of rows and millions of inserts per second on a single server), 94%+ native compression, 10-100x faster queries than PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Cassandra, and MongoDB â€“ all while maintaining the reliability, ease-of-use, SQL interface, and overall goodness of PostgreSQL.<p><i>WITH</i> the links to back up their analysis&#x2F;comparisons. I think I was first sold the hardest on Timescale when I read the InfluxDB post.<p>Timescale also releasing their hard work over the last ~3 years with a very permissive, surprisingly business friendly license[0] which was previously discussed on HN[1].<p>This is pretty huge -- personally one of the things I&#x27;m really looking forward to is using Postgres as a backing store for Prometheus now, which timescale actually worked on[2] already. If you look really closely, there&#x27;s actually a way to get <i>all</i> your observability data into Postgres (i.e. zipkin&#x2F;jaeger, logs, and prometheus for metrics), and Timescale is going to make <i>all</i> of those things easier to scale and maintain. For those following along at home, postgres already has some not terrible full text search[3] and ways to integrate with elasticsearch like zombodb[4]...<p>[EDIT] - Just to make what I&#x27;m hinting at a little clearer, I think you might be able to build a Graylog[5] type system <i>really</i> easily with <i>just</i> Postgres these days. Imagine deploying a single binary that only needs a single database to do <i>everything</i> it needs to do.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.timescale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.timescale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-open-source-busines...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24579905" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24579905</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;promscale" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;promscale</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;textsearch.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;textsearch.html</a><p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zombodb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zombodb.com&#x2F;</a><p>[5]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Graylog2&#x2F;graylog2-server&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Graylog2&#x2F;graylog2-server&#x2F;</a>')
