A function with no parameters is just a complex constant.<p>Computation is always the union of code and data. People can <i>and do</i> embed full programs in &#x27;inert&#x27; formats like JSON, and write an interpreter for that program.<p>This is a bad idea, and the notion that JSON is &quot;just data&quot; is exactly what fools people into writing such inner languages (implementing, of course, half of Common Lisp).<p>Reducing the motivating examples (JSON, TOML, etc.) to path strings is a weak argument, because path strings are not strong enough to provide for such an inner platform, while the data formats under discussion are, it happens all the time.<p>The very fact that I can point out that a path string is capable of driving less complex calculations than YAML is, points out that there is <i>in fact</i> a continuum from pure code to &#x27;mere data&#x27; (a float, let&#x27;s say), which undermines the argument that there is some strong distinction to be made here.')
