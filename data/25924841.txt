Why? It&#x27;s quite remarkable that for Covid vaccines now, id&#x27;s are mandatory.<p>- The Ratner NIA report is explicit &amp; absolutely clear that China &amp; Iran were able to access the Dominion systems. Please read it.<p>- 96% of Dominion political donations went to democrats. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenationalpulse.com&#x2F;exclusive&#x2F;dominion-dem-donors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenationalpulse.com&#x2F;exclusive&#x2F;dominion-dem-donors&#x2F;</a> Isn&#x27;t this even a teeny bit suspicious??<p>Politics aside, it looks like HN is not even able (ready) to examine what the truth is. Especially when ~30% os US population think that the election was fraudulent. If elections are themselves questionable, then do we have any hope of having a nation anymore? What if the shoe was on the other foot?? Trust but verify is all I ask. If information is censored then how will ANYONE verify anything???')
