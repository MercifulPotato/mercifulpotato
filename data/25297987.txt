However, like in the game of Go, this is computationally intractable, so instead they use machine learning to &quot;guide search&quot; towards more promising &quot;moves&quot;. In AlphaGo (and here) this learning happened as part of a reinforcement learning pipeline.<p>There was some discussion of this in the AlphaGo Zero blog post from a while back: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepmind.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;article&#x2F;alphago-zero-starting-scratch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepmind.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;article&#x2F;alphago-zero-starting-scra...</a>')
