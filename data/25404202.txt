In short its the control of the materials required to create or assemble a firearm or other regulated component. Typical examples would be possessing a &lt; 16” barrel, a collapsible stock, and an appropriate receiver. They dont need to demonstrate that you did assemble an SBR without a tax stamp, merely that you could assemble them to an SBR. Similarly here theyre not selling just an unfinished receiver. Its all of the components necessary to assemble (not manufacture) a regulated firearm.<p>Edit: see also sibling comments are pistol braces, or “baffles” on the sig MPX. The ATF has never been know for consistency even in cases where they issue a letter.')
