Then it&#x27;s rolling forever.<p>2) by referring to the current &quot;testing&quot;, so for example &quot;bullseye&quot;.\nThen you&#x27;re temporarily on testing, rolling for a while until the day bullseye becomes the new stable, and then you&#x27;re on stable too.\nI often do this a bit ahead of a new stable on my personal laptop, to check what&#x27;s coming with the new stable. I guess it&#x27;s probably quite common.')
