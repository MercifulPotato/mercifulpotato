And a lot of people here in America join up. Rich spoiled fools far removed from the brutality they cause.<p>Police do very little even with gun shots. Don&#x27;t let the violence spread. Come back tomorrow morning and collect the casings.<p>Smart, because if you brought what really happens to the public, it would get out of control. The American public beats to death every foreign agent in the street. China invades Taiwan, Venezuela invades Columbia, Russia invades Belarus or Poland and we have a full on nuclear exchange.<p>Join up and stop it, or be quiet. You are in something way over your head. The people pushing this, like Soros, don&#x27;t care. They care about the money and leave town first sign of trouble.')
