People in gurneys lined up along hallways, PPE running low, overflow tents in the parking lots, nurses WAY over ratio handling more patients than is safe, doctors burned-out and scared.<p>So, any patient in a hospital that tests positive should be going into a negative-pressure room so that the hospital doesn&#x27;t become a super spreader event. When you get too many patients, it becomes impossible to actually do that, and it gets kind of scary both for people with non-COVID issues, as well as the staff. Doctors, and nurses, and ER techs, and social workers, and respiratory therapists, and security, and janitors, and radiology techs, and CNAs aren&#x27;t disposable.<p>The other issue is that you need doctors and nurses to run the ICU. Critical care physicians and nurses are in high demand all over the country right now, and LA may not be able to double their number of ICU specialist staff on a week-by-week basis.<p>Sweden has a universal, socialized healthcare system, so they are able to allocate resources nationally based on demand. In the United States, it&#x27;s a checkerboard of private, nonprofit, and county facilities, each with different structures, policies, health record systems, profit sources, etc. so planning and coordination becomes very complex.<p>Again, the order does not prevent people from going outside, there is a long, long list of exempted activities in the actual order.<p>I have turned this problem over in my head a <i>lot</i>, and I really can&#x27;t think of a good alternate policy approach specific for the highly dense urban setting of LA city proper. I don&#x27;t have a good answer along the lines of &#x27;this is what they should be doing instead.&#x27;')
