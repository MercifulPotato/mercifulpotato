All the USB ports are disabled. Nobody has admin rights on their laptops. You can&#x27;t install any software unless you download and install from their internal app store which only allows apps that have passed a rigorous gambit of testing beforehand. And you have to put in a request for the software in the first place. It took me three months to get Photoshop approved because I was designated as a developer and not a web designer. It went through three escalations and took several debates between senior managers who finally approved my request.<p>We don&#x27;t have &quot;phishing tests&quot;. If something pops up on the security team&#x27;s radar, then they push it out as an email alert company wide. That&#x27;s about it. Maybe if GoDaddy put as much effort into securing their network as they do putting together these stupid tests, they probably wouldn&#x27;t need them to prove that yes, humans are fallible.')
