I think there are some low hanging fruit in Nix.<p>The other isuess do reflect some persistent rhetorical issues we&#x27;ve had with explaining Nix:<p>&gt; There was little differentiation with Nix vs NixOS. (Some of his philosophical difference could be resolved by just using Nix.)<p>&gt; There was no recognition that the &quot;nix language part of Nix&quot; is cleanly layered away from the layers that actually do the work of running jobs and moving files around, and can be replaced like Guix does.<p>So I do want our materials to highlight this so experimenters realize Nix is less of an all-in proposition than it sounds (if one is already willing to do the extra work of blazing their own trail).')
