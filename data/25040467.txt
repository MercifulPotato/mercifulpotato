I flagged the review and yelp got back to me that &quot;they tried to include all relevant opinions.&quot; This was about a decade ago, but the experience has always left me with the opinion that review sites could do more to keep reviews topical by promoting ratings of the separate parts of an item. Also, they should allow you to flag racism.')
