FX322 is a hearing-loss drug that works via stem cells and has shown promising results in treating the hearing loss angle.<p>If yours is TMJ or blood pressure, though... you need an entirely different plan of attack.<p>Posting this comment mostly because I really get tired of reading threads where this isn&#x27;t acknowledged; no one cure fits all. I&#x27;ve had it since I was a child and while habituation does factor in slightly, I think wider understanding of this all needs to be out there.')
