That is, new short positions could even be in the money right now (at least some likely are).<p>Of course, another insane rush and buying spree could squeeze a short position at any price. It’s a giant game of chicken. To me, having a bearish position at $300 seems well-founded, but it certainly seems risky going against an army of people that hate you and are willing to lose a lot of money just to spite you.<p>It will be very interesting to see how this all unwinds.')
