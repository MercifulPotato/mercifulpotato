Certainly for where I&#x27;m living. Most of the information is missing -- eg apparently there are no pediatricians in my city, many opening times are missing, in my area there are no photos, no reviews; other stuff is wrong. It&#x27;s more comprehensive in Prague, though from a brief look Google still has more of everything.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that OSM (and other projects, but particularly OSM) can&#x27;t catch up, especially when it comes to factual information. It has already shown that it  crowdsourcing can do better than Google at pure mapping.')
