Or that the last efforts had much value.<p>No one is saying don’t make progress on compilers.  Look around you and you’ll see the things you just referenced already exist in practice in production today.  (Among others: compiler&#x2F;architecture co-design is a well established and fertile area of work.  Compiling to intermediate formats which specialize for a device later is in use to some degree in App Store, which keeps programs in an intermediate format and thins binaries down to specific slices on demand for iOS devices, etc.)  None of these technologies justify building a new VLIW chip or have frankly much to do with those efforts.  The best thing we could learn from the huge amount of effort that’s gone into VLIW architectures is actually learn the lesson that in front of us, demonstrated repeatedly, that unless something substantial changes, VLIW does not produce a better architecture for processor cores and the assumption that it would was wrong.')
