Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605924807, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166486, text='Linus has apparently argued that x86 really did have an architectural advantage: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yarchive.net&#x2F;comp&#x2F;linux&#x2F;x86.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yarchive.net&#x2F;comp&#x2F;linux&#x2F;x86.html</a>. The argument here is that the CISC nature of x86 forced Intel to innovate microarchitecturally, and those microarchitectural innovations were more important for performance than the RISCy bits that x86 didn&#x27;t adapt.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I completely buy into the reasoning, but I do believe that Intel (accidentally!) ended up with an architecture that compromised well between RISC and CISC ideas. When they tried to build a shiny RISC architecture, what we got was Itanium, which turned out to be a disaster in no small part because the sufficiently-smart-compiler ideas underlying RISC definitely didn&#x27;t work out.')
