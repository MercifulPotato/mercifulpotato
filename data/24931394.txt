So I imagine the lawsuit will have many legs to stand on.<p>Except they don&#x27;t.  In fact, they register domain names and set fake websites that say they are the restaurant when they&#x27;re not.  They set up phone numbers that route through Grubhub&#x2F;Seamless and charge their outrageous commissions even for pickup orders.<p>While there are many places where <i>delivery</i> services are useful, in places where delivery was already ubiquitous (e.g., NYC), the high commission fees and deceptive practices have forced many low and mid-priced restaurants to close because orders through these services take all their profit and a bunch more, making businesses that had been profitable for years or even decades unprofitable and forcing them to close their doors.<p>Aside from reducing the number and diversity of restaurants, sucking profit out of such transactions that are way beyond any value provided will also end up costing consumers (that&#x27;s you) more too.<p>cf:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;6&#x2F;28&#x2F;19154220&#x2F;grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-domain-names-commission-fees" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;6&#x2F;28&#x2F;19154220&#x2F;grubhub-seamless...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;15&#x2F;21260609&#x2F;grubhub-phone-call-fees-controversial-pandemic-covid-19-criticism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;15&#x2F;21260609&#x2F;grubhub-phone-ca...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eater.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;8&#x2F;6&#x2F;20756799&#x2F;yelp-grubhub-phone-numbers-referral-fees-restaurants" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eater.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;8&#x2F;6&#x2F;20756799&#x2F;yelp-grubhub-phone-n...</a>')
