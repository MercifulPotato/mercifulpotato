What makes this offering interesting IMO is that this a PC sold without a HDD and without an OS pre-installed.  Although the &quot;kit&quot; may supply an SD card with a &quot;recommended&quot; OS, there is no obligation to use it.  There are plenty of other options.  Users can use multiple OS on the same computer without the inconvenience of &quot;dual-boot&quot;.<p>Although some of the first personal computers, e.g., the ones advertised in the back of Popular Science, did not come with software, that flexibility did not last and bundling&#x2F;pre-installation became a corporate strategy.  User choice of OS is something no &quot;Big Tech&quot; company today will ever allow.  Their business relies on being able to make this choice for the user and all the power that control over the OS allows.  Imagine buying a computer without a Microsoft, Apple, Google or Amazon OS pre-installed.')
