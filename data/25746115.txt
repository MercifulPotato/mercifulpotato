I generally wear simple black clothing, though I&#x27;ll very occasionally choose something grey. I tend not to have much selection in stores, especially in women&#x27;s clothing. If someone wants to put a small brand on their buttons, a pocket, or something similarly small and non-intrusive, I might just go with it if the clothing fits my requirements.<p>I&#x27;m still not going to wear obvious logos in general, and not wearing prints saves me from the most obvious stuff - and some things can&#x27;t be avoided as easily. I&#x27;m not going to replace the backpacks I have: They were free and functional. I also sometimes have branded shoes because comfort is more important than a logo.')
