It can be an indicator, but it&#x27;s no guarantee.<p>And for occasional-use things, higher quality doesn&#x27;t help as much, as you&#x27;ve seen.<p>Finally, having an item that fits you well can be better than an item that&#x27;ll last longer.  10x so for occasional-use items.<p>For instance, I had a spatula that I <i>loved</i>.  I have never found an better one, and every spatula that I&#x27;ve owned since then has been quite inferior.  I bought that spatula at Walmart on impulse for just a few dollars.  Someone broke it, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement for it for years.')
