Misinformation is untrue, and people can generally see right through it; email leaks <i>are</i> true. Given the polarization at the time, I donâ€™t think that the email leaks had an impact on the outcome, but voters did become more informed, and that likely swayed some votes.  Educated voters are a good thing in my opinion.')
