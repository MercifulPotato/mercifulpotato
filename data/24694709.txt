There are organelles and the nucleus that require only let certain proteins in and and out and at certain rates.<p>There are also kinds of tar-pits that keep certain proteins around for longer.<p>Stress granules and vesicles also gobble-up macromolecules into these fun party bags that burst in certain contexts.<p>Sometimes you even have complexes of macromolecules like ribosomes whose entire job is to intercept other macromolecules so that they might interact (there is a subtle difference between enzymes&#x2F;catalysis here if I understand correctly)')
