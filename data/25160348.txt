You can get up to about mach 3 to mach 4 before stagnation temperature (when you slow down a supersonic flow, it heats up) starts making this approach impractical.<p>But there&#x27;s no way of getting around the fact that if you have a 3 meter diameter fan, you have at the very minimum a 7 m^2 cross sectional area that you are sticking into a supersonic airstream, and in reality that inlet is going to be pretty beefy too. That creates a lot of drag that the fan needs to overcome to produce net thrust.')
