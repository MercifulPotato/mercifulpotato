Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if youâ€™re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.<p>(I think he means &quot;out of the box&quot;, ie, without spending lots of time configuring or fighting with it to get it set up.)<p>I think Mac OS works for most people without spending 3 days to set it up. For OP, he spent the same amount of time setting up FreeBSD as he did MacOS... I&#x27;m not confident this is typical.<p>&gt; Every time Apple pushed an updated, my pf.conf and automount configs got broken on macOS. They either got deleted or they moved somewhere. Well, the last 2 times it just got deleted.<p>Aha. OK, I don&#x27;t even know what this is... but ok, I can believe if you are using features are more unixy they will work better on FreeBSD with less tinkering. Which doesn&#x27;t mean they work &quot;out of the box&quot;, especially for non-technical users. Just that, sure, they aren&#x27;t any better and are sometimes worse on MacOS.<p>&gt; Unix is outdated and Apple does not care about it.<p>I think this is probably accurate, Apple is no longer interested in maintaining the OS (and installed&#x2F;supported packages) as an up to date unix competitive with other unixes.<p>&gt; Doing forensics is almost impossible<p>What do &quot;forensics&quot; mean here?')
