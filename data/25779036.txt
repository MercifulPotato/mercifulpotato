If open means total freedom, including selling on at a lower margin; then yes, people might do express that freedom and undercut you - I can&#x27;t see any way around that by definition, but I also don&#x27;t see it as a problem - what&#x27;s value is lost exactly?<p>I think what <i>is</i> a problem is that people can&#x27;t use a subset of you design to make their own stuff. Maybe the solution to that is a common <i>library</i> of <i>totally</i> free design-pattern, but that still requires integration into a finished product?<p>&gt; Allow your competitors to use your design ... they just must contribute back improvements.<p>won&#x27;t this just lead to trivial improvements? perhaps a bug bounty, or similar, would be better? or even licensing the original design for either a set fee, or a %?')
