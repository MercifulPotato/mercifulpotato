Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612158634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972620, text='All: this thread turned into a wretched nationalistic and religious flamewar. I&#x27;ve scolded and&#x2F;or banned many of the accounts that did that. If you see a comment that didn&#x27;t get scolded that should have been, it&#x27;s simply because there isn&#x27;t time or energy to read everything here, let alone respond. We&#x27;re not secretly agreeing with it. You can always email hn@ycombinator.com about egregious cases.<p>To the commenters who perpetuated this flamewar: it&#x27;s not what HN is for and we ban accounts that do this kind of thing. Please don&#x27;t do it again, regardless of how right you are or feel you are, or how wrong someone else is or you feel they are. This is a site for curious conversation, not a battleground. If you&#x27;re feeling warlike (including flamewarlike) rather than curious, please don&#x27;t post until that changes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
