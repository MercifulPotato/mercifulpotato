I was surprised by the lousy build times, though.<p>The choice of WSL2 as platform introduces a few confounders, especially filesystem performance, which might distort the differences between build times in particular. If someone wants to get a better understanding of what&#x27;s going on, maybe a breakdown of where the time is spent or performing the benchmarks on other platforms would be a good idea.')
