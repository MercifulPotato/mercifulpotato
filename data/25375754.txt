I&#x27;ll tell you a secret, it&#x27;s very hard, and it costs money. It costs employers, who&#x27;ll need to go through headache of sponsoring your visa, and it&#x27;ll cost you, who&#x27;ll need to pay to the Home Office if you want to stay.<p>I have numerous friends and people I studied and worked with over the last 12 years in the UK that couldn&#x27;t stay. They were from Russia, Australia, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, etc. Every time I discussed with them their visa situation and attempts to stay in the country, I thanked god that where I emigrated from, we&#x27;ve joined the European Union and I don&#x27;t have to deal with these issues. It&#x27;s a nightmare.<p>You, as a EU national, can look for a job and work here without a permit, you can reside here without a permit, you can stay here after studies or employment, and from legal point of view, you enjoy equal, non-discriminatory treatment with same rights and access to employment, working conditions, social &amp; health security and tax advantages as UK citizens.<p>No, you cannot have the same and &quot;move to any other country in the world which isn&#x27;t part of the EU as well, so clearly my freedom has nothing to do with the current 4 &quot;freedoms&quot;.&quot;')
