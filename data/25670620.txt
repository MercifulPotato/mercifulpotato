Basically anything that uses things like Bash or CMake will almost certainly not work in directories containing spaces.<p>Developers don&#x27;t use paths containing spaces because it causes so many issues with badly written Bash scripts, and as a result they don&#x27;t test their code with paths containing spaces.<p>Bash and CMake and similar hacked together languages have very error-prone quoting rules that make it very easy to accidentally make something work with paths without spaces but fail on paths with spaces.')
