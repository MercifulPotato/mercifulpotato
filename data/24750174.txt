This is a process called shared what you learned. In most cases the learnings are not financially-related, and in fact most launches on Product Hunt don&#x27;t make any money. Some sign up some customers, but many products are free. Mine just happened to be a paid product.<p>All companies, everywhere do this, not just indie hackers looking to share what they&#x27;ve learned from their process.<p>Business news writes about revenue numbers hit by large companies every day. This is a form of advertising. Sadly, I do not have Forbes to do a story on my tiny payday, so I write about it myself.<p>I also don&#x27;t think this is re-packaged content. I only know of one other person (the file I was inspired by) who did the same. In my ebook, I talk mostly about the process of setting up the page, with detailed steps for the launch -- but the lessons are 2-fold (how to design your website for success, and how to launch). The design aspect is a highly in demand service that your company has probably hired for multiple times. In fact, every business in the world (or just about) hires people to work on their websites and make them work more efficiently. Those who don&#x27;t usually don&#x27;t survive. It&#x27;s a skill you need in today&#x27;s competitive environment.')
