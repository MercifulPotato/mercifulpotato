The question whether we can really go to 100% of automation is moot if we can go to 99%. Either way it means that full employment is unnecessary and leads to the creation of bullshit jobs.<p>&gt; I think the solution is for more people to learn how to set up their own automation and to automate things without making them too centralized.<p>That&#x27;s my sad conclusion as well. We could get to an automated society with far less pain and much faster if it was decided collectively though.<p>Look at car automation: if a city wanted to make automated cars a reality in their streets, there are tons of accommodations they could do: from radio beacons to official maps, standards on how to signal construction work, purposefully designed roads...<p>Instead, we are trying to design automated cars with the assumption that zero efforts will be made to promote them. Worse: we assume they are going to be so criticized that they have to perform better by a magnitude on day 1. That&#x27;s making us waste 40 years.')
