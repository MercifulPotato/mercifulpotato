Password protected site so only family can see it. Easy backups to Wordpress just in case.<p>It’s easy for family to check the site whenever they want rather than putting it on social media. We turned off commenting so there’s never pressure for anyone to leave a comment and we don’t have any sense of needing affirmation for every picture we put up. It’s all just there if family wants to see it. Grandparents living far away especially appreciate it.<p>For our own usage, it has been invaluable too. I made some theme updates so we can go back in time and look at specific months easily. It’s been a great asset of curated family photos we can go through to see the kids at different stages. They’re 7 &amp; 4 now.<p>I’d be happy to share my custom Tumblr theme with anyone who’s interested.')
