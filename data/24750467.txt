Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=[24750490, 24752124], score=None, time=1602464133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750424, text='First off, I do generally regard non-expert opinions on complex subjects as ridiculous (see Gell-Mann amnesia on why that is). But AOC helped me in that by not reading her own proposal, and allowing &quot;cow farts&quot; to figure prominently in it. That just invites ridicule.<p>As to why I did not address the merits: it&#x27;s not a serious proposal, so there&#x27;s really nothing to address as it presents no details for how to get from point A to point B, how much it will cost, how it will (or will not) help domestic industry, what the electricity will cost when all is said and done, how that will affect the standard of living, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;hope&quot; and, as they say in the military, hope is not a strategy. This is sort of like &quot;addressing&quot; a poem - a completely meaningless endeavor.')
