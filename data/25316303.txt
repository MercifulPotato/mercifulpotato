There are thousands of years of human thinking on human thinking that one could refer to, and do. Ignoring the question of what is a human subject, reality and thought maps it as another polemic cultural battle of the Global West. It&#x27;s super fun. Start maybe at Plato, Kant, Hegel, Foucault, Badiou, Ljubljana school, Mbembe, Moten&#x2F;Harney&#x2F;Undercommons, Agamben, Butler, Spivak, Hall, and on and on. So many people dedicating their lives to this question always seems like a good place to start, if one is seriously asking the question and not just reproducing status quo. Which, if that is the  purpose of this forum, I apologize.')
