This is my favorite tower defense game hands down - I never played another one after Gem TD.<p>-Hope you&#x27;ll post about it here! More people deserve to know the awesomeness that is Gem TD!<p>-Things like Gem TD proved a great distraction when I was going through things in life. And one round doesn&#x27;t take long, it could be played in small increments. I feel like there is a lack of games that.<p>Good luck in whatever you are working on - including the HTML5 Gem TD! :)')
