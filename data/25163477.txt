Off to a good start.<p>I didn&#x27;t, I tackled the most prominent first.<p>&gt; Contradicted by the amount of people putting their time, energy and money on. YOU don&#x27;t want it, fine. YOU don&#x27;t speak for everyone.<p>I think you misunderstand. Many people put their time and energy into it because it&#x27;s overwhelmingly a get-rich-quick scheme. If the price went down to $1&#x2F;BTC you can bet your behind nobody would care at all anymore.<p>&gt; FUD and bullshit. Do you blame the use of petrol for enabling Al-Qaeda or left-wing dictatorships in Venezuela? You are very well aware that money laundering already existed before crypto. Have you renounced your use of banking systems because of all the drug and weapon traffickers that used HSBC to launder money for so long? Criminal activity and the need for spending resources in security is never going to go away.<p>I do, which is why I believe in technology that can make the problem better instead of technology which surrenders to the criminals and walks away.<p>&gt; Okay, that&#x27;s the third statement based on the current implementation. Hat-trick!<p>Sure, if you pretend there&#x27;s some platonic ideal cryptocurrency that doesn&#x27;t have any problems, and is perfectly efficient, why not? I&#x27;ll be waiting for OP to deliver.<p>&gt; FUD and bullshit.<p>Not if you decided to look for information. $2 billion dollars and counting as documented by a pro-crypto news source. [1]<p>That&#x27;s the <i>definition</i> of permissionless. Many pro-crypto folks hold this up as an example of crypto working properly! &quot;Why should we allow America decide who can and can&#x27;t spend money! Iranians and North Koreans should be able to conduct commerce internationally too!&quot;<p>&gt; Societies. Plural. To be honest, I am more concerned about people that want to establish an &quot;universal&quot; society than I fear all of the scammers that try to exploit people in crypto.<p>You misinterpreted. That expression implies we each live in our respective societies but that nobody is self-sufficient.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;north-korean-crypto-hacking-separating-fact-from-fiction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;north-korean-c...</a>')
