We have two types of court - criminal for locking people up, and civil for dealing with money. For locking people up, we require beyond a reasonable doubt. Better ten guilty men go free than one innocent man be convicted and all that. For taking somebody&#x27;s money, we require it to more likely than not (preponderance of evidence) be the correct result. You call this a &quot;low bar&quot; but it&#x27;s the same bar for a dispute between individuals. We say - it&#x27;s only money - we should choose the result we believe to be the most correct, <i></i>not<i></i> err on the side of protecting the innocent even if it means letting many more guilty people go free. Why should the state be barred from using both courts?<p>The parents in that news story knew that kid was selling drugs. They smelled it; they saw the money and the clothes and the car; they got helped out on the bills. 9 times out of 10, they are guilty as hell. But it&#x27;s not 10 times out of 10, so we only take the house the drugs were sold out of, not lock them up.')
