I&#x27;ve never had to provide any sort of documentation and have gotten the money back quickly each time.<p>The most recent time was with a company that wouldn&#x27;t honor their refund policy. They were awfully rude over email so I made sure to take screenshots of the policy on their website in case they disputed the chargeback and&#x2F;or changed the wording on their site. Turns out, there wasn&#x27;t even an option to upload that information when I filed with my credit card, and I won the case without doing anything further.')
