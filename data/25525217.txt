If making a cool side project, etc. was what helped most software developers get better at interviews, &quot;people here&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be complaining in the first place.<p>Sure, you are learning something by solving Leetcode problems, but not anything useful[1] except in the artificial world of software interviews.<p>[0] This is probably heavily dependent on the specific jobs in questionâ€”I&#x27;m only speaking from my personal experience.<p>[1] Same as [0].')
