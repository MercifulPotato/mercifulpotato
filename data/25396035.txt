Item(by='SllX', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607753574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395803, text='&gt; Who set a record for votes. He wasn&#x27;t unpopular, he was the 2nd most popular candidate ever.<p>You have a point, but let me ask you: if a bag of rice had been the Republican Presidential incumbent in place of Donald J. Trump, do you think Biden would have received a record-setting number of votes?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong about this, but it seems to me Trump&#x27;s unpopularity was as much a factor in Biden winning as anything else that, and maybe that&#x27;s because I live in a blue bubble, but even conservative outlets I followed were expecting the Republicans to be absolutely crushed this election and to go down in flames <i>with</i> the President, and they weren&#x27;t. Not even close. Republicans didn&#x27;t regain the House, but they saw net gains, and they retained a full 50% of the Senate. Harris&#x27;s vote is only relevant if the Democrats can win in the Georgia runoff on January 6th, not just one, but both seats, otherwise she&#x27;s just another President of the Senate without a vote. Considering that election is still an open question, it is a bit early to be calling Georgia a blue state. Elections are more than just the President after all, and Red and Blue States are only really Red and Blue after they&#x27;ve demonstrated a continuous unbroken Red or Blue streak for a few cycles.<p>So again, if the Republican Presidential incumbent was a bag of rice, would we have 1. seen record-breaking turnout in favor of both candidates and 2. a loss by the incumbent? I ask, and maybe this is just because I live in a blue bubble inside a blue bubble, because it seems to me much of the public turned out to register a vote of no confidence in the President more than they turned out to vote specifically for Biden. I wouldn&#x27;t say most of Biden&#x27;s votes were this, but enough to swing the election in a few key States? I think that&#x27;s plausible.')
