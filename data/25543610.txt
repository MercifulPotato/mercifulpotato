Hell something like Signal for email could work with its forward secrecy I am not saying Signal itself just the approach.<p>I am still sour that KeyBase got sold off I was hoping they would add an email client and we could all get @keybase email addresses and they would charge for the service finally. I would easily have given them $15 a month for a small family plan (for me and my wife) just cause KeyBase is beautifully done. It could probably be fine tuned but it was great.')
