Hell something like Signal for email could work with its forward secrecy I am not saying Signal itself just the approach.<p>I am still sour that KeyBase got sold off I was hoping they would add an email client and we could all get @keybase email addresses and they would charge for the service finally. I would easily have given them $15 a month for a small family plan (for me and my wife) just cause KeyBase is beautifully done. It could probably be fine tuned but it was great.<p>Edit:<p>Please if someone from KeyBase ever reads this, please make your efforts open, some sort of open source foundation that fully owns the rights to KeyBase and is allowed to later on go commercial. It&#x27;s a damn shame a decent tech is going to just perish. Do not open source it when it is far too late! All your users who know you&#x27;ve sold off the project have no strong confidence in it anymore.')
