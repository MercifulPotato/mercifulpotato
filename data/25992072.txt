The manufacturing and fulfillment process is currently just out of my house and too fragile.<p>It&#x27;s tough to outsource right now because we&#x27;re continuing to find new ways to improve our processes and the components. The advantage of doing it all from my house is that I&#x27;m the last stop before the product reaches the customer. I can be nimble and manage changes quickly rather than risk things falling through the cracks trying to communicate to someone else small changes in the process.<p>What will likely happen next is me hiring an extra person to come to my house and take on some of the work. Hopefully vaccine rollout goes smoothly because I don&#x27;t want to do this until it&#x27;s safe for both me and the employee.<p>&gt;<i>I&#x27;m definitely in your target market, but I&#x27;d rather have something more streamlined looking that didn&#x27;t require upfront assembly.</i><p>I currently sell two flavors. One&#x27;s a kit, and the other&#x27;s plug &#x27;n play (TinyPilot Voyager).')
