In fact, your entire application could be a single line of code, easy!<p>- When you enforce KPIs, the only people who will stay are the ones who agree with the KPI (code golfers) or know how to work around it (see above).<p>To extend this idea to its logical conclusion and work around both the issues above, why not limit the number of <i>characters</i> the developers can use? Because every single name in the application will be a single character, making maintenance a nightmare.<p>Let&#x27;s continue the above list for fun:<p>- Automated tests are code, so they would limit the budget of production code even further.<p>- Infrastructure as code is out the window, for the same reason.<p>This is an awful idea.')
