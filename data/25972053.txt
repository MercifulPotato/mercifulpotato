With 100% scaling, the fonts and widgets are too small. The ideal scaling seems to be 125% or 150%. GNOME has experimental support for fractional scaling. This works generally ok for Wayland applications, but windows of X11 applications are incredibly blurry both on the laptop display with 150% scaling and the external screen with 200% screen. I think they are rendered at 100% and then scaled up. There are various workarounds for X11 applications, but it seems that e.g. none of the workaround really works with e.g. JetBrains IDEs (there are some bug reports about it).<p>Windows 10, on the other hand, handles fractional scaling and per-screen scaling just fine. It&#x27;s frustrating, because I highly prefer GNOME and Linux and if all applications supported Wayland, there wouldn&#x27;t be any major problems.')
