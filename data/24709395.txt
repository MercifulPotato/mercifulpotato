An API is source code. Witness thousands of languages, all with recognizably different standard libraries, including languages like Go or Dart created by Google themselves. The problem is less with individual examples like &quot;max&quot; vs &quot;maximum&quot; or &quot;write&quot; vs &quot;scribble&quot;, but more with thousands of packages, classes and methods, 99% of which have the exact names and structure as the Sun&#x27;s Java ones. That is blatant theft. Google stole Java code from Sun. Shame on them.<p>What we need the law to do is to distinguish between copying a piece of code and using a piece of code. Just because I use your code doesn&#x27;t mean you own my code too. What we need the software industry to understand is that relying on a proprietary library makes it impossible to cheaply switch your code to an alternative implementation without rewriting your own code. Alternatives exist: use software with an open license model, or shim out the proprietary library.')
