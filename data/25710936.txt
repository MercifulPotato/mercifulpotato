But I mean it to be more encompassing of any entity that has the right to remove content from communications channels.<p>Currently the platforms are private (as a peer comment points out). So right now there isn&#x27;t technically a &quot;freedom of speech&quot; issue as it&#x27;s a private matter and private entities in the USA don&#x27;t need to respect the 1st amendment.<p>As a thought experiment -- suppose the social media platforms were turned into &quot;utilities&quot; and completely absolved of the responsibility (or even the authority) to &quot;censor&quot; speech. In the same way someone&#x27;s phone doesn&#x27;t turn off if they make a threatening phone call. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Would losing the ability for anyone to remove content be fundamentally bad? Given that we have social mechanisms that existed prior to digital communication for countering bad speech?<p>As to your question, the fact that some people do support the suspension by the platform controllers (currently private) of accounts that post inflammatory speech would suggest that yes, some folks do think that censorship is a good idea.')
