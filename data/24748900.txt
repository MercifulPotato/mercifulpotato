Then it would be like it used to be when law enforcement needed a warrant to obtain an individual’s communications, which is then served to that individual rather than to a third party communications provider.<p>Also, it seems like it’s time to remind everyone that only totalitarian governments want to read everyone’s mail all the time to look for crimes.  Our bill of rights expressly forbids this.  I really don’t understand why the DOJ would write a letter like this that to me, a layman, reads like it is plainly in violation of the 4th amendment.')
