Yes, a guesstimate (nobody could have tested for effect on Coronavirus in advance), but at least it&#x27;s a guesstimate based on some things WHO, Fauci, etc. had knowledge of. Fauci says he was aware of this but worried about a run on mask supplies.<p>My point was that assessing social behaviour was far beyond the remit of the typical WHO member or apparently even epidemiologists. They should have &#x27;followed the science&#x27; themselves and talked to people who actually have some expertise and experience in that, rather than make policy on a whim.<p>&gt;That sounds questionable, epidemiology certainly does have human behavior as a component of study.<p>Fauci worried that if there was a mask mandate early on, would people have made a run on masks, leaving nothing to doctors. What&#x27;s the epidemiological answer? What&#x27;s the epidemiological model for even getting an answer?<p>There isn&#x27;t any, because their toolbox for humans is much more limited than their toolbox for viruses. One really needs to ask other professions - you know, sociologists, economists, etc. for that one.<p>There were alternatives even if the answer was &#x27;yes&#x27;. One could have mobilized production via DPA, or banned the sale of N95 masks. Instead, Fauci made a personal call based on no data.<p>&gt;&gt; Even now, in no place with a mask mandate has there been an increase in human contact.<p>&gt;How would you be able to tell? What&#x27;s your baseline?<p>Google (and I believe Apple too) release aggregate positional tracking data on activities. Most of the world shows decreases, including places with a mask mandate. I haven&#x27;t seen any reporting of an increase tied to mandates in places that have them.')
