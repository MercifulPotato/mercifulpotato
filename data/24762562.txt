Apart from the example you gave, I&#x27;m also vaguely aware of cases where tribes own reservation land where homes have been built by non-tribe members who technically have a lease to the land.<p>And actually you bring up another wrinkle, which is if you don&#x27;t own the land underneath, there are plenty of lenders who also won&#x27;t lend to you to buy a manufactured home, because they consider it to be personal property rather than a permanent dwelling (which they could more easily foreclose and sell)')
