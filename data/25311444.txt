That I am labeling you, and think you to be a white supremacist?<p>If so then allow me to be clear for a moment: I have literally <i>no</i> way of knowing if you&#x27;re a white supremacist. I have no way of knowing if you&#x27;re not actually an armada of ants collectively working to actuate the keys of a mechanical keyboard or a Boltzmann brain sending these messages through some strange and baffling form of quantum entanglement. What I am trying to expose is the very real reality that these are uncomfortable conversations, that&#x27;s just intrinsic to this topic and the climate we are in.<p><i>This is fine. It is fine to admit being uncomfortable trying to process where we are, how we got here, and how we got out of it</i>.<p>But one has to start by looking that beast in the face first in order to reckon with it. For some, that uncomfort gets unwittingly channeled into anger and frustration and they might not even know why or even realize it, but that can be focused, and turned into knowledge and wisdom on the issues. One&#x27;s just gotta start, like I said: see it for what it is, and working from there.<p>If you took that to be me associating you with white supremacy, I&#x27;ll try to find other ways of seeking out clarity from people next time.')
