I boot into windows about once a year to try something or another.<p>The machine is from 2013 and was pretty good back then, Latitude laptop with a Core i5 and 8GB ram. I still use it regularly as a personal linux laptop.<p>Getting to my point, this laptop is still good enough for normal use 8 years after I got it, and even if i was a daily windows users, what reason would i have to try and install windows 10? So it doesnt surprise me that many just keep the version their computer came with, and have kept their computers since windows 7 days.<p>Also, having just had to try windows 10, it really is a bad user experience compared to linux, mac, or windows 7, if nothing else because of added novelty for no reason. The only compelling thing about it for me is WSL, which I would definitely appreciate having on the same machine if I had a MS office heavy workflow.')
