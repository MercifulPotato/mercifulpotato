The government is at odds with public broadcasters. Initially they excluded them from receiving revenue from linkage. They backtracked, but I fear for the consequence: I believe they will use this to introduce cost saving de-funding of public broadcasting.<p>Its &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; stuff.<p>Also, we have a fight with a union-pension-fund backed news outlet being possibly responsible for (same government) legislative changes to prevent pension funds from investing in news (one word change to require their spend to be for members <i>financial</i> benefit, not just &quot;members benefit&quot; which permitted this investment)<p>Also Also we have huge dominance of print media and non-public news outlet by &quot;News Ltd&quot; which is Rupert Murdoch which is a cancer on the world of disinterested, bipartisan news (the leader writers and editorial panel of News in Australia are futher to the right than the Koch brothers, and have gone feral on anything even vaguely to the left of Reaganite views of pollution, green energy, public sector finance...) -The pay for links thing, is designed to get money to News Ltd which has suffered massive declines in revenue.<p>News hoovered up all the small independent newspapers in Australia. Its a public disgrace, of equal dimensions to the predation of news by Google and the Facebooks of the globe.')
