Every time someone asks me about advice for an interview and I don&#x27;t mention doing hours of leetcode studying they accuse me of lying and trying to sabotage them because _obviously_ the only way to pass an interview is to memorize every possible question the interview can ask! It&#x27;s so crazy to me how people think this and then I&#x27;ll sit down with them for a mock interview and watch them completely stop communicating or treat me like I&#x27;m a binary switch that only comes on when they have the optimal solution.')
