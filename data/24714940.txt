ANA is simpler to get lower status, but getting to the top is better on JAL. I can speak highly for the quality of service at JAL. Now to be fair, I have had Diamond for 7 years, so on my normal schedules and airports the staff recognize me. I have not been able to fly at all this year. They have frozen expire dates for status, allowing for an extra year to make up for the lost 2020 year.<p>The JAL flight JL01 from SFO used to leave near midnight. I screwed up once and booked the flight on the wrong day. When I showed up a day late, they asked if I was okay as I had been booked on the flight the day before. We had a good chuckle at my screwup as they found me a seat on the flight, handing me a ticket, no change fee, etc. without a thought.')
