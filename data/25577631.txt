Item(by='avalys', descendants=None, kids=[25577652], score=None, time=1609294870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577037, text='This article is a great example of the straw man fallacy. The article pretends that there is an &quot;intellectual justification&quot; for capitalism that doesn&#x27;t recognize the need to break up monopolies to preserve the free market. I think that recognition is quite common even among &quot;hardcore libertarians&quot;.<p>The article makes good points in favor of a government intervention of some kind against Amazon. But the headline and thesis is overwrought, unsupported clickbait.<p>(For what it&#x27;s worth, in my opinion, the lack of government action in this area is good evidence that no one in power in the US right now gives two shits about the intellectual justification for capitalism).')
