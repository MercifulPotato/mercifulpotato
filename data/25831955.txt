This is a problem and we need solutions.<p>Solutions include:<p>- Fast charging: Yes, it is mimicking gas cars, but gas cars are great at that, so it is not a bad thing<p>- Huge batteries: The idea is to have enough range not to need en route recharging. Problem is, batteries are heavy and expensive<p>- An internal combustion engine: Purists don&#x27;t like it, but it can be a good compromise for many people<p>- Battery swapping: it has been suggested, Tesla even did a demo, but it doesn&#x27;t seem practical<p>If you don&#x27;t consider it a problem because &quot;EVs are different&quot;, then EVs will never replace gas cars. And replacing gas cars with EVs as much as possible is exactly what we want.')
