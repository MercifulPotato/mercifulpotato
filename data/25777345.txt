A more common view in rural areas where you can be quite far from community&#x2F;govt. services. After seeing months of property rights violations by large groups of people doing the same&#x2F;similar in D.C. seems reasonable. Itâ€™s simple trespassing on govt. property. If someone does something malicious there should be repercussions for them but nearly everyone just trespassed.')
