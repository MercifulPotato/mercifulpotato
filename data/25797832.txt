One of the big difficulties with releasing macOS challenges is that not everyone or every team has access to macOS (unlike, say, Linux which is freely available). <i>In principle</i>, contestants could have reversed it by piecing together scattered bits of documentation from the web; in practice, it&#x27;s a lot easier to debug and reverse with the actual runtime in hand. I was sincerely impressed that several teams were able to solve it by reversing the AppleScript VM.<p>For future competitions featuring macOS problems, we&#x27;ll probably rent a cloud Mac for the duration of the contest (24-48h) and give contestants gated access to it, to remove that particular handicap.')
