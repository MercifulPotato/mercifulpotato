There are certain parts of the US employment market that effectively pay software developers many times what they&#x27;d earn in most of the world doing the same job. A new graduate might be earning more in those places than a senior at a good company in much of Europe, and an order of magnitude more than developers in some countries. How are you going to convince all employers everywhere to match that standard, when it would cost them a huge amount and they can just hire through someone else in their local market instead, and when that wouldn&#x27;t take into account the local cost of living, rules and expenses for international hires, etc?')
