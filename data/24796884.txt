This was back sometime before COVID lockdowns started and since then we&#x27;ve deployed it, along side Consul and Vault, to run our new internal production metrics&#x2F;code coverage services.<p>Given we have committed to it, I&#x27;ve closely followed and have participated in it&#x27;s development (in the form of a documentation contribution as well as assisting with a few issues related to the CSI implementation) and definitely believe the products development is moving much faster than it had been.<p>Keep in mind, Cloudflare is now using Nomad in (almost?) all of its data centers and Roblox has built out it&#x27;s game server infrastructure using Nomad as it&#x27;s orchestrator too. Hashicorp would be insane to throw away a product being used at that kind of scale.')
