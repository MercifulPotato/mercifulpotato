I&#x27;ve legitimately had these conversations with people. It&#x27;s deeply saddening and outright fucked. They simply deny what was written into law.<p>Or they just throw out the “T” word and it’s all justified.<p>Honestly this is part of the reason I’m apprehensive about getting in the gun scene. I’d like to practice shooting and purchase a firearm for myself, but I absolutely despise spam and every store&#x2F;range I’ve looked at in the past years seems to buy into this sort of nonsense.')
