For the longest time the only way to race was as a solo driver. However, some of the biggest races in the world of real racing is endurance events where 3-4 people share a car over 24 hours. So iRacing added team races at some point. I&#x27;ve done a few things with data endpoints from iRacing, and it reveals a bit about how they did it.<p>Every driver has an ID. It&#x27;s just an integer sequentially increasing every time a new person joins the service. Teams, however, are the opposite. Every time a new team is created they are assigned a negative ID, perpetually decreasing as new teams are created. Because of this, an entry into a racing session can be handled by way of a single database column for both drivers and teams. Keep in mind that a racing session is either a &quot;driver session&quot; or a &quot;team session&quot; - you can&#x27;t have drivers and teams in the same session. You can, however, have teams with just one driver in them.<p>iRacing is a service that started development in 2004, using custom race simulation tech from ~2001, was released in 2008, and perpetually updated since then. The team is quite small, and has always been.<p>If there are any questions I have 6 years of experience of both racing and developing third-party tools for the service, and I&#x27;ll gladly share some knowledge if questions arise.')
