A couple of them have been covered extensively. The fact that you still believe them days later highlights your bias, or the bias of your news feeds.<p>What exactly has been debunked? That the Penn Judge ordered such that observers can up-close view the count? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;pennsylvania-judge-permits-campaign-observers-close-view-ballot&#x2F;story?id=74040279" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;pennsylvania-judge-permits-c...</a><p>Benford&#x27;s law is debunked? Could you provide a link disproving the law please?<p>Voting employees voting debunked? Not at all. It&#x27;s a real video. People are arguing that they were &#x27;fixing&#x27; damaged ballots. Which is allowed by the rules. Except let&#x27;s rotate back to the observers being placed a football field length away. This is not transparent. Obviously this is not &#x27;debunked&#x27; but AT BEST the argument is that it&#x27;s a completely non-transparent process that places huge doubt on the process.<p>I even provide the video showing the republicans having been thrown out of the vote counting building in Michigan. The windows were being covered up. You&#x27;re right, I have not provided any evidence at all showing fraud. Except that&#x27;s because they were thrown out. Blocking windows and blocking people from video recording the vote from outside is quite shifty. However, there&#x27;s clearly nothing debunked here. I provided the video that cant be debunked.<p>Wisconsin hasn&#x27;t been debunked. Wisconsin has an open observer policy meaning anyone can show up. Any amount of people could show up. They setup covid rules such that they basically couldn&#x27;t observe by placing them in a room and a livestream. I have provided no evidence of fraud, but that&#x27;s because the observers were blocked from doing their job.<p>So again you said most of my claims are debunked but they are inheritantly not debunkable. They aren&#x27;t even debatable, but they also don&#x27;t necessarily prove fraud occurred. You assert that it highlights my bias. Here&#x27;s the even more interesting thing, I&#x27;m not American. I&#x27;m not in the USA. I have no need for bias. I&#x27;m an objective viewer here.<p>You have projected your own feeling of bias. It sounds like your news has &#x27;debunked&#x27; these claims but it absolutely has not. You should take another look at your own echo chamber. Denying reality isn&#x27;t going to make the issue go away. The perception that the election was stolen is quite clear. It wasn&#x27;t Russian agents in Michigan cardboarding the windows.<p>In fact you should see that Michigan video restricting poll watchers from entering that building as election fraud by itself. Poll watchers dont need any nomination from a party. Everyone can be a poll watcher and legally are allowed to go in that building. It was entirely illegal for them to close those doors.')
