Bilateral&#x2F;multilateral &quot;free&quot; trade agreements are created to enable capital to move across borders while movement of people&#x2F;labor is limited or less privileged.<p>For example, you can relatively easily buy citizenship in the US, canada, most of europe, etc if you have enough capital. But if you are a person or worker, you have to jump through a lot more hoops to get citizenship in another country.<p>The world is capital-centric rather than people or labor centric.')
