They&#x27;re quite fast there, and it&#x27;s probably fairly easy to make a representation map and its inverse work well. (I will say that I don&#x27;t usually deal with quaternions other than in a linear-algebraic form when doing some robotics stuff, so maybe this is more of a pain than warranted!)')
