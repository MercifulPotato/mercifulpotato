Nowadays it&#x27;d be an AI-sorted list that attempts to filter with a search bar, the list would fit four items per page because it insists on showing you pictures of hard drives, and it&#x27;d be paginated at some absurdly small number of results per page (or infinite scroll).<p>That said, I disagree with its FAQ claiming whitespace and color wouldn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;d be a lot easier to actually read the data with a light alternating row color, slightly more vertical spacing, and not styling the links as a wall of underlined blue text.')
