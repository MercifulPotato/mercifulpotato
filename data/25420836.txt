If you think of your _actual_ living communities, you might know your neighbor, and you  might communicate with them about things when you see them. You might feel fondly towards them (of course, you might not). With these online forums, that doesn&#x27;t really happen (ignoring celebrity accounts). It seems rare to remember someone&#x27;s username and&#x2F;or communicate with them frequently or outside of the forum itself.<p>I think if you are seeking community as I described above, HN and Reddit are fundamentally not about that thing. Maybe I&#x27;m in the minority, or maybe that&#x27;s not how other people think, but it&#x27;s definitely how I&#x27;ve used and seen others use Reddit&#x2F;HN over the past decade.')
