The opposition claims the election was rigged, the court dismisses these claims, and the government uses the law against inciting violence to silence and or jail the opposition. And it is nearly impossible to prove that the elections in the whole were rigged - in the best case they have a proof on a number of episodes that total in, let&#x27;s say, 100k of votes, but that still doesn&#x27;t prove the overall result is falsified.')
