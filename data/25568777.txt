For several days, my short term memory was really hampered.<p>I also have a former colleague who had a period where he smoked a lot and went through shampoo at a crazy rate, because even after sleeping a good 9 hours, he&#x27;d wake up and shower and by the end of his shower be unable to remember if he&#x27;d already washed his hair.  He&#x27;s pretty sure he was washing his hair an average of 3 to 4 times per shower.')
