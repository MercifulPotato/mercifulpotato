D-Wave, Google, Alibaba, and others already have quantum chips. The disinformation agents claim that “quantum computers don’t exist” which is true because nobody uses a computer to break crypto, they use specialized custom chips.<p>All ECC (X25519-P521) will be broken by private sector quantum chips before RSA-2048 due to the physical limitations of stabilizing qubits.<p>The people making false claims against RSA are either being paid or they are useful idiots.')
