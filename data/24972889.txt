Even if you write it in double bold and highlight it in orange and make everybody signing read it out loud first, you can&#x27;t enforce terms that aren&#x27;t legal.<p>For example, in the US I believe it&#x27;s pretty common for renters to be obliged to pay for or fix up normal dilapidation of the property when they leave. But in the UK it&#x27;s <i>illegal</i> to require that for residential property. If you rent out houses in the UK, you&#x27;re going to be paying to repaint them every few years, replace worn carpets, and so on, because the law says the tenant doesn&#x27;t pay, and if you add a clause saying &quot;Actually the tenant agrees to pay anyway&quot; the law says your lease acts exactly as if you didn&#x27;t add that clause <i>except</i> now you also lose the right to get courts to enforce your lease because it was illegal <i>and</i> you lose certain other protections because clearly you&#x27;re an abusive landlord. So bad luck you made things harder on yourself.')
