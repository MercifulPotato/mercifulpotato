We somehow had the right leaders show up at the right time:<p>* George Washington not only lead the country to independence, but more importantly, he resigned after 8 years as President, when he could have easily been King for life.<p>* Abraham Lincoln who saw America through her darkest time when brother was literally killing brother on the field of battle. He kept the country together and also ended slavery.<p>* Franklin Roosevelt: Kept the country from being split apart by the Great Depression by pushing the New Deal and successfully led America through WWII<p>* Harry Truman: Ended WWII, and laid the foundation for 70 years of peace in Western Europe by establishing the Marshall Plan, rebuilding Europe and Japan, and instead of returning to isolation, committing the United States as the champion of the international order.<p>The United States has seen many dark days, and we have pulled through. I have confidence that we will pull through this current crisis as well.')
