They function just as English magistrates&#x2F;county courts. I&#x27;m not sure how the separation of power has anything to do with these local judiciary. If you talk about corruption that&#x27;s a different issue.<p>For me if these courts are exercising their judicial power legally and properly then we at least have a working civil legal system (not &#x27;none&#x27;). There are unfair cases with international concerns but it&#x27;s not unique to China. I don&#x27;t think a majority of the local courts in China are malfunctioning or abusing power. If you have evidence to back your claim up I&#x27;m happy to read that.')
