Even if there are inappropriate test cases or something in the repo, or if they’re correct that youtube-dl bypasses DRM in violation of a different part of the DMCA, it’s still not a valid takedown because GitHub isn’t hosting anything the RIAA&#x2F;those it represents own the copyright to. The correct way to do this is to go after the lead youtube-dl developer(s) and&#x2F;or GitHub for facilitating infringement or whatever, but I don’t think RIAA wants to do that because they probably don’t have much&#x2F;any legitimate grounds for legal claims against them, so they abuse the DMCA to look like they’re doing something.<p>Edit: for a more concrete picture of what happens next, read GitHub’s DMCA policy.[2] Basically youtube-dl can file a counter notice assuming they disagree with the claims, after that the RIAA has 10-14 days to get a court order or the repo goes back up.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torrentfreak.com&#x2F;github-reinstates-popcorn-time-code-despite-mpa-threat-200520&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torrentfreak.com&#x2F;github-reinstates-popcorn-time-code...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;dmca-takedown-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-...</a>')
