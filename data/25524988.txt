If that were the case, then how about if the .org registry were turned over to a non-profit that was solely and strictly dedicated to running the registry responsibly and affordably?  Is creating such a non-profit feasible?  Could it survive over the long term?<p>For that matter, how much does running a TLD registry with a few million domains actually cost?  To me, the whole domain name registration business reeks of rent-seeking and of the exploitation of monopolies, but I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know enough about it yet to confirm these suspicions.')
