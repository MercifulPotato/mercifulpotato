From those stories I learned so much about humanity, even though they are &#x27;lighter&#x27; versions of the tales the very real consequences in the endings had an outsized impact on how I treated the world around me. Also, the Hans stories are a great example of showing kids that sometimes it&#x27;s just pure dumb luck that people succeed and that has no bearing on the inherent worth of the person. I still have the copy I read as a kid plus a beautiful hardcover edition. They are books I treasure and go back to in a similar way that I peruse my philosophy books.')
