Ethernet has a minimum packet size, which is around the length of a line. The whole poem is short enough that you can remember it, but long enough that seeing a duplicate line would give you a good idea of having a network loop (possibly with delay) or having a second sender that started at an offset (although, maybe there&#x27;s some ID information in the packet before the text begins).<p>This poem seems cute and memorable, and unlikely to offend any censors, and may have been available under a permissive license?')
