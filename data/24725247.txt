I think the specification can be, but the API code itself is a mechanical translation of the specification into computer code. Note that abstractions, names, etc are conceived in the specification and are then translated into computer code. Even if you skip the specification step, as sometimes is done, you&#x27;re then dealing with an implicit, ad-hoc specification.<p>Edit: To clarify what I&#x27;m saying, the &quot;creative design&quot; aspect of what you&#x27;re talking about and that I&#x27;m in no way denying, is meant to be protected via the <i>patentability</i> and not the <i>copyrightability</i> of the end product. The creativity is in the behavior not in the mechanical translation of the behavior for computers to use.<p>&gt; APIs aren&#x27;t just restricted simple functions and types. Some may involve the creation of a custom DSL to make it easy to declare functionality in part of your system, or clusters of protocols that work together in very specific ways so users can implement a complex system atop them<p>Indeed. Yet you&#x27;re still describing behavior here. A DSL is an example of a specification of one language in terms of another. This is a creative work, I strongly agree! The difference is where does the creativity reside? I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s in the API code, but in the specification whether written or unwritten and therefore implied.')
