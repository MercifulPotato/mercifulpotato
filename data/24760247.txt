Some ideas:  Crash recovery is faster without an UNDO phase.  Accessing data that has been modified many times since you took your snapshot may be slower if you have to walk back in time through multiple hops to find the right version of each tuple (compared to the regular heap, which also has to step over lots of dead tuples in that case but can do so sequentially).  There may be space management problems when there are too many active transactions interested in a page.  There may be microscopic overheads that show up in some workloads that don&#x27;t benefit from updating in place, perhaps because they are insert&#x2F;delete-only.<p>I guess both options would be good to have, and it&#x27;s interesting that recent SQL Server can do it both ways at the user&#x27;s option (see &quot;Accelerated Database Recovery&quot;, something that sounds conceptually a bit like PostgreSQL vacuum instead of ARIES style rollback where you have to undo changes).')
