That is what I was addressing.<p>But, yes, since you bring it up, I don&#x27;t believe stop-and-frisk is compelling data for systemic racism. And your appeal to common knowledge is a logical fallacy.<p>As Bloomberg said, there are ethnic&#x2F;racial groups that are responsible for a dramatically disproportionate share of the crime in NYC. (By the way, the victims of those crimes are almost always within the same ethnic group as the perpetrator) This is especially true of violent crimes and crimes involving guns. So how do you get those guns off the street and protect people? Make it clear to the individuals who carry guns and are at risk of committing guns crimes that they <i>will</i> be caught if they are carrying (via stop-and-frisk).<p>I often wonder, for people who object so vociferously to things like stop-and-frisk, do they really think the hassle of getting stopped by a police officer exceeds the risk to the lives of people of color?')
