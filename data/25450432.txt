There were &quot;only&quot; about 8k total confirmed deaths in the US at that time. That was ~300k deaths ago.<p>They had it wrong for a few weeks, okay. But they changed their guidelines, and there was new data showing the efficacy of wearing masks(at least the combination of the masks and the social behavior they encourage), and they have stuck to those guidelines for nearly 8 months now.<p>I&#x27;m honestly amazed how long people are being hung up on that single, one-way change in guidelines during the early weeks. It&#x27;s unfortunate the guidelines didn&#x27;t come sooner. But looking at the timeline, where we were then, and where we are now.. The totality of it all.. IDK, it&#x27;s weird seeing people constantly bringing it up and blaming public health official. Especially considering what the messaging from non-health public officials has been over the past 8 months and 300k deaths.')
