Pay down their bills or add to their investments or whatever. Or even if they don&#x27;t need the money, just adding it to the bank account and forgetting about it will often be the default action, even if some suggestion came with it. But then it&#x27;s just a drop in the bucket, and they don&#x27;t really get to experience the pleasure of a gift. The nice thing about a gift card is that they have to spend it, and so they can&#x27;t feel guilty for doing so.<p>That said, some people might genuinely not want&#x2F;need anything, and so might be happier with a token cash gift specifically because it doesn&#x27;t create a responsibility to go buy something! I expect those people are in the minority though.')
