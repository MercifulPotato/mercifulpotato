Even when people in the UK should be celebrating, as literally the first country in the world to develop an approved C19 vaccine in record breaking time, and enjoy the privilege of a free health system that can roll it out within _weeks_ they still find a way to twist it. Asking them to truly recognise the fact that there indeed exists big differences between the UK and much of the world in this respect will fall on deaf ears - it doesn&#x27;t serve their purpose - which to be clear, isn&#x27;t truth-telling or (heaven forbid expressing pride in their national achievements) it&#x27;s a habit of personal advancement at the expense of others and dissolving their own culture in an acid bath of manifold criticism. It&#x27;s only where this sort of criticism is expressed in forums with international readers, many in far less fortunate positions, does it begin to reveal itself for the pathology that it is.')
