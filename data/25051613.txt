I am getting the idea that many people who are strong in STEM are not thinking in a verbal manner, but using a kind of visual mode of thinking, being able to create complex structures in their mind without having to rely on words. This modes of thinking are not based on &#x27;if&#x27;, &#x27;and&#x27;, and &#x27;then&#x27; lines of verbal reasoning. (It has long been an opinion that thinking and reasoning cannot be done without language, which of course is not true.)')
