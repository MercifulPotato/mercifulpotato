Low cost of entry, generate revenue early in lifecycle thus a strong basis for bootstrapped&#x2F;organic growth, relatively straightforward sell cycle, lots of opportunity for growth and new market exploitation (e.g. expand from consulting to managed services or SaaS once revenue supports it).  I&#x27;ve started several such companies, and it was fun and profitable.<p>The only people who call a business idea &quot;bad&quot; solely because it doesn&#x27;t enable &quot;hockey stick growth and massive revenue per employee numbers&quot; are people who&#x27;s business world view is so constricted that the only possible &quot;good&quot; business is a SV ideal, VC funded, growth at all cost model.  That isn&#x27;t the only way to do it.')
