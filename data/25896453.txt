Reading scratched blocks means sometimes it might work, sometimes it might not.  lets say 1% of the time you get a good read.  If the ECC block is 16k and you always read in 16k blocks, if you get that 1% magic time that the read succeeds, you got the whole block. If however, you read 2k blocks, you need to have the same luck 8x times.<p>From experience of recovering bad DVDs and BRs, there were discs I had to pass through 100+ times to get a valid read on all blocks.<p>This is also because, the underlying hardware will always do a full ecc block read (only way for it to determine that it read the block correctly, to read whole block and verify it), so any smaller reads are pointless.')
