Apple kept using Core 2 processors in their low-end models long after the first generation Core i3&#x2F;i5&#x2F;i7 parts were introduced, because Apple had standards for GPUs. Intel wouldn&#x27;t let NVIDIA make chipsets with integrated graphics any more, so Apple mostly kept using older Intel CPUs paired with decent NVIDIA integrated graphics until Intel&#x27;s integrated graphics was almost good enough.<p>(There have been other times where I&#x27;ve seen Apple widely accused of running behind on CPU updates, but only from people who aren&#x27;t good at matching CPU models to the right product segment. Criticizing Apple for not using the latest generation yet in a product that uses 28W or 45W CPUs while the latest generation is only shipping 15W parts was never valid criticism.)')
