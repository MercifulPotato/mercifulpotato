There&#x27;s no need for a developer account, or any other external party. And there are no issues with legacy support either, because ARM Mac binaries didn&#x27;t exist until now (and the requirement does not apply to Intel apps being run via Rosetta).<p>This really isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>I was initially worried that mandatory code signing would prevent me from hex editing binaries (which is a thing I do sometimes), but I recently learned that codesign can replace a binary&#x27;s existing signature. So even that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.')
