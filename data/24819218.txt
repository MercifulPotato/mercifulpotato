I&#x27;m a huge fan of Rust&#x27;s tooling, but when it&#x27;s so easy to add dependencies, this inevitably leads to deep dependency trees, slower compile times, and less knowledge about what&#x27;s actually happening inside most rust code bases.  Often times when asking about how to solve a problem in Rust, the answer comes in the form of &quot;use crate X&quot; rather than an explanation of how to solve the problem using the language itself.')
