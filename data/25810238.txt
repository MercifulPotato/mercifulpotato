There&#x27;s a rubber grommet which protects the cable as it enters the plug from extreme and repeated bending.<p>For supposed aesthetics, Apple don&#x27;t include this, and their cables fray easily.<p>(This is based on my experience managing hardware for a small organization, &lt;50 staff. After about 5 years, Apple laptops come back with damage to the shiny screen from rubbing against the keyboard, and usually a wrecked power supply cable. Sometimes we have to replace the PSU within the 5 years. The rest of the laptop is usually in good condition, i.e. the case, keyboard, ports.<p>Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;Lenovo&#x2F;etc business laptops come back with the cables in good condition, the matt screens suffer less even with similar keyboard marks, but the cases usually look a bit scruffy. Depending on usage, we might have replaced the battery after ~3 years, which is either easily done by the user, or takes 5 minutes with a normal screwdriver to remove the back case.)')
