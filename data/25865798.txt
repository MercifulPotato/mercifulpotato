Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25865947], score=None, time=1611270079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865412, text='&gt; Literally Emamnuel Macron and Angela Merkel have spoken out about the arbitrary &#x27;banning&#x27; of groups and individuals, and because there is an &#x27;imminent consideration over here in the US&#x27; doesn&#x27;t abnegate our broader concerns about arbitrary banning.<p>This is somewhat amusing to me, as Germany is a country that bans neo-Nazi political parties and makes Holocaust denial a federal crime, whereas both actions are seen as violations of constitutionally-protected free speech in the US.<p>The concern, I suspect, is more over the scope of power that private broadcast platforms have, to which my retort is to ask what their antitrust regulators have been doing for the past decade.')
