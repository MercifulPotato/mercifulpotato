In many ways, if they see enough of you to be intimidated then they can see enough of you to kill you.  The f-35 wants to make the kill before the target even realizes it is in danger, let alone sees the aircraft comming.  I doubt Sun Tzu would have encouraged his spies or saboteurs to stand out from the crowd.')
