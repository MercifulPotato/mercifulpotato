However I believe too that dictating to a company what speech they can have or can&#x27;t have on their platform is a violation of free speech in itself. It is their right to disagree with someone&#x27;s opinion and to deny them access to their platform. If we disagree with that action we punish with our eyeballs, or our wallets or we build our own.<p>That these platforms are so huge is a problem for sure but doesn&#x27;t automatically classify them as institutions owned by the public. There are other ways to deal with companies that get too big.')
