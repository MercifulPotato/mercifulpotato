This free version will always remain free. Unless you are sharing, the passwords&#x2F;notes&#x2F;pictures you store are encrypted and stored on your own device (it uses your iCloud storage for backup if you have it on). That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t incur a huge cost so we are able to keep this version free. However, we are planning to introduce premium features in the future so we follow a freemium business model. We will update the FAQs so it is more clear.')
