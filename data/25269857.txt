Usually they&#x27;re asleep by 9 but there have definitely been days where they are up and fighting until well past 10. Certainly the gp was exaggerating, but just because my kids are in bed doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s my time. 8-9 is lost policing actually being in bed almost every day.<p>That said, I agree more with you, because as much as I like to say, &quot;oh I could be doing x or y if I weren&#x27;t caring for my kids,&quot; in reality, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be doing much differently. Maybe I&#x27;d go out a few more times a month, but oops pandemic.')
