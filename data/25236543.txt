Item(by='pfranz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606556304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235633, text='&gt; It is solely so that people can include a shortcut to &#x2F;Applications and style the dmg window background with a bitmap that alludes to dragging to install?<p>I believe so. The first app I checked, DaisyDisk, distributes as a zip file. Like you said, most often people distribute dmg and it&#x27;s to give hints to drag it into &#x2F;Applications. I really like the .app system, but always found the UX of download, unzip&#x2F;open DMG, drag to &#x2F;Applications as very awkward. I figure Apple stopped caring about that when they added the Mac App Store in 2011.')
