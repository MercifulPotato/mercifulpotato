Try to live as healthy as you can: unprocessed food, drink mostly water, avoid stimulants, exercise, regular sleep, limit screen time, etc. But don&#x27;t obsess over any of it. Thinking about it, analyzing every sleepless night, bad feeling and chest pain is not healthy at all. I&#x27;ve been there and know other people who have. It starts as a normal concern over one&#x27;s health but it can become an obsession and a downward spiral. Nowadays I rely on other people in my life to observe from outside if there&#x27;s obviously something changed about me that might require action.<p>Obviously the opposite extreme exists as well: people who are in terrible health condition and don&#x27;t even notice. So again, self evaluation is not very good.')
