Can&#x27;t I judge Facebook for being a privacy violating nightmare even though I&#x27;ve never had an account with them?<p>As for your other comments: I know what CI is; I use it daily! The way my CI runs (which is how most CI is!) is that a when a commit gets pushed a machine gets spun up to build it, then a few minutes later it shuts itself down once the compilation is complete. Why would I want to pay to have a Mac for an entire day in this scenario? I&#x27;d have to be pushing code every few minutes to have any hope of efficiently using <i>one</i> machine.<p>And believe me, I hate cross-platform garbage apps just as much as you do. But I am not in favor of putting arbitrary restrictions on how people can write their apps. Xcode used to be a soft-requirement to build apps and look how well that worked out: native developers have to stick with it all the time, even when it&#x27;s acting up and being buggy, and developers who couldn&#x27;t care less have reverse engineered it to the point where they either generate an Xcode project from a source tree and build from the command line, or they just package their own app bundle themselves with the magic bits that Xcode would usually apply. Trying to stop people from making garbage apps by limiting their tooling options rarely works. And, in fact, I personally know people who go services like MacStadium (VNCing in) to use Xcode for the couple days it takes to set up a build system with the right certificates and profiles, then they never touch a Mac ever again. It&#x27;s the native developers with their own Macs who want to use a fresh machine to build their code for Mojave or something that they aren&#x27;t running on their personal computers.')
