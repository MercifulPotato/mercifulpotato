Real-world benchmarks instead show what can be realistically observed. The upper bound benchmarks are still useful, just in a different way.<p>For example: these benchmarks show that under excessive load (as benchmarks do), the M1 is <i>capable</i> of out-performing Intel chips at something like 1&#x2F;3 the energy usage. No matter how you slice it, that is an impressive achievement and shows what M1 could potentially do for the most perfectly optimized software.<p>Realistically, of course, software will not attain this. But having the upper bound lets software writers know what to aim for and when it&#x27;s not worth pushing for extra performance.')
