High Gs?<p>Perhaps something more like...?<p>1. Fly to coastal airport with SpX marine terminal.  Board high-speed passenger ferry.  Security, immigration, and luggage processing on board.<p>3. Disembark.  Board Starship.  (Maybe motion-compensated gangways? [1] - fun tech)<p>4. Few Gs acceleration.<p>5. Fall to destination.  A comfort challenge - limiting head motion helps a lot.<p>6. Brief couple of Gs.  It&#x27;s only ~100 m&#x2F;s terminal velocity.<p>7. Disembark.  Similar ferry.<p>9. Leave airport marine terminal.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=latTbgwdywo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=latTbgwdywo</a>')
