Item(by='rudasn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604333272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969348, text='&gt; It often requires an entire ops team to manage and deploy a Kubernetes based application [...]<p>So what&#x27;s wrong with that? At what scale are you operating that requires kubenretes but cannot budget for a team to handle the operations? In what other industries are operations so undermined? As much as we&#x27;d like to believe it, this stuff is not yet commoditised in the same way as having an Internet or telephone connection.<p>&gt; [...] while deploying a unikernel to Google Cloud with today via ops is merely a series of two commands and it will be running within two minutes.<p>Deployment is not even half the problem. The real issues are maintenance and upkeep. I&#x27;m not saying kubenretes is easy to maintain (I can&#x27;t speak to that), but introducing other tools without addressing the real issues seems odd.')
