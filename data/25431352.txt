Something that&#x27;s actually reliable and not propaganda itself? It seems extremely difficult to be able to differentiate between an ad letting people know that a product exists and it directly influencing your decision. Or you could consider letting people know about the product existing as influencing the person, but then it&#x27;s hard to argue that ads are actually bad.<p>Thinking out loud, I would be curious to see a study on people who play &#x27;Loot Box&#x2F;Gacha&#x27; style games. Include both people who have been playing for a while, as well as people who &#x27;start&#x27; playing during the study. Include non-players.<p>Measure their other &#x27;vice&#x27; behaviors (i.e. Drinking alcohol, nicotine, real gambling, gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, etc.) over the same time.<p>My hypothesis is that in those who are introduced to Gacha games, you will see an increase in other &#x27;addictive&#x27; behavior, because the content they see will whittle away at their resistance to other addictive behaviors.')
