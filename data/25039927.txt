On my system with my compiler version it&#x27;ll print xyz without any optimization, but if I use -O3 optimization it prints nothing. But it could just as easily segfault or print garbage from memory.<p>Edit: If I move the first line into a function and return that string_view, then with optimizations it still prints nothing, but without optimizations it prints random varying garbage each time I run it, different each time.')
