We can reasonably assume that, _on average_, the older people are, the less they care about other people&#x27;s opinions. The age after which these effects are noticeable is not immutable since the dawn of times, but depends on when people have kids, are expected to retire, etc. For example, I expect the age at which one cares less to be later in life now that three decades ago, when people at 40 were already considered way past their prime. I mean, for the generation of my parents, physical activity after they turned 18-20 was for wealthy people or &quot;eccentrics&quot;.<p>Second, it depends very much on what is settled for the person or what is still fluid. If someone has a family or has reached of the &quot;peace of the senses&quot;, they are already caring much less about the major source of frustration (much more than source of joy) and status-seeking behavior for most people: sex. If somebody has also given up on practicing sports (or any king of competitive hobby), put up the classic 40 pounds more at 40 years old, they care even less about others. Lastly, hormones change, testosterone in men visibly drops, women start getting into menopause.   \nAnd then it depends on personality (see the point above about variation), there are people who are still combative in the status game at 80 and others who have given up at 21.<p>In synthesis, it is not that older means wiser and thus the &quot;who cares what other people think&quot; comes from a place of introspection (between us: sex is incredibly pleasurable), but more simply that hormonal changes, &quot;giving up&quot; (sex, competition) put people, sooner or later, on the bench of life: spectators, more than players.')
