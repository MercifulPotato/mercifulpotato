At that time the person didn&#x27;t even knew how many members the EU had (Croatia was just admitted) and they were pretty open that they are not really interested to know. When I&#x27;ve been to the UK, two years earlier, a bus driver that I talked to was afraid that eastern europeans will come and take his job. I perfectly well know the UK relationship with the EU, but trust me when I tell you that giving some numbers does not reflect reality. Maybe because the UK considered itself a winner in WWII and wasn&#x27;t ruined from it like France and Germany, or maybe because of Soros and black Wednesday, or for whatever reason,but Brittan was never a cornerstone of the EU the way France and Germany are, which is the thing the GP was trying to imply and I definitely disagree.')
