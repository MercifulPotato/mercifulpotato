Within 30 seconds of the alarm, halls where filled with choking smoke.<p>I managed to exit without too much difficulty, but even with covering my face with my shirt, I was still coughing and black gunk coming out my nose for the rest of the day. Others needed oxygen support even after being in the smoke for minutes at most.<p>If you’re ever in a house or building when an alarm goes off, don’t think you have time to ponder the situation... just move outside to safety immediately.<p>Edit: Found some photos from that day.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.boston.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;massachusetts&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;120806Fire1Broadway&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.boston.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;massachusetts&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;1...</a>')
