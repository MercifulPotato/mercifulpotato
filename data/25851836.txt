Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611175936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25850731, text='I can&#x27;t speak to the mobile&#x2F;desktop distinction, but comparing &quot;watching Netflix in Firefox on my desktop&quot; with &quot;watching Netflix on my LG WebOS TV&quot;, there&#x27;s barely any difference. If anything, the browser version wins because of the superior input devices (kbd, mouse) attached to it compared with the TV. This suggests to me that there would be little difference when comparing mobile&#x2F;desktop or app&#x2F;browser, other than the netflix logo being the point of entry (and if you could run the SPA literally like an app, no difference at all).')
