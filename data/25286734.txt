A language is nothing more than a hammer or a saw. PHP is just like the other languages you mentioned very mature. It&#x27;s up to the developer to make good furniture. Entirely different skillset and not linked to a language.\nI have seen low level drivers for hardware written in PHP operating for over 15 years. I have seen JavaScript used in a medical device. \nYou sound like that creepy negative &#x27;you don&#x27;t wanna hire&#x27; developer complaining about everything you have never worked with. \nA good developer generally appreciates most technologies.')
