When the discussion is controlled by a certain subset of that population, usually via comments, submissions and voting, that subset tends to self-select and alienate alternative viewpoints.  Participants are rewarded with a sense of validation for things that appeal to the group but aren&#x27;t necessarily true or accurate(or humane, fair, respectful, etc).<p>I think this topic needs a whole lot more analysis and public debate as more and more opinions are solidified in these balkanized communities.  I quit reddit over these issues and am hanging on to HN by a thread.  At this point I&#x27;d rather pay to hear opinions and analysis of experts than be influenced by, and participate in, internet echo chambers.')
