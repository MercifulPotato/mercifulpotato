In my first year programming I asked my boss so many questions that he actually got pissed once and lost his cool on me, but that went right over my head. Nobody will fire you because you are asking for more detail around something or wanting to know why or how something works. \nBut you will def lose pts with managers if you don&#x27;t finish projects on time. Just ask those questions and finish your work ahead of time :)')
