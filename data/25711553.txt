I&#x27;m curious about how you acquired this knowledge?<p>How did you determine their intent to shoot a congressman? Which congressman was targeted? How detailed were their plans to shoot a congressman? How did you uncover their plans?<p>On the death: did this person start having a heart attack, and then their gun went off and that was the cause of death? How did you determine the sequence&#x2F;cause of death for this individual? Were you present? Or read it on the internet? If internet, what site(s) did you use?<p>Sorry for all the questions, just naturally interested in different epistemological standards people have!')
