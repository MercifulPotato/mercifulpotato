I was writing in a casual discussion forum about what I am currently doing in the middle of a global public health crisis that has killed 2 million people, mostly needlessly. So yes, I&#x27;m going to write clearly and frankly.<p>And my moral condemnation for people is absolutely not cavalier. I actively and vigorously condemn the legion of assholes who think mild personal inconvenience is worse than mass death plus a much greater swathe of serious illness. I also condemn the societal moral failures that have impeded a sensible coordinated response, especially the politicians who, having created and sustained an underclass, now insist for ideological reasons that their suffering should be deepened while at the same time making the pandemic worse for everyone.  It&#x27;s both moral idiocy and moral obscenity. At best, it&#x27;s obliviousness or IGMFU. But more often, as Serwer wrote, &quot;The cruelty is the point.&quot;')
