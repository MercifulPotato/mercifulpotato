Eg if a piece of content has 3 upvotes, the cost to create another new upvote might be $0.07, but if the content as 100 upvotes, that cost might be $1.40.\nEqually at any point, you can &quot;sell&quot; your upvote at that same cost ($0.07 @ 3, $1.40 @ 100). The way the maths works out means that finances are conserved, so the investment return for selling comes from the market itselm.<p>In terms of rewards, I was thinking actual money, just in very small amounts. People love speculating on markets so i think it&#x27;s feasible.')
