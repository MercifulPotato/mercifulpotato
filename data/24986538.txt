DRM only gets legal force when it has the effect of controlling access to a copyrighted work. This has been court-tested: Lexmark v. Static Control Components proves that you cannot legally enforce DRM that does not control access to copyrighted works. You can&#x27;t copyright ink, ergo you can&#x27;t argue that ink DRM is protected by DMCA 1201.<p>That&#x27;s probably the only reason why DMCA 1201 would pass a strict scrutiny test at all - it&#x27;s evidence of narrow tailoring.<p>BTW, what you&#x27;re describing with treaties has a name: it&#x27;s called policy laundering.')
