That is, maybe, the first hour of a game that lasts many many dozens even hundreds of hours.  Mining only happens in the first five or ten <i>minutes</i>.  There are a host of other interactions, from tweaking object settings, optimizing pathing layouts, planning, direction of bots, to deployment of the factorio equivalent of Redstone circuitry.<p>And mods.  As with KSP or minecraft, a greater number of possible interactions comes from the modding community rather than the stock game.')
