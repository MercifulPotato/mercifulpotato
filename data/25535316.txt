Otherwise, there is usually not enough CPU available to perform all the DSP for a complex song. (Additionally, bouncing tracks to audio gives more control over fades, cross-fades, tails, etc.)<p>This blog post confuses me, because is he playing the VSTs live? Why not trigger bounced audio instead?')
