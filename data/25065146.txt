They could have easily stuck to demos using Final Cut like they often do, so this seems like a pretty good sign that from day 1 they do care about 3rd party software running well. They&#x27;ve also been showing more and more games which are obviously also performance sensitive. I fully expect Tensorflow models and other major libraries will be able to take native advantage of the Neural Engine in the near future as well.')
