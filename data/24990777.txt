A difference of 0.001 in probability means that the two events differ in their likelihood to occur by 1 in 1,000 trials.<p>&gt; OP pointed out intuitively why adding and subtracting probabilities in the linear scale don&#x27;t make sense (examples would be comparing 0.001 and 1 versus 0.500 and 0.499)<p>This is only intuitive if you have a misunderstanding of probability.<p>&gt; The proper interpretation of your Case 1 and Case 2 should be the ratio of heads and tails as you flip coins<p>This ratio is not relevant to anything.')
