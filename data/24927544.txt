Sounds like you never got past the rebellious teen phase. I often don&#x27;t see eye to eye with my parents (especially when religion takes part in many of their arguments), but there&#x27;s nothing wrong taking the extra effort to avoid seriously offending the people you care about. Though maybe you had horrible parents and that&#x27;s your justification for not putting them in the same category as wife and kids.<p>As for guys like Linus, his straight up brutally, abusively honest take on things has probably been good for the linux kernel, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it should apply to your day-to-day life (interactions with family, extended-family, neighbors, etc).')
