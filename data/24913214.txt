Item(by='sk5t', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603840934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905262, text='&gt;  Have you worked with any of the things you listed?<p>Yes, and I offer the (indeed rather scattered) list as a sampling of the formats and taxonomies one encounters--sometimes by essential need to code wildly different concepts like &quot;struck on head by tortoise&quot; vs &quot;lower back pain, moderate&quot; vs &quot;Lisinopril 5mg oral tablet&quot;, sometimes by separate efforts across time or geography or organization to do sort of the same thing.  From the outside it might seem a lot more tractable space than it is after you get into the weeds.<p>Although my time with HL7 v2 over the years amounted to probably less than 100 focused hours, it didn&#x27;t take long to encounter folks mangling the spec in ways HAPI rejects, mashing giant base64-encoded PDFs into ORU records, etc., and worst of all, using the &quot;flexibility&quot; of the records&#x2F;segments to ram through rubbish not aligned to any nomenclature.  Ugly pipehat serialization without schema or validation.  I&#x27;m sure someone with 10 years at MGH would have a very different impression, but this one is mine.')
