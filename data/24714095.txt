Be that manufacturing, interior materials or general care for UX. But those things matter far more to enthusiasts. Your average family owner cares more about all of Tesla&#x27;s positives.<p>This actually seems kind of backwards to me? Car enthusiasts -- at least the way I think of &quot;car enthusiast&quot; -- are the ones who prioritize acceleration, speed and handling to a point where they&#x27;re forgiving, at least to a point, of other flaws. Tesla also has a lot of tech enthusiast appeal, of course, and their best target market is right at the center of that Venn diagram.<p>However, I&#x27;d think &quot;average family owners&quot; are the kinds of folks who are way more likely to think that if they spent $60,000+ on a new car, that car should be as close to problem-free, and even maintenance-free, as realistically possible. They&#x27;re not prioritizing for under 4-second 0â€“60 speeds. I mean, they&#x27;ll also love the high safety ratings and trunk space, but if the car gets a reputation for reliability problems, they&#x27;re going to remember there&#x27;s a Volvo dealer next door.')
