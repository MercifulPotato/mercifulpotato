I know it costs me time and money to have to dispute charges, but I’ve never had to in 15 years of card usage, and the couple times my card number was attempted, the bank’s system had already flagged the transaction for me and asked me to verify.<p>Basically, I see no value in PayPal to be in a credit card transaction.  However, I wouldn’t do the same for an ACH&#x2F;debit card transaction.')
