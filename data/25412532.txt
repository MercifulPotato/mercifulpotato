Because of this, she would not be able to provide redress <i>&quot;Even assuming that Plaintiffs establish injury-in-fact and causation under this theory&quot;</i>.<p>This was one of the main reasons for the opinion.  There were other reasons (e.g. laches).  The issue of redress &#x2F; equal protection, however, was repeated several times in the judgement.<p>For the most part, the judgement does not address the actual claims being made.  Below is one of the few quotes where she does address the actual claims:<p>&gt; For example, the closest\n&gt; Plaintiffs get to alleging that physical ballots were altered in such a way is the\n&gt; following statement in an election challenger’s sworn affidavit: “I believe some of\n&gt; these workers were changing votes that had been cast for Donald Trump and other\n&gt; Republican candidates.”9<p>The above statement, as far as I can tell, is just factually not true.  The plaintiffs do allege that physical ballots were altered in a fraudulent way.  See the section: &quot;Election Officials Added Votes and Removed Votes from “OverVotes”.')
