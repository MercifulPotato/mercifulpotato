Instead, it disproportionately hurts Black<p>&gt; communities.<p>These drug infected communities still have serious problems, the Black community for example is far from out of the woods. Drug addiction needs to be recognized as a disease.<p>Given how much the US has been willing to spend on their war on drugs, I think they could better spend this money giving free help. (Hell, it could even be the start to a free healthcare program.)')
