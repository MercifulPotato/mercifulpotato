Every situation is different but if there aren’t buyers it just won’t work.<p>Interesting enough that the successful exit was because of astute cap table management. The founder was very ruthless about managing the cap table and negotiating to maintain a huge amount of equity, which turned into a fairly good exit for the founders &#x2F; execs &#x2F; early engineers despite a relatively low acquisition price. And the reason the acquisition happened at all was for IP rather than customers, so I guess even without strong product &#x2F; market fit a successful exit can still be accomplished if the founder is clever.')
