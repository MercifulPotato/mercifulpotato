This is called the &quot;one-stop shop mechanism.&quot;<p>If the Norwegian DPA is the one handling this case, probably that&#x27;s because Grindr&#x27;s EU operations are legally established in Norway. If they don&#x27;t have an &quot;establishment&quot; in the EU, then I think it&#x27;s up-for-grabs, and my gut is that NOYB would have preferred to file in France or Germany.<p>This is why GDPR actions against Facebook, Google, etc. all go through the (under-resourced) Irish DPA: US companies are all based there for tax reasons. It&#x27;s... becoming a problem.')
