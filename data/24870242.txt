There is no next iPhone. The iPhone was a once in a lifetime product. There were already 1 billion phones being sold a year when the iPhone was introduced - Jobs said he wanted to sell 10 million phones and capture 1% of the market. The smart phone (not the iPhone) has 70-80% penetration. What we call an electronic communication device thatâ€™s always connected may change, but there is no larger conceivable electronic market.<p>As much as HN poo poos the Apple Watch and the AirPods, from a technical standpoint it is much more innovative than the iPad - the last product that was introduced under Jobs. Once you have the iPhone, using the same technology in something with less constraints was easy. The Watch is just the oppposite.<p>From a financial standpoint. The Watch already produced more in revenue and profit than the iPod at peak. As does the AirPods.<p>Not to mention that Apple could have never shipped in volume without Cooks supply chain management expertise.<p>Then there are the upcoming ARM Macs that will probably be the fastest personal computers in the industry in a year or two. The $399 iPhone SE is already faster than any Android phone at any price.')
