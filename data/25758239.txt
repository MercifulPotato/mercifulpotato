Item(by='fpgaminer', descendants=None, kids=[25758282], score=None, time=1610512857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25757721, text='Honestly that AOC clip was just the first thing that popped in my head as an example of &quot;Why people don&#x27;t trust what Facebook says about their policies&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t really say that AOC oversimplifies the issue.  I doubt she was interested in an in-depth debate about political moderation with Mark.  Her drive was just to either elucidate the truth of Facebook&#x27;s policy, or show Facebook as deceptive.  Mark decided to dodge the question, so he ended up showing Facebook as deceptive.<p>Fact is, Facebook decided to go the no-moderation route.  That&#x27;s their right.  But they should stand behind that policy and the consequences of it.  A good CEO would&#x27;ve answered AOC by restating that they are not the arbiter&#x27;s of truth.  Not exactly that difficult of a response.  But Mark chose the worst, whishy-washy, slimy response probably because he didn&#x27;t put any points into his Speech skill and every other dialogue option was greyed out.  Either way, it makes Facebook look spineless and deceptive.  Hence why I used that clip to demonstrate why people are rightly skeptical of any suggestion that Facebook might be applying their policies consistently.<p>P.S.  The truth of it is perhaps deeper than that.  Facebook is taking the no moderation policy at least partly because of money (otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t give a shit).  Since they&#x27;ve done that it&#x27;s in their best interest that Congress _not_ provide guidance, because _any_ guidance will more likely than not require some amount of moderation.  And that means less ads, which means less money.  So really Mark&#x27;s non-answer was more about being willing to sacrifice Facebook&#x27;s image in exchange for continuing to muddy the discussion and promote inaction.  Any other answer, one way or the other, would have proved AOC&#x27;s point and given Congress further impetus to have a discussion about online political speech.<p>Or he really did forget to put points in Speech.<p>P.P.S.  Whatever one might think of Twitter, Jack Dorsey&#x27;s response during that whole fiasco was fucking superb, and relevant to the tangent we&#x27;re slightly on about political speech moderation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threadreaderapp.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;1189634360472829952.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threadreaderapp.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;1189634360472829952.html</a>  It really just sums up the issues nicely.  Again, regardless of how one may feel about Twitter or their decision there, that response is what I&#x27;d expect of a cogent CEO.')
