VPS providers with 1-button WordPress installs are dirt cheap. Netlify and GH pages are free.<p>It&#x27;s slightly easier to post stuff on something like lithub (or Facebook, Medium, etc.), but then how much does one really care about this if the excuse is that doing something about it is a minor inconvenience?<p>People want their cake and to eat it to. They want don&#x27;t just want to get read. They wanna get paid for it. Too bad the marginal value of any particular writer is about the same as it costs for hosting them. Zero. So we all get barraged with endless crap because fools still think writing essays online is a serious career path.<p>(The serious career path here is making middle brow YouTube video essays. Still questionable, but at least you might get paid.)')
