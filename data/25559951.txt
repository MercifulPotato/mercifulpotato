Item(by='smnrchrds', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609169690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559268, text='There was a research in Canada about hiring discrimination. One of those ones where they send mock resumes to employers with similar contents but different applicant names: some had English names, some had non-English (mainly Asian IIRC) names. Then they compare the number of callbacks they got from employers.<p>The result of this particular study was that: 1) the resumes with non-English sounding names had much fewer callbacks than the ones with English names. 2) the resumes with more education and experience got more callbacks than the results with less education and experience. 3) if you had a non-English name and a master&#x27;s, you almost but not quite, had the same rate of callback as someone with a bachelor&#x27;s and an English name.<p>I imagine some people see this and conclude that <i>skills beat racism</i>. But if the reality is that you have to get a PhD and a couple of years of extra experience under your belt to have the same chance of finding a job as an English Canadian who has newly graduated from good BSc, then this is not skills beating racism. The fact that some people have to do a lot of extra work for the same outcome is the epitome of discrimination.')
