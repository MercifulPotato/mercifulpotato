And if you think that, it is very simple: Abortion is taking a human life, i.e., killing a person. Then nothing else matters. We can bring up all social, economic, feminist, psychological, health, etc. arguments in the world, all in vain. We all agree that we don&#x27;t go around and kill people, so if you think that life starts at the conception, there&#x27;s nothing more to argue about.<p>So in this case, we disagree only about meaning. The only way to have fruitful discussion would be to talk about what we mean by a human life. Then I&#x27;m not sure that is possible when one side&#x27;s main argument is &quot;the Bible says so&quot;. But there&#x27;s nothing inconsistent or contradictory that could be resolved between the premises &quot;a human life starts at conception&quot; and &quot;taking a human life is always wrong&quot;, and the conclusion &quot;abortion is wrong&quot;.')
