This is neither a failing of their enthusiasm nor a social tactic, but an imbalance in their abilities.<p>An old anecdote is the professor who was asked by a student how a certain problem is solved. The professor paused in thought for a moments, then gave the answer. The student asked again how to solve it, and the professor, again, thought for a while and gave the answer.<p>The student persisted: &quot;but how is it done?&quot; To which the professor gave a frustrated look and said, &quot;I already solved it two different ways, what more do you want?&quot;')
