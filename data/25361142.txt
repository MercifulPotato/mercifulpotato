It&#x27;s unaffordable to low income families, even the cheapest plan, which still typically requires you spend $10k+ a year out of pocket before insurance covers anything. Additionally, Obama added penalties for not having health insurance (that Trump thankfully stopped, the only good thing he&#x27;s done I can think of) that financially cripple these families.<p>All you really need to look at is whether the insurance companies liked obamacare: they loved it. Because it was a great deal for them and at the expense of everyone else.<p>It did nothing to lower costs. It did raise the age limit to stay on your parent&#x27;s plan, disallowed pre-existing conditions exclusions, and made contraception more accessible though. Those could have been passed separately without trying (and failing) to overhaul the entire industry, which ultimately contributed to the ridiculous pricing we see today.')
