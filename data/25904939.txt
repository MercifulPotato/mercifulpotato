If one of my employees violated the ToS, even repeatedly, I expect to be told &quot;Get off our system.  We&#x27;re giving you x days to move elsewhere, and have restricted &lt;functions&gt; until such time&quot;.<p>An immediate and total shutdown with literally NO response from Support is so drastic that it would trigger a lawsuit if it were any other company.<p>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t in these cases is because it&#x27;s David vs Goliath, and the victim company is already too dead and broke to sue.<p>Hopefully some lawyers will file a class action against Google - I have a Google My Business account that was suspended without cause (no abuse) with zero response from support.')
