Managing our files is the whole point of file systems! It&#x27;s amazing how bad at it most of them are. Linux is still catching up with btrfs...<p>It&#x27;s extremely aggravating how most file systems can&#x27;t create a pool of storage out of many drives. We end up having to manually keep track of which drives have which sets of files, something that the file system itself should be doing. Expanding storage capacity quickly results in a mess of many drives with many file systems...<p>Unlike traditional RAID and ZFS, btrfs allows adding arbitrary drives of any make, model and capacity to the pool and it&#x27;s awesome... But there&#x27;s still no proper RAID 5&#x2F;6 style parity support.')
