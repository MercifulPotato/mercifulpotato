And if one country does everything on cost uber alles, it&#x27;s the US (as a brit we&#x27;re close behind). Chernobyl happened not because a well-built and well-run reactor unexpectedly went bad.<p>Incidentally, from same link: &quot;estimated death toll ranging from 85,600 to 240,000&quot; so your quote is towards the upper limit<p>Additionally, the death toll was again partly due to mismanagement:<p>&quot;For example, while only 827 out of 6,000 people died in the evacuated community of Shahedian just below Banqiao Dam, half of a total of 36,000 people died in the unevacuated Wencheng commune&quot;<p>So again the death toll could have been lower if people in charge hadn&#x27;t been stupid - but they were.')
