But the likes of CNN and MSNBC have been pushing their own fake news continuously for 4 years, pretending that the election had been stolen, that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, etc.<p>I think all of this is bad, but I refuse to accept that this is a bad behavior that just came up and is the monopoly of a single side of the political aisle.<p>All this is, is Youtube picking a side in this fight.<p>By the way, on the back of the David Fincher&#x27;s movie I re-watched Citizen Kane. I love the part where Kane&#x27;s newspaper prepared two alternative front pages the night of the elections: &quot;Kane elected governor&quot; and &quot;Massive fraud at the polls&quot;. 1942. Nothing new under the sun.')
