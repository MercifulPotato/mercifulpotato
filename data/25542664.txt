But it doesn&#x27;t take into account which part of sunlight would be usable (there will be an energy cutoff) and what efficiency at channeling sunlight photons onto the catalyst your setup will have.<p>Also, I&#x27;m missing the environmental conditions. If the process only works at &gt;9000MPa and &gt;9000K, it will be useless...')
