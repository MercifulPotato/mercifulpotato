If it&#x27;s not paired with an enterprise solution (Slack, Teams, Hangouts&#x2F;Allo&#x2F;Meet&#x2F;Whatever), it has to make money on ads or premium features (emotes, stickers, &quot;server boosts&quot;).<p>Google and Facebook are about to get reamed by the DOJ for anti-competitive practices, and I&#x27;ll wager that privacy is one of the talking points. If you can&#x27;t use chat to enhance your advertising moat, what then? Sticker sales can&#x27;t amount to <i>that</i> much, and ads without purchase intent or social graph knowledge are pretty low value.<p>I&#x27;m curious what people&#x27;s thoughts are.')
