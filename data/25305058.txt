Work in a place that you don&#x27;t normally use to relax when you would get home from work. Maybe a spare bedroom, maybe the kitchen with a stool.\n2. Start work on time, and keep your schedule as non-pandemic-y as possible. Don&#x27;t sleep in until a minute before work, but get up and pretend to do your commute. Make sure you make your coffee early, too.\n3. When your done work on the clock, STOP ANSWERING EMAILS&#x2F;SLACK&#x2F;WHATEVER IS WORK RELATED.

The biggest thing is people are afraid to say no, but in reality, if your boss asks you to do work after you&#x27;re done your day, either ask for overtime or don&#x27;t even answer it. It&#x27;s not your responsibility to work when you&#x27;re off the clock. If your work would force you to work after-hours even before the pandemic, then there are a few problems: the bosses don&#x27;t understand the work you do, they don&#x27;t respect your time, and&#x2F;or you enable them by working beyond your hours.')
