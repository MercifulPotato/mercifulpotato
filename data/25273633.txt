It feels like you&#x27;re using it wrong. In my experience, Slack is for conversations. The groups I&#x27;m in use it for tossing out random thoughts&#x2F;questions... and people participate as they choose.<p>If you&#x27;re using in a way where people are constantly pinging you demanding your attention, then you should change that. That&#x27;s no different than being in a large office and everyone else feeling free to just walk over to you and tap you on the shoulder every time they want something. If _that_ was happening, it would be something you should fix, too.')
