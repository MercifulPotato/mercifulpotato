My partner recently got into a heated debate with a pharmaceutical company she was working for because they wanted something added to their standards of care document for a rare genetic disorder they developed a therapy for.<p>She couldn&#x27;t find a study to backup the claims that the medical team wanted to make in the document, but the lead doctor said that if this wasn&#x27;t included, the patients would suffer and ultimately die.<p>So she said &quot;you need to prove this in a study so it can be included, otherwise you put the company at risk&quot;. To which the doctor said &quot;We could do that, but it would take 3-4 years, and in the mean time, the patients we&#x27;re caring for would go back home, the doctors would be missing the one key piece of advice, and then they&#x27;ll all suffer and die&quot;.<p>Science is slow. People are dying now.')
