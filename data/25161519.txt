It may be a name of a base type but it&#x27;s still a name. IIRC, you can&#x27;t even typeof() an instance of a Voldemort type.<p>That has some implications for how Voldemort types work that can&#x27;t be replicated with anonymous interface implementations. The main one is, Voldemort types are <i>very</i> thoroughly sealed. There is no way to create an instance of one outside of the function where it&#x27;s defined. With an interface, anyone else could come along and create their own implementation.')
