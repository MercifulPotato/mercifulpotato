Sure, not a lot of types unless you use Typed Racket, that&#x27;s true. I also don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t swap out Datalog with another constraint system, like that described in Monadic Constraints (Wadler, Stuckey, Sch-something).<p>I think the effect system is cool. How does Flix differ from Eff or Unison in this matter?')
