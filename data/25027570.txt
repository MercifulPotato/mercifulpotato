As a constant pattern of trumps presidency, he throws out a dog whistle and then walks it back 2 days later sayig he was taken out of context, misspoke, or was joking. You can claim he&#x27;s fighting against antisemitism and racism, but I just straight up don&#x27;t trust his good faith. My jewish eyes see him as supporting nazis and a supporter of those who walk with nazis. Him being a poor communicator is a lackluster excuse why I should trust him.<p>All those other good people walked under those nazi flags. Why would I trust them either?')
