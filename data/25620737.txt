Import&#x2F;export, Const&#x2F;let, arrow functions, async, and destructuring are the only really mainstays of the spec. The framework dependent development now days has left the current developer pool weak on constructing their own Class organization (but this might be a React specific problem). I don’t even really see scoped styles taking on the form of Class A extends B, we do weird stuff with hooks. The shift to hooks really put a damper on leveraging things developers already know how to reason about.<p>React not coming with a built in global store that’s easy to hit up really fucked with everyone’s natural ability to simply structure their code with stuff like Class, so it’s hard to just blame the es6 spec, the ecosystem is driving people in different directions. I was appalled how a simple API wrapper Class turned out to be the monstrous Redux action&#x2F;dispatch fiasco for example. Our most widely used frameworks don’t implement obvious stuff in obvious ways, so what can you expect from the rest of the community.<p>Async, again, another weird syntactic jury rig with try&#x2F;catch. Promise.then().fail() is so clear, but to each their own.')
