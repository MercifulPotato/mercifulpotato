I bought a few NEC displays cheap for my old office and the picture quality is excellent. Even the no-name OEM displays I bought second hand were acceptable with solid viewing angles and colour reproduction.<p>When my 15 year old Sony Bravia finally kicks the bucket I have my eye on a 55&quot; 4k Iiyama commercial display to replace it. I made the mistake of buying a 2015 Sony Bravia Android TV for upstairs and it is an utterly painful experience, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it in nearly 8 months now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iiyama-monitors.co.uk&#x2F;products&#x2F;monitors&#x2F;le5540uhs-b1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iiyama-monitors.co.uk&#x2F;products&#x2F;monitors&#x2F;le5540uh...</a>')
