I bought a few NEC displays cheap for my old office and the picture quality is excellent. Even the no-name OEM displays I bought second hand were acceptable with solid viewing angles and colour reproduction.<p>When my 15 year old Sony Bravia finally kicks the bucket I have my eye on a 55&quot; 4k Ilyama commercial display to replace it. I made the mistake of buying a 2015 Sony Bravia Android TV for upstairs and it is an utterly painful experience, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it in nearly 8 months now.')
