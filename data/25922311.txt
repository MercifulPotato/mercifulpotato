It has to be, because the people on the opposite side have an identical view, only with the high-order political bit flipped. That is, they&#x27;re wrong in an exactly symmetrical way. Here&#x27;s a tasteâ€”there are many more where these came from:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25427915" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25427915</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25615692" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25615692</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25779614" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25779614</a><p>In reality, HN is divided on any topic that is divisive in society at large, including all the variations across the different countries represented here. That&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of variation.<p>Once you get over seeing both $X and anti-$X users pronounce HN to be an &quot;echo chamber&quot; controlled by their opponents, it&#x27;s a bit of a puzzle how that is even possible. How can people come up with 100% opposite views of exactly the same thing?<p>I think these false feelings of generality are generated by the mind because the comments one dislikes make a much stronger (and more painful) impression on it than anything one likes or agrees with. The more one dislikes those, the more pain they cause, and the mind responds by creating an image, almost like an organ might secrete a membrane to protect itself. This explains both why these views are so identical (except for the high-order bit) and why they&#x27;re most often posted by the people who have the strongest feelings for or against $X.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a><p>Unfortunately this creates a situation where everyone with strong passions feels like the site is dominated by their enemies and they&#x27;re basically surrounded by demons when they spend time here.

It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s organized in a way that keeps everyone together, so you&#x27;re much more likely to randomly bump into remarks that you passionately disagree with. On other sites people protect themselves from this by subscribing or following or connecting primarily with users of their own tribe, and come into contact with the other tribe only when going out on skirmishes. I wrote a mini-essay about that if anyone cares:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23308098</a>')
