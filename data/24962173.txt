So before the product was released we could eliminate common pitfalls based on our previous experiences. When a product is released you can then use data to optimise things.<p>An other issue I have with the article is that in some cases I&#x27;ve seen upclose, a tiny tiny percentage improvement in UX equaled an extra 6-figure increase in revenue. When a product is in a stage of optimising UX for more revenue, it&#x27;s in the company&#x27;s best interest to focus on the improvements that have direct impact on company revenue. So improving the UX on pricing pages, cancellation user flows etc.<p>This means a smaller UX improvement, sometimes really really small, but a huge upside for the business. So smaller UX improvements does not mean it has less effect on businesses. If anything, it&#x27;s more likely the impact is growing because UX optimisations don&#x27;t happen in random places anymore.')
