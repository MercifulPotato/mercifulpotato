Most public schools are really weird in that parents are heavily incentivized to move to expensive school districts when their kids are school age ish, pay egregious income taxes while their kids actually attend school, then downsize somewhere cheaper when their kids leave. Those public schools get all the funding, and the schools in worse districts have rich parents fleeing them, leaving the less privileged behind with lower local taxes to work with. Itâ€™s a really non equitable system.')
