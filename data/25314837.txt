I get the top quotes from those books in the daily digest. If I really like the quotes, I plan to read that book in full. If I don&#x27;t like the top quotes, I know I don&#x27;t have to bother with the book. This way, I can skim through 10x more books than if I tried reading all of them.\nWhat are your hacks?')
