There is a silly ineffective effort to track down the nest, as if there would be only one nest. That won&#x27;t work, and the pests will eventually spread all across the Americas. We could solve it, at the cost of a short-term ecological mess. Simply dump pesticide from aircraft, covering a 100-mile diameter region, in quantity sufficient to kill every member of the order Hymenoptera. We won&#x27;t do it, and so both North America and South America will eternally be infested.')
