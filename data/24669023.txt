Item(by='wolfram74', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601692403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668956, text='I&#x27;ve not played around with command blocks, but it&#x27;s a bit more than redstone components.<p>When Factorio items are wired together with signal cable they have a few different operating modes. You can specify what objects are requested from a delivery network and what items are taken from a chest, or if any are to be taken at all. So this solution involved chests being filled with various items that have a specific color on belts, and then staggering pulls from the chests to place on belts in such a manner as to make pixels.<p>Those commands were issued by combinations of the constant signal block, the comparison&#x2F;decider block, and the arithmetic block. I would say those entities are between NAND gates and pre fabricated if&#x2F;else or for loop constructs.')
