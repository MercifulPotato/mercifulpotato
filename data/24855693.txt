I think, the effort needed to do so should also be honoured, not simply skipped over. I disagree though, that it will stop innovation. On the contrary, if the capabilities and knowledge are spread, it allows people to build on that.<p>Currently, I think, we vastly favour novelty over reproducibility. We still can have &quot;innovation&quot;, but I think, it is right to take the novelty under consideration, if it hasn&#x27;t been reproduced. In my opinion, exceptionalism is used more often as not as protectionism.<p>If results in physics produced at the LHC are held to that standard, I do not see, why we let anyone else of the hook.<p>Unfortunately, in the current &quot;publish-or-die&quot; environment, there is next to no incentive to reproduce results or to make them reproducible. I do not get academic jobs for merely reproducing results, you cannot publish that stuff, or only on low impact papers.\nAnd if I do produce something new and others can easily reproduce my results, then they can simply pick up the work where I started, and I lose my edge. Even if I am more open to competition, it still may be a lot of work to make it reproducible for others, time I rather can spend on furthering my research.<p>E.g. there is no excuse, that in computer science practically all the results can be easily reproduced, but how many are?')
