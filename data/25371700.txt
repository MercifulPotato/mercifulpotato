No testing and no limits.<p>States have a legal and ethical pubic health obligation. They&#x27;re also on the hook financially via lost sales taxes and medicaid costs. Each covid case is bad for states. But they can&#x27;t pay businesses to close. And they federal government won&#x27;t pay even though they could.<p>A 10 minute spit test would make this allot more doable.')
