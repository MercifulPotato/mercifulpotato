Languages are not created in a planned, thought-through manner. Instead they are designed by human beings.<p>But what if they were, in fact, planned?<p>Let us quickly come up with some obviously orthogonal properties of a PL: evaluation strategy (by value, by name, by need) memory safety (manual, automatic), type system (none, nominal, structural), and implementation choice (compiled, interpreted). That alone gives us 3x2x3x2=36 possible languages and there are a) many more orthogonal choices to be made and b) several subchoices (e.g., which garbage collector, or which kind of polymorphism in the type system, what kind of macros, etc.) - also some of these choics are not <i>truly</i> orthogonal to complicate matters even more (interpreted languages tend to be untyped for some reason, for instance).<p>All in all, it seems there should be hundreds if not thousands of languages even if we would design them like we design wrenches or screwdrivers.')
