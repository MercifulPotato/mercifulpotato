I first launched Google Analytics widgets for the &quot;Today&quot; view way back, but I&#x27;ve just re-built the whole App and re-released it for iOS 14 widgets. It also now has Siri Shortcuts so you can do things like get currently active users and metrics from the last 30 days completely hands-free.<p>It also has a dashboard that lets you get basic dimension information. It&#x27;s not designed to replace the full Google Analytics App, but instead be an alternative way to more quickly get a quick glance at how things are going.<p>With the release of the v4 analytics API I&#x27;m hoping to update it to support Firebase analytics. I&#x27;d also like to add Apple Watch support so you can get basic realtime information on your wrist.')
