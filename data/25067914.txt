Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25068194], score=None, time=1605171908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25067844, text='I was curious; 13.3 inch screen with light and touch screen for $1099 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasung-tech.myshopify.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;dasung-e-ink-paperlike-hd-front-light-and-touch-13-3-monitor?variant=32310474866733" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasung-tech.myshopify.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;dasung-e-ink-pape...</a>) (without it&#x27;s $999).<p>Pricey, small and really not the best design, but it&#x27;s a start. I say it&#x27;s a start but at the same time I&#x27;m afraid this is the best we&#x27;re likely to get, given that the e-ink market is not growing and the technology isn&#x27;t competing with cheap LCD screens and tablets.<p>A shame; I wouldn&#x27;t mind a modern, affordable take on the typewriter with an E-ink screen (13 or 15 inch) and mechanical keyboard. I could probably build one if I have a lot more expendable income and time.')
