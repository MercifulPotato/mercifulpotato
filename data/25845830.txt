If deepfakes weren’t a thing then there would be no need to fake something like this so I don’t think there’s be much reason to fake it now. Seems easier to just do the real thing.<p>I think the whole point of the messaging is to make it obvious what’s happened without explicitly saying it and a deepfake doesn’t help with that. If they had done something worse they would have done it deliberately and would want to prove it. Kind of like when the Russians assassinate some dissident and go on their news to say “we absolutely deny the allegations that so and so was assassinated but I guess it just shows what happens when you are a traitor”')
