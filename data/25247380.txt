I&#x27;m confident that&#x27;s happened to me a few times.<p>For electronics products, some reviews go into excruciating details on what counterfeit v real products look like.<p>Then some products literally explain how to avoid counterfeit products, especially the smaller producers of goods with niche products.<p>Finally there are articles in the press about it.<p>eBay has less of this problem because it&#x27;s set up to select sellers based on reviews. Amazon&#x27;s stores are more obscure, and often don&#x27;t have many reviews, or sometimes you get an item fulfilled from a third party without knowing about it.  I&#x27;m not sure if that still happens though.')
