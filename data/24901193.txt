But those are exceptions to the rule of &quot;western societies didn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t handle the pandemic very gracefully.&quot;<p>Mind you, I am not advocating to follow an authoritarian&#x2F;Chinese model.<p>But the analysis that neoliberalism (and the hyper-individualist mentality that it co-evolved with) have undermined any collective effort at containing this effectively seems valid to me, or at least worthy of discussion.<p>Financially, we have eroded our capability to respond to this in a timely manner. Our healthcare and test&#x2F;trace capabilities were simply not up to snuff, even though the people that know most about them kept sounding the alarms.<p>Philosophically (and IMHO this is the more contestable part of my <i>opinion</i>) our individualist societies have eroded our capability to demand (let alone volunteer!) <i>personal</i> sacrifice for a <i>collective</i> good, even one that indirectly benefits us and our direct peers.<p>Alas, give the developments and debate around this, I don&#x27;t see anyone working through this after the fact. We&#x27;ll all want to move on, forget that 2020 ever existed, and hope that economic growth will lead us into the golden twenties we&#x27;ve all been waiting for.<p>This time it will definitely work and not screw us all over in the next cycle, we&#x27;ll say. Or at least next time I will be on the winning side! Just you wait!')
