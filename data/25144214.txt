A fetus (human or otherwise) is a living thing. I don&#x27;t know what the purpose of your link was, or how it has anything to do with the misuse of words above. Unless you think I&#x27;m implying that all forms of killing are the same, which obviously I&#x27;m not. That being said &quot;killing &lt;animal&gt; fetus&quot; is merely a subset of &quot;killing &lt;animal&gt;&quot; by basic logic. Were you implying otherwise by citing that link?')
