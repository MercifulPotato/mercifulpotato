Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=[25192334], score=None, time=1606156200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189675, text='&gt; Sometimes, even as a consumer, this is desired<p>I don&#x27;t understand this argument. The goal is not to be intrinsically &quot;slow&quot;, but to be suitably &quot;careful&quot;. If you can be as careful as needed, but execute that careful process in such a way that no time is wasted, that&#x27;s a win. The two are separate questions.<p>To put it differently: high-security systems programmers don&#x27;t move their fingers more slowly on the keyboards because &quot;going slow is better&quot;. They put checks in place, and they take as much time as is needed to do things right, but padding that time just for the sake of &quot;slowness&quot; helps nobody.<p>&gt; Government is also inefficient by design. Imagine the govâ€™t pivoting to different laws every week - it would be completely unsustainable and would drive people crazy.<p>Speed of change has nothing to do with efficiency of implementation. I&#x27;m talking about writing laws that are efficient for <i>companies</i> to deal with, not streamlining the law-passing process so that legislators themselves are unburdened. It&#x27;s a totally separate thing.<p>&gt; inefficiency can be a feature...for big companies because it creates a slow and expensive hurdle for smaller competitors<p>This is true, and could be part of the reason this problem hasn&#x27;t been addressed. But corporate lobbyists are just one of the many forces influencing legislation, and formalizing ideas around &quot;efficient regulation&quot; would only shed even more light on bad-faith attempts at making laws less efficient for the purpose of moat-building.')
