My mom lives and my grandma lived on the Iron Range in Minnesota, so a very rural area, which seemed to help keep infections at bay for a while.<p>It&#x27;s been incredibly hard for my mom, because my grandma was her best friend and her rock. The day she passed, I remember my mom saying &quot;I never got a last hug&quot;, which was heart breaking. My mom has MS, so there was no possibility of her visiting her through that whole process.<p>It&#x27;s been really hard. I want to see my mom and give her a hug. But I also don&#x27;t trust the time in between getting the results of a negative test to feel confidant about visiting her.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ll all find some closure once we have a chance to grieve together, properly. There are many memorial&#x2F;celebration services that have been postponed. I hope we can reach the day where we can hold them safely together.')
