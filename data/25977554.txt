In a previous post I saw someone saying that American Airlines was looking at adopting Matrix for their employees.</i><p>Do you really think &quot;but enterprise organizations don&#x27;t mind running it&quot; is a great argument? By that measure, JIRA is also perfect software :D<p>I know plenty of places running their own Matrix servers, and while it&#x27;s certainly not unusable (proven by the fact that they keep running it), it&#x27;s a common refrain among their admins that Synapse is one of the more annoying pieces of software they run in their infrastructure. That&#x27;s not &quot;bikeshedding&quot;, but operational experience, which has an impact on if it&#x27;s recommended or not. See also the ... varying ... quality of matrix&#x27;s bridges to other ecosystems, even the ones that are provided officially by the Matrix project. So yes, there are actual issues with Synapse performance - &quot;rewrite it in Rust!!111&quot; is of course not necessarily the correct response :D')
