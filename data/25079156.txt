I pirate things when legal services become too cumbersome, unethical, or dirty. DRM often does that. I won&#x27;t avoid all DRM, but there&#x27;s a threshold. The RIAA crossed with youtube-dl.<p>When I was in college, price was an issue, and piracy was there to save the $10&#x2F;month for most students, but the alternative was not having the music&#x2F;software&#x2F;etc., rather than a legal sale. The actual financial loss was close to zero. I think the reason for DRM isn&#x27;t so much to prevent profit-losing piracy, as control.<p>Movie and record companies want to differentiate pricing by market. They want records of who watch what and where. They want to be able to expire things, explicitly or implicitly (if I go Android&lt;-&gt;Apple, my iTunes&#x2F;Google Play collections become less helpful). That has business value.<p>As for paying customers, when I was a student, they could have milked me for $5. As a professional, I don&#x27;t really care what it costs, and I don&#x27;t want to bother with piracy, and I&#x27;ll do whatever&#x27;s most ethical. The RIAA just told me what&#x27;s most ethical is not listening to new music, followed by pirating music, followed by buying music.<p>I got enough music.')
