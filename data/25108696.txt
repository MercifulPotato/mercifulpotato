Please spend as much time as you can understanding the complexity of your MVP and try to map that to what it should cost to build. Without having a good estimate of how much it should cost you will either spend too little and get extremely sub par results, or spend way more than you should have (more likely scenario) and get barely usable MVP. It&#x27;s easy for dishonest parties to take advantage of your lack of knowledge and quote you an extremely high figure for what you want to do.<p>So my recommendation is to find someone with the right technical background that ideally has done many projects that may be similar to your MVP and that can put together for your an overall high level design and give you estimates on how much it would cost to build it based on hours and even tech stack used. They don&#x27;t have to do the work but it should guide you on your next steps.')
