You run your program once to print out what&#x27;s going on, but it also displays a unique word next to each line and on a second run you can set a breakpoint at any of these words to investigate deeper. It&#x27;s pretty handy when you spot an issue at the hundredth invocation of some function deep in the program&#x27;s execution.')
