That&#x27;s ridiculous<p>CSS-in-JS solves a lot of problems that people that have been writing &#x27;real CSS&#x27; have been experiencing for a long time. Writing CSS for very large applications that deal with lots of shared components across engineering teams is a hard task. Some of those problems are alleviated by libraries like styled-components.<p>It&#x27;s not for every use case and should only be used when there is a genuine need (rather than &#x27;because it&#x27;s shiny.&#x27;) But shrugging off CSS-in-JS because you don&#x27;t understand it is a bit silly.')
