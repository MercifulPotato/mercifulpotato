It can also be worsened by blepharaitis (inflammation of the eyelids).<p>If you feel like you’re straining to focus (and you haven’t already), you should see an optometrist and get computer glasses.<p>I have a pair that I wear occasionally, and I find them especially helpful with low-res (e.g. medium to large 1080p) displays.
