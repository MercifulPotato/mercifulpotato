I view them similarly to the soft drinks market, you have moats due to brand such as Coca Cola, but vigorous competition with a heterogeneity of choices for the consumer. If I&#x27;m a socialist I can read Jacobin and if I&#x27;m very right wing I can read OANN, no matter my perspective I can find print media to suit. TV networks aren&#x27;t a good comparison to newspapers&#x2F;print media since they have very high fixed costs and as a result will only cater to markets that represent a sizeable proportion of the populace.')
