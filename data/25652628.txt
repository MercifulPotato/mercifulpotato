In mRNA it is learned by teaching&#x2F;programming from a set of instructions.</i><p>No, the learning is not done by programming. Nothing is programmed permanently by the mRNA vaccine. In both cases, the proteins to be learned by the immune system are introduced to the body, and then the immune system learns about the proteins floating around. mRNA vaccines do not &quot;reprogram&quot; the immune system any more a traditional vaccine does. What differs is primarily how the protein learned about is made.<p>&gt; <i>you can’t introduce proteins to get your DNA to do something</i><p>The DNA isn&#x27;t &quot;made to do something&quot;, this doesn&#x27;t make any sense. DNA is not influenced by either vaccine type, and DNA is not changed when the immune system adapts to something.')
