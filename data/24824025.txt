One of the outcomes of the geometric approach to gravity is the total lack of anti-gravity: there is simply no such thing as an anti-geodesic. The lesson of quantum field theory to me was that observables are operators on fields and not simple scalars evolving in time. General relativity is quite similar in that respect.')
