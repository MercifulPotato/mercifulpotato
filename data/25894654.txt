Item(by='Railsify', descendants=None, kids=[25895578], score=None, time=1611514693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25893103, text='&quot;wrong per se&quot;, do you really want to bicker over the meaning of wrong. It was his advice&#x2F;predictions&#x2F;theory (call it what you want), that when followed turned out vastly different than predicted, that is wrong in my opinion. Look how many years it took him to come out and say &quot;the pace&quot; was not adequately (incorrectly) taken into account. He was even awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics and 1.4 million dollars for this theory that played a large part in tearing apart the middle class.<p>My comment was indeed too hyperbolic but basically true. A mistake that affected our country so negatively cannot be forgotten or forgiven.')
