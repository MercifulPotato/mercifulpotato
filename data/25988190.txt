Helping the environment means fewer cars and of those we can&#x27;t get rid of, make them electric. Their strategy is more cars. That is, the tactic of electric is useful within a strategy of de-growth, but they have a strategy of growth. In fairness, they are a car company. A meaningful strategy to shrink the market would require changing the playing field, which would likely have to come from outside the field -- government or leadership at the level of Mandela or Dr. King.')
