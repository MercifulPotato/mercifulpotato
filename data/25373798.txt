The rules are basically the same as in April. Only main difference is 8 people instead of 50 in public gatherings. I can still arrange a private party in my own house with hundreds of participants if I wanted to.<p>Some of the recommendations have changed, but not by a lot. And not all recommendations have become stricter. For example: in April we were advised not to travel further than 2h from our homes, and the recommendations for 70+ were harsher than the rest of the population. These recommendations are no longer in effect.<p>Shopping centres are still open with unlimited capacity. Masks neither mandated or recommended. I was in a hospital a month or so ago, and saw one or two masks in total, and none among the nurses or doctors. Last time I was in a pharmacy nobody wore a mask.')
