It&#x27;s one thing if you were paying a bribe to say, a local minister to get exclusive access to some sort of scene...<p>But low-level crooks pretty much sticking you up and you try to buy your stuff back from them under the guise of &quot;government business&quot; is not the kind of thing FCPA is about. It&#x27;s for concerted attempts to pay off foreign officials to strengthen your business.<p>Which surely still happen, but not in the manner you&#x27;re describing. FCPA violations wouldn&#x27;t be the sort of thing that &quot;everyone&quot; is told about.')
