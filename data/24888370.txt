Probably a little bit. But having a simple, agnostic, portable and stable development environment is well worth the trade-off IMO.<p>I&#x27;d say historically this was less of a concern, but 10-100kloc codebases are becoming pretty common. More powerful uCs with more flash&#x2F;ram, heterogeneous cores, etc are allowing very complex embedded projects to exist. I&#x27;d say fancy IDE features start to help in these cases.')
