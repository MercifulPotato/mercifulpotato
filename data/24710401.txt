Item(by='quacked', descendants=None, kids=[24712562], score=None, time=1602090896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710147, text='&gt; In theory, thatâ€™s what the dates next to Amazon&#x2F;App Store reviews are for.<p>There&#x27;s no way to chart the average review score over time, though, is there? If people saw several years of 4.5-averaged scores and then a sudden drop to 3-average, that would tip them off, but looking at dates next to individual reviews doesn&#x27;t help because any single review by itself varies wildly with the knowledge and opinion of the reviewer.<p>As for immutable reviews- that&#x27;s a good point, although it seems like you could get around that by leaving reviews editable through at least the listed warranty period of the item. Or add a separate set of reviews that only become active after a certain period of time after you left your first review, but now we&#x27;re getting into anal-retentive nerd territory that no average user is incentivized to venture into. (&quot;Why, of course I&#x27;d like to log back on to a review site I used once six years ago and talk about how my washing machine is functioning!&quot;)<p>Edit: Actually, the type of person who would seek out and help populate a &quot;reliability rating site&quot; might be the type of person who would respond with details to a six-year-later email that asks for commentary on a product, especially if you can enter the review straight from an email reply.')
