It should be very well possible to follow them and use Optix to render on a graphics card but I would much prefer a solution not involving closed source. Which would mean that you have to implement your own Optix. :\\ But looking at how CPUs and GPUs are evolving it might be possible in a distant future to use the same (Swift) code on both of them; you can have instances with 448 CPUs in the cloud and the latest GPUs have a few thousand micro-cpus, they look more and more the same.<p>I&#x27;d be really excited for this future. One of the main reasons I haven&#x27;t delved into GPU programming for fun is that I don&#x27;t really like the available language(s). It seems petty, but the language I&#x27;m using makes a huge difference in the fun-factor for me.')
