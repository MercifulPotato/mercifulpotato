[...] How can the free market work if everyone is so easily affected by suggestion?</i><p>I&#x27;m (genuinely) surprised that someone with your financial background knowledge would write those sentences about &quot;free market&quot;.<p>I think you already know that the &quot;free&quot; in &quot;free market&quot; means free (as practically possible) from <i>government</i> controls. (The first sentence in wikipedia.[1]) E.g., the baker decides to bake 10 loaves of bread instead of a government official telling him a quota.<p>Yes, I understand that many people use <i>another definition</i> of &quot;free market&quot; to mean &quot;theoretical and impossible to exist market&quot; -- because it would require all humans to be all-knowledgeable Laplace&#x27;s Demon[2] and impervious to hidden influences.<p>Ok, I get that language usage evolves and labels get diluted and therefore, &quot;free market&quot; is meaningless.  In that case, what _do_ we call imperfect humans trading without government dictating quotas to us?  I&#x27;m open to alternative labels.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Free_market" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Free_market</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laplace%27s_demon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laplace%27s_demon</a>')
