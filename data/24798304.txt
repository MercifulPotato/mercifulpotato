But Tuya already changed the firmware once to block this, and although the newest tuya-convert works again, there&#x27;s no telling they won&#x27;t do it again.<p>Lately though Tuya devices have started using a Realtek RTL8710BN instead of the ESP8266 - those are completely incompatible boards, and to my knowledge there&#x27;s nothing like Tasmota or ESPhome for them.')
