Many editors describe RT as a mouthpiece of the Russian government that engages in propaganda and disinformation.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this is untrue or that RT is a reliable source, but I can&#x27;t actually recall or find a specific example of false or fabricated information published by RT. Does anyone have a good example?')
