The legal concept which serves as a basis to determine someone&#x27;s allegiance by their ancestry is called &quot;ius sanguinis&quot;.

Many nations have implemented this in their nationality laws in a way that extends surprisingly far.<p>For instance, if you&#x27;re of Luxembourgish descent through the male line of your family, you could just claim Luxembourg citizenship - and by extension E.U. citizenship - under Article 7 of their nationality laws. Something which was recently pointed out on Reddit. Even if you weren&#x27;t born in Luxembourg or never have set a foot in the E.U. proper.
