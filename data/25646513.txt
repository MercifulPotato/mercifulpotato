Superluminal collapse, for instance, or closed timelike curves; it seems to my intuition that these are clearly flaws in the theory rather than properties of reality. In a sense, the sci-fi concept of the ansible, where quantum collapse effects are exploited for FTL signaling, is <i>more</i> plausible than the view where quantum systems collapse instantly, but cannot be exploited for FTL. If your theory requires FTL in the &quot;backend&quot; to operate, it shouldn&#x27;t end up with FTL just happening to not be exploitable in the &quot;frontend&quot;. So I expect that when we find the true ToE, it&#x27;s not going to end up with traits where the data structure in principle allows a certain capability, but coincidentally doesn&#x27;t give us access to it; all limitations of that theory would follow directly from its structure, so that illegal operations cannot even be <i>expressed.</i> So when we find a practical limitation to the exploitation of a physical theory, then this seems to me to require, barring very good theoretical reasons to the contrary, a genuine underlying property of the universe that justifies this limit.<p>As such, it seems to me, purely from an intuitive view, that of those three claims:<p>- reality is quantum<p>- quantum mechanics requires exponential cost to simulate<p>- quantum mechanics cannot be exploited for exponential computation<p>One has to be false! If reality <i>requires</i> exponential cost to simulate, we shouldn&#x27;t expect it to then turn around and hide that capability from us. God famously doesn&#x27;t play dice with the universe; but I doubt he&#x27;s playing Poker either. Personally, I suspect quantum mechanics is cheaper than is widely believed.<p>Idk, am I missing something obvious?')
