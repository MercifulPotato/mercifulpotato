Putting your site on shared hosting or a VPS like Dreamhost, DigitalOcean, Linode, or Vultr is not self-hosting.<p>Self-hosting means you pay for your own pipe, your own hardware, and your own space in which to keep the hardware, whether it&#x27;s on your own premises or in a co-location facility owned by individuals sympathetic to your views.<p>Corporations don&#x27;t exist to provide you with a platform for your views, especially if they&#x27;re as repugnant as those frequently aired on sites like Parler. They exist to make a profit for their owners&#x2F;stockholders, and if you hamper that mission they will throw you under a bus.<p>Whether this is right or wrong is irrelevant; corporations will do as they please unless the state governments that issue their charters (which in the US is mostly Delaware) start revoking them and dissolving corporations that abuse their power.<p>People keep forgetting that &quot;the cloud&quot; is just somebody else&#x27;s computer, and that somebody else is NOT your friend or ally.')
