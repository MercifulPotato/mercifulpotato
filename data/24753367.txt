What&#x27;s being suggested is updating React state via a mutable API on the data value itself.  `use-immer` wraps the useState&#x2F;useReducer functional updaters with a call to immer, whereas `use-structure` suggests mutating the data, which is what every React-beginner instinctively tries to do when they first get started with React.  Same idea of using Proxies as immer though.<p>This is really interesting!  Great idea.')
