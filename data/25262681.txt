It does not prevent cheating.  However, it shifts focus: I can go about my teaching life <i>starting</i> from an assumption that students are not cheatersâ€”and I&#x27;m personally convinced that most aren&#x27;t.<p>The flipside is that when you do catch a cheating case, you completely throw the book at them.  It&#x27;s legitimately easier to cheat under an honor system, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re wanting to do... so my assumption is that if we <i>catch</i> you at it, it&#x27;s likely part of a pattern, and if we catch you multiple times the pattern is irreformable.  It is not uncommon at honor-code institutions to expel students on the second offence (sometimes even on the first).<p>I do think that cheating is less prevalent at my institution (and my previous institution) than it is in the larger university population.')
