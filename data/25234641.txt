(I guess it&#x27;s difficult to think in these terms because we always only see a 4.367 years old &quot;<i>NOW</i>&quot; from Alpha Centauri.)<p>There would be no violation of Causality if you had a ship which could instantly Jump between Sol and Alpha Centauri - you&#x27;d simply arrive there at <i>NOW</i>+&lt;however long this Jump took&gt; - whether it&#x27;s seconds or picoseconds.<p>If you sent a radio signal &quot;Hi there!&quot; from Sol to Alpha Centauri before this Jump, you&#x27;d be waiting for 4.367 years for it to arrive - which still isn&#x27;t a violation of Causality, because it&#x27;d be <i>NOW</i>+4.367 years in Alpha Centauri and the same would be true in the Sol system.<p>If your faster-than-light (faster-than-Causality) Drive wasn&#x27;t an instantaneous Jump like above, Causality is still not violated, because you&#x27;d still be arriving at <i>NOW</i> + &lt;however long it took&gt; to travel between Sol &amp; Alpha Centauri. Maybe you could only travel at twice the speed of light (twice the speed of Causality), in which case you&#x27;d arrive there in <i>NOW</i> + 2.1835 years')
