I stopped using it because it&#x27;s incredibly slow.  Even on a 32 core Threadripper, things like &quot;list the files in this directory&quot; take seconds.  I can&#x27;t deal with it.  Honestly, I would have dealt with it, if Adobe&#x27;s mandatory extra software weren&#x27;t so annoying.  The installer auto-installs a &quot;cloud drive&quot;, and then it&#x27;s in every Explorer window, slowing down every file operation in the OS... that was the last straw for me.  (They promised to remove it, but never did, so I stopped paying for their software.)<p>Honestly, Lightroom never really worked for me.  It made easy things hard and hard things impossible.  I take a lot of film photographs, and it just didn&#x27;t integrate with any of the tools I use to capture the images.  I do everything manually in several separate pieces of software, and adding one more didn&#x27;t help much.')
