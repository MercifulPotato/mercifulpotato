The real trouble is outside of software.<p>If you think about it, how come otherwise reasonable people become anti-vaxxers, or flat-earthers, or believers of any kind of (perhaps less obvious) nonsense? The arguments I&#x27;ve seen tend to boil down to lack of trust. They don&#x27;t trust healthcare institutions (&quot;it&#x27;s all bought out by big pharma!&quot;), scientists (&quot;all bought out by big $something!&quot;), government agencies (&quot;they&#x27;re incompetent&quot;&#x2F;&quot;literally nazis&quot;), etc.<p>To some degree, these institutions all violated our trust in one way or another, and media (both mainstream and social) is doing stellar job at amplifying the damage. To me, the problem with the people mistrusting institutions to the extreme isn&#x27;t the facts - they often have good, if cherry-picked ones. It&#x27;s the relative weight given to those facts (like, just because there was a screwup with the swine flu vaccine doesn&#x27;t mean flu vaccines in general are evil dangerous pharma moneymakers). Fixing that requires teaching people some rational thinking, and I&#x27;m not sure how to do that; it&#x27;s much more difficult than just throwing citations at them.')
