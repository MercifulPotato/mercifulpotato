He chose certain criteria and used the computer to assist him in the evaluation.<p>Another option would be to choose the team on who you just &quot;like the most&quot;. Maybe this would have been more to your liking? It&#x27;s more human, I guess. However, notice that there is still a criteria and still an evaluation phase, you can&#x27;t avoid it (unless you pick by random).<p>None of this means that you have to use text-to-speech and have the computer read out the list of names who were fired. You can still go to each team member and talk about it, like a human.')
