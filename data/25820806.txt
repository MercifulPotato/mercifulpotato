Stuff that should work intuitively sometimes doesn&#x27;t, and when you get a cryptic error message, it&#x27;s difficult to find relevant help online. And when you do find help, some of it is out of date because the language has changed over the past few years.<p>- You can squeeze a lot of performance out of Python and the ecosystem of libraries is hard to beat.<p>- Julia has to be <i>way better</i> than Python to give people an incentive to switch. Being just marginally better in some aspects of the language isn&#x27;t enough. And it&#x27;s very difficult to be much better than Python especially in useability and ecosystem.')
