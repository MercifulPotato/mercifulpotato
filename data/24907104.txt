Item(by='nsajko', descendants=None, kids=[24907304], score=None, time=1603804782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906602, text='&gt; An idiosyncrasy of Axler&#x27;s book is that it introduces determinants only toward the end<p>I think the idea is that determinants do not necessarily belong in linear algebra proper, at least not with as prominent a position as they are usually awarded in textbooks. More specifically the idea is that determinants are being excessively and detrimentally used in linear algebra proofs. Axler actually published a paper called &quot;Down With Determinants!&quot; in 1995, for which he won the Lester R. Ford Award. Quote from the introduction:<p>&gt; This paper focuses on showing that determinants should be banished from much of the theoretical part of linear algebra. Determinants are also useless in the computational part of linear algebra.<p>Paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maa.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;awards&#x2F;Axler-Ford-1996.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maa.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;awards&#x2F;Axler-For...</a><p>Wikipedia page for the award: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_R._Halmos_%E2%80%93_Lester_R._Ford_Award" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_R._Halmos_%E2%80%93_Leste...</a>')
