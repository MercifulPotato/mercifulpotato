A normal distribution has &quot;thin&quot; tails. The probability of huge outliers is pretty low.<p>If you have tail risk, then it means you have a decent chance of losing a lot more money than the typical variation. Your returns might look like +1.1, +0.9, +1.2 +1.05, -3. So your profit is pretty predictable with little variation, until suddenly you lose a lot of money.')
