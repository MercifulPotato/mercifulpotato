Meetings being added&#x2F;removed to calendars to mess with you, an &#x27;implied&#x27; threat being left in the notes section of a hidden slide in a presentation, meeting notes being manipulated to make them look bad, this sort of thing.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just extremely lucky but I&#x27;ve never worked with anyone who would put in the effort for this sort of thing, even if they really disliked the person. And some of it just makes no sense - an implied murder&#x2F;suicide threat, in the notes section in a hidden slide in a slideshow?<p>Also the formatting being a long screed with <i>random bolding</i> doesn&#x27;t help, although that could well be a non-native speaker not realising how this appears to natives.')
