Item(by='mahoukov', descendants=2, kids=[24739443], score=3, time=1602341967, title='Show HN: Decentralised Digital Identity and Messaging', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been working on something for a while now. It&#x27;s a combination of a decentralised identity system and a decentralised messaging system that makes use of the aforementioned new identity system.<p>It&#x27;s based on cryptographic keys with one major property: keys are paired with arbitrary mnemonic strings, e.g. your favourite username, so apps can send messages in a P2P fashion addressed to the strings directly without having to worry about IP addresses. These key-string pairs can be generated on-the-fly on any computer and there&#x27;s no central database. When multiple people inevitably choose the same strings as their identifiers, e.g. 5 people choose &#x27;alice&#x27;, the system has a consensus mechanism for resolving such conflicts across the entire network so &#x27;alice&#x27; will always point to one public key that all nodes will use at a given point in time for encryption and signature verification. This means that only that specific &#x27;alice&#x27; will receive any messages sent to that identifier. The other 4 people won&#x27;t be able to read them.<p>I&#x27;ve written two papers describing both systems:<p>* Nomicle: A decentralised, identity-based, cryptography system [ http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noraco.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;xp002&#x2F;docs&#x2F;XP002.pdf ]<p>* xTalk: A Nomicle-powered, inter-app messaging system [ http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noraco.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hp001&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HP001.pdf ]<p>I plan on releasing the source code and documentation some time later this month. It&#x27;s all written in Python. Nomicle&#x27;s code includes a Python library as well as a C library that developers can use to integrate it into their apps. I&#x27;m trying to make it as easy and simple as possible for anyone to pick up. These are the first projects in a pipeline of open source projects that build on this work and that I intend to work on and release in the near future. Messaging is one potential use of Nomicle, but I can already see more uses such as consensus-based packet routing and information publishing. In fact, the latter is the next project I&#x27;ll be working on.')
