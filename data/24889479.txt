However wrong others may be, it&#x27;s not ok to break the site guidelines by attacking them personally or impugning bad faith. If you have evidence of abuse, that&#x27;s differentâ€”but the bar for &#x27;evidence&#x27; obviously has to be higher than other commenters simply holding a different view.<p>Believe me I understand how frustrating it is when the community or a large subset of commenters seem to be repeatedly and perversely wrong about something. But that is the internet doing its internet thing. We all run into it on some topic that we know a lot about and&#x2F;or feel strongly about. It can&#x27;t be stopped or fixed.

It won&#x27;t stop because you ask it to or want it to; &quot;it&quot; is impersonal and doesn&#x27;t have consciousness to begin with. One needs to accept that for one&#x27;s own sanity (I hope it&#x27;s clear that I&#x27;m talking from personal experience about this) and then patiently supply corrective information wherever you can and have the energy.
