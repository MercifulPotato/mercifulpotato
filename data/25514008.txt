They collect AP&#x27;s for their mapping&#x2F;location crap. 2. The wifi chipsets they use are basically their own self-contained computers that can manage scanning at low-power without taxing the CPU. 3. At least for new HW, some of the 5G-NR stuff really isn&#x27;t well optimized yet, not as bad as LTE originally was... but it&#x27;s entirely possible the new modems for now are a little power hungry. Turning on wifi makes the cell chipset track less carriers, typically it&#x27;ll just hug to one low-band carrier for status&#x2F;push messages instead of as many as 5 or 6 carriers.<p>EDIT: Phones usually only transmit on one channel while receiving anywhere from 1-7 different channels at once, only the recent flagships transmit on 2 or 3 right now.')
