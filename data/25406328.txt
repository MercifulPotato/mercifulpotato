Every self respecting VM treats value types differently than reference types, and esp. objects. Ruby, Perl, Javascript, every lisp, lua... That&#x27;s why they are all so much faster than python. Python made the weird&#x2F; insane decision to overload + for strings, so treating numbers as classes goes from there. It just cannot be fast then. But even most Common Lisp&#x27;s treat every value as class, with an atom being a struct of class and value. So it can be made fast if you do it properly.<p>Lessons learned: Don&#x27;t ever look at the python vm, if you want to look for a well designed VM. Even Ruby is miles better there.')
