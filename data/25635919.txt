Is anyone pre-paying for the 1 year license to buy ourselves 1 year migration timeline? Anyone heard if we would be allowed to pre-pay for another year if there&#x27;s an announcement of the deadlines? Has anyone been approached by that special team for their customized transition?<p>And if you happen to work for Google you should realize should you make your G Suite customers unhappy with how this transition is handled, you may as well stick a fork into any CGP aspirations Google&#x27;s management has.')
