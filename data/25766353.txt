You talk about surivivorship bias in university students, but I think it&#x27;s a lot more likely that the survivorship bias is really, &quot;people who value education&quot;. That is, the people currently in traditional university are by and large the majority of the people in whatever hypothetical online next-gen education system you&#x27;re imagining.<p>I think it&#x27;s really unlikely there are a whole lot of geniuses for whom school, &quot;just doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. I&#x27;ve met a <i>lot</i> of people who think of themselves like this, and honestly, they&#x27;re usually just stupid or lazy. High achievers figure out ways to take advantage of the systems that are in place, they don&#x27;t admit defeat and blame &quot;the system&quot; for their failure.')
