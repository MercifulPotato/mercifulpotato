The sentence is phrased somewhat ambiguously, which is why I said she&#x27;s being <i>loose</i> with the facts. But the links she provides neither back up the claim (all are <i>speculative</i>), and 3&#x2F;4 are not specific to Florida, so I think it&#x27;s a fair critique given the forceful nature of the statement, and the fact that she&#x27;s calling out Levitt for his own past speculation.<p>The link to Levitt&#x27;s supposed comments to the governor is broken, so we can&#x27;t verify what he actually said in detail. However, if you follow the other links, you can see that she is not above taking comments out of context when it serves her purpose. In the comment about about 10 deaths in Israel, it&#x27;s fairly clear that Levitt is <i>not</i> making a bold claim about the distant future -- he&#x27;s saying that <i>given the case counts at the time</i>, it would be surprising to see more than ten deaths, not predicting ten deaths in Israel, ever.')
