How does that correspond to less loading from memory?<p>Linear arrays are often faster, not because they require fewer memory loads, but because the cache has intelligence built in (the prefetcher) that loads some memory in advance even before the code requests it. That intelligence works way better with linear array scans than with pointer chasing. (I&#x27;m not sure if these loads will count as cache misses or not).')
