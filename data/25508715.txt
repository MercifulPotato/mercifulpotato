Item(by='splix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608657868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506007, text='I&#x27;ve got a recent experience with similar software (and still having PTSD from it), and I don&#x27;t even think it really provides any real protection against cheaters. Ok, maybe all those AI-things to track head and eyes movements even work, though I find it a stupid idea.<p>More interesting is their exam protection part. It records the screen, limits the software you can run, disables copy-paste, disables external monitor and keyboard on a laptop, etc. All to avoid leaking of the exam questions. And it&#x27;s super annoying for the student.<p>But I don&#x27;t think they protect from custom browser scripts like with Greasemonkey, and there is just no way to detect a proxy server that makes copies of the requested pages with the exam content. So it&#x27;s only a Security Theater, nothing more.')
