So far, proposals to extend the for-loop have not passed the cost&#x2F;benefit test. I think supporting iterators would require something like magic-methods, which so far are not a thing in Zig (language syntax doesn&#x27;t interact with userland code).<p>The status quo for iterators is this:<p><pre><code>  var it = getSomeIterable();\n  while (it.next()) |item| {\n      ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIMO it&#x27;s &quot;good but not great&quot; (not great because it adds a var and the variable pollutes the outer scope). But the alternative is a bit of a pandora&#x27;s box.')
