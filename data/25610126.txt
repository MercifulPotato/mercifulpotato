Even for me the process was opaque and terrifying and I&#x27;m extremely lucky that no one tried to take advantage of the situation. Had I fallen into the kind of toxic nightmare described in the post, it would also would have felt insurmountable.<p>Most employers don&#x27;t understand work visas and really don&#x27;t care to but those who do surely understand the leverage they have. Even people on work visas often struggle to understand their rights since BY DESIGN they are dependent on employers for their ability to remain in the country. If you lose your job under most work visas, you need to find a new job immediately or pack up and go home regardless of the circumstances.<p>Initially, there are [safeguards][2] to prevent wage discrimination for visa workers, but eventually after receiving a work permit, before its renewal, or before an employer accepting to sponsor a green card application, the baseline level of fear you&#x27;re under effectively reduces job mobility for visa workers. Not being able to &quot;quit and just get a new job&quot; like most U.S. residents because their current one is utterly toxic, visa workers have to interview, secure a new employer, initiate a work visa transfer, all with unpredictable delays in transfer processing from USCIS which routinely leads to companies rescinding job offers because the USCIS is too slow (we&#x27;re talking months and years) to adjudicate requests.<p>The idea that someone under an OPT would launch a workers comp suit against Apple for emotional abuse is sadly very far-fetched to me. The OPT worker likely be quickly out of a job and their unemployment grace period (90 days for OPT, 60 days for H-1B) would quickly run out as interviewers for prospective jobs would ask &quot;What made you want to leave Apple after such a short time?&quot;<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uscis.gov&#x2F;working-in-the-united-states&#x2F;students-and-exchange-visitors&#x2F;optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uscis.gov&#x2F;working-in-the-united-states&#x2F;students-...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flag.dol.gov&#x2F;programs&#x2F;lca" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flag.dol.gov&#x2F;programs&#x2F;lca</a>')
