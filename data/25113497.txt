These can not be applied to Apple&#x27;s apps.<p>System-wide VPNs thankfully don&#x27;t have the same problem.<p>Can anyone weigh in on why Apple would prevent this? It&#x27;s not as though redirecting the traffic from Apple&#x27;s software will let you impersonate Apple (unless you&#x27;ve also been able to load your own fake certificates, in which case the client is already hosed). At worst you can selectively block them, no? And you can do that anyway with a hosts file.')
