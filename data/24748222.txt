When you have a steady demand for reactor pressure vessels, high pressure heat exchangers, and other specialized machinery for nuclear plants its cheaper on a per-unit basis.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure why you think weapons programs have anything to do with nuclear power generation&#x27;s supply chain. The supply chain issues pertain to the construction of pressure vessels, pumps, and pipes that need to withstand the more difficult environment inside a nuclear reactor. The only intersection that nuclear weapons manufacturing has with nuclear power is uranium enrichment. But the cost of fuel is negligible in nuclear power.<p>&gt; It will almost certainly be much cheaper than building nuclear reactors, and by a very large margin.<p>Right, just like how early nuclear advocates said it would almost certainly be cheaper than fossil fuels. We don&#x27;t know this. This isn&#x27;t a historical cost estimate, it&#x27;s cost speculation. And cost speculation fundamentally cannot account for unknown challenges.<p>&gt; But if it&#x27;s not, no big deal. We could build reactors later if by some miracle it turns out they&#x27;re needed.<p>Trillions of dollars wasted is &quot;no big deal&quot;? Not to mention, exacerbating global warming because we delayed nuclearization of our energy sector pursuing energy storage? These are pretty big deals. Decarbonization of the energy sector is going to be one of the biggest endeavors that countries conduct. It&#x27;s no time to bet on unproven technologies. We know nuclear is expensive. But we <i>know</i> that it works, and we have experience building it at scale. We&#x27;re walking in the footsteps of what we&#x27;ve done before, not bushwhacking through unknown engineering challenges.')
