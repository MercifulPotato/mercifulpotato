Questions like: Isn’t the proposal racist on its face?<p>No. The point here is not to impose a new racial hierarchy, but to remove an existing one. Race, as we have come to understand it, is a ﬁction; but, racism, as we have come to live it, is a fact. After centuries of waiting for white majorities to overturn white supremacy, it has fallen to Black people to do it themselves.<p>I am unapologetically pro-Black, not because I believe in Black supremacy, which is as false and reckless a notion as white supremacy, but rather because I insist upon Black equity and equality. In a society and system in which white supremacy is ubiquitous and inveterate, Black people need ﬁerce advocates to help restore the balance — or more precisely, to establish that balance in the ﬁrst place.&quot;')
