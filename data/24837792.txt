I should check the emoji-picker documentation to see why this happening. I&#x27;ll see if I can find an emoji picker that returns SVG. That would solve this issue definitely.<p>Regards sizing, yeah, the text size is fixed at 80px. I&#x27;ll add a control to change the font-size in upcoming updates.<p>Glad you like it so far. Will try to improve the tool soon.')
