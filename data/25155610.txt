I also have thought of offering this as a side project, but I&#x27;m glad to see someone else get to it first so I don&#x27;t have to.   Also loving the website layout.  No muss no fuss.<p>One question I don&#x27;t see answered:  If I go the rent-to-own route, then what&#x27;s the monthly price (for use of the VM and to pay the colo fees) after I&#x27;ve purchased the drive?   $5?   And is there a price cut if I want to purchase the drive outright in one payment instead of split monthly?')
