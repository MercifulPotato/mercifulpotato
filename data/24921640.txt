They caught up to Intel a few years ago.  Now they are just asserting dominance for the immediate future.<p>They&#x27;ve definitely been far behind Nvidia for a while, though.  I haven&#x27;t seriously considered an AMD GPU in almost a decade outside of budget gaming rigs, and even then I ended up going with a used Nvidia card.  Hopefully this is enough to give them a serious foothold in the high-end GPU market so they can give Nvidia competition for years to come.')
