Actions should have consequences, which is why we have rules and agreements in the real world.<p>But threats are talk, and threats often motivate action without undertaking it. So talk is, in a real sense, action. Many forms of speech can have profound effects.<p>For example, I say, &quot;Pay me $400 more a month or I will evict you.&quot; If you believe I can evict you (even if I probably can&#x27;t) then my talk has changed behavior. Can I then say, &quot;I took no action?&quot;<p>I think everyone would agree that&#x27;s not so.')
