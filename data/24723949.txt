He&#x27;d sometimes have people driving some 20+ year old economy car asking to test drive a Nissan GT-R.  When he told them they would have to run a credit check before even doing the test drive, the customers changed their mind.<p>Did he perhaps lose a couple possibly genuine sales?  Maybe, but likely not.<p>Heck, I wanted to create an appointment to test drive a Subaru BRZ and I had to put down a $500 deposit to &quot;reserve the car so they don&#x27;t sell it before then&quot;, which would have been 100% refundable if I chose not to buy the car.  I did end up buying the car, but they never charged a deposit at all.  My brother said that they probably never even actually recorded my credit card number anywhere, and the supposed requirement for a deposit exists purely to eliminate joy riders.')
