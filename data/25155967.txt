My comment had nothing to do with the comparison with turbofans, and only that large amounts of air is being moved.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the other way round - a Jet gains efficiency the more air mass it can &#x27;process&#x27;, because larger mass means you need to throw it out at a lower velocity to get the same impulse from it.<p>How is it the other way around, I explicitly said a Turbojet sacrifices efficiency to increase exit velocity.')
