IIRC, the compiler will perform automatic recursive derefs when you try to use the indexing operator `[]`, until it finds a deref target which matches the index you&#x27;re using. I doubt anything relies on that search behaviour outside of the compiler code itself.<p>I imagine abuse of specialisation could also increase the confusion, if you were so inclined.')
