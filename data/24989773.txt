Awful. Might as well be celibate, fuck. That&#x27;s no way to live. Condoms feel terrible. Double up with some other birth control and be monogamous so you don&#x27;t have to worry about disease. And fucking feel something.<p>Condoms + vasectomy. Jesus. I&#x27;d rather eat nothing but kale the rest of my life than get a vasectomy and continue to use condoms with my wife.')
