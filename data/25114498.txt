Luckily there are lots of other distros.<p>&gt;  a free upgrade from 7&#x2F;8<p>Microsoft forced that on a lot of people too, so it&#x27;s not the users fault for &quot;not paying&quot;<p>&gt; a campus license from their university, &quot;included&quot; in the computer they bought<p>Someone still payed for that, whether it is the OEM or the university. It still doesn&#x27;t excuse the practice.<p>&gt; Many of the advantages and disadvantages of various OS come down to personal taste and willingness to deal with them. There&#x27;s no need to belittle either side.<p>I agree for the most part. If you have to use windows or MacOS because it is the only OS that some specific software is compiled for, and you need the software, then I don&#x27;t blame you for using the OS. But really it&#x27;s the software developer&#x27;s fault for not releasing on all common platforms that brought the limitation in the first place.<p>But I&#x27;m sorry I am going to belittle people who defend dual payment systems as you call them. That is just pure greed.')
