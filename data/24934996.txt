And it&#x27;s a smooth gradient between them.<p>An example of data that is harmless on its own but harmful at scale is license plate reading. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;we-know-where-youve-been-ars-acquires-4-6m-license-plate-scans-from-the-cops&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;we-know-where-yo...</a> a few points tells you that a person is in a city, a few more tells you where they live, a few more tells you where they work, a few more tells you where the shop, a few more tells you who their friends are, who their associates are, if they&#x27;re seeing someone on the side, if their going to any gatherings, if they tend to frequent red light districts... ect.<p>In this way, as data is aggregated, the picture of a given person slides from blurry to clear. And a clear picture of someone is an invasive and dangerous picture of someone.<p>As a result, aggregation of &quot;public&quot; data like this is something privacy advocates generally resist. It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s is some line that&#x27;s been crossed.')
