The $320 PUT expiring in 1 year costs $240.    I purchased 2 contracts on Wednesday bc I don&#x27;t see a scenario where the price doesn&#x27;t crash back down below $60 within a year.  Expected ROI of 10-20%.  Not a large return, but also a pretty safe bet imo considering their ATH prior to this squeeze was $60, and that was back in 2007.')
