It happens in Intellij, not in the browser.<p>I can have Intellij, Firefix, and Chrome all open while typing in emacs and no typing pauses at all.<p>On the other hand, I can run Intellij alone with no other applications open, and still get pauses while typing.<p>It&#x27;s an issue with Intellij itself, not a matter of system resources.<p>That said, at least for Java, I find the benefits outweigh the costs. But I don&#x27;t find that to be true for any other language I use.')
