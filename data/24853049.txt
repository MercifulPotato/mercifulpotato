A lot of &quot;management&quot; is readily automated, look at uber, it automates the dispatcher and keeps the manual workers. This idea could be extended further up the management ladder, its just that middle management is more of a stakeholder to the consultants pushing automation so they focus on eliminating workers.<p>2. The real scary thought to me is not manual jobs being automated, but rather humans only being used for their spatial reasoning and grasping abilities and having all other agency automated away. Anecdotally this may already be the case e.g. in some warehouses.')
