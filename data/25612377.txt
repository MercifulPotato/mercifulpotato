Item(by='mikewarot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609590762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609316, text='&gt;We actually have tried several times to build programming languages that break out of the textual programming style that we use. Visual programming languages exist, and there&#x27;s a massive list of them on Wikipedia. However, they don&#x27;t appear to actually be superior to regular old textual programming languages.<p>A lot of the time I spent doing the Advent of Code last month was wishing I could just highlight a chunk of text and tell the computer &quot;this is an X&quot;... instead of typing out all the syntactic sugar.<p>Now, there is nothing that this approach could do that you can&#x27;t do typing things out... except for the impedance mismatch between all that text, and my brain wanting to get something done.  If you look at it terms of expressiveness, there is nothing to gain... but if you consider speed, ease of use, and avoiding errors, there might be an order of magnitude improvement in productivity.<p>Yet... in the end, it could always translate the visual markup back to syntactic sugar.')
