Sure enough, I unplugged it and it seamlessly switched to Bluetooth. That was a level of integration I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and without ever installing any DualShock-specific package.<p>Unfortunately, one of the reasons I bought the controller was to try out the pressure sensitive face buttons, and PCSX2 on Linux didn&#x27;t seem to support that? On Windows, PCSX2 can do this with ScpToolkit, but that seems to be abandoned. Still, for the 99% of games that don&#x27;t need pressure sensitive face buttons, the DS3 integration in Linux was literally perfect.')
