What these all have in common is they try to project negative light on the person they are used against and make the reader view their information negatively. It&#x27;s absurd to me, that asking for some reference and citation to the subject at hand, now has a label word to dismiss it, out of hand. It&#x27;s been a while since I have been in higher education, but IIRC citation and references where pretty much the basis of research and publication of ideas.')
