Social contact with your peers is important too. having to forfeit that just to not be in a prison-like system seems like a bad deal.</i><p>This is why above-average students should just go to college after a year or two of high school. 16 year olds and 18 year olds are in fact peers (or can be without drawing arbitrary lines).<p><i>&gt; I think in both cases we need to fix the system instead of putting the burden onto students to put up with it or work around it with the solutions that you describe. </i><p>The problem is that your suggestion is completely non-actionable for students.<p>It&#x27;s also not particularly actionable for a parent trying to help their school-aged child <i>today</i>. Even if a parent does manage to change a huge entrenched institution -- highly unlikely! -- it&#x27;ll be at least a decade after their own kid is out of the system.<p>So. Yes, I agree, you too should run for school board. But don&#x27;t count on systemic change if you&#x27;re trying to help someone currently in the system.')
