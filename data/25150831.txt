Lots of internal tools are really buggy on anything but Chrome, so I have little choice. There&#x27;s lots of copy-paste of URLs, including fragments, and it&#x27;s really jarring to have the text suddenly change right after a mouse-up. It&#x27;s surprising and unpleasant. And of course the browser tries to modify the selection between mouse-up and copy to make sure I get the whole thing, so now the software is not doing what I told it to.<p>It seems harmless to show the full URL and not bait-and-switch the text upon interaction. I don&#x27;t see it as the browser&#x27;s job to protect users from their incompetence.')
