The difference between cherry browns and cherry clears is huge!<p>If someone gets a switch that feels like the brown but is totally silent, they will take the market, but it&#x27;s hard to see how that is possible. The keys have to be stopped by something to get the correct feel, current attempts to use o-rings create a different feel. It&#x27;s hard to see how you can do that and be totally silent.')
