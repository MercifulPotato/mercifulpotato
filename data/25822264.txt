What&#x27;s interesting though is how many supporters there of the idea that extremely large quantities of people 100% &quot;hook, line, and sinker&quot; buy into such fake news stories  - based, ironically, on <i>fake-news-like</i> articles assuring us (with specious evidence, if any) that this is the true state of reality.<p>The world is amazingly paradoxical if you look at it from the proper abstract angle.')
