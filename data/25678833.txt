Item(by='wayneftw', descendants=None, kids=[25679012], score=None, time=1610060190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25677950, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;agqXWWJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;agqXWWJ</a><p>That&#x27;s me pasting your comment into a reply box and then using my iPhone 8 to move the cursor around. Once I start moving the cursor all I&#x27;m doing is moving it, nothing else. You can see that it starts selecting text randomly twice. It actually took me longer to trigger it this time than usual.<p>I think it happens when I moved to the top of the text and then make a downward motion. It&#x27;s really, really annoying on a regular basis.')
