In academia and scientific computing, the landscape is completely different.<p>Most of the software is written Linux-first. Because it&#x27;s both easier to move on to clusters and open source philosophy (GPL &amp; MIT licenses) is more prominent than ever.<p>A lot of the cutting edge tools are open source and there&#x27;s a strange model in some: Software is free, code is open, but for research you need a license. You need to give your license number in your publication otherwise it might get rejected and&#x2F;or retracted and you&#x27;d be fined by the company developing the software.<p>Forking is not feasible since both the software is well known and developing that kind of scientific software is very hard (to put it mildly).<p>Yes, MATLAB works everywhere but, MATLAB is not the peak scientific software. It&#x27;s generally the base camp where you start. If you want MPI even for local runs, you&#x27;re in *NIX land, squarely.<p>There are also other interesting software, like Singularity which can run containers as non-privileged users and some software (like OpenFOAM) is also available as a prebuilt container.')
