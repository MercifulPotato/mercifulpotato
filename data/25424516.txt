Object Pascal had this feature by default: you have to declare public methods and then implement it in a different section. I always missed that in Java and separate interface allows to recreate that pattern.<p>Sure, you might want to say that I should just use IDE which will show me all public methods in a GUI tree control. But I don&#x27;t like it, I like code. May be some feature which completely hides anything in the class except public method declarations could substitute, but I did not see that feature yet.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with an interface, even if there&#x27;s a single implementation. Idea and Eclipse allows you to jump to implementation with a single click if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. JIT will replace virtual method calls with direct ones.')
