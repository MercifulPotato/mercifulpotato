Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25862902, 25862852, 25862407, 25863115], score=None, time=1611253563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25860451, text='I am genuinely sorry that so many men appear to grow up in a culture that teaches this about women. It&#x27;s deeply misogynist, and makes the assumption that women must hate men just as much.<p>This simply isn&#x27;t the case. The vast majority of women genuinely like men. Not as penises to be notched, but as human beings. Many of them want a long-term partner because it makes them feel good. It&#x27;s nice to have a person they can rely on and develop a life with. It&#x27;s hard enough to find one person for that, and many are content with finding that one person. For most women that&#x27;s going to mean finding one man.<p>And that gets even harder when faced with the sheer number of men who seem to think the way you do, seeing women as commodities on a &quot;super efficient market&quot; to meet their &quot;sexual needs&quot; -- and threatening &quot;antisocial activity&quot; when they&#x27;re not met. If you ever wonder why women refuse to date you, you can cross off everything you think is at the top of your list -- money, attractiveness, ambition, whatever. Every reason women refuse to date you is in your post here, and none of the others matters even a tiny fraction as much as you think it does.<p>Your &quot;sexual frustration&quot; has nothing to do with women. If you need an orgasm, go take care of it yourself. If what you want is a trophy of your economic and sexual prowess, don&#x27;t use a human being for that. If what you want is a partner in life -- including one who takes an interest in your sexuality -- stop talking about them as if that were a commodity to be purchased or a prize to be won. And certainly not as predators looking to use you, because that&#x27;s precisely how you are appearing to them.<p>Women are human beings. Seek out a human connection with them, and you&#x27;ll discover that that&#x27;s something that they want, too. That doesn&#x27;t make it easy to find one who is a good match that stands up to years or decades. But that&#x27;s not the reason you&#x27;re alone, brooding about how better men are taking up all the women.')
