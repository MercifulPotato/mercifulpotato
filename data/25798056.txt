It&#x27;s clear that the Trump administration&#x27;s goal is simply to cripple every major Chinese tech company.<p>So far, China hasn&#x27;t really responded, but it&#x27;s hard to believe they&#x27;ll just sit back forever. My guess is that the Chinese government is waiting to see what Biden&#x27;s approach will be, and that they&#x27;ll retaliate if Biden does not roll back some of Trump&#x27;s measures.')
