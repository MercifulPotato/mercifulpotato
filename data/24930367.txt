It&#x27;s the one that most gives the illusion of truly wireless charging.<p>With MagSafe charging now I imagine I&#x27;ll have to lift my phone and presumably detach the MagSafe puck at the same time, making it more cumbersome than what I do now, which is just lifting the phone off the Qi charger.
