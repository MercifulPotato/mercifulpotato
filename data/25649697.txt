If the interest rate is $900&#x2F;month, you&#x27;re paying off $1000&#x2F;month in principal each month, and making $100&#x2F;month in profit that is applied to the home equity.  You can then go use that equity to take out <i>another</i> loan on the property, make $100&#x2F;month in profit, repeat.  Or go buy a different property with a different lender, if the bank starts getting suspicious.  If you can&#x27;t afford the increased payments...well, that&#x27;s what a loan is for, particularly one that you&#x27;re making a profit off. ;-)')
