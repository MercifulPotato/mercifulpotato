Item(by='hardwaregeek', descendants=None, kids=[24872690, 24875360, 24872761], score=None, time=1603479004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871348, text='I&#x27;ve become skeptical of people talking about technical debt and clean code and all the standard Fowler&#x2F;Uncle Bob&#x2F;PragProg-isms. Not because they&#x27;re wrong. If anything they&#x27;re all right, but in a rather vacuous, well-yeah way. Yes technical debt is bad. Yes we should start with a design. Yes we should do refactoring. But using the analogy of the author, that&#x27;s like telling someone who&#x27;s overweight and eating a lot of junk food that they should &quot;eat healthier and exercise&quot;. Well yeah. They probably knew that already.<p>And so many people try to make it a dichotomy. Like that diagram of a project with a design versus without. That&#x27;s not a fair comparison. What does a design even mean? Wireframes? A written document of features? How do we change this design? What&#x27;s the way in which we get feedback? And what sort of projects are we talking here? A programming language is very different from a website. And what even counts as no design?<p>Some other notes:<p><pre><code>  - I&#x27;m not sure the author correctly used the Pareto principle. It&#x27;s not just a generic &quot;split things into 80&#x2F;20&quot; but a specific observation on how 20% of the causes result in 80% of the effects.\n\n  - The post could have used a quick proofread. There&#x27;s quite a few spelling mistakes and poorly phrased sentences. I totally get if the author is not a native speaker, but they could easily enlist one to help (if the author wishes, I&#x27;d be happy to proofreadâ€”contact me).\n\n  - I get the whole &quot;make this post fun with cats!&quot; but honestly I&#x27;d prefer a straightforward example with no funny images. Maybe that&#x27;s just my grumpiness.</code></pre>')
