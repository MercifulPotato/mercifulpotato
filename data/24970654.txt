This package provides the best of both worlds.<p>Description:\nA Python dataclass container with multi-indexing and bulk operations. Provides the typed benefits and ergonomics of dataclasses while having the efficiency of Pandas dataframes.<p>The container is based on data-oriented design by optimising the memory layout of the stored data, providing fast bulk operations and a smaller memory footprint for large collections.
