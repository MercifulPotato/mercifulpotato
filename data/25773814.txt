Remote attestation provides a cryptographic guarantee of the code that is running in a remote enclave over a network.<p>&gt; Originally designed for DRM applications, most SGX examples imagine an SGX enclave running on a client. This would allow a server to stream media content to a client enclave with the assurance that the client software requesting the media is the “authentic” software that will play the media only once, instead of custom software that reverse engineered the network API call and will publish the media as a torrent instead.</i>')
