Or rather, it would, were all the apps for the latest compatible iOS version still available.<p>But they&#x27;re not, and there&#x27;s no way (sort of jailbreak) to install them otherwise.<p>So hardware is fully functional (for the most part), but can only be used as a slow browser. The fault here is in (a) mandating use of a single store, combined with (b) not supporting the store longer.<p>I understand nobody wants to maintain services for 9yo hardware, but since they wanted to be a gatekeeper, I place the blame squarely on them.<p>Meanwhile, my 13yo X220 works like a charm.')
