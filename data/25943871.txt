So BLM riots have had a worse impact.<p>Your statement is dense with issues:<p>1. You&#x27;re comparing a single &quot;protest&quot; to a protest <i>movement</i>.  Also, where did you get a figure like &quot;12-19&quot;?<p>2. There are documented and confirmed cases of capitol-riot-type people using the BLM protests as <i>cover</i> for violence (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcchicago.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;illinois-man-accused-of-handing-out-explosives-at-minneapolis-protest&#x2F;2282034&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcchicago.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;illinois-man-accused-o...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;23&#x2F;texas-boogaloo-boi-minneapolis-police-building-george-floyd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;23&#x2F;texas-boogaloo...</a>).  The attempts to blame the capital riots on &quot;antifa&quot; are groundless.<p>3. The capitol rioters deliberately struck at the democratic process itself (e.g. process of conducting a fair election) because they rejected the results of that process, which is a far more serious thing than any traditional protest, no matter how violent.')
