You canâ€™t (trivially) reverse the effects of oxygen. This is why Coravin exists: replace the air (with oxygen) with an inert gas. You can do the same for cheap by putting the wine in a container (preferably gas) that reduces its exposure to oxygen, ideally entirely. There are companies selling other tools that do this, like an inflatable device that goes into a bottle.')
