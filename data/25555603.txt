Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=[25555631], score=None, time=1609116242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554018, text='I don&#x27;t want to outright dismiss this piece as &quot;argument bait&quot;, but it is essentially just a bunch of assertions on what other people should do with virtually no rationale and a bunch of shade thrown around deliberately. Sure, we all like to have a good argument, and C++ is an easy target, but this seems wholly unproductive from the get-go. If there was any intent of <i>convincing</i> others then this isn&#x27;t how to do it.<p>I would also like to know who or what the &quot;Orthodox C++ committee&quot; is. A search only gets you this exact gist. Is the author himself the committee? That really doesn&#x27;t put this piece into a better light.')
