The biggest example seems to be Citadel, which got to play both sides by trading on Robinhood&#x27;s order flow and <i>also</i> investing in Melvin at a steep discount.<p>My point remains, though: where was the concern <i>before</i> the r&#x2F;wallstreetbets saga? GME was at ~$4 last summer and made it up to ~$20 by the end of last year. If the hedge funds were right and it was massively overvalued, where was the concern for retail investors taking out long positions <i>back then</i>? And conversely, if the hedge funds were <i>wrong</i>, where was the concern for the GameStop workers?<p>We can go back and forth about the winners and losers, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that no one really cared about the &quot;ordinary people&quot; before some hedge funds got caught with their pants down.')
