Item(by='scoutt', descendants=None, kids=[25136578], score=None, time=1605695100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130316, text='&gt; Rust has very few OOP features like an optional notion of a `self` on a function bound to a structure. There&#x27;s no classes, no subclassing, no message passing, no inheritance at all (structure, interface or implementation), limited dynamic dispatch, no polymorphism.<p>As an embedded developer for a living, if you put it that way, then the first thing it comes to my mind is &quot;so why should I bother learning Rust&quot; for embedded.<p>Other than the usual &quot;please consider UB and network&#x2F;memory handling&#x2F;security issues&quot; (reasons that don&#x27;t really affect me), so far nobody could provide a convincing answer.<p>It&#x27;s not that the usual answer I get is wrong or invalid or doesn&#x27;t have a point. But if I ask &quot;ok, what else?&quot; there is really little motivation for me to move on.<p>Someone once told me I&#x27;ll become an <i>outdated curmudgeon</i> here on HN, but I think I&#x27;ll be long gone before something truly deserves to replace C for embedded (and low level).')
