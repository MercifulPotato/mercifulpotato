Technically the complaint here is against pip, but I guess they have similar terms and conditions.<p>On the other hand, you would have enjoyed a royalty-free, world-wide permission to use, distribute, and modify the code base at your will.<p>So I&#x27;d say, not a bad wager if you&#x27;re willing to do the extra work of keeping your software up to date over time (which otherwise you&#x27;d have been paying someone to do, in case of a proprietary infrastructure).')
