Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603703199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891457, text='By meta discussion I mean Hacker News threads about Hacker News. Meta is the crack of internet forums. Users tend to flag such threads and moderators tend to moderate them because they&#x27;re mostly all the same, they breed like rabbits if allowed to, and they&#x27;re not actually interestingâ€”they&#x27;re internet drama, which feels interesting but isn&#x27;t. Such pseudo-content is also a risk to the site because it pleases&#x2F;riles the self-obsessed minority (I mean the minority of HN users who are obsessed with HN, which certainly includes me) but leaves the majority of the audience cold. This is one way for an internet forum to lose its audience, and our #1 job is to prevent HN from killing itself.<p>This is bog standard HN moderation, btw, and has been the same for many years: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=by%3Adang%20%22meta%22&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu...</a>. Even my analogies have been the same for years: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=by%3Adang%20meta%20crack&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu...</a>. Everyone who rushes to post such a thread feels like <i>this</i> is the one that changes everything, but that&#x27;s just part of how the crack works.<p>I realize that your intention was good and that what I&#x27;m saying here must sound cynical and heavyhanded, but you have to understand what it&#x27;s like to see these things a hundred times and realize that they&#x27;re never any different and never lead anywhere. If they don&#x27;t make you feel weary and slightly nauseated, that must be because you haven&#x27;t seen so many of them yet.')
