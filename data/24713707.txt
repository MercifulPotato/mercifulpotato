If you reveal and ace, return to step 1 since this history is eliminated from the story we&#x27;ve been told: we know this wasn&#x27;t a possible path to our endgame. Otherwise continue to step 4.<p>Step 4: Which of the remaining two cards is more likely to be an ace?<p>Step 5: Realize that they&#x27;re just as likely as each other to be the ace. Step 2 didn&#x27;t magically imbue the card remaining in the pair with extra probability juice.<p>Long story short, you definitely need Monty to make an intelligent selection, so Monty&#x27;s knowledge is far from irrelevant. It matters whether he revealed a goat by luck or by knowledge, because he&#x27;s 2x as likely to get &quot;lucky&quot; in the case where there are 2 goats behind the doors you didn&#x27;t choose in your original guess.')
