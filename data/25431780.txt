We can just elect another diplomat in their place. There isn&#x27;t enough turnover of diplomats anyway and they typically have too much power or they know too much stuff that their citizens don&#x27;t know - It creates a massive disconnect between politicians and citizens. Maybe they should be less powerful and more disposable. If every country had highly disposable diplomats and government officials, everything would probably be much better for everyone and each country should mind its own business.<p>No matter how you put it, diplomatic immunity disproves the idea that everyone is equal under the law. You can&#x27;t have diplomatic immunity and also have everyone equal under the law. It&#x27;s a logical contradiction. You have to choose one or the other or else it&#x27;s impossible to know where to draw the line.')
