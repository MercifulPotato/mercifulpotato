It cannot subsequently be removed from the user without its consent, made to produce invalid outputs, rendered useless or less valuable.\n&quot;Programs do not wear and cannot be used to extort money from users.&quot;<p>Programs must not ignore users inputs solely based on a probability of them being wrong.\n&quot;Unusual input is not necessarily invalid&quot;<p>Users can always override program outputs that are based on probability or incomplete information.\n&quot;In autonomous vehicles, justice, profiling&quot;<p>Documentation for the program must be provided to the user.
