In fact it&#x27;s even worst with svelte because it&#x27;s compiled only (which is it&#x27;s unique selling point) whereas vue can be used in a much more progressive manner.  React is a little bit harder because of jsx, but it&#x27;s still not that much more complicated.<p>Build-wise, parcel supports jsx&#x2F;vue files out of the box. Plus React&#x2F;vue both have cli tools that I don&#x27;t like and wouldn&#x27;t recommend, but are super easy to get started with.<p>And this all comes with the giant caveat that react&#x2F;vue make progress which can lead to confusing versions. Svelte is a lot younger (kind of, it came out a few years back, so idk) so it hasn&#x27;t had to cross that bridge yet. And even then, there was the confusion with Sapper. I highly doubt that svelte is going to be immune from the fast-paced nature of these frameworks.')
