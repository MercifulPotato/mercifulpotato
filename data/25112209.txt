This may be caused by a misconfiguration or an attacker intercepting your connection.<p>Edit: Hah! And HN is also guilty of being confused by this. My comment now says &quot;xn-coronoprver-ngb&quot; when viewed from the outside, but my comment field correctly says &quot;coronaprøver&quot; when editing the comment...')
