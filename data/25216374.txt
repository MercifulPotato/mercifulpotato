I don’t care about the effect on <i>you</i> personally. If their existence causes more carbon through a <i>combination</i> of: a) ineffective programs and b) secondary physiological effects, then no one should support them (and ideally, they would just be disallowed by regulators — as it would be both in consumers and environmental interests — and replaced with mechanisms and incentives that actually work).<p>For clarity: I think they probably do work and there’s value there, but I think there are good reasons to be skeptical and evaluate carefully.')
