I work with WordPress (setting up eCommerce sites or applications with custom functionalities), Python for more than a few things (messing up with textual data for ML and Django for web applications), JavaScript for some front-end work (currently learning React and Svelte) and static site generators (mostly Hugo). *I am also interested in (entry-medium level or even academic) jobs in Machine Learning, especially for tasks where I could work with lots and lots of text and tabular data and get insights from them (clustering, classification, summarization, recommender systems, etc). Thank you for your time')
