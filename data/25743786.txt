Overall assembly cost may be higher or lower depending on those other changes. It really is just that $0.0273 for the switch, which compared to the very steep marketing and branding challenge of convincing privacy-minded folks that Amazon isn&#x27;t evil, is nothing.<p>I love how people on HN can rationalize every imaginable bad thing, and figure out reasons why the good thing is really, truly impossible. Qwerty is superior to any alternative, healthcare in the US is completely rational, we can&#x27;t build cheap tunnels but at least we build the best tunnels, English spelling is a feature not a bug, as are Imperial units by the way, and college education is optimally priced.')
