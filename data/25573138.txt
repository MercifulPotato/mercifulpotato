Families of lower socioeconomic status were underrepresented as part of the initial sample group and therefore needed recruitment via referrals and fliers to add and diversify the sample group.&quot;<p>The sample size of the study in the article is way too small in my opinion to apply to the whole US population, I wish they didn&#x27;t put it behind a paywall because they still might have some interesting insights on the local&#x2F;regional scale :(. They mention the only city used in the study is &quot;a large north-western city&quot;. Doing some back of the envelope math I just used Seattle as an example.<p>- Seattle has ~800k people today and ~610k people 10 years ago.

Their real sample size is probably at least an order of magnitude less than the size of the city so &lt; ~0.1%.<p>I am interested in the study though just not $60 interested :(.')
