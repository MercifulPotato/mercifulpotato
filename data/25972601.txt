This is the property of hash functions that we make use of when hashing passwords, generating signatures, validating files and so on.<p>We assume that hash functions are one-way functions but to prove the existence of one-way functions is one of the big unsolved problems in computer science. Additionally it has been shown that if one-way functions exist, that P != NP.<p>With that in mind, we cannot confidently say that &quot;Hashes cannot be undone&quot;. While it might still be impossible to find the exact input that was used (unlimited input range vs limited output range), it would be possible to find a possible input resulting in the output you are looking at.<p>The Wikipedia article [0] is a good starting point for more information.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;One-way_function" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;One-way_function</a>')
