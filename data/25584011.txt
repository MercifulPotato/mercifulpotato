I still own that house and rent it out through a rental agency, but that&#x27;s definitely not the best return on investment on that money (it&#x27;s not the kind of property you would&#x27;ve bought if your goal was to maximize return on investment).<p>I would own a home again some day just because there&#x27;s things you can do with a property you own that you can&#x27;t do when you rent, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be approaching it as if it were an investment like I did in 2012.  I&#x27;d be financially better off (admittedly to an insignificant degree) had I not bought that house, and I certainly put a lot more of my time and effort into it in those 18 months than I would have if I&#x27;d continued renting.')
