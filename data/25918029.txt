Especially for consumers - the big difference between Blackblaze and regular users is that they have their disks spinning continuously, and the reliability numbers seem to only apply in that scenario. If you switch off and store a drive my experience is that after a year it&#x27;s very high probability it won&#x27;t switch on again. This is a big problem in academic labs where grad students generate terabytes of data and professors and departments are too stingy to provide managed storage services in that scale so it all sits in degrading drives in some drawer in the lab.')
