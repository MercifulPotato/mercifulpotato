As an aside, when I was a student, we also had an applications module called &quot;Numerical Analysis&quot;. We went through a bunch of algorithms (Cholesky, Seidel, Newton-Raphson, Gauss, etc.) and ran them by hand. We basically were &quot;human computers&quot;. The exams were also solving problems using these algorithms, and given the iterative nature of many of them, if you make a tiny mistake it&#x27;ll ripple and ruin everything for you.<p>As an aside, my background is in optimal control&#x2F;control theory and instrumentation, and operational calculus, state space representations, and matrices were a huge part of the &quot;Jiu-Jitsu&quot; we did. Tinkering with RST control, robust systems, finding optimal systems and sequences (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Pontryagin) with matrices flying around on our exam papers solving these systems. It was a nice abstraction.<p>Very, very, powerful tools that command immense respect for Laplace, Lagrange, and people like them who invented things to solve problems we&#x27;re facing now.')
