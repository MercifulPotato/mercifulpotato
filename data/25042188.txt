They&#x27;ve never been that, and the idea that they&#x27;d become that for Donald Trump seems pretty implausible. They rule on questions of law, and they rule based on their legal philosophies. Yes, you see the reasoning look a bit motivated sometimes (looking at you, Alito and Breyer), but the idea that these are people who will throw away their credibility and careers to abet a coup? Naaaah.<p>They&#x27;d have a hard enough time going after gay marriage -- I&#x27;d bet Gorsuch and Kavanaugh would vote to uphold Obergefell today if they heard it, and we already know Roberts&#x27; vote.')
