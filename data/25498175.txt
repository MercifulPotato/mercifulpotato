Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25498627], score=None, time=1608577394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497790, text='&gt; Cancer and other disease are extremely expensive to treat and fairly common in the population. Yet, somehow, emergency care which is a minority of health costs, eats up 10% of the spending.<p>Emergency care is not actually uncommon. Heart attacks, car accidents, these are the leading causes of death. It&#x27;s completely reasonable to expect this to legitimately consume 10% of healthcare resources.<p>&gt; Anyone that&#x27;s been to an emergency room knows how excessive the price gouging going on there is. Pills that cost $0.10 OTC (or less!) routinely see 100x markup. That same pill can cost anywhere from $10-&gt;$15.<p>This is just opportunism, but it isn&#x27;t really the core of the problem.<p>Emergency care is inherently expensive for a specific reason. You need an emergency heart surgeon on premises in case anybody needs heart surgery regardless of whether anybody does at any given time. You also need a neurosurgeon and one for every other specialty, and all the supporting equipment. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> expensive, which is why it amounts to 10% of healthcare costs.<p>They then try to recover some of those costs by massively overcharging for ibuprofen and band-aids, which is silly (charge insurers the actual cost for emergency heart surgery instead), but it&#x27;s not going to be a source of major net cost savings just to do the accounting differently.')
