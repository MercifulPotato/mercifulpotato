(The ending of Player of Games was a bit too much, but looking back, it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s not really a big part (if I remember that part is ~10 pages, from the moment the drone forces Morat&#x27;s hand to the king&#x27;s demise). Oh, and the comically villainous dude in The Algebraist seems like a gag. (With the sentient punchbag.)')
