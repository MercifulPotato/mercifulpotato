We are obviously missing the point if we are wasting time on new features when no one can use the old features.<p>&gt;The &quot;safety numbers&quot; concept does need to be learned, but I think it is way easier to explain than PGP key management.<p>If the question is &quot;why do I have to care when the safety number changes&quot; then the answer still involves the basic concept of cryptography identity in both cases.')
