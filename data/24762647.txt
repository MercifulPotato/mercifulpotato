One states that he became a follower of the Buddha at&#x2F;after the Battle of Kalinga. This is a rock edict attributed to <i>Ashoka</i>. It does not explicitly say that he converted but rather embraced the monastic path.<p>The second which is a Buddhist textual source, says that he was always Buddhist, and he in fact had 18,000~ Jain monks put to death because their spiritual leader insulted the Buddha. Why would a Buddhist source lie?<p>Modern historians play up the first source and bury the latter.')
