If public transportation is not reliable, make it reliable. If people aren&#x27;t paid enough, improve wage and labor requirements. Many countries provide for their workers&#x27; transportation without Uber, so why can&#x27;t we?<p>For example:<p>&gt; But if you&#x27;re on the lower income scale and you need Uber to help you get between your second and third job (because you can&#x27;t afford a car and public transit is unreliable) or you need it to get to a doctor&#x27;s appointment, this kind of change is a big deal.<p>If this is the problem we&#x27;re solving for (getting you between multiple distant jobs that you desperately need to make ends meet), and have determined that Uber is the only or best solution, we have already failed. The solution to poverty is not serfdom.')
