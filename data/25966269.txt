There are, alas, perhaps a dozen or more dimensions along which recipes are going to be difficult to sanitize and normalize—there’s weight vs volume, variations in how to describe similar ingredients, and perhaps worst of all is the actual steps!<p>But are these challenges insurmountable? Well, maybe a few would limit you in some respects, but it certainly can’t be denied that some intrepid coder-cook could push this concept somewhat further.<p>You could also turn this all around and have a “consensus recipe generator.” Type in “pesto genovese” and it gives you a best guess of ingredients and amounts, with links to some recipes roughly matching those consensus amounts, perhaps with notable variations&#x2F;“nearby” recipe clusters (sun-dried tomato pesto? or just the most popular pine nut substitute?) noted too.')
