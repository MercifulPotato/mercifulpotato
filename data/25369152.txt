YouTube doesn&#x27;t prevent people from finding other hosting for their own videos and linking people to those videos. Do people have any more right to YouTube&#x27;s megaphone than they do to any specific newspaper or TV channel&#x27;s reach?<p>I despise people pushing anti-vaccination misinformation. Would it be good for us to fight for their right to have their message to be uncritically broadcast on say NBC? I might care if the government made a law that was ambiguously too broad that happened to make it so antivaxers couldn&#x27;t possibly be broadcast on TV at all, and it was clear that antivaxers winning that fight against that overly-broad law would open things up for other groups I thought the law was too strict against, but if it&#x27;s just the case that every TV station decided of their own will and probably specific reasons to not broadcast them, then even if I thought all the TV stations were generally too strict, I&#x27;d pick something I actually liked that they were being too strict against to support to convince the stations to change their opinions.')
