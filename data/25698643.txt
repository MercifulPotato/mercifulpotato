Segmented networks sound fine in principle, but there&#x27;s a pathological behavior happening: there&#x27;s a group of people around the core instances that like to take offense over things, who then try to pressure the administrator of that person&#x27;s instance to ban that person, or else they&#x27;ll defederate the whole instance. The source of offense may be some wrongthing the person posted, or reposted from another instance, or any &quot;known association&quot;, etc. Also defederation because of incompatible codes of conduct is a thing, and as you expect, this creates a pressure towards CoC extremism.<p>The Gab thing was funny to watch, lots of people behaving as if that service was a literal existential threat to Fediverse, and banning - or advocating to ban - anything related to it up to two degrees of separation. It also revealed an interesting pattern - Mastodon itself may be decentralized and instances are theoretically independent, but there for sure is a <i>community</i> of Fediverse people that&#x27;s pretty hiveminded. And left-leaning. Gab definitely wasn&#x27;t welcome, and wouldn&#x27;t be able to benefit much from federating through Mastodon, even if technically nobody could stop them.<p>(To be clear: I don&#x27;t like Gab, never interacted with it, and I don&#x27;t particularly care about it. It was just weird to see the degree of moral panic on Mastodon happening the moment they <i>said</i> they are considering joining the network.)<p>Mastodon is therefore an interesting experiment in how the ideal of distributed web - of virtual archipelago[0] - falls to realpolitik. Freedom of curation is limited by your ability to deal with threats of defederation.<p>In this sense, when you&#x27;re switching from Twitter to Mastodon, you&#x27;re switching from a stable tyranny to highly volatile sorta-democracy. Pick your poison, I guess. I stick to Mastodon, and try not to give the admin a reason to get me banned for going against the party line.<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;archipelago-and-atomic...</a>')
