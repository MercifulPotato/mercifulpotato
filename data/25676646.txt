Tolls, car registration fees, property taxes, etc are all taxes.  Therefore, they are very relevant when discussing CPI, as it directly affects your bottom line.<p>I specifically wrote the &quot;goods and services I want&quot; so real estate that I&#x27;m not interested in doesn&#x27;t concern me.  I have to plan my life around buying real estate that I want, and so if the price of that real estate is increasing, then it&#x27;s once again affecting my bottom line.<p>Education and healthcare being social and fiscal policy issues is irrelevant to me for budgeting purposes.  All I am concerned with is the price to achieve the life I want for myself and my kids.<p>I am predicting that the items I am interested in buying are worth $x in year 2021, but will be worth $y in year 2030, and the difference in $x and $y will be more than what is predicted by official CPI numbers.  This has proven true for the last 15 to 20 years for me.')
