I have fallen for it numerous times.<p>The problem is when you&#x27;re working for yourself (or a worthy non-commercial cause) work feels more fun and worthwhile, but the health damage is kind of the same (long hours, lack of exercises, sub-optimal nutrition). Despite it &quot;feeling good,&quot; working in this over-capacity regime ends up really inefficient (since you&#x27;re tired and not seeing the big picture).<p>One thing that I find helps is to get other people involved (e.g. collaborators, reviewers, users, etc) then allow yourself to take breaks, while still knowing work on the project is continuing by others.')
