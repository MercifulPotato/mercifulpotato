Are all of the criticism on here valid? We&#x27;ll find out soon enough. Will a tax like this actually change behavior in desired ways, or provide a useful amount of revenue? We&#x27;ll find that out, too.<p>But what this tax will <i>not</i> do is change the very nature of San Francisco or dramatically alter its business environment. The tax is just too small for that to be the case. It&#x27;s a tiny addition to a vast and complex and ever-changing web of taxes and regulations that large businesses in SF have been successfully dealing with for generations.')
