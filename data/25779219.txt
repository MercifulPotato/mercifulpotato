At least where I am located calling it a lockdown is a bit of a stretch.  That said, I haven&#x27;t been going out, going to other people&#x27;s homes, or inviting people to mine.  I do miss going out to get lunch, dinner, and drinks.  However, I&#x27;ve saved quite a bit not doing those things.<p>The biggest positive change for me has been eliminating my commute, which usually takes 2-3 hours per day.  I&#x27;ve used that time for weightlifting and have stuck with it 3-5 (usually 5) days a week since March.  I have also been able to get more sleep due to not needing to get up as early to commute to work.<p>Beyond that, I have a much easier time focusing in my home office.  Most workplaces are loud and distracting.  Peopling walking by or having impromptu conversations by your desk is a major distraction that seems to happen every day in an office.')
