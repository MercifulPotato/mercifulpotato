Item(by='adenozine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612183691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987847, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reasonablypolymorphic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;elm-is-wrong&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reasonablypolymorphic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;elm-is-wrong&#x2F;</a><p>Here&#x27;s a good starting place. Look for some discussions about typeclasses and read for yourself. Ask yourself if you&#x27;d bet on this person, and if you&#x27;d build critical tools for your org with a tool dictated by them.<p>I have no ill will for Elm. I&#x27;m grateful it exists and that we can all learn. I&#x27;d never invest in it though, it&#x27;s too much a risk for things that could affect my ability to put food on the table quickly enough.<p>I&#x27;m not a frontend guy, so if some crazy frontend bug happened and crunched up my landing page or any of my forms, I&#x27;m not confident that I could debug it fast. I hate to say it, but honestly I think TS has to be the future of front end web. It&#x27;s simply too solid to consider very many other options.<p>The one-man-running-the-show act kinda works for small things, like Tarsnap is a great example. But for languages that are powering business frontends, I can&#x27;t have some goofball with a bad opinion holding up progress on something important.')
