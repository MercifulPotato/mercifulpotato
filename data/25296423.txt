Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607035772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293869, text='There is no way to lower the platform safely. The cables are anchored to the saddle block you see in the drone footage.<p>The closest you can get to a safe lowering would be to sever all the anchor points simultaneously so that the platform falls vertically, rather than having a rotational component due to differing total tension forces. And even then, I don&#x27;t see how that can be done particularly safely, given that any human in proximity to any of the towers at the time of premature collapse would be dead.<p>Just to reiterate: any person working on the support tower platform would have been dead. If not from the cable snapping (you can see how much damage it does to the remaining cables!), then from the support tower itself toppling over a few seconds later.')
