Item(by='pedro_benteveo', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1612216853, title='Unreal Engine 4 Editor Plugin Development Tutorial', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hello all,<p>Previously I posted my tutorial series here and had some interest. I thought I&#x27;d post an update to let you know that the third part in the series is now online as well. So far I&#x27;ve covered:<p>Creating a UI Toolbar button to duplicate an asset (in this case a map) from the plugin to the project in part 1. This also deals with user input in the form of dialogs.<p>Adding context menu items to perform modification to assets in disk, as well as using the Unreal Engine source code to implement undocumented functionality, such as adding sublevels in editor in part 2. This covers some API changes that have been recently introduced and which you may have to deal with if you are interested in using the latest versions of Unreal Engine.<p>Modifying project settings programmatically. In particular, we are changing the default levels and creating a custom ActionMapping, as well as investigating how to change other settings that may be relevant for you in part 3.<p>Part 1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benteveo.kiwi&#x2F;blog&#x2F;advanced-unreal-engine-tutorial-part-1\nPart 2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benteveo.kiwi&#x2F;blog&#x2F;plugin-development-in-unreal-part-2\nPart 3: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benteveo.kiwi&#x2F;blog&#x2F;plugin-development-in-unreal-part-3<p>Part 4 will be focused on implementing gameplay elements and Part 5 will be focused on implementing unit tests and integration tests.<p>As you can see the lessons in the tutorial are pretty generic, and hopefully they can help you extrapolate the knowledge that you may require to implement your own custom plugin.<p>Let me know if you find it useful, and if you want me to write about any particular topics.<p>Thanks,\nPedro')
