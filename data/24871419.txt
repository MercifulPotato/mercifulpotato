If the other option is a party that you hate even more, your vote isn&#x27;t &quot;wasted&quot;, it&#x27;s going towards making the government less bad.<p>Except they picked an option that is a party they like. They have multiple other options.<p>As has been pointed out by plenty of people: If you subscribe to the &quot;vote was wasted&quot; mentality, at least be consistent. Your vote is wasted any time you don&#x27;t live in a swing state. I&#x27;ve lived in extreme blue and extreme red states, and who I voted for really had no consequence at all.')
