If HN let us delete our own accounts I would have done it a year ago.<p>I&#x27;ve asked you repeatedly to do something about the downvote abuse but you continue to act like nothing&#x27;s wrong. I have no respect left for this community or the people who run it, nor do I see value in participation anymore.<p>HN likes to masquerade as some sort of upscale establishment, high and above the petty squabbles of Eslewhere, but in the end this place too devolves into a predictable echo chamber just like the rest of them, when it comes to any topic on which people have varied opinions.<p>This did not happen overnight; for more than a year I have been watching perfectly fine comments getting buried almost instantly. Why give a fuck about what you write if you&#x27;re going to be downvoted anyway?<p>You are well aware that downvotes can be and are abused to prevent facts from being seen. Like what even was in the GP&#x27;s comment to make it so gray? (at the time I posted mine)<p>HN is broken, and one of the major indicators of a broken service is a tone-deaf management who continues to insist that everything is Working As Intended.')
