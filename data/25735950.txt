Item(by='Johnny555', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610396413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735732, text='AWS said:<p><i>Itâ€™s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.</i><p>They didn&#x27;t say &quot;98 people posted bad things so you suck&quot;, they said that Parler was lacking a system to prevent those kinds of posts and provided 98 examples.<p><i>I didn&#x27;t say anything about removing moderation. In fact I talked about reporting the offending posts and making sure the website owner took action within a timely fashion, action which includes reporting the details to the authorities.</i><p>Why do you think that Parler should be able to moderate their users, ban them or report them to authorities, but AWS should not be allowed to do the same with their own customers?<p><i>This thread is about the ethics of what they did and this is clear</i><p>That&#x27;s the funny thing about ethics -- everyone has their own set of ethics. I think that if a site abuses the ToS of a provider and allows their platform to be used to plan an insurrection, then that provider ought to be able to terminate services.<p><i>Parler was one of the few sites that required a photo ID verification to make posts, precisely for that kind of reason</i><p>You don&#x27;t need to give ID to post on Parler. Becoming verified gives you some additional access&#x2F;visiblity (for example, users can block posts from unverified users), but verification is not neccessary to post.')
