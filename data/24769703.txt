The classic equation was MV = PY, and M (the money supply) and P (the price level) are <i>different</i>. They are only proportional (according to this equation) if everything else remains the same.<p>In any case, the &quot;money supply&quot; is an abstract macroeconomic variable with multiple possible definitions. Why do we care about it? Because it might have a real-world effect on us via price changes.<p>Gathering data about prices directly is a better way of understanding price levels (and inflation) than mucking around with less measurable quantities.<p>To the extent that the money supply matters, it&#x27;s because it might result in higher prices in the future. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in any mechanical way. Just because people have money doesn&#x27;t mean they want to spend it. In the classic equation, V (the velocity of money) can slow down.<p>This is particularly true when we are talking about institutions and rich people who already have savings. Higher numbers in their bank accounts doesn&#x27;t automatically result in more spending, either by them, by the banks, or by companies whose stock prices get bid up.<p>It would matter more if the money went to people who actually need to spend it.')
