It can also lead to instability. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether a country is &quot;developed&quot; or not. Developed countries can still have corrupt governments that are not responsive to their people, civil wars, etc. It can happen quick, or take a long time.<p>The stakes are high. Can enough of us agree on how to fix our problems? I don&#x27;t know. I think that removing corporate and union money from politics would be a good first step, which is what most other countries already have done. Beyond that I wonder if we&#x27;ve grown our federal government too far past it&#x27;s design specifications, expecting whoever is president this year to fix all our problems, leaving the other 49% of people very upset.')
