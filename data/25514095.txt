People who believe in this, like me, have sent them my money, but my daily driver is a modern Android phone which was not only (much) cheaper, but miles ahead in stability and hardware. I send my money and bugreports in the hopes I will have a stable and open phone in my pocket before my death, but there are many years to go as it is.<p>If we manage to get something like the samsung a31, at a similar pricepoint, with all hardware working before 2025, I would be happy. But I am skeptical when installing yet a newer OS version on my pinephone and start writing bugreports for applications we consider trivial for a daily driver phone.<p>Edit; being able to performantly and robustly run Android applications in Linux could (sadly but it is a reality) help adoption a lot a well because of proprietary apps (it sucks but I need whatsapp for instance). That is not that close by either I think; anbox is slow and unreliable last I tried.')
