But &quot;success&quot; in terms of rapid user base growth inevitably leads to enough members who are prepared to be uncivil to each other, at which stage the members who desire a civil discourse to either demand moderation or to leave it to become a youtube-comments style cesspit.<p>It&#x27;s not a technical problem, it&#x27;s a people problem. Technology just amplifies the problem enormously, it doesn&#x27;t _cause_ it. Jerks don&#x27;t last long at small local bars, because the locals set the tone and shun people who don&#x27;t behave according to local norms. Large beer barns, concert venues, or festivals largely cannot rely on local norms and custom, or for regulars to guide newcomers to understanding and appropriate behaviour. And there will _always_ be some people who are jerks, or who&#x27;s personal understanding of acceptable behaviour differs from the group norm. In the real world they hopefully find &quot;their people&quot; and their places. People who want to behave like outlaw bikers hang out in biker bars, not piano jazz clubs. If you want to build a social media site, you need to realise that eventually someone from 4chan who&#x27;s idea of fun is trolling normies is gonna show up, and if the place looks &quot;fun&quot; to him, he can put out a call to hundreds of his friends to come show up too. You need to have a plan to deal with that before it happens, if you have a vision for your site that isn&#x27;t &#x2F;b&#x2F; To some people, that&#x27;s gonna look like &quot;overly heavy moderation&quot; even if you do it right.')
