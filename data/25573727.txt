Item(by='CC38', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609270050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571849, text='I just want to add that the skills that make a good First Person Shooter player do not translate to real-world shooting skills AT ALL.<p>In a virtual world:<p>- The gun weights nothing so strength doesn&#x27;t matter and gravity doesn&#x27;t slow your aim<p>- The trigger is a mouse button and there is no right or wrong way to pull it, and it&#x27;s incredibly easy and identical for all firearms<p>- The accuracy of the firearm is often perfect<p>- Holding the gun still is usually only a consideration when sniping and you can just hold down a button to achieve an impossible level of stillness<p>- When you reload a half-empty magazine the bullets from the discarded magazine usually stay in your overall supply somehow<p>- Posture is a non-issue<p>- Recoil never hurts<p>- You achieve a perfect sight&#x2F;scope picture every time you shoulder the weapon or raise it up with no practice needed<p>Basically I am trying to point out that these games are really not simulations. The visuals are just window-dressing for the real game which is determined by the mode. Even the ubiquitous &quot;team deathmatch&quot; is essentially just a modified version of capture-the-flag without the flag where eliminations are not permanent and the game is instead ended by a timer or a score limit.<p>On an interesting note, I got the game Star Wars: Battlefront 2 recently and I noticed that the game says I &quot;defeated&quot; whoever I just shot which is in contrast with the visuals of the person getting shot and falling down. I see this as an attempt to make the game more friendly to kids by pulling back the curtain on what is really happening through language in order to keep kids from going around talking about how many dozen people they killed in the last game they played. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with this but think it should not be necessary for adults. Of course if your game is rated T (Teen) or E (Everyone) then this makes perfect sense.')
