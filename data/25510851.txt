And when there wasn&#x27;t work to do, they were perfectly chill.<p>That only works because their job is perfectly defined. The scope is finite and always in sight. I&#x27;m not quite convinced this would work for creative work or a project that&#x27;s somewhat open-ended in  features and&#x2F;or scope.<p>To give an example of this: I can do this type of no-bullshit relentless work when I exercise in a gym. 1.5hrs of a strict routine with a fixed number of reps. And a hard stop after that.<p>Never found the same type of ability for deep work.')
