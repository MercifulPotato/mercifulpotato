Did you get to hang out and eat at the mezzanine?<p>As for how daunting, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been into Motorsports for most of my Life and Aerospace is the most often transitioned to Industry from Automotive I knew (as much as anyone not hands-on with the project could be I suppose) what an immense feat that was. Also I was at the Mars Desert Research Station and got to ask as many questions as I wanted about it, and I&#x27;m also a member of The Mars Society.<p>BUT I still get giddy and have goosebumps going back and watching highlights of the first successful landing as I saw it on the streamcast with a friend who is doing his now doing his Masters in Iceland and wants to be the first wave of Martian colonizers because of that event.<p>I also saw the first re-landing mission at Vandenburg in 2018, the one that lit up the sky and made people think it was &#x27;aliens&#x27; all over SoCal. We saw it from the Eagle&#x27;s Nest where a bunch of NASA and SpaceX guys watch it from and met one of the non-crew Dragon capsule pilots and you could still get an idea of the scale of it from up there as I&#x27;ve seen the F9, too.<p>But SN2 at Boca was breathtakingly massive when it stood in its full glory on the launchpad, and to think this too will be reusable but will take Humans to Mars makes feel think the World still makes some sense.')
