Pay upwards of 500$&#x2F;mo (or for perspective, 75% monthly minimum wage) for a room in a shared house<p>Data point: around 25 years ago, I was paying GBP225&#x2F;month - so that&#x27;s ~USD300 - for a (tiny!) bedroom in a shared house in Cambridge, UK.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what approach one would best use to adjust for 25 years of house price and&#x2F;or general inflation, but isn&#x27;t that in the same ballpark as your &#x27;$500&#x27; in Libson now?<p>FWIW, we thought housing was expensive back then, too.')
