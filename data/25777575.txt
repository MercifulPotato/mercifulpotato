With that said, I do think a lot of users end up trying harder stuff because they&#x27;re with the wrong crowd.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth - I don&#x27;t use anything. But I have friends who are regular users. Some use a <i>lot</i> of different stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve been told that whenever cannabis (here in Europe, that&#x27;s usually hashish) dries up, there&#x27;s always going to be people that turn to harder stuff. Apparently after COVID hit, hashish became very difficult to get, and people started dabbling with speed, etc.')
