We need to remember that PCG is not cryptographic, and thus I think the comparison is not meant to be ChaCha20, but more one of the ChaCha-versions that you would use in situations where you would use PCG. If you want chacha to produce random-looking data even nearly as fast as PCG does, you will need to run a lot fewer rounds. 8 rounds is, IIRC, about what you need for it to pass statistical tests, but if I would guess chacha8 would still be a lot slower than the better versions in the PCG family. If you want comparable speeds, you would need to run even fewer rounds, making the statistical quality even worse.')
