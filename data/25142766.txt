It&#x27;s the workers&#x27; rights to try and fight for a higher salary and it&#x27;s the companies&#x27; rights to either pay them or tell them no. The majority of the workers affected by this are making well above the poverty line, so I&#x27;m happy to let the free market handle this.<p>What I do have a very negative view on is articles like this that try and frame it as some big moral argument and hide behind things like discrimination to get people on their side. Like I said, I feel like most people complaining about this saw an opportunity to increase their take home pay by a lot and are now just angry that their plans have been foiled.<p>If the author want to live in India, but thinks he can provide more value (and thus should be paid more) than everyone in his local market, then let him make his case. If that isn&#x27;t the case and he doesn&#x27;t provide any more value that the other people in his local market, then why should the company continue to pay him an above market salary when theres a ton of other potential applicants out there?<p>Basically, I find him pretending that this isn&#x27;t about money very disingenuous.')
