In the same way the parent comment says that adults won&#x27;t correct grammar because it&#x27;s impolite, adult visitors to your house won&#x27;t tell you to pick up your toys, or lift your arms up to put a sweater on, or brush your teeth, or how to set the table. You won&#x27;t get constant feedback on the day-to-day minutuae of life - and the constant use of sentences around the vocabulary. If you don&#x27;t know what &quot;toothpaste is&quot; you&#x27;re unlikely to stop brushing your teeth and go and look it up. If you do, and you make up sentences and say them to nobody, outside a specific classroom environment nobody will tell you if you&#x27;re making mistakes.<p>Just imagining a situation of child immersion vs adult immersion vs adult trying to make sentences up:<p>Adult making sentences up: &quot;I am put on coat. Two arm&quot;.<p>Adult immersion: &quot;What is the word for coat?&quot; &quot;&#x27;coat&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Thank you. I am put on coat&quot;. &quot;nearly, we say &#x27;putting on my coat &lt;blah blah&gt;&quot; &quot;Thanks, I am putting on my coat&quot;.<p>Child immersion: &quot;Come here and put your coat on, we&#x27;re going out, you will get cold&quot;, &quot;No I don&#x27;t want to gone&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t want to <i>go</i>, say it&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t want to go&quot;, &quot;ok but we&#x27;re going, so blue coat or rain coat?&quot;, &quot;blue raincoat&quot;, &quot;warm coat or small coat?&quot;, &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;good, now put down what you&#x27;re holding, how will you get your arms in?&quot;,...<p>It&#x27;s so much <i>more</i> everything, more words, more contexts, more sentences, more connections, more interactions, more moments of feedback, more continuous through the day, through every day, more <i>immersive</i>.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to make up sentences you know, using words you know, harder to make up sentences using words you aren&#x27;t sure of and sentence structures you aren&#x27;t sure of. Easy to do in situations where you have some free time and remember to do it, hard to have it ongoing even when you&#x27;re busy. And with scant feedback. Surely more effective than not generating anything, but equally effective? Can it possibly be?')
