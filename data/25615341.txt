I&#x27;ve driven through Germany last summer and I couldn&#x27;t find a single charger that worked, every single one required an app, one wouldn&#x27;t accept my non-german card, second one didn&#x27;t have a menu in English so I didn&#x27;t know how to set it up, third one gave me an &quot;unspecified error&quot; and told me to ring their helpline, but upon calling them discovered they are closed on Sunday. So in the end I didn&#x27;t charge in Germany at all.')
