Conclusions:<p>1. CQRS+ES works great, if you implement it carefully, which requires discipline. We ended up creating our own framework (ugh) to make it easy to go down the right path.<p>2. There are trade-offs, of course.<p>3. You are only one smart agile thinker-in-a-pinch away from stepping away from the discipline and creating really tricky complexity and far more negative trade-offs.<p>4. There is very little market demand for this approach among the typical enterprise business solutions we work on; though as I understand there are some sharp peaks in certain areas of financial services.<p>(The odd thing is... we have financial service customers, just not in the particular domains where there is demand for CQRS.)')
