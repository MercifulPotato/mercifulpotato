There are very good arguments against it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t assume the opposite and become a boastful patriot either, but maybe the big leaps taken in the past were so good that people got lazy. You didn&#x27;t need to innovate or only innovate for money (which isn&#x27;t nearly as effective a motivator as being annihilated by Germans or ICBMs). There is also the argument of low hanging fruits, but I find that it&#x27;s easy to undervalue the inventions of things you already know very well.<p>There is no grand narrative anymore.
