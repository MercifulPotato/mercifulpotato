Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see any good data adjusting for this.<p>Nonetheless, the idea that rural America is doing just fine is sort of silly, for a few reasons:<p>- It&#x27;s a minority of the population. So from a policy perspective, it&#x27;s unclear to me what the conclusion should be. That more people should move to rural areas? That the Atlantic article is missing the experience of 1&#x2F;5th of the population? ;)<p>- The same macro trends (rising GINI, declining real household wealth) exist across rural&#x2F;suburban&#x2F;urban divisions. (Note too that the Simpsons is probably set in a suburban, not rural, areaâ€”and suburban areas have experienced a sharp increase in poverty.)<p>- Qualitatively, rural poverty is associated with prescription drug abuse (extremely prevalent where I grew up), limited education and labor flexibility, limited geographic flexibility, etc.<p>So I never know what to make of these &quot;it&#x27;s going fine in Rural America&quot; arguments.')
