Did you read any of the affidavits filed with the so-called &quot;fraud&quot; lawsuits? There were election observers complaining that they saw lots of military ballots for Biden, which is proof of fraud because they &quot;knew&quot; military members were &quot;supposed&quot; to vote for Trump. There was another observer who complained that he saw an Asian person working the polls, which was proof that the CCP had infiltrated the elections. The lawsuits were just hundreds and hundreds of pages of conspiratorial nonsense like that. The lawyers filing these things are QAnon cultists.<p>How do you &quot;investigate&quot; allegations like that? If you&#x27;ve really fallen for this scam then you have been thoroughly brainwashed by the far right internet.')
