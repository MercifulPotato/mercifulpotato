Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!<p>A few examples of why it was so great:<p>Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#x27;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#x27;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#x27;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.<p>Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#x27;t have internet and need the map on my phone. \nI know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant.')
