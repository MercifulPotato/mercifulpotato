One of the things I didn&#x27;t get &amp; wanted from the original post was the full CO₂ cost of the manufacture, and I figured it was probably going to be much higher. (I didn&#x27;t include it since the article was focused on <i>moving</i> manufacturing, so the manufacturing CO₂ cost would remain the same either way.)<p>(But, presumably the ICE car also has its own manufacturing cost, which should offset that of the Tesla? Though, I&#x27;m not sure what the equivalent here is; the manufacturing CO₂ of the gas? The CO₂ of the ICE&#x27;s battery?)<p>I know not everyone does keep their vehicles as long as I do, but I better get at least 75k mi out of it! (My current — and first — car is at ~130k mi, and still going fairly strong, though it is definitely showing some wear. Alas, it burns gas.)')
