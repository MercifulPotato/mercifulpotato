If you read only the headline you might think it&#x27;s making the argument your implying, but if you actually bother to read it you&#x27;ll find it doesn&#x27;t.<p>From the article:<p>&quot;The biology of sex is real, but itâ€™s extremely complicated, and there is sometimes no easy way to draw a line between the biologically male and female.&quot;<p>Having now read the top 5 articles for that search term, I still haven&#x27;t found one that makes the claim your suggesting.<p>I&#x27;m sure if I dig hard enough I could find that someone has said it non-ironically, but if I dig hard enough I can find someone saying the moon landing didn&#x27;t happen or talking about lizard people non-ironically. That doesn&#x27;t make it a mainstream movement.')
