To support existing code, you add a method that returns the first element of the array (let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s guaranteed non-empty for simplicity).<p>If you used a field, you have to update all code referencing that field to call the accessor method instead. If your class was part of a public API, it&#x27;s a breaking change.<p>Even if it was just internal code, your next commit will contain a zillion changed files where you replaced foo.number with foo.getNumber(). You&#x27;ll leave a trace in each of those files&#x27; histories for a change that really didn&#x27;t concern them at all. Also code reviewers will have to check that you didn&#x27;t miss a usage somewhere (hopefully your code would just fail to compile in that case though).<p>If you had used a property or a getter around the original field, none of that happens. You add a new .Numbers property and replace the old .Number implementation with one that gets or sets the first element of the array.')
