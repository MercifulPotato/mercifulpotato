There are &quot;optimizations&quot; the compiler can choose for limited addresses &quot;reaches&quot;. Please consider independently compiled libraries that are aggregated into something larger, specifically languages that permit subclassing and inheritance. How can they be moved within an address space?<p>If there is a hierarchy of address availability this means that ASLR cannot be implemented in a pure way - it must involve runtime fix-ups if the base address changes. If the length of an instruction must change because of the addressing mode, what happens? How can you do ALSR?  Do you rewrite all instructions (is there space? was space allocated?) or always use the most expensive address mode?')
