Mr. Assange’s health improved on being removed from relative isolation in healthcare. He has been able to access the support of family and friends. He has had access to a Samaritans phone line. He has benefited from a trusting relationship with the prison In-Reach psychologist. By contrast, a SAMs regime would severely restrict his contact with all other human beings, including other prisoners, staff and his family. In detention subject to SAMs, he would have absolutely no communication with other prisoners, even through the walls of his cell, and time out of his cell would be spent alone.<p>These conditions sound barbaric to me and I&#x27;d go as far to describe them as torture. Amnesty International do a better job of outlining the problems with this regime than I can: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnestyusa.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;entombed-isolation-in-the-us-federal-prison-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnestyusa.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;entombed-isolation-in-the...</a><p>Frankly I don&#x27;t understand why the UK continues to maintain an extradition treaty with a country which clearly has a poor record on human rights and fails to maintain a justice system that meets the UN&#x27;s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.<p>She concludes:<p>&gt; I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.<p>&gt; I order the discharge  of Julian Paul Assange, pursuant  to section 91(3) of the EA 2003<p>Whilst a victory nonetheless for Assange, it is unfortunate that the entire judgement seems to come down to this point alone. Let&#x27;s hope it is not overturned.')
