Now this didn’t happen overnight—this took some considerable time—and our early attempts were very poor. They were inadequate to describe many of the tricks we thought a notation should be able to describe. And eventually we hit on a scheme that seemed to work. And we used it to write down loads of different juggling tricks that we knew.<p>&gt; We discovered that if we arranged those tricks in just the right way, they fell into a pattern. There was an underlying, unsuspected structure. As long as you had the courage to leave gaps. And this goes back to things like the Periodic Table, when Mendeley was writing down all the elements—he realized that if you arranged them all according to function, then there were gaps, and that then predicted the existence of chemical elements.<p>&gt; Well, we were predicting the existence of juggling tricks. And it worked! We actually found juggling tricks that no one had ever done before.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hypotext&#x2F;notation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hypotext&#x2F;notation</a>)<p>What&#x27;s so cool is that you can predict gaps in knowledge by developing a notation to (honestly) describe what you do know.')
