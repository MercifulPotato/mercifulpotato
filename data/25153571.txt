I too have been pretty anti-IDE most of my history. But I think a lot of it comes down to tools and culture; Ruby (which I have done for the first half of my profesional life) is extremely hard to give good tooling for. So the tools are bad, so they aren&#x27;t useful. So you don&#x27;t use them.<p>Contrast with a language like Java, which is very amenable to a lot of tooling, and kinda sorta needs it to make the language more usable. If that&#x27;s your background, you can&#x27;t imagine not having that tooling, because, well, you&#x27;re used to it.<p>I will say that I have been playing around with using more IDE-like things, and even though it&#x27;s culturally pretty foreign to me, I understand the appeal. And as I&#x27;m getting more used to it, I get annoyed when it&#x27;s not there, and then remember how I used to pooh pooh people who required all those fancy features. So... I get it. These days at least.')
