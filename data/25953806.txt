Item(by='malwrar', descendants=None, kids=[25953830], score=None, time=1611893584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952976, text='Having expressed this understanding of WSB&#x27;s benign intent in their use of the term &quot;retard&quot;, surely you see why some random person at Discord taking offense to it and whimsically banning <i>the entire community</i> is messed up, right? Discord is host to a massive variety of nominally private (you need a link to join) communities that have real, deep value to those who participate in them. Over time they develop their own unique history and culture that has a complex context that can&#x27;t be assessed with simple, surface level judgements by some Discord employee to whom said community is the n+1th problem of the day. Banning the community comes off to me as an arbitrary exercise of an unearned moral authority, and feels deeply arrogant and ethnocentric in all the negatives that term implies.<p>Obviously Discord is a private company etc etc. They&#x27;re also <i>the</i> dominant platform upon which ~140 million people [1] from all over the world communicate, in all the messy ways humans do. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather they focus on keeping the platform running, collect their revenue from their customers, and mind their own business. This is what everyone who uses the service expects them to do, after all.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;discord-raises-100-million-as-its-social-hub-hits-140-million-users&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;discord-raises-100-millio...</a>')
