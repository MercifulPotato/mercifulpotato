For someone like myself who can read Russian newspapers, but struggles to finish older literature, it&#x27;s not ideal, because I can look at the original text and see the lost poetry.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in Pevear and Volokhonsky&#x27;s translation methodology, check this out: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;columbiajournal.org&#x2F;translation-lecture-richard-pevear-and-larissa-volokhonsky&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;columbiajournal.org&#x2F;translation-lecture-richard-pevea...</a><p>&gt; Pevear explained that they first began translating when they happened to both be reading Crime and Punishment at the same time – Pevear in English, Volokhonsky in Russian – and they compared sentences and saw how radically different they were. Since then, they have developed a system: Volokhonsky makes the first draft, trying to translate as literally as possible [...], explaining any clichés or colloquialisms. Then Pevear looks at the “scribble” (as Volokhonsky calls it), and he “puts it into English” (Pevear said, sighing). Pevear asks Volokhonsky questions, and, in the creating of the third draft, she answers them. Finally, before sending anything off to their editor, Pevear reads the English version out loud while Volokhonsky follows along in the original Russian text.')
