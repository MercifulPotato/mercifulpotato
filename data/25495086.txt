So you hook up the box and you get what you get. Interpreting the data thus revealed is part of the service.<p>Interestingly enough, things that use a separate passphrase to protect the saved data are immune to a Cellebrite style attack. Since Signal relies on the security of the underlying device there is still a distinction that can be made here.<p>Another point that falls out of this is that Signal is more secure on systems with an unbroken hardware enclave. It is also more secure when you have it delete your old messages.<p>&gt;Cellebriteâ€™s details will make it easier for the Signal developers to patch the vulnerability.<p>There is no actual Signal vulnerability here so Signal has nothing to patch.')
