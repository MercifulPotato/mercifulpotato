What qualifies as &#x27;non-intelligent&#x27;, just anything non-human? Can we define a spectrum (as a pescetarian, I make special exceptions for octopus and squid as they qualify as sentient on my rudimentary personal sentience&#x2F;intelligence spectrum)? What defines best interest? I can easily imagine scenarios in which my best interest would be euthanasia or copious painkillers&#x2F;sedatives, if I had to otherwise live in severe pain or discomfort. But I can&#x27;t say what other humans would want in that scenario. Interesting topic indeed.')
