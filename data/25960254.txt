We don&#x27;t have too many names to erase here, but the school district has become more and more overtly political, injecting all manners of the progressive &quot;social justice&quot; agenda into school curricula and activities (for example, &quot;ethnic studies&quot; math: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;seattle-math-oppressive-cultural-woke&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;seattle-math-oppressive-cultur...</a>). The people voted onto the school board who enable all this are basically unknown random people who are winning elections solely due to the degree of virtue signalling in their platform. And even though the current Seattle schools superintendent is very politically progressive in her work, she quickly went from a favorite to not-activist-enough, and is now resigning due to pressure from a very loud but very small cadre of activists (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;education&#x2F;seattle-public-schools-superintendent-denise-juneau-will-resign-in-june&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;education&#x2F;seattle-...</a>).<p>Although our schools mostly don&#x27;t have names tied to key American historical figures, we do have a major university named for George Washington (as is the state). BLM activists have repeatedly vandalized the George Washington statue in the middle of the University of Washington Seattle campus (typically pouring red paint all over it). Inspired by CHAZ (the &quot;autonomous zone&quot; later renamed to CHOP), the UW BLM group took over the statue and set up an &#x27;art installation&#x27; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestranger.com&#x2F;slog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;44267722&#x2F;uw-protesters-embark-on-month-long-art-installation-at-george-washington-statue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestranger.com&#x2F;slog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;44267722&#x2F;uw-prot...</a>) to push their skewed perspectives. The spineless university leadership largely looked the other way and remained silent through their occupation of this space, and as these statues and other buildings were repeatedly vandalized. It&#x27;s also interesting seeing the alliances that build up to condone and encourage such political vandalism  - for example, Real Change - a Seattle area homelessness advocacy group - came out in support of it (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realchangenews.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;deconstructing-george" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realchangenews.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;deconstructin...</a>).<p>The erasure of the names of key figures like Lincoln is a normalization of attacks on symbols of the country&#x27;s foundations, which is just a stepping stone to attacking those principles directly. I find the role of schools (like SF schools) and universities in enabling a political &quot;dirty war&quot; to be grotesque. We need to return to normalcy, where these spaces should strive to be neutral and not act on the demands of fringe activists who have all the time in the world to push for such policies.')
