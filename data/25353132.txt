If you are not allowed to maintain any state, then you don&#x27;t have a lot of options to efficiently respond to the new thing, and most likely need to re-read the 1M things.<p>That&#x27;s the benefit of being stateful. There is a cost too, which is that you need to be able to reconstruct your state in the case of a failure, but fortunately things like differential dataflow (built on TD) are effectively deterministic.<p>Also, I suspect &quot;Spark&quot; is a moving target. The original paper described something that was very much a batch processor; they&#x27;ve been trying to fix that since, and perhaps they&#x27;ve made some progress in the intervening years.')
