People from Western countries are highly sensitive to corruption, even soft corruption (e.g. some politician introduces his kid to a constituent who is a business person in order to get an internship).  Ask people in highly corrupt countries if that&#x27;s corruption and you&#x27;ll get a very different answer (my sister-in-law, who is from a developing nation, would call that leveraging your network).<p>Add on top that it&#x27;s <i>perception</i>.  In western countries how many people have <i>direct</i> experience with political corruption?  Their views are going to be <i>heavily</i> influenced by media coverage.<p>And then add on top anti-corruption measures.  If your gov&#x27;t prosecutes corruption aggressively, it will seem like there is more of it, versus a country that just ignores it.  If it&#x27;s not in your face, you&#x27;d probably say your country is not that corrupt.  When in fact the country that more aggressively fights corruption is probably less corrupt than one that doesn&#x27;t.')
