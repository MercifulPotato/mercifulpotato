I’d consider dynamo a fantastic tier 1 service, but it wasn’t always that way. This is inline with the Amazon philosophy in general.<p>As for “making something for the sake of having it”, I believe the key reason for building their own applications is that they can build it on the same multi-az incremental ledger&#x2F;block store that underlies most services (first built for aurora), or a variant thereof. They have some pretty stellar underlying tech built to be reliable at cloud scale,  something you won’t get from running a service on your own EC2 fleet. The new stuff built on top of it just isn’t all that mature though. That’s just my take though. If interested, the deep dive talk from reinvent last year on aurora is pretty cool.<p>Disclaimer: I work at Amazon, nothing to do with AWS or timestream. In fact, I’ve been excited for time stream for a while but found its initial performance lackluster for what I needed.')
