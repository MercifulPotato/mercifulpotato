Item(by='svrb', descendants=None, kids=[25022936, 25022972], score=None, time=1604808006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022051, text='Not GP commenter, but here&#x27;s one: The &quot;will you support a peaceful transition of power&quot; question is designed to elicit a response which could be quoted out of context in an article inevitably headlined &quot;Trump predicts his own election defeat; already musing about transfer of power to his Democratic challenger&quot;. For <i>any</i> politician to answer a question posed this way would be disaster. Trump&#x27;s unique problem is that he simply refuses to answer the question rather than giving a non-answer with the appearance of substance. Whether this is by choice or because he <i>can&#x27;t</i> pull off that common trick is perhaps debatable.<p>(Before downvoting&#x2F;flagging, please recognize that this answer is not <i>exclusive</i> of other explanations such as &quot;Trump really does have dictatorial ambitions&quot;. I take no position on such non-falsifiable claims.)<p>This is very similar to George W Bush&#x27;s &quot;fool me twice... I won&#x27;t get fooled again&quot; gaffe. Had he completed the quote properly he could never have escaped the clips of saying &quot;shame on me&quot; taken out of context (remember this is before the days of deepfakes; now it would matter much less). This was predictably spun as &quot;Dubya is stupid!&quot; but frankly to recognize mid-quip the minefield he was about to step in is a feat beyond the average person. Of course the difference is (again) that unlike Bush, Trump really leaves open the possibility that he really is incompetent as opposed to the 5-dimensional chess that anyone supporting him really hopes he&#x27;s playing.')
