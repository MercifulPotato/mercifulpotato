What if each head had independent micro-actuators so that all heads can be locked to their track of the same radius, with the data being distributed across all heads. Wouldn&#x27;t this improve throughput n-fold?<p>Edit: Seems like modern hard drives already have micro-actuators for each head to overcome precision and bandwidth issues with the main arm actuator, but it seems like none of those enable a range of motion that is sufficient to lock multiple heads simultaneously.')
