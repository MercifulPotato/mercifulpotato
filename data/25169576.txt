That it&#x27;s better to be richer? You&#x27;ll have more resources and advantages. A common concept where I&#x27;m from is you work harder so you can give your child a better life.<p>My parents immigrated to a country with basically nothing and barely spoke English. I can&#x27;t imagine what their lives were like, how hard it must have been. I was raised below the poverty line and had free lunch well into high school.  They always told me they did everything they did because they wanted me to have a better life. It worked. I am amazed at how far there were able to climb, and it gave me the confident to achieve so much more. My mom routinely calls me a dreamer because I wanted to make six figures. In her world, this is huge, she doesn&#x27;t understand the world like I do. And, that&#x27;s okay, she did the best she could, so I achieve so much more. And, hopefully, one day, my child can achieve things I can only dream of.<p>Life is unfair. The way I see it is every one of us was dropped into a race that we didn&#x27;t ask to be in. Some of us got dropped further along in the race, some of us got dropped further behind. Is it unfair? Fuck yea it is, but what are you going to do? Stay there and complain? Or are you gonna get busy running.')
