For me, vision and hearing both come out far ahead.<p>Where would I be without Chopin&#x27;s music, without the sound of my friends&#x27; instruments as we jam, without the loving voices of friends and family?<p>Where would I be without vision, I couldn&#x27;t see the works of Monet, Van Gogh, Miyazaki, Blizzard, Bethesda, or practically all code and screens and UI?<p>Touch feels nice, but as an American man, I was taught to touch only when necessary, lest the other person find it over the line. The OP author is an Italian female, so there&#x27;s a cultural abd gender difference no doubt. But personally, I don&#x27;t miss shaking hands or hugging, nevermind cheek kissing.')
