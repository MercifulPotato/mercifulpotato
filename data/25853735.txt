I&#x27;ve thought about making a SaaS where I basically just host pre-compiled FOSS packages for esoteric cpu architectures. So that way if you have a &lt;insert random CPU&gt; embedded linux system, you can quickly grab a precompiled `tshark` for example without figuring out how to build it yourself. Sure, it would be better as a free service, but I&#x27;m not super motivated to do that in my highly limited spare time. I would be super motivated if I were compensated for my effort with cash, however.<p>Making something paid vs. free can be the difference between it existing and not existing. I&#x27;d rather have this exist and be a paid app than not exist and be free.')
