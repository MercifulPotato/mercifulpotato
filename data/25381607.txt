Some of those airports are not nice.  Some of them are nice shells that are almost deserted, with no wifi and a couple vendors that won&#x27;t take your American credit card.  Your &quot;World Plan&quot; often works, sorta, but you can&#x27;t always get data due to different radio bands or because the network is simply not good enough for a 100+mb download. \nYou&#x27;ll either have to hop into a hopefully licensed taxi, or start walking in the dark in an industrial area (where airports usually are) in order to find a wifi hotspot or a street vendor that will sell you a SIM card.\nIt&#x27;s not fun.<p>Uber made the right choice.')
