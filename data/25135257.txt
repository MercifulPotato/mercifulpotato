Item(by='yyyk', descendants=None, kids=[25136341], score=None, time=1605696031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135074, text='&gt;Simply instead of &quot;resistance&quot; they call them &quot;pro-democratic rebels&quot;<p>Which is mostly accurate (the rebels part, we have no idea what regime they would have set up). Iran officially supported Hamas and Hizbollah, the former even <i>after</i> it&#x27;s been declared a terrorist org. When one does those things so openly, it&#x27;s no wonder the designations follow.<p>&gt;(e.g. search for a humble &quot;freedom-fighter&quot; Osama).<p>Al-Qaeda (or the Taliban) didn&#x27;t even exist at the time.<p>&gt;So do please clarify what exactly I am &quot;mixing&quot;?<p>Your original comment mixed JCPOA (a text at most binding members who signed it but does not override UN resolutions), nuclear sanctions (removed under UN 2231, not the JCPOA), economic sanctions (not all removed, since quite a bit is not nuclear), terror sanctions (e.g. Solemani), etc.<p>&gt;LOL what? When ISIS has started making territorial claims...<p>ISIS existed before they made &#x27;claims&#x27;. The organization is what Al-Qaeda in Iraq evolved into once they got radical beyond even what Bin Laden wanted (Bin Laden opposed targeting Shiites). Al-Qaeda in Iraq was supported by Assad and Iran. Just recently someone assassinated an Al-Qaeda head in Tehran.<p>&gt;If anything, it&#x27;s American support of Sunni rebels in the hope that they will overthrow the Assad government resulted in the creation of ISIS as a quasi-state.<p>Ah, yes, the US created ISIS conspiracy theory. Lets remember the US left Iraq and was happy to be out until ISIS called it back. ISIS then took over Mosul first, and only then became a quasi-state. The holding in Syria came later, and it was the US (with SDF) which threw them out.')
