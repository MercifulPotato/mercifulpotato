However, for graphistry&#x27;s graph workloads, we do most scipy-size graphs at much higher speeds via cudf + cugraph. Similar apis, more speed.<p>Ex: Preprocess many cols with scikit sparse (genomes, many-featured fraud, ...) -&gt; cudf (= gpu dataframes) for most of workload -&gt; infer relationships with gpu UMAP then gpu k-nn -&gt; graphistry for visual analysis.<p>We&#x27;re starting to experiment with bigger-than-memory (TB etc) scale via the gpu-enabled dask libs.  I definitely recommend trying.  If interested in adding visual analytics here, these&#x27;ll be hitting our free + self-hosted layers soon, and drop a contact method if you&#x27;d like early access. Exciting times!')
