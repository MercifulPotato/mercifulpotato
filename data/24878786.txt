Playlists carefully built over time, suddenly changing and shifting. Music is huge to me, and here was Google, playing with my memories. Not being able to listen to some songs is bad enough, but entirely remoing them from the lists felt like gaslighting. My memories were being played with, and Google was telling me &quot;here&#x27;s your playlist&quot;, but that wasn&#x27;t my playlist anymore.')
