Item(by='vvanpo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609127450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555416, text='&gt; This makes computer science a bright target for mathematical formalization. This is entirely different from science.<p>Yes, but until computer science is fully formalized we will still need design, and can benefit from science. If&#x2F;when it is fully formalized and creating software becomes an automate-able optimization problem, we will no longer need system designers. Or software developers, for that matter.<p>&gt; I never said ignore the field.<p>Not explicitly, perhaps, but it really does read like that is what you&#x27;re implying. You said multiple times that anyone labelled as an architect or designer knows nothing and is peddling bullshit. If we can agree that design is amenable to scientific inquiry, then it would make sense that some designers <i>do</i> know things.<p>Re-reading your original post, I realize now that I chose the wrong quote to respond to. I do agree with you that anything labeled as &quot;design&quot; is necessarily constrained by a lack of knowledge. Any time there are multiple ways to solve the same problem and there is no <i>a priori</i> way to figure out which solution is the best, we are forced to design. My point is that this describes software development, which as noted above has not been fully formalized. Writing software is design, and therefore needs designers.<p>&gt; Often we have no choice. No one calculate the best work of art. Art is created by design.<p>Are you implying that when it comes to software, we <i>do</i> have a choice?<p>&gt; The concept of abstraction, good abstractions and bad abstractions can be separated from design and formalized into exact definitions. That is my argument.<p>This is where you lose me, I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you mean here. Abstraction is a design principle, and developers argue constantly about whether a given abstraction is good or necessary. The motivation behind abstraction as a principle hinges on how you define &quot;too complex&quot;, and that sounds very subjective to meâ€”the opposite of formal.')
