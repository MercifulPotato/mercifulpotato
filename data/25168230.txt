We haven&#x27;t officially launched yet and haven&#x27;t published the final plans, but the basic plan for normal websites will be around $10-15&#x2F;mo.<p>You can certainly use HTTrack or just set up WP2Static yourself. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statically.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statically.io&#x2F;</a> is very nice too. If the website is managed by only a single person who has technical skills, then I would recommend WP2Static on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lokl.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lokl.dev</a>. You can probably deploy for free to Netlify or AWS free tier. But if you need access by multiple people, convenience, or any kind of support, then our service can be very valuable.<p>I would really like to have a stupidly low cost plan that would just be a no-brainer to use all the time, but unfortunately the way WordPress is designed makes it extraordinarily difficult to bring costs down enough. Each site has to be a separate WordPress instance, and we can&#x27;t host WordPress instances for free. We are considering having a free deployment option for people that just want to run WordPress locally.')
