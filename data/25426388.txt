It was very much a dysfunctional and failing system, for reasons that were made clear even by Adam Smith, who wrote in 1776 - and that are agreed upon by modern economists.  What it did was create a huge unfair advantage for the few who could afford to &quot;own&quot; someone who had been enslaved - but that never translated to region-wide progress. Indeed, the part of the U.S. where slavery was widespread is still the most unequal today and the one with the most uninclusive, regressive, extractive culture and institutions (despite a very real change in outlook during the 1980s), and that&#x27;s no coincidence.<p>&#x27;Slavery made economic sense&#x27; is a narrative that, until recently, you would only have heard from the likes of &quot;Black-Israelite&quot; conspiracy peddlers. Let&#x27;s not give credence to such unscientific and misleading claims.')
