Item(by='InitialLastName', descendants=None, kids=[25087729], score=None, time=1605300312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086798, text='Some amount of in-person-schooling-as-necessary-function makes a lot of sense.  We know that kids under 10 are very unlikely to transmit Covid, and younger kids are also the least able to thrive in a remote learning environment.  My SO is currently teaching second grade (7-8 year olds) remote, and I get nightmares just imagining trying to keep 7-year-old me staring at a teacher on a computer screen (that was a difficult enough task in person).  If you can orchestrate your staff in such a way that they&#x27;re in limited contact with one another (maybe specials suffer) you can probably teach younger kids safely.')
