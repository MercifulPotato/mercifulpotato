I&#x27;m still suffering from a bug which makes the clipboard on Firefox just hang, perpetually. This is Firefox with the wayland backend enabled, which I had to switch to because the Xwayland backend would crash the entirety of sway in some weird resizing edge case.<p>Sway is still unstable. Even if the bugs have gotten less frequent, having it crash is not an uncommon experience. And because they tied its feature set to i3, the scripting experience is really not great. I say all of this as someone who has:<p>- used i3 for many years daily<p>- used sway for many years daily<p>- written both a Rust (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;norcalli&#x2F;ksway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;norcalli&#x2F;ksway</a>) and Lua package (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;norcalli&#x2F;lua-sway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;norcalli&#x2F;lua-sway</a>) for sway.<p>- written about a dozen or more scripts for sway<p>- contributed patches to Sway<p>The bugs are so irritating and wayland is so irritating that it&#x27;s driven me to have already started making both my own browser due to firefox&#x27;s issues, and my own alternative compositor. I&#x27;d rather make something outside of both wayland and X that only runs programs that I personally wrote and have QEMU as an escape hatch than use either of them full time. And one day I&#x27;ll port it to Raspberry Pi on a unikernel or just off of the bare ISA.<p>E: Oh yeah and screen capture, IME, and various other things are still basically experimental.')
