For example, when there is a water pipe behind the walls a plumber (a good one) would also put a plate in front of it.  In this way, once the walls are in place, drilling away into the wall, or nailing, would hit the metal plate, thus provides some safety mechanism.  As another example, underground, in public areas are markings (or at least procedures) to identify such areas gas pipe areas before excavating.<p>How are the fiber optics being cut?  Are there no procedures for this or is there some challenges how the infra is setup today?')
