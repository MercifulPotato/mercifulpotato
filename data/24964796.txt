It&#x27;s well-known that air travel is much safer than cars per mile, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was over 100 times safer.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to know what this number is for fully self-driving cars once they start being used for the commercial transport of passengers (as opposed to just testing&#x2F;refining the technology).')
