But still, just like you, I really hate the base attitude here.<p>And for a different reason: I find that programmers who think like this, are also lazy when it comes to respecting the user. They&#x27;re lazy when it comes to supporting accessibility. They&#x27;re lazy when it somes to properly supporting i18n and making experience great for non-Americans. They&#x27;re lazy when it comes to respecting privacy and not burning 8GB of RAM just to render a webshop frontend.<p>They&#x27;ll say &quot;this is hard&quot; and add Facebook SDK to do things for them. They&#x27;ll say &quot;this is hard&quot; and make the page inaccessible for people that don&#x27;t own a 4000$ 16&quot; MBP and has perfect vision.<p>That&#x27;s the core issue of this attitude for me, which I&#x27;m seeing by too many people I mentor. Development is sometimes hard and requires hard work to do right by people.')
