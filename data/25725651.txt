It was not Jira but bugzilla, but you can use it in the same way (I told you it was years ago ;)).<p>Any engineer could open any ticket for another engineer or team. You could also set the priority to how urgent it was. The receiving engineer could adjust the priority according to their own work of course.<p>Basically all work that you do was in the tracker. You could even add things for yourself, so you had a central place for your or anyones todo list.<p>Best work environment I ever worked as a software developer. There was never something blocking that some manager had to resolve, because you would just open a ticket an assign it to the person or team you think is relevant. All discussion was done in the ticket.')
