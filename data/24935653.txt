Tedious but possible. But the community of discussion will eventually disappear.<p>Same with Usenet -- far more useful than Reddit, Google Groups or places like HN, but fell victim to the pressures of spam, moderation and lack of standards evolution. I probably have a deep backup with News posts from the 90s but it is essentially lost to the world. It was never intended as a historical artefact, so in 100 years it will seem like a dark age, no hardcopy records and a tiny digital archive.
