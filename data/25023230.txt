You have really drifted from textbook science at this point.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about human cells being alive. were talking about the whole organism being considered alive and its own thing.<p>Talking about whether an organism that can not exist independently of its host, that  hasn&#x27;t experienced life yet can be aborted by that host.<p>It feels like your being disingenuous arguing semantics like cell life with me. Yes cells are live, no the organism is not an independent thing with its own rights. An nonviable fetus is not a fully grown human, this isn&#x27;t killing babies.')
