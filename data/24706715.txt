Wipe your SSDs and storage buckets? Remove your DNS records? Should it be permanent?<p>I&#x27;d be absolutely fine with that in a sub-account or resource group as long as I had to enable it.<p>A while back I wanted to try out an Azure Resource Manager template as part of learning something.  Since I was _learning_ it, I wasn&#x27;t 100% positive what it was going to do, but I knew that it should cost about $1 to deploy it.<p>With a hard limit on spending I would have set it to $10, run the thing and been ok with the account being wiped if I hit $10.  Even $100 I could tolerate. Unlimited $$ was too risky for me, so I chickened out.<p>The worst part is I can&#x27;t even delete my CC because it&#x27;s tied to an expired trial that I can&#x27;t update billing for.<p>&gt; Also for most customers, the data and service is far more important than the cost.<p>So don&#x27;t enable the hard limit.')
