Item(by='ivanbakel', descendants=None, kids=[25721401, 25721402, 25721199, 25721155], score=None, time=1610318336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720861, text='&gt;Iâ€™m having trouble even imagining the insane event-processing architecture that results in keystrokes being processed out of order.<p>It&#x27;s relatively simple: the picker executes file-opening asynchronously, and only checks which file was selected at some indeterminate point after enter is pressed. In the meantime, the down arrow input in the main GUI changes the selection. The keypresses are always in order.<p>Whether or not that&#x27;s the correct decision, it&#x27;s not an inconceivable design. That example is probably one of the only times it would matter, since you would need async code that cares about some part of the file picker state.')
