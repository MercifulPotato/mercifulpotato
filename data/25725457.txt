Similarly, in certain cases it&#x27;s one or more minorities that have the power against the majority - e.g. the fewer white-spanish descendants over indians and mulatos in some Latin American countries, or the white 20% against the blacks 80% in appartheid South Africa).<p>So, no, it&#x27;s not clear cut that it&#x27;s &quot;in a society&#x27;s interest to limit hate speech against minorities&quot;.')
