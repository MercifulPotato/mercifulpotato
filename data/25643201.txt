Item(by='Closi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609832800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636275, text='&gt; The statement is factually false, the reason we have judges is to consider individual circumstances and to make the tradeoffs between conflicting rights and laws.<p>Not really, we have judges at the level of the magistrates to apply laws based on the precedents set in higher courts, not based on their own feelings of what the law <i>should</i> be.<p>There are legal tests that need to be applied - in your example about murder and surgery the definition of murder requires intent. As we know from cases like Shipman, a surgery can be murder, but it’s not for the judge to decide that arbitrarily, it’s for a judge to apply case law.<p>A district judge is not a one person jury!')
