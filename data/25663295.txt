Instead we put unsecured boxes on street corners to collect ballots and put them in the mail.  We eliminated signature validation.  The list goes on.  I have no idea who got the most legitimate votes, but neither does anyone else.<p>&gt;The closest thing to a widespread problem is voter suppression, where states administer elections in regionally uneven ways to suppress one party&#x27;s turnout. This is predominately against black citizens in the south after Shelby v Holder.<p>I agree with you 100% but that just means every election is illegitimate.')
