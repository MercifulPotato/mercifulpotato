To me, it&#x27;s a systems problem like an engineering problem.<p>The difference between burritos and politics for me is that the questions I often ask are about people. Who benefits, who is being exploited, are people being treated fairly. I&#x27;d use the word justice, but that&#x27;s a pretty loaded term. When I play a game, for instance, I wonder how people were paid, was there crunch, etc.<p>I cannot turn this part of my brain off even for things I enjoy. Again, it&#x27;s like handing me an interesting engineering problem -- I&#x27;m going to be thinking about it when I&#x27;m not distracted.')
