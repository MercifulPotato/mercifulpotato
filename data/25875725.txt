Here are a few pointers to help as a litmus test, that I wish I had back then:<p>- How many self serve customers have built a business on top of your platform? (this is where good documentation helps)<p>- Is your leadership excessively concerned about the branding and how the company comes across, or do they actually talk to customers and developers?<p>- Have the founders raised excessive capital relative to business maturity?<p>- Is there cultish behaviour, where bad decisions are not questioned? how vulnerable is the broader leadership?<p>- Where do engineers spend their time? Making cool stuff or building towards clear customer outcomes?<p>As I said, genuinely friendly comment. I really hope I am wrong, but sharing as someone who has gone through something similar who was triggered after I saw this.<p>All the best, hope this takes off!')
