I personally dislike simple text logs and find them frustrating to use and would rather not go back to them, and using a traditional database engine is overkill here. (An on-disk log database only needs to support create and read operations)<p>Regarding security and code base size, it&#x27;s not clear to me that any other architecture here is going to be less error prone. The problem seems to be that a large number of operations that you probably want your service manager to do on Linux require root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to matter if you put that stuff outside of pid1, a program that needs the same elevated privileges can still stomp on your system and mess with the state of pid1.<p>I&#x27;ve found systemd has extensive documentation (at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systemd.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systemd.io&#x2F;</a>) and the developers on the IRC and mailing list usually seem to be responsive.<p>I searched and I could not find any examples of this &quot;bullying&quot; on LKML. It looks like Greg was the person who was sponsoring it and trying to get it merged, not Lennart. And I&#x27;m not sure I would call their use of dbus to be abuse. I honestly think it would be cool if other low level daemons used dbus in this way because it makes integration (GUIs, automation, remote control, security policies, etc) a lot easier, as long as you familiarize yourself with the tooling around dbus.<p>All that said, systemd is made for a general use case and is not ideal for containers or for embedded. I hope these other init systems can find their niche.')
