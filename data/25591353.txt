That&#x27;s the productive question to ask, that&#x27;s the question that will actually help us make progress towards replacing Flash.<p>There are basically two camp of people. Those who use Flash, and stating HTML5 not as good as Flash are coming from a user, designer, creative point of view. Its ease of use, from coding to authoring. The simplicity of getting something done. Like HyperCard.<p>The other camp are programmers, software and web developers who just saw Flash and HTML from a technical perspective. Of course you can replicate 99% of Flash capability, but that was not the point. Since the first camp sort of rely on the 2nd camp to provide tooling. And the 2nd camp doesn&#x27;t understand or care what they are missing. Nothing is being done.<p>Classic Software consultant and development problem.<p>Again, if Flash no longer provide any value to Adobe, may be they could open source it?')
