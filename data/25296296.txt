We actually found the most amazing babysitter ever.  She is a high school student and watched the kids during the day for us in summer until school started.  We were so excited that we could finally go to movies again.<p>And then the pandemic kicked in.  Sadly, by the time it&#x27;s safe to go to movies again, she&#x27;ll have graduated and left. :(')
