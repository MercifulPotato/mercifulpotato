I&#x27;ve worked with one of the current gen Intel Mac Minis, and that thing gets really hot! Like 60-80 degrees celcius. The insides must be cooking if the outside is that hot.<p>The 2013 Mac Pro also had heating design issues, only corrected with the current gen Mac Pro.<p>I&#x27;d say active cooling is a consistent weakness of the entire modern Mac hardware design division.')
