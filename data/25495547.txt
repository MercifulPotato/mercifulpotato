That does make optimizing performance more difficult.<p>But on a much simpler level, a lot of Pythonic data code is just functions + values, without them being complected in an object.  That makes a lot of stuff like wrapping numerical libraries in C very easy in Python.  I think you&#x27;d still have a bit of a culture shock writing procedural, return-by-value code in Ruby.  That&#x27;s pretty normal in Python and I think one of the (many) reasons it got picked up by STEM disciplines in academia.  <i>Looks over shoulder at awful code in Numerical Recipes in Fortran book</i>.<p>Different strokes for different folks and all that, I just think there are probably constraints (and cultural values) that Python has that make it more suited to data problems than Ruby.')
