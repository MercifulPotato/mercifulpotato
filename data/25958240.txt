Go around arresting people? Stop trading on every market? Say that Robinhood is no longer allowed to trade?<p>It&#x27;s a giant government body that overseas a very large tender market of money, they can&#x27;t just make rash decisions. They need to review, see how it plays out in the longer term, and see how the government is going to want to adjust.<p>I don&#x27;t think technically anything (minus the robinhood&#x2F;other people restricting buying, and even that who knows) that&#x27;s going on is really &quot;wrong-doing&quot; on the surface. Everything seems to be by the book.<p>So they&#x27;ll need to dig deep into the stock and find evidence and provide that evidence to the body that reviews stuff.<p>You probably won&#x27;t hear of any changes for months if not years if at all.')
