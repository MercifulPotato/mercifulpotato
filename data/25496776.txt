It&#x27;s a pain in the ass to correct if you get there by mistake and it&#x27;s very opaque. Overall credit scores seem like a great idea with a terrible implementation. In general you as a mindful consumer that pays your bills on time wouldn&#x27;t want to be paying the same prices for loans (spread, interest) as other consumers that have a history of not paying. A well functioning credit score system makes for a more efficient lending market, allowing consumers to save money if they have a good track record. How it actually works in practice is a joke, though.')
