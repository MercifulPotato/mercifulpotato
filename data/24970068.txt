My favorite pen is the Pilot G-2 07 black.  It can make the tapered points of Chinese &amp; Japanese characters.  Its only shortcoming is that the ink takes about a minute to dry.<p>UNI JetStream 0.7mm black has quick-drying ink and is just as smooth.  But it cannot make the tapered line ends, is more expensive, and has a counterfeit problem.')
