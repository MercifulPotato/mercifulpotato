You may need to make all kinds of adjustments to your recipes. So it feels to me like this is just one of a dozen issues you’ll have.<p>But yes, I did not mean to endorse measuring by volume—only that you can avoid much of the problem if you follow proper measuring technique. As I noted in my post, I personally use weights when baking.<p>As for the historical justification for using volumetric recipes: you’re probably overthinking it if you’re connecting it to geography, and especially if you’re connecting it to altitude. More likely the reason would just be that volumetric measuring was easier and cheaper to reproduce until quite recently. Scales can be expensive, can break, etc. Cups are cheap and durable.')
