The underinvestment extends to the grid (the UK has trouble replacing power lines&#x2F;maintenance, let alone moving towards adding new capacity...the UK has very few detached houses so this is going to be complex).<p>And &quot;build more power plants&quot;...so simple...part of the problem is that actually building more power plants is more complex than just typing a post out or observing it should be true. This is linked to the issues that I mentioned in the previous post (when the govt moved towards green power a decade or so ago, investment went through the floor...more recently, they have introduced price caps...the reason why the UK hasn&#x27;t built power plants is because the govt asked companies to build them, and they said no...which is why the govt has had to hand out big subsidies to nuclear).<p>Btw, if you aren&#x27;t familiar with something, ask more questions (I know this because I used to work as an analyst, and part of my coverage was these companies) rather than assume that someone has made a basic mistake. The power market is local, not global. What is happening in the US isn&#x27;t happening everywhere else (the UK is far further down this road than anyone else).')
