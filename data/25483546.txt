I by and large agree with how you see it.<p>One thing jumped out:<p>&gt;&gt; I think some people are just wired that way, or perhaps set on that course by environmental factors early in life. Either way, it&#x27;s not a choice. So I think it&#x27;s somewhat of a tragic condition.<p>and<p>&gt;&gt; My advice would be that if you&#x27;re consistently getting negative feedback about personality traits from others, take it seriously.<p>If you think about it these two comments are contradictory. Either you are a victim of your programming, or you have the power to (slowly and painfully) recognize it and change.<p>I am a firm believer that people ultimately can recognize their problems and change. Recognition is the harder part. For most of us, to recognize the really deep and ugly things about ourselves is really hard and often is only done when someone has hit bottom and are forced to confront that there&#x27;s something wrong. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;listen to feedback&quot; but it&#x27;s impossible to convince someone they should until they&#x27;ve had some painful experience that forced them to recognize there&#x27;s something that needs to be heard.
