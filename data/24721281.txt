Just because the society around you doesn&#x27;t believe certain rights are real doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t personally buy into them. &quot;Rights are a societal construct&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that nobody has a right to believe different things from society. It just means that our conception of rights derive from societal consensus, not a higher power or objective source, and conversely that there is no higher power or objective source we can invoke to override society&#x27;s mores.<p>&gt; If you are willing to recognize that society has had an incorrect view of rights in the past, you must recognize that there is a standard beyond society to appeal to.<p>No, you can just criticize them using the today&#x27;s moral standards. You can be sufficiently committed to your moral standards to be willing to impose them on other people without simultaneously believing that those moral standards are a objective property of the natural universe.<p>Hume&#x27;s is-ought guillotine is a thing. A normative statement does not magically become an positive fact just because that normative statement is an extremely strongly held (e.g. slavery is bad). The notion of inalienable rights is a rhetorical trick that lazily conflates the normative and the positive.')
