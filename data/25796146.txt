The DOJ (or something at the national level) really needs more oversight when it comes to policing so that we can have collectivized bargaining on both sides.  Local councils can&#x27;t realistically stand up to police unions in a meaningful way since the national charter can drop a ton of money on elections to get troublesome members ousted... Again, another side effect of terrible election finance laws.')
