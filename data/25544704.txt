There&#x27;s lots of uses for hydrogen beyond running your passenger car. It&#x27;s a feedstock into a lot of chemistry (hydrogenating food, making fertilizer, reducing ores) as well as various high temperature processes.<p>It looks like you can blend it at some modest proportion into existing natural gas infrastructure to lighten its environmental burden somewhat.<p>Closer to my personal sphere, I&#x27;d be interested in using it for longer-term energy storage. It&#x27;d be amazing to be able to have some onsite high pressure or even cryogenic storage of hydrogen to be able to store a summer solar surplus for use in the winter. And yes, that&#x27;s in addition to batteries to handle short term (hours up to maybe a week) of generation&#x2F;load mismatches. I&#x27;d probably want to turn some back into electricity, but I&#x27;d be happy to simply burn a bunch too.')
