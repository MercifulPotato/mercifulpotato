But I guess I say that through my &quot;He was trying his best&quot; goggles.<p>&gt; Or as the BBC referred to it, &quot;the worst mistake of Obama&#x27;s presidency&quot;.<p>Is that in this article where Obama admitted that himself? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-36013703" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-36013703</a> . Unlike Bush&#x2F;Cheney who never admitted anything? (But we&#x27;re not judging these men for their honesty at the moment, are we).<p>&gt; Despite destabilizing Iraq, the US military stayed on the ground and at least attempted to create a stable transition of power (and over time largely succeeded, at least by comparison).<p>Huh.. and you&#x27;re asserting that Obama didn&#x27;t continue that policy? Sorry but Iraq didn&#x27;t turn to a peaceful and solved problem in 2008.<p>Seems like you&#x27;re just throwing sweeping generalizations and one word answers to complex problems (&quot;Libya&quot;), and sadly I don&#x27;t know the whole issue in depth either.')
