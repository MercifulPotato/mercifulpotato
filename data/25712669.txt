There are numerous forks of it, with tgstation being the most popular one [1].<p>SS13 is multiplayer round-based role playing game, where players assume the role of a crewmember on a space station. Together they must keep the station running smoothly,  whilst dealing with antagonistic forces who threaten to sabotage the mission.<p>Since most stations have dozens of job roles, each with content enough to last you hundreds of hours it&#x27;s no surprise why people such as myself have spent thousands of hours on it and thousands play this every day. It has systems as varied as atmospherics, fully destructible environments, surgery, genetics, science, engineering, etc etc and the amount of content and interaction possible means that no two rounds are the same. Here&#x27;s a very popular review which shares stories of some of the crazy events that can happen [2].<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s all built on the proprietary engine BYOND. <i>However</i> there are fully libre successors on new FOSS engines which are in-progress to match the massive amount of content SS13 has already accumulated, such as SS14 [3] and Unitystation [4]. I&#x27;m not a hardcore FOSS enthusiast about games so I prefer the amount of content SS13 has for the time being, but in time I intend to play and contribute to one of the successors instead in the future. They both have active servers if you&#x27;re interested in playing them right now, with SS14 also already being available on Steam.<p>Watch the review at least, you won&#x27;t regret hearing the funny stories at the very least.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tgstation&#x2F;tgstation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tgstation&#x2F;tgstation</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=URJ_qSXruW0</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacestation14.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacestation14.io</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitystation.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitystation.org</a>')
