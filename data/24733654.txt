Editorial decision of coverage. &quot;What you choose to talk about&quot; is editorial. That &quot;fact-based reporting&quot; is no less subject to lies of omission. And, beyond that? Contextualization of those &quot;facts&quot;. What are these facts? What do they mean? Why are they worth reporting on? Why are they worth reading about? <i>Are they even &quot;facts&quot;?</i><p>I don&#x27;t blame you personally for propagating this misunderstanding of journalism as there is a lot of power and money behind <i>not having actual journalism</i>, but &quot;actual fact-based reporting&quot; is a canard designed to keep the populace <i>dumb</i>. Reportage--journalism--has always contextualized information and explained <i>why you should care</i>. That cannot, repeat cannot, be divorced from the act of reporting. A stock ticker is not journalism. You can get it if you want. But it doesn&#x27;t mean squat to the overwhelming majority of people, nor is it expected to, and the dull ignorance of a wave of decontextualized &quot;facts-only&quot; reportage is an idea <i>designed</i> to create a dumber and less civically capable society.<p>It also happens to make the comfortable and the comparatively powerful, a class to whom I belong, feel less challenged about things. Convenient, that. But bad for us, no matter how convenient it is.')
