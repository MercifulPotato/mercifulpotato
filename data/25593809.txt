Bochs emulates even an i7, at glacial speeds, but it&#x27;s a beast for debugging.\nIt emulates even the virtualisation instructions themselves, FFS, in order to debug the inners of a guest OS while &quot;virtualising&quot;.\nAnd it did VooDoo and VooDoo2 before PCEM several years before even it existed.<p>The issue is those early games for W95 don&#x27;t even launch properly on real machines under Windows 98!')
