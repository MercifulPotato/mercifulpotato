That&#x27;s the point. The status quo has some glaring issues. I understand it&#x27;s difficult to take proposals for big changes seriously, but does that mean we should not take the problems of our current system seriously?<p>&gt; You&#x27;re saying that residential property gets a special restriction on how people who own something are able to use it or enter into agreements on how they can charge others for the use of it?<p>Yes. Specifically, no one can enter an agreement where housing can be rented. The core idea is that housing can be owned and sold, just that it can&#x27;t be rented. There can be some discussion as to whether short term contracts like hotels could be allowed, but they would have to be regulated to prevent abuse.<p>The only question left is what to do about extant rental contracts.<p>&gt; Who occupies a house then? Only the owner?<p>The owner or a guest. That&#x27;s how housing works outside renting.<p>If you can&#x27;t charge rent on property, then you are incentivized to sell it, thereby flooding the home ownership market and lowering the cost of housing.<p>This is a concept that has been discussed at length elsewhere. I encourage you not to use me as your only source of education.')
