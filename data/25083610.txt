The extremely wealthy allocate money for these expensive yet unprofitable online services, like uber, doordash, and UpWork, almost like socialist central planners. So many of these modern businesses would not exist without the safety net of the extremely wealthy.<p>Also, how is DoorDash still unprofitable, despite taking 30% commissions from restaurants, and 25% commissions from delivery costs, during a pandemic which has many people locked inside???
