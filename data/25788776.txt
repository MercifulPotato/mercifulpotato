I accept <i>other</i> reasons in this case, but not this one. Which of these positions you endorse has far-reaching consequences for the moral and legal evaluation.<p>It&#x27;s similar with the &quot;war on drugs&quot; or when you want to evaluate the morality of your sneakers and clothes. Should possession of the drugs be illegal because people were harmed in their production (by e.g. drug cartels), should possession of the clothes be illegal because they were produced with child labour? I don&#x27;t think so.<p><i>Edit: To make this clear, I merely replied again to clarify the difference not because I think there is a huge disagreement. This is obviously an unpleasant and contentious topic and I very much hope I don&#x27;t come across as a CP apologist - I&#x27;m not, for the other reason I&#x27;ve mentioned.</i>')
