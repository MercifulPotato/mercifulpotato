I was working on a soccer game using Godot engine and COVID-19 came along, so I switched to building a math game to take advantage of the fact my kids were at home with me all day. It&#x27;s designed for 8-11 year old children. It was a hit with my 2 boys from the start and after a lot of testing got to the point it was a hit with my friends&#x27; kids as well.')
