Mid-summer, studies were either in vitro or limited to medical settings. One I saw analyzing a natural experiment didn&#x27;t make it clear if their numbers were relative or absolute. It reported a 2% benefit, but that can mean very different things. Maybe there&#x27;s something better out now.<p>There was a comment I read on HN suggesting spread at home is where we should pay more attention. It explains why Bay Area-level masking hasn&#x27;t ~eliminated new cases, why minority communities (read: larger households) are hit harder, and puts Sweden, a country where most people live alone, in context.')
