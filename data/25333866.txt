Item(by='NoOneNew', descendants=None, kids=[25333952], score=None, time=1607359686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333400, text='I dont know how feasible it would be, but an official lic&#x2F;cert to allow someone to see personal data (I assume data with name, location and other sensitive data like credit card, social security num, etc) is extremely interesting. Pretty sure someone can make a quick list of hurdles and potential exploits, but still... I think theres a public value in that as the accountability could reflect something like architect and engineering plans for a building. The name and lic are on the plan so you can fry the person who made an egregious error. A similar mechanism for exploiting personal data (within legal parameters) would be nifty. I like it, but since products are not owned but licensed by consumers these days means that&#x27;s a crack induced pipe dream.')
