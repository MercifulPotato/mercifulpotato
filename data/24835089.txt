They don&#x27;t have the mental models to conceptualize what exactly is it that annoys them, and they don&#x27;t have a voice to express that annoyance. But they are annoyed, and you can hear that when you actually talk to them. The frequently heard things like &quot;Why did they have to rearrange everything again?&quot;, &quot;Google &#x27;xyz contact form&#x27; because it&#x27;s easier than finding it on the xyz site&quot;, or &quot;My computer is slow it&#x27;s probably viruses&quot; are symptoms of that.')
