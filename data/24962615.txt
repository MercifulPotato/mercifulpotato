It’s enough to crash Windows, but not enough to do more than that. An attacker would likely need to do additional work to make it relevant to them unless they’re just a prankster. Given that the disclosure says exactly where an attacker would need to start looking, it doesn’t make much difference whether a PoC is released in this case.<p>This isn’t always true: sometimes knowing where to look is the easy part, and crafting a working exploit is the hard part. I don’t get the impression that’s the case here.')
