Yes you can go to the unified billing, but freight was it&#x27;s own separate section. Yes you can get consolidated package&#x2F;freight quotes but each had it&#x27;s own website workflow. Yes you can generate a BOL on the ups.com website but it was way better to use the upsfreight.com website. The Freight API used the same ups.com API server and login, but it was it&#x27;s own path with it&#x27;s own xml schema.<p>It was pretty clear that the integration was, at best, surface level. Especially when the package reps and the freight reps had no clue what the other was doing, letting me know that it was just a siloed org.')
