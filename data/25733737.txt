Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25733924], score=None, time=1610390283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732809, text='Yes - Apple&#x2F;Google should be able to cut off Parler <i>from their own stores</i>.<p>BUT.<p>Parler should still be available via 3rd party stores if the user so chooses (which isn&#x27;t possible). Here we have a case of big tech acting against the will of the user &quot;for their own good&quot; which I fundamentally disagree with. I own the device. I should have the right to install anything I want on it, even if the company that makes the device deemed the thing I want bad for me or for society.<p>Amazon should not be able to kick services off of AWS they don&#x27;t agree with. That&#x27;s entering cloudflare&#x2F;daily stormer territory and is a dangerous precedent. I prefer the &quot;infrastructure&quot; layers of the stack to be net neutral.')
