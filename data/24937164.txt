Especially if you&#x27;re coming from some other paradigms &#x2F; languages etc., RoR can feel quite different. Understanding the philosophy is a nice window to kickstart the &quot;way&quot; of RoR.<p>On a more practical level, I&#x27;ve found the official Ruby on Rails guides [2] to be super helpful. I started a RoR job almost a year ago without having done any Ruby at all (I had a Python background). I probably should have gone through the tutorials in the OP and in other comments (rails tutorial book comes to mind). But since I didn&#x27;t, I used the RoR guides A LOT. And they were super useful. Everything from routes, to controllers, to ActiveModel and migrations. They give you a good starting point to get most of the job done. Highly recommend looking at the relevant guides if you are working on specific RoR things!<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rubyonrails.org&#x2F;doctrine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rubyonrails.org&#x2F;doctrine&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.rubyonrails.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.rubyonrails.org&#x2F;</a>')
