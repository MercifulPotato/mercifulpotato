The last few projects I&#x27;ve worked on I used vanilla HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS and I found it so much better than using any of the popular front-end frameworks.  I didn&#x27;t have megabytes of dependencies before a single line of production code was written. I didn&#x27;t have to spend time trying to understand any Webpack incantations.')
