What good is it for the 96% of the world that is not the US? Does it even benefit anyone outside the US ruling class?<p>As you alluded to in the previous paragraph, it&#x27;s good for people because it means we&#x27;re not participating in the kind of horrific wars that ravaged the world in the century before. And the US has been far less extractive than previous global hegemons. (So in that sense it&#x27;s worse for US citizens, but better for the rest of the world)<p>Now, everything is a tradeoff, and perhaps this particular tradeoff hasn&#x27;t been worth it. But there are most certainly good things that US hegemony has given the world.')
