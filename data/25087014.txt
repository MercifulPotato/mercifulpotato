Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605298989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082077, text='&gt; Do you think that all people are born with the innate ability to master computers, programming, and other technical tasks?<p>No. That is besides the point.<p>There is a big difference in knowing how to repair a computer, how to program a computer and how to do technical tasks with a computer.<p>Repairing a computer normally involves identifying the part that is faulty and replacing it. On a desktop PC that is relatively because the components go together like Lego pieces tbh. My father managed to replace the memory in his ageing desktop computer by just looking for what the parts were in the machine and just replacing them. He barely understands how to use a keyboard (he highlights each letter with the mouse and presses delete)<p>I am good at programming computers but I don&#x27;t understand how Excel works past very basics. My friend who can&#x27;t &quot;program&quot; with something like a text editor or IDE, she will quite happily do all sorts of complicated tasks with sheets and cells in it all day.<p>&gt; Just as not all people are born with innate ability to write a good novel, paint a masterpiece, write a symphony, or lead a nation, I&#x27;d say no.<p>I never claimed the opposite.<p>However there are plenty of people while they can&#x27;t write a symphony can start up their own metal tribute band and make quite a lot of money.<p>You are painting it as a binary of people that can&#x27;t do something and people that have mastered something. There are plenty room inbetween.<p>This place is called hackernews and I have explain this point sooo verbosely. This must be satire.<p>&gt; But all people are born with the ability to live their own life and learn how best to do it in the direction that seems natural for themselves.<p>Some aren&#x27;t actually. I have a friend that looks after seriously mentally ill people. They must be cared for almost 24&#x2F;7. There is one lad he told me about that will masturbate in public because he has no concept of it being socially unacceptable due to having somethign similar to asbergers IIRC.<p>&gt; You are confusing the spirit of this discourse.<p>I don&#x27;t think so.')
