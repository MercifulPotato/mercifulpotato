Then, air pressure is applied to the shell exterior, pushing a drop of fluid out of the hole. The process takes one second per egg and enables fluid to be collected from eggs without touching them.<p>This seems counterintuitive. If the external pressure is equally applied around the egg, what forces the fluid to escape?')
