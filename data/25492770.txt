No one has claimed that this is uncommon, or &quot;the end of the world&quot;, or &quot;her whole family is racist&quot;, or &quot;it&#x27;s the reason everyone else can&#x27;t get ahead in life&quot;. They&#x27;ve simply said it&#x27;s racist, and that claim seems uncontroversial given the definitions.<p>For example, if it turned out someone gave 1 cents more on average to white vs non-white beggars (due to unconscious racial biases), that would clearly be racist, but it also wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world, and I don&#x27;t think person would be a particularly bad person.<p>If something fits the definition of racism, it doesn&#x27;t become not racism just because someone feels attacked by calling it racism.<p>Now, in common parlance, racism is a loaded word, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s advisable to call someone racist over these issues, and I wouldn&#x27;t do so. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we should censor ourselves when discussing these topics in the abstract. Otherwise, we&#x27;re basically practicing political correctness.')
