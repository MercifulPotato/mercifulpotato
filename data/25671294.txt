I voted with one of these machines for the first time this election and all it did was... print out my choices on a ballot. It takes all of 15 seconds to look over your votes and make sure they&#x27;re correct. Then I manually put the ballot in a privacy sleeve, walked over to the ballot box, and inserted my ballot. The machine was a mere convenience that kept me from needing to manually circle my choices with a pen. Not much opportunity for widespread voter fraud in my opinion.<p>If the machines were switching votes so rampantly you&#x27;d think, of the millions of people who voted, more people would&#x27;ve raised concern at the polls when they noticed their vote for the president of the United States at the top of the printed ballot was switched.<p>Am I missing something?')
