You don&#x27;t have to prove private key compromise for a CA to revoke a cert, you just ask them to revoke it. How in the world is this apple&#x27;s fault?<p>As long as they authenticate the person requesting the revocation. In most CA&#x27;s, this can be done by signing the request with the private key to prove control.<p>Now we are told that blame &quot;MUST&quot; be apportioned? &quot;HP and Apple failed in their responsibility&quot;<p>For all we know HP could have found a remote zero day exploit in their drivers, and was going to initiate a replacement effort or something.<p>The author also complains no CRL is available, but that&#x27;s a good thing in these cases, if there is a mistake certificate status can be updated. So again, apple has an approach here that means it&#x27;s not too hard to get folks printing again.<p>The author makes a case that a publisher can only revoke in the case of malware and key compromise. I can think of PLENTY of situations where revocation might make sense (and publisher may be still sued I&#x27;m sure) outside of that, for small teams and even for big teams.')
