Technical debt is not bad code. It&#x27;s expedient decisions made to achieve short term business value at a long term cost.<p>On point 2, you&#x27;re right they should be separate, but I think the solution is, refactor to make your solution easy, then build the solution.<p>Point 1, if you have a significant rearchitecture to mention on your roadmap, do so.
