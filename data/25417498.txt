If you mean stuff I get paid for, my workload is variable. If you mean doing productive stuff, I probably do around 8-12 hours a day.<p>I do a lot of writing, which means a lot of reading. Some of that writing I publish, a lot is not.<p>I develop my skills, not always in ways that are directly related to tasks I do for money, but they generally end up contributing to my income.<p>I also don&#x27;t really have a weekend. If work needs doing, it gets done and I take the time when I don&#x27;t have work. I worked 3 days in a row about 12 hours a day on a hardware project I&#x27;m shipping, building hardware, testing software, writing a manual, imaging cards. I&#x27;ll do more of that this afternoon but I&#x27;m not working a large amount of hours today due to unrelated outages.')
