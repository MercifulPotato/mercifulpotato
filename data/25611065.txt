(remarkable has folders and notebooks, so i keep one notebook per ongoing project)<p>4. one of my remarkable notebooks is &quot;Todos&quot;. it&#x27;s so cool to have one physical &quot;notebook&quot; for all my different notebooks. it&#x27;s like a kindle but for creating! the internal organization works really well for me. ps - did i mention that digital writing can be edited and doesn&#x27;t suffer from getting messy and disorganized like paper? such joy.<p>5. there are just enough features like pens and line widths and &quot;smart vector based selection&quot; to be useful, while still being simple and getting out of the way. i&#x27;ve never had a tablet or ipad. i don&#x27;t want more screens in my life. i have an old iphone i try not to get attached to. i use a neo for writing stories and journals ;-p<p>i dont get excited by technology. BUT to me the remarkable is a single purpose tool that works beautifully well.<p>ps - to me the purpose is to create. i don&#x27;t need a phone todo app or anything more prescriptive than a futuristic notebook.<p>pps - i used the remarkable outside today, for example, and didnt think twice. eink is lovely.<p>yes there are differmented between the remarkable and high quality paper and analog art tools, as well as high quality digital tools (there&#x27;s some parallax in remarkable among other issues that simply cannot compare to the cintiq, to say nothing of professional art software) but those tools aren&#x27;t life changing the way the remarkable fills it&#x27;s particular niche.<p>totally cool if it&#x27;s not your cup of tea, i just love it and recommend visual communicators and visual note takers check it out.<p>pppppps - oh yeah, the scribble to text transcription is on point. that&#x27;s not my main usage, but i&#x27;m impressed it can read my actual-not-lettering scrawls, which sometimes i can&#x27;t even read.<p>i can&#x27;t share examples of most of what i&#x27;ve created, but for fun i&#x27;ve started making comics out of work charts and graphs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;staycalmcomic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;staycalmcomic</a>')
