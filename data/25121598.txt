In this case, the light never appears. The switch must be pressed eventually in the future so that the circuit sends the message back in time. If you find out a way to &quot;trick&quot; the system by never pressing the switch, it never sends the message in the first place.<p>The mechanism doesn&#x27;t work by predicting whether you will press the button in 1 second.
