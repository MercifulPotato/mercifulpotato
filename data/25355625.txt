Maybe it was, maybe they are &quot;inflating&quot; the sophistication of the attack to avoid looking bad.<p>Besides that, I care little about &quot;attribution specialists&quot; and what they say (sorry if anybody is in the audience :p). Evidence can be faked, it&#x27;s all bits and bytes in the end (and some server locations, usually rented boxes) and things have been misattributed constantly in the past and will be in the future. I think the most you can infer is the general sophistication of the attackers and their resources, but that doesn&#x27;t require an &quot;attribution specialist&quot;. Attributing it to some specific nation state is guess work at best based on mistakes they made in their camouflage (if those mistakes aren&#x27;t a deliberate or accidental red herring; e.g. [1]). And such &quot;It was China&#x2F;Russia&#x2F;North Korea&#x2F;underpants gnomes&quot; claims are made by people claiming to be &quot;attribution specialists&quot; all the time. It&#x27;s extremely rare that there is compelling evidence to supporting such attributions.<p>So if FireEye provided evidence or at least a reasonably detailed post mortem backing their claim of a sophisticated attack, then I&#x27;d probably believe them on that. If they made claims about a particular nation state (and so far they did not, as far as I can tell) then I would find that a dubious claim to make.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;08&#x2F;wikileaks-files-show-the-cia-repurposing-foreign-hacking-code-to-save-time-not-to-frame-russia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;08&#x2F;wikileaks-files-show-the...</a>')
