Why should tech companies (and by extension software engineers) provide discounted service to non tech businesses?<p>No other industry has made themselves so available at such affordable pricing than tech has?<p>Where are all the blog posts&#x2F;free software&#x2F;free advise from those finance companies?<p>Where is all the free legal&#x2F;free court counsel info from all lawyers?<p>It&#x27;s about time tech started charging for commercial use.<p>Software engineers worldwide deserve more of the pie and letting traditional industries eat Michelin quality food at fast food prices has to end.<p>Retailers don&#x27;t sell at cost - they never have. They sell at as much profit as they can get (and yet free ERPs exist&#x2F;cheap e-commerce exists).<p>All so the non-tech business people can have greater profit? Fuck that.')
