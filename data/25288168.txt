My state (tamil nadu&#x2F;india) has banned plastic bags and cups .. generally what we might think of as single use. You have to take your own bags or (in some shops) buy reusable+degradable cloth bags. There are also grocery shops like &quot;eco indian&quot; to which you take your own containers, fill them up, weigh and pay. That&#x27;s how we used to do it when I was a kid, but it all went plastic after that. Glad to see it coming back. Covid threw another curve ball but the ban hasn&#x27;t changed. Next up should be food packaging.')
