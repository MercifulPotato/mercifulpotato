It&#x27;s basically automatic recursion-to-loop transformation (whether you call it &quot;optimisation&quot; or not is just a semantic issue). So obviously will turn &quot;infinite recursion but not really because it blows the stack&quot; into &quot;infinite loop&quot;.<p>But then many languages are quite loose with stack size requirement anyways, as well as stack traces (e.g. JVM&#x27;s can include details about the internal implementation and&#x2F;or automatic compiler transforms, e.g. concerning lambdas, methodhanles, invokedynamic etc).')
