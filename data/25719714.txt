The notion that weather has become more extreme still relies on very little data and statistical models trying to fit different <i>types</i> of events into the same model.  ...and none of the models are able to digest all types of events across the entire world, over the entire 100 year reference time window.<p>But more importantly, the debate around it is a distraction.<p>The <i>proven</i> fact is that global warming has occurred and continues, AND that it will cause sea level rise within our lifetime.  That fact has sufficient serious consequences for nations&#x2F;states&#x2F;cities to begin planning local responses, and <i>maybe</i> coordinate global emissions reductions (though this seems increasingly too little, too late).')
