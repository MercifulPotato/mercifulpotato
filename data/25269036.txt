I&#x27;ve only ever used the App Store for upgrading from Win10 S to Win 10 and I rarely even notice the ads are there.<p>I don&#x27;t have any issue with the things you raised because they&#x27;re just not serious issues.  I&#x27;m more concerned with other problems like forced updates &amp; workstation windows getting cranky without reboots &amp; the batshit Frankenstein of new+old control panels in win10 &amp; the fact that most computers in the world use unix-like operating systems.')
