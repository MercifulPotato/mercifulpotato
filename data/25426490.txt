Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608001401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425369, text='&gt; I think the resistance to reparations comes from folks like me who don&#x27;t see a reason we should pay anything.<p>I agree that individual Americans shouldn&#x27;t have to pay anything. All former slaveowners are long dead. These claims are properly levied against the government and whatever other institutions still exist (universities and corporations come to mind).<p>&gt; I also do not think direct reparations are the best approach to resolving the continuing racism in America.<p>You&#x27;ll be relieved to learn that there are proposals for reparations that do not ask for payments to individuals.')
