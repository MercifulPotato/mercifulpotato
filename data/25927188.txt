One thing to note about Kinesis Advantage 2 is that it is really massive compared to other keyboards. I didn&#x27;t realize before getting one for myself and seeing it on my desk.<p>Second thing is that quite frankly at that price point Advantage looks a and feels a bit flimsy (especially the middle part between the key wells) though it has seemingly no impact on typing.<p>And lastly, I have a bit broader shoulders than average and I need hands a bit more apart than the key wells on Kinesis and maybe a bit more tilted sideways (well at least I think, I am not a doctor). It is orders of magnitude better than it used to be on a regular keyboard, but I still have sore muscles around shoulder blades and back of my neck sometimes.<p>All of these issues seem to be solvable by a split. I still hope that Kinesis would release a split concave keyboard by themselves since among all of the concave keyboards it is by far the most user friendly (no assembly required, no QMK compiling, remapping is doable on the keyboard itself), but I am starting to oogle the likes of Dactyl, Dactyl-ManuFrom or Bastyl[1] (which is modified Dactyl with less DIY required for more $$).<p>If I go the DYI way I am also thinking about mounting trackball on it similar to the Tracktyl (trackball helped me immensely with my wrists). What I am a bit afraid of is that once I start doing customizations I&#x27;ll need&#x2F;want something easily modifiable&#x2F;adjustable to experiment with quickly. This design [2] in combination with Bastyl-like flexible PCBs seems like a neat idea I&#x27;d like to try.<p>Be not mistaken, Advantage is, not entirely unlike a good office chair or a mattress, still worth every penny, but IMO the split concave keyboards are the &quot;future future&quot;. I would not even think of building a keyboard before Advantage, but now I do and there is no turning back for me.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hidtech.ca&#x2F;?product=bastyl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hidtech.ca&#x2F;?product=bastyl</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deskthority.net&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=11734" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deskthority.net&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=11734</a>')
