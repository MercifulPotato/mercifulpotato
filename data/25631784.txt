Do you remember when Donald Trump called nazis &quot;very fine people&quot; and threatened to have journalists assasinated? There is nothing these people won&#x27;t attemp to destroy our democracy, including putting immigrant children in concentration camps, and spreading dangerous falsehoods and conspiracy theories is just another day at the office for them.<p>And these days it is even worse. I fear for the republic if Trump attempts a coup because they ridiculously claim &quot;the election was hacked&quot;!<p>In short, those paranoid idiots spreading conspiracies are sick and evil and I hope we will have the technology in the near future to keep them under very close surveillance 24x7.')
