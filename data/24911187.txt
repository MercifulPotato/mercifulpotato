If the avionics software catastrophically fails in a commercial airliner hundreds of people could die. If there is a critical software malfunction in a single gas stove that could result in it filling a house in the middle of a night with gas and there are no other safety precautions then maybe four people could die. This is already a 1-2 order of magnitude difference in risk and easy to mitigate by having a hardware safety interlock which reduces dependence on software reliability.<p>The real problem in these cases is internet-connectivity + software-control. Without internet-connectivity, your primary failure mode is random chance. The probability of failure of each system is largely independent from the others as there are few ways to induce simultaneous failure in all such systems. This means that the worst-case failure mode of any individual error is the worst-case of single-system failure which, for most systems, is relatively limited. However, once you add in internet-connectivity, you now introduce an easy way to induce simultaneous failure. Since these systems will all be running the same software, an error in one is an error in all, and you can now exploit the error in all simultaneously. This instantly adds a gigantic single point of failure whose failure mode is critical failure in all systems at the same time.<p>Suddenly, the software failure mode of an internet-connected gas stove with remote turn-on [1] is no longer one house blowing up in the middle of the night killing possibly 4 people, it is every one of the houses buying the 3.5 million gas stoves sold this year [1] blowing up killing possibly 14 million people. The introduction of internet-connectivity raises the worst case failure mode from a tragedy to approximately a nuclear first strike and surpassing Hitler as a mass murderer. They should not be releasing internet-connected gas stoves unless every engineer on their team is comfortable that their security would be good enough to connect the US nuclear arsenal to the internet since the worst-case consequences are equally bad.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geappliances.com&#x2F;ge&#x2F;connected-appliances&#x2F;ranges-ovens-cooking.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geappliances.com&#x2F;ge&#x2F;connected-appliances&#x2F;ranges-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;221447&#x2F;gas-range-and-oven-shipment-forecast-in-the-us-by-quarter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;221447&#x2F;gas-range-and-ove...</a>')
