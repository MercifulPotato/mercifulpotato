I don&#x27;t think AZ can claim anything about preventing asymptomatic infections. You&#x27;re right in that they&#x27;re the only ones with that data, but that data is practically identical between control (37&#x2F;2760) and vaccinated (34&#x2F;2751) groups.<p>Side note, the more I read about the AZ trials in detail, the more it becomes obvious how messy their trial was compared to the Pfizer&#x2F;Moderna ones. They have so many more methodologies and outcomes and much smaller samples.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a>')
