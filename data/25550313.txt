[1]<p>She struggled with mental health issues and depression most of her life. She excelled academically and she was driven to write, but at the same time, she  struggled with her own self. Her life is marked by several suicide attempts.<p>She married the poet Ted Hughes and moved around frequently during their short marriage. While she was ambitious, a deep sense of anxiety kept her from exploring and expressing her own identity through her writing.<p>Most of her poetry was written during a short burst of creativity, over the course of a few months, in late 1962. She died of suicide in 1963. Her famous novel, The Bell Jar, was published a month before her death. Major themes in this novel include &quot;socially acceptable identity&quot; and mental health.

As Plath received treatment and openly discussed her mental health issues, undoubtedly she was told this many times over.')
