I see that it is a &quot;Cisco Certified Compatible Display&quot; which gives me pause ... but I think I will get one of these and see how it behaves ...<p>EDIT 2:  The samsung model is described as having &quot;Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth&quot; which is sort of a deal breaker ... we&#x27;ll see.')
