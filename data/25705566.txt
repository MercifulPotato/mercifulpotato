The web had started with static web sites. Many of them had misused HTML tags to take shortcuts, and to achieve a certain look, including `&lt;pre&gt;`, `&lt;table&gt;`, etc. That had eventually caused so many compatibility issues that we thought malformed documents were a problem, so we defined a rigid structure for HTML called XHTML. We discovered the value of semantics and separated style from content with CSS. Then, we thought XHTML was too much work and just went back to loose style with HTML5 for ease of use. Then, people thought CSS was so much work that they applauded Tailwind for brining styling back into HTML. And three decades later, &quot;next-gen static blogging&quot; is about misusing HTML tags to take shortcuts, and to achieve a certain look. :)')
