At this point can the Republican party be saved, though? He made the comparison to Krystallnacht, which is a stretch (and feels very wrong), but is relevant in that in both cases the authorities stood by and watched. That seems to be problem: the party, its beliefs and those within it are still held in esteem. Calling some unnamed people &quot;spineless&quot; isn&#x27;t the full-throated denunciation of the ideology and all those affiliated that seems needed. All those Republican congresspeople voting against certifying the election indicates this anti-democratic ideology has taken strong root within the party -- has become the ideology of the party. The Republican party itself has become a threat to democracy. If they won both houses in the next election, would you trust them to certify the election of a Democrat president? I&#x27;m sure there are many reasonable Republicans on here, but can you still trust the party to represent those reasonable beliefs? I&#x27;m not suggesting all those people should suddenly become Democrats, just pointing out that I don&#x27;t know that this is a problem that can be fixed without much more drastic changes.')
