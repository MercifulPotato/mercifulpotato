War is often a case of responding in kind.<p>If the Germans had had the capability of bombing London they would have (but couldn&#x27;t thanks to radar).  This was not a small conflict but an existential fight for existence between two groups of countries.<p>I have a hard time judging the decision to carpet bomb during WWII harshly given the circumstances.  Note that both sides had nerve agents that were not deployed because neither wanted that escalation.<p>There are definitely events, and even wars, where the US has committed atrocities but I don&#x27;t think carpet bombing during WWII is a good example of it.')
