The more orders&#x2F;powers you add into a fit equation, the more it&#x27;s going to get artificially closer inside your data window (as you sledgehammer it into a nearly arbitrary shape).  And the more it&#x27;s going to immediately shoot to infinity the moment it gets out of your data window, because those extreme powers of your variable are all fighting each other and have no real connection to the underlying data; what physical process is causing x^10 and x^11 and x^12 curves or even x^5 and x^6?<p>See the last example here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2048&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2048&#x2F;</a>')
