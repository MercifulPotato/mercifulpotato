I&#x27;ve built my fair share of such spreadsheets, and as penance, I&#x27;m learning R.<p>The thing with Excel is there&#x27;s a low barrier to entry, but there are a lot of differences between a great spreadsheet and a bad one.  Somewhat like a junior vs senior developer, the quality of code&#x2F;spreadsheet depends on what they know, how well they can troubleshoot, and how good of a system they can imagine (to then replicate as much as possible).<p>For example, most people are entirely unaware that Tables exist in Excel.  When you want the sum of a column, rather than writing =SUM(F7:F39) and cursing when you realize you added 10 more rows and that&#x27;s why the sum is not updating, you can do =SUM(tbl_Sales[SalePrice]), and when you add 10 rows, the table will automatically expand.  Suddenly your formulas are somewhat self-documenting, regardless of which sheet holds tbl_Sales.  Crtl+T when you&#x27;ve selected your data, or Insert -&gt; Tables -&gt; Table.<p>You can also make named ranges, which I would say is an analog between using {a, b, c, tempVar} versus well named variables in normal programming.<p>You can also trace dependents&#x2F;precedents, showing arrows for how the data flows throughout the spreadsheet.
