For the JVM or .NET, they give you virtually no insight at all into system calls - so eBPF is complementary to VM profilers, not a replacement. If you ever used Shark on OS X you will get a sense of how cool this is - this was a profiler for the OS X JVM which profiled the system calls as well and combined it all into a single trace tree. Maybe one day we&#x27;ll get similar profilers on Linux for these systems - with eBPF it should be fairly straightforward.<p>OpenTelemetry is just a reference API. You could export metrics using eBPF as well. I&#x27;m pretty sure Sysdig does this for example.')
