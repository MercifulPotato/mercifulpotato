You said &quot;Amnesiac is a level above FDE. You can’t be compelled to decrypt that which does not exist.&quot; Well, if the USB stick that contains the amnesiac OS also contains a script for downloading an encrypted blob from cloud storage, then obviously we are back at the &quot;being compelled to decrypt&quot; issue that we started from. If we&#x27;re going to have an encrypted $TOP_SECRET document, we might as well encrypt the whole disk. And at this point the amnesiac property of the OS doesn&#x27;t really provide a lot of benefit.')
