The problem is that:<p>* Cooper and Zinc that are the parts of brass.<p>* Iron, Chrome and Manganese that are common in stainless steel.<p>So the most simple explanation is contamination from the surrounding vessel and plumbing.<p>It is also very strange that they didn&#x27;t get Cadmium and Indium that are the direct product of fusion of Palladium and Silver with Hydrogen, Deuterium and Helium. It is like if there was a fusion and then the new atom split into smaller atoms like all the ones I listed before. It is strange.')
