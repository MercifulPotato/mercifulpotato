You could save your life or that of a friend by learning what&#x27;s in these videos.<p>So, everyone, please EDUCATE YOURSELF and stay safe!<p>[1] - Part 1 - The History of MDMA              <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8ZY-ZFJnWbg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8ZY-ZFJnWbg</a><p>[2] - Part 2 - Tips for Safer Use               <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HgUPKYrpBvY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HgUPKYrpBvY</a><p>[3] - Part 3 - Pharmacology and Medical Use     <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UHduGGB5kJU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UHduGGB5kJU</a><p>[4] - Part 4 - The Need for Drug Policy Reform <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nTSiyQHm2s4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nTSiyQHm2s4</a><p>[5] - Part 5 - Heather Brooks                   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O8s-nhlaACw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O8s-nhlaACw</a><p>[6] - Part 6 - Joseph Pred                      <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0wolzUE3lPk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0wolzUE3lPk</a><p>[7] - Part 7 - Question &amp; Answer                <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rovaoVjLnOk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rovaoVjLnOk</a><p>[8] - Prohibition Fatalities and MDMA Complexities: Interview With Emanuel Sferios, the founder of DanceSafe   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yHKYogJ8Yxs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yHKYogJ8Yxs</a>')
