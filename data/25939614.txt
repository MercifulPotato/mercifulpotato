Note this section does not improve the asymptotic case, but has significant constant-factor advantages for small inputs.&quot;<p>[edit]<p>I noticed you mentioned &quot;heap&quot; assuming you&#x27;re talking about the data-structure, that would probably be in a different class than one where you read windows source code.  Just like you probably wouldn&#x27;t read Joyce in a class on composing newspaper articles.<p>I still think it&#x27;s useful to dissect existing code to get an idea of how complicated it really can be.  A CS undergrad may graduate without ever reading or writing a single program over 1kloc.  Even from an academia perspective, having a concept that real-world software is usually 100s or 1000s of kloc is likely useful.')
