I was not clear enough.<p>People are dying constantly because not enough people are helping.<p>Relative to the number of people trying to help, the size of the problem is nearly infinite.<p>If someone who could help, doesn&#x27;t, the people they would have saved just die. No one else will save them.<p>This is the unreasonable burden. This is why I don&#x27;t suggest it lightly. I&#x27;m telling a person who is already suffering enough to want to <i>opt out</i>, that people will die unless they choose to stay and do a truly unacceptable amount of work.<p>I&#x27;d certainly like to see people in better circumstances help, but there seems to be a problem of perspective. The full scope and seriousness of the problem <i>tends</i> to slide off and not stick for &#x27;healthy&#x27; people. Not always, and I appreciate everyone who does even the smallest bit, but... apparently it&#x27;s ignored often enough that it continues.<p>(To be clear, I don&#x27;t really blame people who never think about it or shy away from actually engaging with it. No one can be expected to tolerate it or to carry the burden of doing something about atrocity. That the world contains these evils is not really their <i>fault</i>, they&#x27;re just people that happen to be in slightly different circumstances than the ones currently dying.)')
