Brought my bike in to my local shop to have them fix it. They said &quot;I hope you have a spare because we don&#x27;t have tires, and it may be two months before we get any&quot;. I did have my spare that I had brought in with me. And I felt good about giving the shop some service works because I noticed right away that they had almost no bikes in stock.')
