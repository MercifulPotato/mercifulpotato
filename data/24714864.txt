Do you want A or C? It&#x27;s a coin toss, of course.<p>But suppose you pick door A first and THEN he knowingly opens a wrong door you didn&#x27;t choose (B). Now the odds of winning are 2&#x2F;3rds if you switch. But it <i>feels</i> the same as in the previous case. (&quot;How could choosing a door first affect the odds?! It couldn&#x27;t <i>possibly</i> change anything!!&quot;)<p>The answer is that your choice of a door constrains Monty.<p>Suppose you choose a door secretly before Monty opens a door. Suppose you choose A, and Monty opens door A, revealing a goat. Well, uh, you can&#x27;t pick <i>that</i> any more, now, can you? You&#x27;re forced to choose between B and C, a toss up.<p>But if you publicly pick door A then Monty can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t open A; he has to open one of the other doors. Since you <i>probably</i> chose the wrong door to begin with, and he <i>always</i> opens a wrong door, the other remaining closed door probably has the car.')
