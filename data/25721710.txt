The request to use JIRA was basically our managers and the product people wanting some vague reassurance that progress was being made, but nobody was concerned with the details of the tickets, etc.  This included early-phase &#x27;R&amp;D&#x27; work on a medical device.  Of course in that setting once the device was on a release cadence, if we were contributing to the 1.x line of the release we had a lot more overhead :).   However even then you could always file yourself a more R&amp;D flavor ticket, as long as it was going to the long-term branch and not to the release branch...<p>What it came down to, per the article, was that everyone in the co. respected that the engineering team was capable of delivering results and solving problems.<p>But i think per your question about JIRA, it gives you autonomy if:\n- anyone on the team can add a ticket\n- the team is trusted to make small changes in scope or spec to tickets in response to things they encounter as they work\n- there is little to no ceremony around accepting tickets as done\n- the team is trusted to check their own work first, and then collaborate with QA &#x2F; stakeholders &#x2F; etc. on releases')
