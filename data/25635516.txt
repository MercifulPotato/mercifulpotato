The one constant I&#x27;ve found that hampers my productivity is working from a &quot;shared&quot; space. Working out of a space like the living room or bed room, where you would normally relax, tends to make me slack off, get distracted easily, etc.<p>I have noticed though that your work space doesn&#x27;t need to be fully dedicated though, it just needs to not be a leisure room. We adopted a Belgian Mal mix in February that needed supervision throughout the day, so I transitioned from my office to my dining room. We don&#x27;t use that outside of the occasional game night or other gathering, and the table makes a nice makeshift desk with a laptop. I found working from there comparable to working from my office.')
