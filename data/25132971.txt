I have such mixed feelings about seeing Browsh here again. I poured soooo much geeky passion into it, but I&#x27;ve just not had the opportunity to take it to the next step since its initial rise to stardom.<p>There have been a couple of contributors recently and I haven&#x27;t even been able to get the CI to run because I&#x27;ve lost The Knowledge. I even had to take the demo services down `ssh brow.sh` and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.brow.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.brow.sh</a> just because there was a bug and I couldn&#x27;t remember how everything worked.<p>The plan for the next step is to write a dedicated text-based UDP protocol, maybe with some video compression tricks, so there&#x27;s no dependency on Mosh then (whose development also seems to have stalled BTW). That way the client will be extremely lightweight, and work in either a normal browser or a tiny CLI application.<p>As others have faithfully recounted, the entire raison d&#x27;etre of Browsh is to fight against the increasing bloat (and bandwidth costs) of the web. I travel a lot outside the Western world and am often surprised just how many MBs I need to consume the wealth of text on the internet.<p>I hope the next time Browsh arrives on the frontpage is because of a new version.<p>Thanks,\nTom')
