I think the majority of that money, if it existed, should be used for building infrastructure and financing public healthcare and education. I.e. it could replace some of the sources for the government budget, or add to it. Obviously there would be strict controls for suspending the funds if deforestation continued. If the government budget became even slightly dependent on such a fund, it&#x27;d be in the interest of every administration to make sure it kept coming. From the government&#x27;s perspective, beef and soya are important exports so the funding would have to be comparable to that.')
