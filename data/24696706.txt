Maybe making users not have to dig though 10 pages to find the “Covid” checkbox would be better.<p>Would it make sense to have a single schema monolith with simple HTML forms vs microservices, 100 schemas, persistent connections, streaming, and burn-rate-heavy cloud infrastructure?<p>Do you need all of those JS libraries that look simple but are actually more complex than vanilla JS to setup and maintain?<p>Object storage seemed simple, but how will you translate all of that JSON later when the model must change over and over again?<p>Is that code that uses lambdas and annotation-based cloud logging that is so much more readable and maintainable generating frequent delays for customers due to GC and latency than the loop and shared variable equivalent that writes to file?<p>Counter-examples: code that could be simplified without cost, storing customer data whose structure is out of your control, use of well-maintained libraries that save time and add value, and relatively low cost use of the cloud services due to good planning and design.')
