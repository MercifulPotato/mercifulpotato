In fact, I would say this is one of the key things that differentiates software engineering from programming.<p>Sometimes that means centralising code so that change can be limited to one location.  Sometimes that means creating strong seams between areas so that changes stop rippling out at the boundaries.  Sometimes that means allowing duplication strategically so that your inadequately informed preconceived notions about what future change will look like don&#x27;t precommit you to unnecessary change.<p>YAGNI and DRY are great, but the fundamental principle underlying them both is the containment of future change.')
