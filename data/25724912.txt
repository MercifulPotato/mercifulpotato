Made couple of searches and results are very relevant to what I am searching. And it&#x27;s faster than DDG, at least for me. I like it.UI is nice too, clean AF. I don&#x27;t care much for the ocean cleaning part to be honest, yes shame on me. I guess I am cynical since some companies push those altruistic stuff to advertise themselves. Don&#x27;t mean no ill, it&#x27;s great what you&#x27;re doing. Considering using at as my main search engine. Do you proxy exact results from Bing or are the results managed before showing to user?<p>Just searched 4chan, no direct link to 4chan in first page, only &quot;about&quot; it.')
