Vim lets you just combine delete&#x2F;copy&#x2F;replace&#x2F;...\ncommands with inputs that move your cursor, whether it&#x27;s just\nthe current line or a whole 100-line table column. And of course\nyou can tell it to repeat those operations by entering a number\nbeforehand, or just repeat the last operation by pressing &#x27;.&#x27;.<p>Vim doesn&#x27;t make you a 10x developer but it will make you think\n&quot;oh man, was it really that cumbersome?&quot; whenever you go back to\na normal editor. Do you like always moving your hand to the\nmouse and back when you want to select text? Probably not. Vim\nmakes that step completely unnecessary, among other things.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not for everyone and that&#x27;s fine. But\nif it fits your way of doing things it&#x27;s a super efficient and\nflexible tool that is only limited by the user. I&#x27;ve been using\nit for over 5 years and still learn new, clever ways of doing\nthings quicker.')
