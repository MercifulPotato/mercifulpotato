Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[24810319], score=None, time=1602786144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24784605, text='&gt; The movies have forgotten they are fantasy, and come to the conclusion they are Sci-Fi.<p>You seem to have forgotten that it&#x27;s entirely possible for &quot;fantasy&quot; to have more complex themes than &quot;evil space wizards vs. good space wizards,&quot; or that something must be only one or the other. Star Wars is solidly both, and as far as its sci-fi aesthetic goes, it&#x27;s more grounded than Star Trek, which runs entirely on nonsensoleum sometimes.<p>&gt;The worst moment, by far, was in the 2nd of the latest trilogy, when the chinese girl (Rose?) monologues about how the real evil in the world was greedy war profiteers and evil capitalists. ffs.<p>I mean, the actress is American born, of Vietnamese descent, but sure, Chinese is basically the same thing, right?<p>And that was one of the best themes of the Last Jedi. Of <i>course</i> there would be war profiteers - we already <i>know</i> this because the OT gave us Mos Eisley and Jabba the Hutt and bounty hunters. &quot;greedy war profiteers and evil capitalists&quot; aren&#x27;t at all unknown to the franchise. The problem here is this sudden dump of complexity should have been a throughline with Rose for the entire trilogy. It certainly would have been better than &quot;This time the Empire is even <i>more</i> fascist and the Death Star is <i>huge.</i>&quot;<p>&gt;This is a universe in which the more powerful faction outwardly identifies itself as the Dark Side, fueled by the power of Hatred, and known for destroying planets at a time.<p>The &quot;faction&quot; doesn&#x27;t identify itself as the Dark Side. It identifies itself as the Sith. the Dark Side and Light Side are aspects of the Force, like yin and yang (in fact, probably exactly like that since so many elements of SW mysticism are Zen Buddhism with the serial numbers worn off.)<p>Also the Sith and the Dark Side weren&#x27;t known for &quot;destroying planets at a time.&quot; The Death Star was built by the Empire, and yes, while Palpatine turned out to be a Sith (as a retcon) they even made a point of having Darth Vader point out how insignificant the &quot;technological terror&quot; of the Death Star was compared to the Force - not the Dark Side specifically, but the Force in its entirety.<p>&gt;(although the real worst part was, surprise, 100,000 star destroyers, all of which can destroy planets)<p>Yeah, that was stupid.<p>But Rose wasn&#x27;t, she was just badly misused as a character.')
