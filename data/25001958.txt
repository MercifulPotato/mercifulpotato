Sometimes after fixing all the statically detected type problems, my program works on the first try.<p>Python was strongly typed from the beginning, before it was statically typed. When you add a string to a number in Python, you get a type error. Python&#x27;s static type system– which is formally part of the language and has multiple implementations– is an elegant and natural fit to the language. Unlike TypeScript, where the type system is artificial, and <i>restricts</i> what you can do with JavaScript.<p>Language features that made it into ruby– like blocks and unless– were rejected from Python because they would have made it possible to create advanced DSLs, which is something the language maintainers aim to avoid– enabling the creation of arcane application-specific special languages.<p>PEP-484 is the static type system&#x27;s name: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0484&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0484&#x2F;</a> (implementations include mypy and Pyre)')
