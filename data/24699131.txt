If patient identifiers have a fixed, known length, then you can pad with leading zeros to recover them.<p>You only have a problem if 012345 and 12345 are distinct patient identifiers.<p>It is bone-headed in the first place to use numeric-looking identifiers (such as containing digits only) which are really strings, and then allow leading zeros. Identifiers which are really strings should start with a letter (which could be a common prefix). E.g. a patient ID could be a P00123.<p>This is useful for more than just protecting the 00. Anywhere in the system, including on any printed form, if you see P00123, you have a clue that it&#x27;s a patient identifier. An input dialog can reject an input that is supposed to be a patient identifier if it is missing the leading P, or else include a fixed P in the UI to remind the user to look for P-something in whatever window or piece of paper they are copying from.<p>The main point in my comment is that instead of shaking your fist that the behavior of other users in the system, such as those who choose Excel because it&#x27;s the only data munging thing they know how to use, you can look for ways that your own conventions and procedures are contributing to the issue.<p>If people are going to &quot;Excel&quot; your data, and then loop it back to you, maybe your system should be &quot;Excel proofed&quot;.')
