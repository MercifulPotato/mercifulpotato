From Apple&#x27;s perspective, they&#x27;re making the right move to their own CPU design. Apple has always been about controlling the user experience and by bringing it all in-house it takes things that were out of their control (Intel) and allows them to increase their vertical integration, unifying their product lines, and increasing market differentiation.<p>It&#x27;s been clear for a while that ARM processors have hit near desktop performance and it took the megacompany of Apple to push it over the edge.<p>I&#x27;m a dedicated non-Mac user at home, but at work I always chose the MBP option over the craptastic Dell PoS that&#x27;ll start turning into broken plastic pieces within a year or the latest Microsoft offering which seems to suffer from endless software and driver struggles.<p>The software story will take a while to work out, but Apple has made this transition TWO times before, which is astonishing. Nobody else has done this successfully. Part of the reason is there is simply less of a need among Mac users to maintain backwards compatibility and simply far less software to carry forward. Even then, it appears that Apple has done some kind of magic to allow older software to work on the new architecture without too much fuss -- I&#x27;m awaiting some benchmarks!<p>(This will hopefully push more of the industry to look at desktop ARM systems)')
