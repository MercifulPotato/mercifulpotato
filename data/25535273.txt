Most languages have simpler phonology than English. It&#x27;s not about the number of possible syllables, it&#x27;s about the rules to go from text to phonemes. The rules in English are immensely complicated and inconsistent. Meanwhile, I can accurately describe Spanish phonology, such that you&#x27;d be able to pronounce ~any Spanish word (English loanwords excluded) accurately including stress, in about one page. Written Japanese lacks pitch accent information, but otherwise works similarly.<p>(By the way, your stats are off; modern Japanese has about ~106 possible syllables (mora) by rough count).')
