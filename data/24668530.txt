You can count yourself <i>lucky</i> if there&#x27;s at least a barely legible and badly scanned PDF. Usually your only choice is hitting your universities&#x27; library.<p>This is also true for a lot of general literature that is just old enough to still be copyrighted but already too old to still be sold anywhere. There are <i>thousands upon thousands</i> of such books which you will be hard pressed to find anywhere but in a library. An example I recently encountered would be most works by Joseph Jefferson Farjeon. Out of his 80 published works maybe 10-20 are still easily accessible and purchasable somewhere. Soon he would be a forgotten author, and stupidly long copyright terms would have played a role in that.<p>Thank god we have libraries preserving at least some of our history.')
