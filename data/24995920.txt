You are still an adult, but emotionally it feels like travelling back in time. Like being a child in an adult&#x27;s body. Much more than just thinking or talking about the experiences themselves. It brought up a lot of crying. It felt a bit like catching up on it, because I never felt safe to cry as a child. And with this I couldn&#x27;t even hold it back and it all just came out. I like the way Bessel van der Kolk describes it in his book [0]. It is like the trauma stops being something that still haunts you today and that you can still feel like no time has passed, and instead it turns into a memory and something that happened in the past and that doesn&#x27;t affect you anymore. It almost felt like magic, because it lifted a huge burden seemingly effortlessly. And that was after ~5 years of regular psychotherapy. It doesn&#x27;t fix everything, but it made parts of the trauma pretty much disappear.<p>And yes, I would very much recommend therapy in general. Here are some thoughts on this from a discussion a few months ago [1]. There are lots of good points in that Ask HN in general.<p>[0] If you like somewhat technical books I can recommend The Body Keeps The Score [0]. Very much not a self-help book but the observations of someone working with people&#x27;s traumas.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.besselvanderkolk.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;the-body-keeps-the-score" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.besselvanderkolk.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;the-body-keeps-th...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22261226" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22261226</a>')
