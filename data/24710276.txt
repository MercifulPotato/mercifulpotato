I do not want someone to loose their livelihood because I disagree with them on their personal ideology and I certainly don&#x27;t want to loose employment because someone disagrees with me on my personal belief system. The US communist witch-hunt is a great example because McCarthyism led to a good number of people who where not communist but where still undesirable to the current (at the time) social contract, being blacklisted by just throwing a communist label on them, which resulted in their lives and livelihood being destroyed.')
