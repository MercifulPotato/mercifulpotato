Item(by='lambda_obrien', descendants=None, kids=[25337180, 25337512, 25338082], score=None, time=1607372982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336644, text='HN isn&#x27;t exactly the most positive of places sometimes, in the comments, and I&#x27;ve been downvoted for comments that don&#x27;t make sense to be downvoted unless you had something against me as a poster (like my recent 0 voted post about a System76 laptop). I don&#x27;t care about downvotes, I don&#x27;t care about my vote numbers at all (other than being able to report posts and not be &quot;green&quot;), but it&#x27;s weird that the HN community thinks it&#x27;s above such petty &quot;censorship&quot;, or whatever you want to call it, when they constantly downvote topics that aren&#x27;t in keeping with the general conservative and commercial&#x2F;capitalistic slant that goes on here.<p>I wish the political or murky topics could be separated from the clearly technical ones, I would ignore the former as much as possible.<p>I have no idea if this article was good or bad, mind you, but there is a point to &quot;HN is toxic&quot;: HN&#x27;ers preach &quot;free speech&quot; then downvote&#x2F;flag anything they don&#x27;t like, so the community is &quot;talking out of both sides of it&#x27;s mouth&quot;, which is pretty toxic.')
