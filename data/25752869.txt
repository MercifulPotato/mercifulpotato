But these companies aren&#x27;t actually monopolies. Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on social networking, there&#x27;s Twitter and TikTok and Snap too. AWS doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on cloud infra, there&#x27;s GCP and Azure and Oracle and Digital Ocean too.<p>The author knows that these companies aren&#x27;t actually monopolies, so he insinuates that the whole region (Silicon Valley) is a monopoly. And one of these companies (Amazon) it isn&#x27;t even located in the Silicon Valley region; it&#x27;s located in the state of Washington.<p>So really the author has expanded the target of the ire to a whole industry.  That is to say, the tech industry has a monopoly on the tech industry.')
