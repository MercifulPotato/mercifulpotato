I think the issue in your framing is lumping trump with bush when in reality, obama and bush are more alike (whether it is the merciless killing of people expressing sovereignty against an invading army or bailouts of wall street and wall street alone to the tune of trillions of dollars). Contrast that to Trump (who I am not a fan of) with zero wars started (despite ample opportunity in yemen) and a covid bailout that directly went to the people.<p>Again, I did not vote for the man but facts matter, please don&#x27;t get fooled by the same agenda even if executed by two (or three) different administrations with technically opposing parties.')
