It&#x27;s about romantic partnership. And the harsh reality is that some people will be alone.<p>Especially in China, I think it is really fair to say that for economic and demographic reasons, many men will not find love or even companionship in their lifetime - no matter how society changes.<p>I actually believe this is true in many places.<p>And is it really a failing of society?\nOr is it a liberation of a previously suppressed part of society: women, who are now more free to choose their partner?<p>I think one can not judge the preferences of potential partners on moral grounds by looking at history. Both women and men have every right to search for economically and socially compatible companions, or any other metric of preference. And if that means that finding a mate becomes more difficult, we have to deal with that.<p>All this hateful and bitter crap spewed by certain male-only online communities is based on the underlying assumption that everyone deserved to find the ideal partner, when it is obviously not so.<p>But then, we ALSO can not and should not judge or impede anyone in finding happiness and even love in other ways. AI&#x27;s, robots, online personas... all these things are just as valid as the skewed preference for high quality men.')
