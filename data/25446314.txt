I think it still might be possible to run into the problem in overage so I can describe it a bit.<p>Basically I was polling an API endpoint on our SPA client. Maybe one hit every second. We were getting over 10,000 (non-signup) users a day, so it ended up being a lot of requests. Our functions were configured with the default amount of RAM and CPU allocation. When I saw the bill shoot up, I reduced the rate of polling and adjusted the serverless functions to have a lower amount of RAM. This got the price down to $50&#x2F;mo. Later, Vercel would make pricing per developer seat so the price dropped even more.<p>The traffic dropped to more reasonable levels after that. But it was a very good week and the traffic remained nominally 2x-5x. I&#x27;m sure google&#x27;s algorithm played some part in the traffic spike.<p>(also, I am not an employee of Vercel, just a customer :)')
