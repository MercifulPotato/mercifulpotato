Essentially, at this critical point in time for the industry, you&#x27;re just giving up, merging everything sort of related into one giant story, hoping people will go back to discussing Rust again?<p>I came here by first reading the story on Reddit (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;news&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ku6jdx&#x2F;amazon_to_drop_parler_from_its_web_hosting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;news&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ku6jdx&#x2F;amazon_to_drop...</a>), then trying to find what I expected to be a front-page story on HN; failing - then finding this via a search.<p>Edit: While I agree that the debates are kind of going in circles.. there&#x27;s also the informational aspect. I guess this could be alleviated if the title was changed to to indicate that AWS was a part of it. E.g. say AWS instead of Amazon. My first reaction when seeing the new title was that the Amazon Fire store had blocked this app. I&#x27;m sure it has by now, but that&#x27;s not so important to many people.<p>.. anyway, that&#x27;s a moot point by now - the story is on page 2-4 or so.')
