I bought a Model 3 in Feb of this year, I definitely would have held off if I had seen this first. Anecdotally, my car has been perfect, 0 issues cosmetic or otherwise, but it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;ve just been lucky. I really love the car, it&#x27;s a dream vehicle that exceeded my expectations despite the hype, but there&#x27;s no getting around the fact that I am sacrificing an unnecessary amount of safety for a cool car. Certainly I could not justify purchasing another Tesla the next time I need a car.')
