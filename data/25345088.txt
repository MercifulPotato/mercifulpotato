As quick fix I will add context for the current definition of &quot;playable&quot; and also add this to the form to submit reports.<p>As next step I will look into how to best model and communicate something like a &quot;recommended&quot; context and most likely make that the default view (as this I think will be what most people will be interested in knowing).<p>Thank you!')
