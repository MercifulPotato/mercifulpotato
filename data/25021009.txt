They set up troll farms to promote pro-Trump narratives.<p>The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee characterized this as &quot;The Russian government directed extensive activity, beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infrastructure at the state and local level.&quot;<p>That was unusual. &quot;Every country interferes with the elections of every other country&quot; is disingenuous. And thinking maybe that there&#x27;s more that might have happened there that went undiscovered is not even close to the same level as thinking that Wayfair is facilitating child trafficking.')
