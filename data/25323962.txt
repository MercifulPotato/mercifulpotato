It is a treatment for a disease. It would be like calling Tylenol a performance enhancing drug, of course you will perform better without a headache, but Tylenol won&#x27;t do anything if you don&#x27;t have headache.<p>That ADHD drugs are also performance enhancing drugs in healthy individuals is just a coincidence.<p>As for performance enhancing dugs in the workspace, they have already made their way. The big one is of course, caffeine. Nicotine would be in second place.<p>And BTW, nice job managing your hyperactivity without drugs.')
