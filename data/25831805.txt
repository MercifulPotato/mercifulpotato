So you won&#x27;t &#x27;see&#x27; anyone on it and it wasn&#x27;t ever on &#x27;last night&#x27;.<p>&gt; In fact very little conversation about TV programmes in general.<p>Again... it&#x27;s a radio programme. And I&#x27;d bet my life on the fact that whatever political media you consume actually does frequently has conversations about what happened on the Today programme.<p>&gt; honestly have better things to do with my time<p>I think you&#x27;re thinking it&#x27;s an evening chat show? Today is essentially the nation’s daily standup, and it&#x27;s in the morning. You’ll usually get a robust interview with a couple of ministers and often the Prime Minister. It’s a major way we have to interact with the Government daily. The Today programme will often be a primary source for whatever secondary source political media you are using.')
