The fastest strike from a sub on each of the coasts gives plenty of time for Nukes in strategic locations to be detected and a strike to be launched.<p>If it was needed, you can also design a bunker to survive a direct strike and launch after the fact.  Though subs in the Great Lakes would be most cost effective option for the US.')
