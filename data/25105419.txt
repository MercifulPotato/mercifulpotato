If they can afford to buy back a hundred million dollars&#x27; worth of stock every year, they can afford to test upgrades on affected older devices before rolling them out.<p>When an upgrade is supported on an Apple machine, then there should be 100% success -- or at least, as you suggest, a painless way to catch the upgrade failure and roll the device back. They sell the hardware and develop the software, so <i>they</i> have to own the problem. No mumbo-jumbo. No excuses. No passing of the buck to the customer who trusted them at the moment of downloading&#x2F;installing the upgrade.<p>If they can&#x27;t guarantee success for an OS upgrade on a particular machine, then they shouldn&#x27;t offer it for that SKU -- and they should lower the retail price of the MBP because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;just work.&quot; People who own these machines paid a premium for them over every other comparable laptop.<p>I have a late-2013 MBP 13 (one of the potentially affected machines), on which I am currently running Mojave because Apple has been guilty of this kind of garbage so many times in the past. Think of how horrible it would be to put your daily driver laptop in the shop for a few days when you have important work to handle. That&#x27;s the reason why Apple can&#x27;t just mail it in when rolling out OS upgrades.<p>I have had similar situations in the past, and you know what the result has always been? I stop buying hardware from the company when it becomes clear that it doesn&#x27;t give a damn about what happens to the customer. Bose rolled out firmware to the QC35 that nerfed the ANC, and then pretended that nothing happened -- essentially gaslighting the customer. I never bought another pair of Bose ANC headphones after that (I had purchased 5 pairs in the year prior to that, as gifts and for myself). Google rolled out an Android upgrade (Oreo) that immediately sent my Nexus 6P into a Bootloop of Death upon installation, and then passed the buck to Huawei. I swore never again to buy a Google hardware product as a result.<p>I just bought a MBP 13 a few days ago, because despite all of the BS that Apple has done, they have always turned out to support the customer in the end. But if their defense sounds anything like what you are suggesting -- that there is always some collateral damage when an upgrade is rolled out because QA is not a perfect process -- then I would rethink my purchase decisions in the future.')
