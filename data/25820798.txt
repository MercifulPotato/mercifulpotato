Happy to be proved wrong, but I had a quick look around on the internet and couldn&#x27;t find a reasonable source to contradict me.<p>&gt; Youtube is also able to monetize your video, but since people have reported seeing adds on demonetized videos, you just don&#x27;t get the money.<p>This might be right, it might be wrong, but it isn&#x27;t censorship.<p>&gt; Can you point me out to left leaning content that gets demonetized constantly so I could compare with the right leaning one. I&#x27;ve not seen this happen in people I&#x27;ve subscribed and would like to see if this claim has any merit.<p>I don&#x27;t watch much &#x27;left leaning&#x27; content, so I can&#x27;t readily provide an example, but a lot of true crime and history channels are constantly having videos demonetised  for touching on non-advertiser friendly themes. I know this because they constantly complain about it!')
