I use Wacom Touch Tablet for trackpad along with a Steel series mouse in its Hub; But I&#x27;m worried about saturating the bandwidth as it&#x27;s just USB 2.0 although I haven&#x27;t found any conclusive issues.<p>Have you tested the Keyboard hub&#x27;s limits? Controller seems to be QinHeng Electronics USB-Serial.')
