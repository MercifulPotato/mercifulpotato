Item(by='peeters', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604983787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037064, text='&gt; one WLU professor wrote that anyone who wished to use foam noise-cancelling ear plugs must “in plain view of your webcam … place the ear plugs on your desk and use a hard object to hit each ear plug before putting it in your ear—if they are indeed just foam ear plugs they will not be harmed.”<p>Nitpick but noise-cancelling is by definition an active electronic process, and so will never be a purely foam ear plug.  This is Vice misreporting what the professor said (professor&#x27;s words were &quot;ear plugs for noise reduction&quot;).')
