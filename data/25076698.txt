What exactly do you mean? Quantify this, how bad...with respect to AGI?<p>&gt; discourages anyone from preparing for potential nuclear wars<p>Interesting, what would be your suggestions for preparing? Mine would be: AT ALL COST AVOID. (I mean it...ALL COST).<p>Anything else, and I would classify it as a species wide failure to adapt to technology (In this case EXISTENTIALLY dangerous tech). Further, there is no way to grasp or accurately predict confounding factors of post total nuclear war that would put humankind at further risk.')
