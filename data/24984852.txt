They were, but now they aren&#x27;t. Guess who voted to make it that way?<p>b) It would be a dick move and would cost the ISP a lot of business. Email is 1:1 and you (presumably) consented to receive email from your friends. But it isn&#x27;t illegal afaik. Can you cite the relevant law you think makes this action illegal?<p>&gt; is identical to what Twitter and Facebook are doing regularly.<p>Maybe, maybe not. It&#x27;s not illegal. Considering that an ISP operates at the network layer and social networks operate at the application layer, such comparisons are meaningless. ISPs perform plenty of network-layer moderation that you never see and might never find out about.')
