I was just getting used to the idea that we have a decent rally sim&#x2F;game (Dirt Rally) again.<p>It&#x27;s a niche genre that requires a specialized physics engine, and there hasn&#x27;t been decent entrant after Richard Burns Rally (2004) or before that. That was&#x2F;is maintained by community binary patches for years and years after it EOL&#x27;d.<p>Rally car physics can&#x27;t be simulated with just any car physics model, there is a lot going on with tyres on loose surfaces, differential gears in the drive train, turbo chargers etc.<p>I can&#x27;t see it being lucrative enough for EA to make a niche game like that.')
