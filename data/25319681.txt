Some just want to use it as short-term memory, while others use it more as a research index&#x2F;tool.  If you&#x27;re more in the latter camp, the browser isn&#x27;t necessarily the best designed tool to maintain your 80,000 bookmarks accrued over 10 years, even if they did have more open standards.  So, sometimes you just want a system that more targeted to your use case and that &quot;does one thing well&quot;.  The nice thing about links is that there isn&#x27;t any inherent reason why they need to be stored in the browser anyway.<p>But i take your point that it would&#x27;ve been nice to have your basic profile information be more easily shared&#x2F;synced across applications; that would&#x27;ve been pretty cool.')
