Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603828381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907386, text='There is a massive spectrum of juvenile behavior out there in workplaces. I&#x27;ve worked in a place where overt, graphic (often disgusting) harassment happened regularly, and I&#x27;ve also worked in a place where even making what you thought was an innocuous wisecrack would probably get you fired. Obviously the former is totally unacceptable and probably illegal, and the latter is stifling and feels oppressive. The line has to be drawn somewhere, and where it gets drawn is not necessarily the same at every place you can possibly work. There is not one line that fits all companies. Where the line gets drawn can and does depend on the existing workplace culture, the industry, the job function, the country, and the law. There is a legal&#x2F;illegal point on the spectrum that the company definitely doesn&#x27;t want to go near. There&#x27;s a &quot;reputational disaster&quot; point that most companies also don&#x27;t want to go near. On the other side of the line, there&#x27;s the &quot;exceedingly woke&quot; point that you won&#x27;t see outside of multi-national corporations and silicon valley. Most office workplaces draw the line somewhere in the middle, where you basically are expected to treat people thoughtfully and pleasantly, with dignity, respect, assume good intentions, behave like an adult, etc. You know, the &quot;no assholes&quot; rule.')
