However that doesnâ€™t mean it will remain the fastest way to do things in the long term<p>Starting with Ice Lake, you can just use `rep movsb` all the time, and the processor will move memory in the fastest way it can.<p>The CPUID feature &quot;ERMS&quot;, &quot;Enhanced REP MOVSB&quot;, means you should use `rep movsb` for any memory copy that&#x27;s at least 128 bytes. The CPUID feature &quot;FSRM&quot;, &quot;Fast Short REP MOVSB&quot;, implies ERMS and additionally means that you should use `rep movsb` for any memory copy, even if it&#x27;s shorter than 128 bytes.')
