While the continued rate of spread seems to suggest to me that really we have a near binary option:<p>1. get injected with some vaccine soon, expose your body to a controlled amount of slightly noxious chemicals and hope your body learns how to eliminate them before they degrade on their own<p>2. contract COVID-19 soon, expose your body to those same noxious chemicals, plus a bunch of others that help it spread throughout your body and cause damage and linger, possibly for weeks or sometimes until you die<p>(excluding extreme options, like living alone for the next 5 years far from other humans, or dying of a mundane cause sooner)')
