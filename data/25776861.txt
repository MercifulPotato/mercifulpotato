There is no doubt that the production of CP is and should be illegal, as it involves child abuse. However, your original argument was about the possession of CP. There is a standard argument against the claim that this is a victimless crime, and that is that the children abused are harmed by the distribution of pictures that show them. I find that argument to some extent convincing, but not yours.')
