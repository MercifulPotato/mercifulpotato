You just won&#x27;t be allowed on the official Signal network.  That&#x27;s the entire point of FOSS.<p>Open source vs. open network are fairly orthogonal.  AIM and ICQ were never open source, but had several 3rd party clients.  Outlook is closed-source, but still federates with other e-mail servers.<p>I&#x27;ll use an open-hardware analogy.  Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a open-hardware go kart.  The publishers of the original go kart also own a race track.  They only allow their original design on the race track.  You can take their design, modify it and drive anywhere you want.<p>A competing race track is closed hardware, with copyrights and patents on their karts.  If you base a kart off of their design, they will sue you.  If they deign to let you take your home-built kart designed by someone else on their track, they aren&#x27;t open hardware.  If they publish the exact specifications required for karts to run on their track and encourage home-built karts to run on their tracks, they <i>still</i> aren&#x27;t open hardware.')
