This solves the lack of data problem, but it also prevents the police from using their own footage without authorization.<p>Unfortunately, That doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Police officers, supervisors, and internal affairs often need to refer back to recording when making or reviewing police reports. Body cam and dash cam videos often need to be shared internally or externally.
