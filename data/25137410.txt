Probably 10s of soldiers on both sides died recently. Are the nukes flying yet? Of course not, no-one is suicidal and both sides won&#x27;t attempt anything beyond their skirmishes in one or 2 remote valleys.<p>It&#x27;s only sensationalist news channels that peddle the risk of war with North Korea.')
