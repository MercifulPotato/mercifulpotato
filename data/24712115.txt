Not that I&#x27;m complaining. $300&#x2F;500 and monthly options to boot is very consumer friendly. The hype over the proprietary memory card is overblown. I&#x27;m sure either Microsoft will release a compatible adapter that takes any m2 drive and or a Chinese factory will make them and sell them on Amazon.')
