Yes, BNTech and CureVac are German, but they are exceptions, rather than the rule.<p>It isn&#x27;t even proven that lockdowns can actually save lives, although the last study touching this among a whole load of other risk factors (from U of Toronto) can be now considered old (data up to early May).')
