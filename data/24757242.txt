The difference comes from the federal government&#x27;s power.<p>Both constitute a union of regions under a federal government. However, the confederation is distinguished by a union of sovereign regions under a federal government. Independence of the state was so important at the founding of the USA that the first governing document of the country is names the &quot;Articles of Confederation&quot;. However, the Articles of Confederation were too weak and did not allow the federal government to levy taxes, so they were scrapped for the present-day Constitution to grant the federal government a bit more power.<p>The USA isn&#x27;t an ideal confederation, but the confederal elements pop up from time to time (e.g. any person talking about &quot;state&#x27;s rights&quot;)<p>Canada is also close to being a confederation, but the executive power is still vested in the British monarchy.<p>I don&#x27;t believe any European nation can be considered a confederation.<p>So, to your point: the most free nations in the world are those espousing confederal values. Even among Western nations, only a handful qualify, and the USA is one of those.')
