Maybe 2-5 times slower on average. Of course, this doesnâ€™t actually matter, because 95% of apps are performance constrained because of architectural reasons, and functional languages tend to scale better in terms of architectural asymptotics.<p>&gt; Imperative and parallel code also does not have to be a nightmare at all, as evidenced by Rust and even Go.<p>Go is, by all accounts, a massive nightmare. I think this claim calls your judgement into question.')
