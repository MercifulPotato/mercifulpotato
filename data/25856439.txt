As a dev who came from PHP&#x2F;Javascript into Java and Python (heh, not quite the same thing but that&#x27;s how life was), I find MicroPython a lot more intuitive than the Arduino language or raw C.<p>I also learned that Adafruit maintains their own flavor, CircuitPython [2].<p>Definitely worth trying out if you haven&#x27;t, and know any Python!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dUCgYXF01Do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dUCgYXF01Do</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circuitpython.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circuitpython.org</a>')
