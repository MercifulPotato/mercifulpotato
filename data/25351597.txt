That&#x27;s Veblen enough for me.<p>They have also lowered the price of their most affordable product in a category, and in any case, this being tech, each new product isn&#x27;t the same as the predecessor, which complicates the analysis.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;people buy the latest flagship iPhone because it&#x27;s expensive&quot; is as true for Apple as it is for, say, BMW.<p>But it&#x27;s reasonably true, and there&#x27;s a trope to go with it: Apple keeps releasing products where the commentariat say &quot;that&#x27;s so much money for an X! who is going to buy this?&quot; and then sell millions of that product.')
