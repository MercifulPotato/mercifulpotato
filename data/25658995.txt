Laundering would come afterwards, I presume.<p>Ok, so to pull this of, you need to:<p>1. have one or more stolen credit cards (obviously not on your name)<p>2. sell a book under a false name and buy it with the stolen credit card<p>3. have a bank account somewhere either under the false name from 2. or under some other false name or with a bank that will never give out your real name<p>So the money is not &quot;clean&quot; because it now rests inside a bank account with a false name or a bank that does not cooperate with authorities. In any case it is still somewhat shady.')
