Then the QSN-lines format is better than the NUL format.<p>Also, you can transmit a series of say SHA256 checksums in binary format with QSN-lines, or some other binary format.<p>Even entire JPG files, audio clips, wasm files, whatever.  It&#x27;s &quot;8-bit clean&quot; (and so are Oil strings).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;29.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;29.html</a>')
