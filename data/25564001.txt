In the real world, government and physics basically do this for us. In the digital world, private companies and their apps are usually the ones setting the rules and hosting the services, and as you said, you can trust them or not. But blockchains offer another option - to have logic and assets that exist independently. Yes, we have to agree that Bitcoin or whatever is that thing, but network effects should pull apps together, just like today we are on one Internet and not many intranets. I don&#x27;t really like theorizing about it though. This just has to be demonstrated, and people have to want to use these apps. Curious to know what you think of Run!')
