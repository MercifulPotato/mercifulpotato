Higher octane ratings mean a fuel can withstand more compression before detonating. Pre-detonation, or &quot;knocking&quot;, where an engine experiences detonation in the cylinder before top dead center can cause severe damage, so higher octane is used with higher compression engines. Lower compression engines see no benefit.')
