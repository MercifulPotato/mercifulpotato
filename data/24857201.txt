They only look superficially well and that because other movies are completely unrealistic and space battles are there just to fill the screen with action and graphics effects, hopefully as background for the real narrative.<p>Also, if you are looking for <i>any</i> kind of realism in Star Trek battles you are completely missing what the series is about.<p>I like SF and I love Star Trek just as I love reading hard science fiction. Just don&#x27;t mistake the two, because looking for realism in Star Trek would be like trying to do linguistic analysis on magical incantations in fantasy.')
