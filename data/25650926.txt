Most people who visit the public square spend most of their time in this roped-off Facebook section.<p>In the Facebook section, Facebook concierges monitor each person carefully. The concierge will occasionally bring various third-parties up to each person while constantly gauging engagement as a proxy for how likely a person is to return to Facebook section.<p>Facebook uses their engagement metric (plus all of the observations taken to derive the engagement) to value and sell access to (through the concierge) their patrons.<p>You are equating some specific consequences of this concierge service to censorship as if that is the <i>only</i> problem. This censorship is not the <i>only</i> problem it is also not even a relevant problem.')
