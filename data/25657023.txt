So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an excuse for the level of care provided in the US - yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but you also pay more for it, so.....why is the experience worse?<p>I believe the nuance is in who is paying more in taxes and who is receiving the benefits.  This is the distribution of taxes paid by quintile:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itep.org&#x2F;who-pays-taxes-in-america-in-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itep.org&#x2F;who-pays-taxes-in-america-in-2019&#x2F;</a><p>The over-arching theme in the US is the lack of political will in voters to enact policies that benefit everyone.  And I believe that manifests itself in the messed up systems that we get, which are half assed measures to “help” people, but not really help people.  So you end up with a much worse experience in healthcare for half or more of the population, since the goal never was to actually provide them with healthcare, but to give the appearance of it while also minimizing the amount of wealth transfer that happens.<p>&gt; And I mean, Polish supply of doctors and medicine is massively constrained too, that&#x27;s by no means a uniquely American problem to have.<p>I presumed it is less supply constrained due to the lower price point.  I know it’s quicker and easier to become a doctor in the UK than the US, but potential doctors in the US may also have better career alternatives.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sure the deeper legal nouances of legal liabilities are of course not the same, but at least on the surface level it&#x27;s similar - of course you can sue a hospital for malpractice if it occurs, and you will be awarded damages.<p>I don’t know enough about this to make any solid claims, but I was just going off the worldwide reputation of the US being more litigious than anywhere else.  Also, the healthcare providers’ higher incomes in the US also probably result in bigger liabilities since there is more to gain in a lawsuit.')
