Did I say the things the left does are as bad as starting an insurrection? I did not, and in fact I think the far right is much worse. That doesn’t mean there aren’t parts of the left that are also in the wrong about certain things. And no it’s not just a tiny part of the left.<p>But why are you so quick to get so defensive? Why can nobody openly acknowledge their own side’s faults?<p>Going back to the topic at hand about abolishing the police, I don’t understand why I never hear anybody say “yeah you’re right, abolish the police is a bad way to say it. Here are the things we actually want. Wr should tweak the messaging to make it more clear”. Everyone is so insistent on doubling down on the abolish&#x2F;defund language. And if someone doesn’t understand that this is now just a code for a more nuanced agenda, then we’ll extend our outrage to them too!')
