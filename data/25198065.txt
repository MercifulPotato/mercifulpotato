Especially coloured versions of newspaper strips because they were often originally published in black and white, and so there were often no clear guides on colour from the original artists and it&#x27;s easier to then have the colouring follow some rough set of patterns than to spend time agonising over it, and focus of often far more on making it easily and quickly digestible than particularly artistic.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Calvin and Hobbes was such a major revolution in the newspaper strip market - with few exceptions newspaper strips were not considered to really be focused on the art; it was about the gag. You had strips where the artist very obviously cut and pasted and reused panels multiple times, to the point where some strips included meta-jokes about how little effort went into the art of some series.<p>Returning to the colouring, Hagar the Horrible is one example, which while more constrained than Garfield, it took me just a couple of clicks to find examples where the interior wall of a house changes colour between panels back and forth with the dialogue.<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s a Hagar strip where that is particularly noticeable, as the background colour changes very specifically to emphasise an outburst:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;hagarthehorrible.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;-31-new-comics-december-are-added-on-httpwwwhagarthehorriblenet-all-strips-of-20&#x2F;782736271926581&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;hagarthehorrible.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;-31-new-...</a>')
