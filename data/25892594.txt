I went to college and lived in dorms and apartments in the city.  Literally 3 weeks after graduation I moved 3 miles away to a suburban apartment complex.  5 years later I bought a house in the suburbs and absolutely love it.  The grocery store and shopping centers are 1 and 4 miles away.  I can load up my car with tons of stuff.<p>My wife, kids, and I all have our own rooms and home offices.  We have a nice backyard with screened in porch, deck, and patio.  2 car garage and can charge the electric car at home and never have to deal with bringing the groceries in during the rain.<p>I would never go back to living in a downtown area.<p>I have a couple of friends that moved downtown.  One bought a house for 2X the cost of the suburbs.  The other got divorced and moved to an apartment downtown.  After a year of trendy restaurants and lack of space he got tired of it and is looking to move back to the suburbs.')
