(Then promptly had to order a replacement PCB and joystick because I wrecked the joystick cable and connector during assembly. :&#x2F;)<p>I can definitely see the appeal of a slightly higher-res and larger screen.  A 25x80 screen probably makes it feasible to do more config on-device with a USB keyboard, rather than via SSH, but there&#x27;s also a few parts of the default UI that are sort of squinty at the current lower res.<p>It definitely occupies a unique place in the market-- the form factor and price reminds of the ~$30 &quot;800 in 1&quot; NES-on-a-chip devices you see as impulse buy items, but the potential is so much higher, with the GPIOs and big, fairly open hardware.  I could imagine using them as the &quot;head&quot; for projects like SDR recievers or soft-oscilloscopes where you need a good screen and a few buttons, but a full keyboard&#x2F;mouse or touchscreen would be overkill or complicating.')
