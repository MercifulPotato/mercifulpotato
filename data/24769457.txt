Five years later, she was still on this dose, and her blood Vitamin D level had risen to 79 ng&#x2F;ml. This level is within what many labs call the normal range, between 30 and 100 ng&#x2F;ml, but levels above 70 are almost always a result of high dose supplementation, and I have seen toxicity with levels between 70 and 100 ng&#x2F;ml. (A better “normal range” based on what I have seen would probably be between 30 and 60.) &quot;<p>The linked article seems to be using nmol&#x2F;L units as opposed to ng&#x2F;ml so multiplying by 2.5 doesnt seem to be working out for me, someone who knows something have any comparison between these two?')
