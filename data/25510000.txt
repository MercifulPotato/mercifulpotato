In reality there is an imbalance of negotiation power. A company can sell their data because they understand the game and have leverage over other companies. They can say &quot;buy our data, it&#x27;s valuable and there&#x27;s only one of us&quot;. A citizen cannot do that.<p>Besides your data is already in circulation and they don&#x27;t necessarily need it to be tied to you in order for it to be a generally useful human data point. How do you &#x27;tax&#x27; that which has been stripped of your ownership and distributed far and wide?<p>Nevertheless I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get this put into law. Legislation is an unstable and unfair method of change that is biased towards people who can afford to partake in it.')
