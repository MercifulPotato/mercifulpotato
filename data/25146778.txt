This article helped me to do it.<p>Google and Apple app stores are mechanisms which are used prevent, snuffle and destroy competing digital services. They prevent competition by collecting 30% tax. They snuffle competition by setting their own rules and controlling app store visibility. They destroy competition by closing companies from stores. Why it is important, is that smartphones are the most used platform to consume digital services. Digital services can be apps, music or anything distributed digitally.<p>Why it is financially so small business right now, 15Bn for Apple right now, is just that they have not used their full leverage yet.<p>Why you need to make rules for all App stores, for example Facebook virtual reality, is that it is feasible, that these will later become platforms, mainstream customers expect to have services.<p>How it works (if further explanation is needed): \n1. If you are offering digital services to consumers or companies, your customers will expect them to be present in both platforms. \n2. You have to pay tax, so both of these companies take a cut of your business, which prevents competition.\n3. They can add offer the same service, and advertise it over your services, which snuffles competition.\n4. Even been closed out by either of these, likely destroys your business.<p>4 happened to one of my products<p>I&#x27;m building a new product, and I think it is likely, that Apple and&#x2F;or Google will use 3 to compete against me in some timeframe. Even if they don&#x27;t I will be paying 30% tax forever.<p>Edit: Now that I think about his further, nothing prevents extending their reach to nondigital services as well, such as airbnb sales - they just need a new &#x27;innovation&#x27; to the app store rules')
