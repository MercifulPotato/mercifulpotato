My criticism would be the same with 8086 assembler as his language of choice. Yours too. Then where would we stand do you think?<p>I&#x27;m just sick of people wasting a lot of energy on a sub-par language for things that could be of interest to a lot of people.<p>People choose JavaScript to demonstrate monads for god&#x27;s sake. Why? This is an: I have a hammer-strategy and that is what I am calling out.<p>I write in a number of different languages (Java, Scala, F#, Haskell, C, C++, Rust, Idris, OCaml, Lisp, some dabbling in assembly) and they each have a profile when it comes to what they are able to present.<p>The purer ML-dialects&#x2F; languages are a very good fit for compiler work. Java to show off, maybe, enterprisy and legacy patterns. Scala as a more familiar way of getting at pure functional programming for those that don&#x27;t want to start off with Haskell. C++ for those of us that want to read about games. Rust for a lot of different things (that someone wants to re-write.) Idris to talk about some very advanced type systems in a way that is code rather than logic equations.<p>JavaScript? Wtf does that present? How to use four layers of dependency resolution? How to make one page-applications with the highest number of enterprise patterns outside of J2EE anno 2001? It&#x27;s not a serious choice.')
