Having more people who can understand&#x2F;build&#x2F;fix will always win out, and rails is what most coding bootcamp teach. So there’s just going to be too many folks who will choose rails over more suitable languages.<p>I’m not super convinced that’s a bad thing though. The software industry has always suffered a perennial shortage of engineers. What I predict will happen is that an ecosystem of tools will spring up around rails and there will be serious investment in improving performance rather than the framework being abandoned.<p>Remember how kubernetes changed infrastructure development to managing config files? It’s what I see happening to most areas of software development. The more experienced software engineers will then be responsible for optimizing&#x2F;bug fixing&#x2F; scaling.')
