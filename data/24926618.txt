In the beginning browsers didn&#x27;t support JavaScript classes and neither did React. You fake them by using a function known as React.createClass instead. There was also no transpilation required, as JSX was optional. In fact React was always about unidirectional data flow, and reasoning about state -&gt; DOM elements rather than reasoning about changes to the DOM.')
