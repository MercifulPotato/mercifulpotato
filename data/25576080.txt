They&#x27;ve fully bought into the CCP narrative that the Govt is merely making the best decision for a lazy and unproductive people. Stripping people of the ability to choose their identity, stripping them of freedom of thought, stripping them of language and culture, stripping them of choice itself because their primary purpose is industrial output is wrong. I have no illusions that outside forces will change China&#x27;s practices, but I don&#x27;t see how they build a harmonious and prosperous society long term while doing what they&#x27;re doing to large chunks of their population. So much of western innovation is based on immigrants ability to leave repressive govts for freedom of thought and practice. Will China ever be able to move from copying IP and manufacturing for others into inventing for itself?')
