PCL6 on more modern printers. Compared to Linux, the Windows printing experience is easy. 99.9% of the time, you go into your settings, click on devices, click on &quot;add device&quot; and wait for the printer to show up (usually within 30 seconds, sometimes takes 2-3 minutes). Then you click that and you can print. That is the 99.9% case.<p>On Linux you&#x27;re way less lucky if you wanna print, god forbid the document is more complex than a text file.')
