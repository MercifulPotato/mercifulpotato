My research is about new concepts for parallel programming, especially via runtime optimization and JIT compilation.  It was not hard to convince others to use Common Lisp for this - there aren&#x27;t many languages that allow for metaprogramming at run time.  And of these languages, Common Lisp is the only one with decent performance.<p>As for landing a job outside of academia - my advice would be to attend some of the regular Lisp meetings (See <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;planet.lisp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;planet.lisp.org&#x2F;</a>, or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;european-lisp-symposium.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;european-lisp-symposium.org&#x2F;</a>).  There is usually some recruiting going on at these meetings.  And even if not, you might meet fellow hackers that know about job opportunities.')
