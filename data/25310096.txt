Why would they know? It&#x27;s an entirely new language to them. How are you going to learn a new language&#x27;s syntax or library functions without a reference?<p>If you gave a JS programmer a C programming textbook or tutorial they&#x27;d type out and run Hello World in about 2 minutes, like anyone else.')
