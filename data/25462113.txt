Sorry if I missed one.<p>&gt;  You were talking about seller reviews, not product reviews before.<p>I was actually talking about both types of reviews. Amazon will remove illegitimate product reviews if their existence is made known through seller feedback mechanisms, and seller reviews are one such mechanism.<p>&gt; Do you think choosing a reputable seller is a &quot;secondary&quot; concern after choosing a product? If so, why?<p>Usually I&#x27;d pick the product first, then find a reputable seller. If there&#x27;s no reputable seller, I may choose a different product, or choose a disreputable seller if I think their reputation is undeserved, or if I&#x27;m willing to take a risk to get the particular product. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what you mean by &quot;secondary concern&quot;, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it that. They&#x27;re both considerations.')
