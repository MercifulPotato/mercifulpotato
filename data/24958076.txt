Realistically, two always on station from each fleet, sometimes four. Enough to maintain second strike deterrence even with enemy attack subs to contend with.<p>It also important to note that once an SSBN launches, there will likely be return fire from either land or sea based ballistic missiles that will boil the ocean for 50nm, incoming in 30-60 minutes.
