We moved to the SF Bay Area in 2009.<p>The 11 minute drive from our house into town (capital of Washington state) is ironically shorter than a drive to the nearest Safeway in Mountain View at certain times of the day.<p>My wife and I daily appreciate the fortune of having the luxury of working full time remote.  Most people don&#x27;t have that.<p>We very much enjoyed our time in the SF Bay Area.  It&#x27;s a beautiful place full of excellent people.  &quot;things&quot; just got too out of balance over the past decade plus.')
