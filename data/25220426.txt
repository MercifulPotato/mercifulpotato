Voting on single issues requires very engaged citizens that understand how their voting decisions impact the bigger scheme of things. Essentially it leads to the pitfalls of single-issue politics [1]. Political parties on the other hand, allow people to sort of vote for a direction. Ian Shapiro describes this phenomenon [2], but it is a long read.<p>2. The transition to and bootstrapping of such a system is very hard. It may work well in Switzerland, but that&#x27;s because people are used to it and it&#x27;s established. In a place like the US, where voter turnout is already low for a general election, it is hard to imagine why people would show up for specific issues.<p>3. If the issue at hand is very important to a small minority, but 99% of people don&#x27;t really care, voter turnout will probably be low as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pros-and-cons-of-the-swiss-referendum-model&#x2F;a-17643284" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pros-and-cons-of-the-swiss-referendum-...</a><p>[1] \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single-issue_politics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single-issue_politics</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shapiro.macmillan.yale.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;The%20idea%20of%20a%20political%20party%202-25-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shapiro.macmillan.yale.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;files...</a>')
