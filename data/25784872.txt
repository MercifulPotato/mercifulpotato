Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610668540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782745, text='&gt; I completely blame the food<p>I don&#x27;t <i>completely</i> blame the food itself. It&#x27;s more about food habits.<p>One of the things I found very weird was American portion sizes. Go to any restaurant and plates were easily double the amount I was previously used to. I felt bad leaving almost half of a plate every time.<p>And then... I got used to it. But also very fat. With similar levels of sedentarism so it&#x27;s not only about exercise levels. And frankly, while exercise is healthy, you don&#x27;t burn that much energy with cardio. Every time I do the calculations I&#x27;m shocked. From a weight loss perspective, you&#x27;re better off reducing food quantity (and the proportion of highly energy dense food types) than just increasing exercise. Unless you are at marathon-levels, that is. Increasing muscle mass is also time well spent (still pales in comparison to just eating less). Need to do it for the health benefits anyway, but it&#x27;s easy to see why people get frustrated.<p>The kind of food served must have an impact too. Most places, if you are even offered a salad, it&#x27;s awful. It&#x27;s either tasteless or downright nasty and you can only make it palatable by overdosing on dressings. It seems that the nastiest tasting greens are chosen - don&#x27;t even get me started on the &quot;spring mix&quot;. So many people just don&#x27;t eat salad and I can&#x27;t blame them. Kids are right to rebel against their vegetables.<p>The American-style breakfast is delicious. It&#x27;s just that most options are caloric bombs.<p>This is obviously not applicable if you don&#x27;t eat out with any regularity. But that was the norm pre-pandemic, whether it&#x27;s a restaurant or a $5 meal at Taco Bell with the nastiest (but tasty to our lizard brain) calories imaginable. Given that many people in the US don&#x27;t really have the habit (or the employer doesn&#x27;t give them time) of having lunch, burgers and the like are common.<p>Fine, let&#x27;s eat healthy then and stop complaining. Let&#x27;s start with fruits.<p>... and they suck. Apples are tasteless. Bananas are terrible. Mangos are a shadow of what they are supposed to be. Some grapes are ok. Berries are good (but not cheap in most places!). And so on. Fruits seem to be selected for appearance, easy of transport and shelf life, nevermind if they taste like used cardboard. Except berries and even then, IFF they are sourced locally.<p>You can make a decent salad with ingredients found in any supermarket, so there&#x27;s that. Less convenient - you need to make your own with tastier greens(whatever your preference is!) rather than grabbing a box of spring mix that tastes like grass that was mowed a week ago. Add some lemon, vinegar and a very small amount of salt and it&#x27;s all you need.<p>Meat is essentially the same everywhere(barring some food regulations). Can be affordable if one is ok with eating based on what&#x27;s available, as prices fluctuate like crazy.<p>You _can_ eat healthy in the US. But you&#x27;ll be battling: affordability, time, convenience and cultural norms. You need to check the labels on everything too, the corn syrup comment is relevant.')
