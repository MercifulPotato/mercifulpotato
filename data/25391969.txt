They&#x27;ve forgone the luxury market and gone all-in with performance. The 3, Y, and even X rely on the nostalgia of the Roadster and soon the S. Despite the fanfare of the S, Tesla hasn&#x27;t been able to convince the average consumer with multiple cars to own multiple Teslas nor the PR firm that their other models deserve to be on the Top 10s, etc. I&#x27;m never going to bet against Tesla. I&#x27;ve seen my $500 TSLA purchase go up 15,000% to $75k in just a few years. That being said there&#x27;s a lot more work to be done for Elon to get to the top and stay there.')
