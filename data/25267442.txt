The important technical factors for those workloads are startup time and I&#x2F;O capabilities...JS is strong in both of those areas.  For simple Lambda functions JS still seems like a great choice, along with Go.  Rust would be overkill IMO unless you need to share a codebase or aren&#x27;t I&#x2F;O bound or have some other unique requirements.')
