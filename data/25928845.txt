Item(by='iSnow', descendants=None, kids=[25930410], score=None, time=1611758792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928254, text='Oof, I won&#x27;t go into details, but you got a couple of things wrong about Germany.<p>First, the crosses on gov&#x27;t buildings are specific to Bavaria. As the USA, Germany has a strong federal constitution which allows the states some lee-way. Furthermore the German Constitutional Court has ruled crosses in schools must be removed if parents object, a ruling that was partially overruled by the ECHR.<p>Second, Merkel&#x27;s remarks were rather specific to a form of living together without an overarching attempt at having and enforcing core values. She did not reject other cultures or beliefs. I doubt her position would be controversial in a country with the &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; as part of the brand identity, but I can&#x27;t really say as I don&#x27;t know the USA too well.<p>IDK about the assessment that liberals destroyed social conservatism in the USA as it is again not my country. But from over here, it really seems like the GOP went into a tail-spin over the last decade, maybe even since Reagan. In Germany, due to our voting system, the conservative party is as much a coalition as the Democrats in the USA while the left is more splintered.<p>I&#x27;d say if you wanted to have a less extremist conservative party, you&#x27;d need to get rid of the FPTP voting system: it would allow the GOP to jettison the right-wing extremists and seek a ruling coalition while fighting the Democrats for centrist voters&#x2F;moderate conservatives.<p>But if the liberals really forced the GOP into becoming a assembly of lunatics, hats off, they did a great job. I somehow doubt it, though...')
