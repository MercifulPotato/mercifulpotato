It feels contrarian and insubstantial since his exit from The Intercept, though. I haven’t read anything insightful or informative from him.<p>I don’t mean to rain on things. I would like to be more excited about independent journalism (and I was until I read it - I subscribed to his content immediately) but I’m really struggling to find much more value in the content than anywhere else.<p>What do you like about it? That’s a sincere question. Maybe I’m out of line here, not reading closely, being grumpy, something.')
