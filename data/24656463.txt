I&#x27;m able to do this because, 1) luckily, I make a lot of money, and 2) I don&#x27;t have any dependents or health problems.<p>If I moved to St. Louis, I&#x27;d save an extra ~$2k a month in taxes, which is basically the cut in salary.<p>I &#x2F;only&#x2F; spend $40k a year outside of housing (I realize this is a lot). A lot of that &#x2F;was&#x2F; on traveling to see friends and family, and about 10% of that is utilities, car payments, etc -  things that don&#x27;t really change. Let&#x27;s say $20k of my spending is on local services like entertainment and restaurants and general shopping. Let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s 30% cheaper in St. Louis.<p>That&#x27;s $6k in savings. Plus another ~$1-2k per month in rent. Absolute tops, that&#x27;s $30k per year. For context (not to brag), this is not much much more than my annual raise.<p>Sure, if you have a giant house and several dependents, and spend ALL of your post-tax income - living in Saint Louis could offer you twice as much spending power.<p>For a lot of people, it doesn&#x27;t. Most of their money goes toward investments, and I can&#x27;t buy investments any cheaper from Saint Louis than I can anywhere else in the world.<p>Finally, if you own, even with the $12k limit on SALT, the fact that Mortgage Interest is deductible makes the difference in housing not as extreme as it might appear if you make a lot of money. Also, a lot of places with very high housing prices - unsurprisingly - have really low property taxes.')
