The doctor liked the analogy as it was a fun way at looking at a real issue.<p>I&#x27;m pleased I now know where it comes from! This analogy helped us both come to terms with managing her lower energy levels.<p>* I use the term chronic cancer as she has Stage 4 cancer. The term terminal cancer to describe her cancer has been so incredibly unhelpful, its taken me years to frame where we as a family fit into it and how we can live. Essentially, the term has caused more fear than was warranted at the time. So until she needs end of life care, I won&#x27;t call it terminal even though that is the expected outcome. That maybe 6 months from now or 6 years from now.')
