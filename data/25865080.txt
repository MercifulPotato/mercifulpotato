Certainly some were parked near the ocean in England or California. You probably don&#x27;t need full up marine grade alloys for something that only has to deal with salt spray.  It&#x27;s not like you park the thing underwater every day.<p>I would expect the frame and engine&#x2F;transmission to be more of a concern.
