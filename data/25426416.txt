If you withdraw your token from Mint Bot we give you a link to the transaction on the blockchain explorer showing it on the ledger.<p>3) Thanks, I agree visual aids would be helpful.<p>4) Mint Bot lets people send tokens to other users. People use this feature to trade tokens with each other.<p>5) That sounds cool! If you have anymore questions you can reach me on our official Telegram group. Link is on our website!')
