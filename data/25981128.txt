Unfortunately, those bees don’t survive in Maharashtra because they’re easy prey for bee-eater birds. So, we replaced them with Apis Cerana Indica, a smaller subspecies of the Indian honey bee which has lower yield of honey but better for pollination,” says Kaginkar who is also developing the technology to track and interpret elephant movements, and looking at better “land-use management” to reduce human-elephant conflicts while allowing the animal’s continued access to their forest range in the Tillari jungle.<p>What an innovative idea and interesting research!')
