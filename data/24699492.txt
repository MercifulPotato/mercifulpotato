From one of his guest appearances on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, where Sheldon is having some issues when a rival has outclassed him, and Leonard brings in Hawking to have a talk with Sheldon:<p>Stephen Hawking : I understand you&#x27;re struggling with professional jealousy.<p>Sheldon Cooper : Thanks, Leonard, now he&#x27;s not going to think I&#x27;m cool.<p>Stephen Hawking : Don&#x27;t worry. I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel prize.<p>Penny : Oh, wow, that doesn&#x27;t seem fair.<p>Stephen Hawking : It&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve been on The Simpsons.<p>Sheldon Cooper : How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?<p>Stephen Hawking : I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.<p>The first meeting between Hawking and Cooper was pretty funny. Hawking couldn&#x27;t make very much in the way of facial expressions, but you could tell he was having a good time [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wlrOKpQ6UBI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wlrOKpQ6UBI</a>')
