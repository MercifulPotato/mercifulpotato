Which matches up with what Trump supporters say in interviews regarding Trump&#x27;s stance on topics that even many of his supporters don&#x27;t agree with. They will generally say something like &quot;yeah, I don&#x27;t agree with what Trump says about X and Y but I vote for him because of Z&quot;.<p>And to be fair their stance is not totally unreasonable. On both isles of the political spectrum most voters for some candidate ignore at least part of what the candidate says _and_ does. No candidate perfectly matches up with what you think should be done, that&#x27;s normal and expected, democracy isn&#x27;t perfect. A part of this process is trying to guess what the political candidate really thinks&#x2F;believes vs what they say just to gain political capital. All people living in a democracy learn to do this early on. I guess for many Trump supporters they guessed that even with all the seemingly violence inducing rhetoric it wouldn&#x27;t end up with a mob assaulting a federal government institution. Mistakes were made. :)')
