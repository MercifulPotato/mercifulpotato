I&#x27;m talking about basic factual matters.<p>Start with something simple: the in-person attendance and TV viewership of the President&#x27;s inauguration. This is completely irrelevant to policy and has no long-term implications whatsoever. Yet somehow it became a major &quot;partisan&quot; controversy, when it was never controversial in the past for Presidents of any party. Of course crowd size estimation isn&#x27;t a perfect science, but this particular controversy had nothing to do with science. And if you&#x27;re going to tell me the problem there was &quot;both sides&quot;, I&#x27;ll have to disagree.<p>This is just one example of extreme reality denial. What makes it notable is again that the dispute was of no particular importance in the grand scheme, and yet reality was still vehemently denied.<p>I mean, this kind of shit comes right out of George Orwell, where the test of party loyalty is how you can make yourself believe things that are obviously false.<p>What was the attendance at Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration? FDR&#x27;s? Who knows. Who cares! The only person who truly cared was Donald J. Trump himself. But Republicans have been primed to take anything critical of what he says as a partisan attack by the &quot;liberal media&quot;. Every fact, no matter how trivial, is now a political controversy.')
