In some Bunkers the circulation is so bad, that after 2 week sleeping on your mattress mold starts to grow in it (bunkerhusten (bunkercough) is common after 1-3 weeks because of that mold), natural fortresses&#x2F;bunkers drip water quite allot from the ceiling, but sleeping and living &quot;rooms&quot; are normally plastered or with concrete walls.')
