Herman and Noam Chomsky arguing that the mass communication media of the U.S. &quot;are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without overt coercion&quot;, by means of the propaganda model of communication.[1] The title refers to consent of the governed, and derives from the phrase &quot;the manufacture of consent&quot; used by Walter Lippmann in Public Opinion (1922).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Manufacturing_Consent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Manufacturing_Consent</a><p>What we&#x27;re seeing is the system reasserting itself.')
