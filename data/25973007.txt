I use a pair of 24&quot; 4K monitors in roughly the same configuration as yours. 27&quot; would definitely be too tall.<p>I find having a vertical 24&quot; monitor to be super useful, especially for reading typical PDF files as an entire page fits nicely on the screen.<p>My vertical monitor is a bit closer to the desk, and the horizontal monitor is much higher than yours, about 7.5&quot; above the desk. The bottom edges are not aligned; the vertical monitor bottom edge is about 5&quot; below the bottom of the horizontal monitor, and its top edge is about 3&quot; above the top of the horizontal monitor.<p>The top of horizontal monitor is just below my eye height. So the top of the vertical one is a couple of inches above that, but this is not a problem as I don&#x27;t spend much time looking at the very top of that monitor.<p>Each monitor is tilted separately. The horizontal one is tilted back only slightly; the vertical one tilted more. So the center of each monitor is perpendicular to my line of sight.<p>At the moment I&#x27;m using the two monitors with a Linux desktop, but sometimes I connect them both to a ThinkPad for a three-monitor setup with the ThinkPad&#x27;s display and keyboard. When I do this, I raise the horizontal monitor up another inch so the ThinkPad display tucks in underneath it.<p>With your horizontal monitor sitting so close to the desk, I have to wonder if your seating position may be too low? Are your forearms horizontal when typing? (Forgive me if I&#x27;m being nosy or presumptuous, just curious.)<p>One related tip for anyone reading this, regardless of your monitor arrangement: if you wear glasses, <i>do not</i> use progressive lenses at your computer. Instead, get a pair of single vision lenses with a fairly tall aspect ratio so they let you see the entire screen(s) without tilting your head back. Don&#x27;t ask your optometrist for a &quot;reading&quot; prescription - that tends to be about a 16&quot; distance, and your monitors are probably farther from your eyes than that. Measure the distance from your eyes to the monitors and get single vision lenses made for that distance.')
