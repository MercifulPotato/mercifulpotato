Item(by='refulgentis', descendants=None, kids=[25079027], score=None, time=1605241500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078743, text='&quot;asymmetry of injuries&quot; is just anodyne enough of a phrase to seem obvious and fine, but it doesn&#x27;t follow at all from GPs post. GPs post is about how men face _symmetrical_ injury, thus it is unfair to say it&#x27;s an _asymmetric_ issue and only females are affected (if you need convincing on this, note their invocation of how unfair it is to LGBTQ people that the debate is reduced to gender...the opposite of your claim...)')
