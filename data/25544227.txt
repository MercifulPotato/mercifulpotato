I was in a delirious state for many hours, and it left me in a disassociated state for some time afterwards.<p>Just to add, most nootropics are cholinergics in some way or another. Take a look at choline supplements, or racetams (from Wikipedia: &quot;Racetams are understood to work by activating glutamate receptors that are colocalized with cholinergic receptors, thus increasing the frequency of activation of the latter.&quot;). They are supposed to help people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, improve their memory and whatnot. There are many studies around to support this. There is also Huperzine A that has been investigated as a possible treatment for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and there was a meta-analysis that found it efficacious in improving cognitive function (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Huperzine_A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Huperzine_A</a> for more).<p>But yeah, anticholinergics are known to be bad for people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and some cholinergics are known to be effective in improving cognition of those who have it. Of course there are other medications that are supposed to be avoided, here is more about it for the curious (it mentions DPH, too): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mind.uci.edu&#x2F;medications-and-patients-with-alzheimers-disease-what-to-avoid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mind.uci.edu&#x2F;medications-and-patients-with-alzhe...</a>')
