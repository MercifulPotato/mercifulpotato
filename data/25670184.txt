But this is very complicated on Android. I once maintained an Android phone for my Dad and the permissions prompt on that are so overwhelming that it&#x27;s very easy to get people into &#x27;accepting all&#x27; and I feel like this is the idea behind the design by Google. One shouldn&#x27;t be worried about a keyboard spying about you and should be as easy as flip of a switch in settings from not allowing it but it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that on Android.')
