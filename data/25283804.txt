Anti-Chinese racism is ingrained in the Australian culture, even though Australia prides itself on its multiculturalism.<p>That history begins as far back as the 1850s during the gold-rushes, through the White Australia Policy of the beginning-to-mid 20th century, and then during the mid-to-late 20th century anti-Communist wars era (Korea, VietNam, etc), and the last 10 years of anti-China mindset by both of the main political parties in which the excuse is &#x27;National Security&#x27;.<p>Australia has done well from China&#x27;s growth, but continues to bad-mouth China. The Chinese are now saying &quot;Enough!&quot;. Australia is going to discover the hard way that economic growth is not as easy as it once was. For the young who have never experienced economic hardship in the last 25 years because of China, the next few decades are going to be a very painful experience.')
