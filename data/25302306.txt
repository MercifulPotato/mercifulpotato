It was almost like the opposite of the &quot;Everything is awesome and no one is happy&quot; time we&#x27;re living in now?<p>Everything was awful, and everyone was happy. Remember being super excited the first time you saw an animated GIF!? Or you could mouse-over a picture and there would be a popup that said &quot;hey don&#x27;t touch my face&quot;!
