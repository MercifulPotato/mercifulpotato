However, for existing code, the introduction of exceptions has implications on all dependent code. … Because most existing C++ code at Google is not prepared to deal with exceptions [don’t use them]”<p>Google’s non use of exceptions is often used as justification for not using them either, by people who haven’t actually read Google’s style  guide.<p>Also: few of us have Google sized problems.')
