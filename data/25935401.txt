The Java-like approach, with any non-declared variables being the current object&#x27;s attributes, wouldn&#x27;t work because Python doesn&#x27;t use declarations and can have named objects in any scope. The alternative is to use a &quot;magic&quot; variable appearing out of thin air, like Javascript&#x27;s &quot;this&quot; -- but this is basically what &quot;self&quot; does, only explicitly.<p>Any other ideas?')
