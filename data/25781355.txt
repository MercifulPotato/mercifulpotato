As you pointed out, the valuations of both of their companies are held up by widely held beliefs about the men. A lot of Tesla&#x27;s value comes from Elon Musk, super-genius-capitalist, being at the helm.<p>So, if the stock value comes from trusting the humans, it seems possible that Musk or Bezos <i>could</i> sell a large chunk of stock <i>with the right explanation.</i> Like, if Jeff Bezos said he was selling $30bn of stock to contribute to charity <i>right now</i> so he could get critics off his back and concentrate on Amazon...would the price go down? I don&#x27;t see it.')
