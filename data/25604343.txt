The assumption from the grub hub text is that all restaurants on their platform are “partners” and have therefore consented.<p>The two possible omissions are:\n1) “partners” does not actually mean consent. \n2) They have other restaurants on their platform who are not “partners”, but they have the largest “partner” network even without those unconsenting restaurants.<p>Both are deceitful of the common reading of the language which implies both consent and that their platform serves only the group mentioned.<p>It’s leveraging omission and ambiguity to communicate a false hood. 90% of people read it they way grub hub is not using the phrasing.')
