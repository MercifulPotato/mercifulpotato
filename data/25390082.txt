That would be great, and actually, that&#x27;s what the commercial services do.<p>With NWS it goes something like this:  Say the user has a lat&#x2F;long.  You fire off an http request for a document that tells you what &quot;quadrant&quot; you are in and the URL for it.  You then fire off a request for the quadrant document, that lists the products that are available (and their associated URLs).  You then fire another request for the actual product for that quadrant . . .<p>This is not a real example, but this is basically how it works.  Even when you can construct a single URL with the info you need, you still need to make multiple requests to have enough information to build the URL (if that makes sense).<p>&gt; You can make multiple requests over a single connection.<p>You mean with some kind of http keep-alive thing?  I&#x27;m not sure I can do that in these circumstance (with cURL).<p>(edits for grammar, minor issues of clarity)')
