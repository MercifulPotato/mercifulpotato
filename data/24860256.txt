I know older people who themselves have been really sick with COVID-19, and seen friends die from it. Yet many of them would still rather lockdown be lifted so they can enjoy the remaining time they have.<p>The fatality rate of COVID-19 by age roughly tracks overall mortality by age. There&#x27;s lots of older people who would rather at worst double their chances of dying this year, in exchange for being able to see friends and family, not to mention big life events like new grandkids. You don&#x27;t get always get a second chance at experiencing that.<p>If you&#x27;re 75, this year or two of lockdown is a significant % of your remaining life.')
