It&#x27;s certainly more of a job than cutting holes in the wall on the inside and blowing in insulation. By insulating from the exterior you can address vapor issues. There are benefits: you can avoid having to patch holes (2 per stud bay... ie a lot) and repaint the inside. There&#x27;s opportunity to upgrade electrical or fix any issues. Siding also has a limited lifetime. Wood siding can be reused.<p>With some&#x2F;many buildings it is certainly too hard and expensive, but for many this is not. We shouldn&#x27;t write off the whole idea because it doesn&#x27;t apply to all buildings.')
