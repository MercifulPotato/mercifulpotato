Some scenes of season 7 of Game of Thrones were recorded in my city. I can clearly remember the scene after Euron captures Ellaria and Tyene and takes them to King&#x27;s Landing, and a couple of episodes later when Samwell leaves the Citadel. In GoT&#x27;s world both places are supposed to be hundred of km away, in reality they are 200 m away.<p>Also some massive towers in the background that don&#x27;t exist in real life.')
