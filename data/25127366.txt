I am an independent contractor and work across a lot of different projects. Some of my client projects require running a full Rails&#x2F;Worker&#x2F;DB&#x2F;Elasticsearch&#x2F;Redis stack. Then add in my dev tools, browser windows, music, Slack, etc... it adds up. If I want to run a migration for one client in a stack like that and then want to switch gears to a different project to continue making progress elsewhere I can do that without shutting things down. Running a VM for instance ... I can boot a VM with a dedicated 8GB of ram for itself without compromising the rest of my experience.<p>That is why I think 16GB is table stakes. It is the absolute minimum anyone in this field should demand in their systems.<p>Honestly the cost of more RAM is pretty much negligible. If I am buying laptops for a handful of my engineers I am surely going to spend $200x5 or whatever the cost is once to give them all an immediate boost. Cost&#x2F;benefit is strong for this.')
