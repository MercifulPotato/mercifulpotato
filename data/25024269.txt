Fuel leaks are a disaster <i>today</i>.<p>Ammonia is different.  It will dissolve into water, get diluted quickly, and bacteria will degrade it.  A fuel leak on an ammonia fueled ship is just like fish peeing into the water.  Admittedly, a whole lot of fish, so it&#x27;s still a local problem that takes a while to solve itself.<p>Likewise, a fuel spill on land would be a brief local problem.  Today, if a truck spill its guts, we have to scramble to absorb the fuel oil before it contaminates soil or gets into the sewage system.  With ammonia, we&#x27;d just flush it down with an excess of water.  In soil, it is fertilizer, and in a sewage treatment plant, it gets biodegraded.')
