I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of buzz recently about CSS variables but I haven&#x27;t seen such a clean integration. I love the idea of exposing them in the style prop!<p>The &quot;single-source of style&quot; idea also feels powerful. Essentially the component has a list of approved use cases (e.g. InlineLink knows that it will be used as a child of Aside) and centralizes those. This probably has implications for code splitting, so the styled composition API is a nice escape hatch for long tail use cases.')
