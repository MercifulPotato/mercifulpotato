Item(by='xamuel', descendants=None, kids=[24850471, 24852632], score=None, time=1603302800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850116, text='The argument isn&#x27;t so much about the type of agent (which I think is what Neural Turing Machines etc. are about), it&#x27;s about the type of environment. In traditional Reinforcement Learning, environments give real-number-valued rewards (or even rational-number-valued rewards which is even more constrained). Presumably this was a decision that was made with hardly a second thought because real numbers are most familiar to people... but such &quot;appeals to familiarity&quot; are totally irrelevant for such an alien field as AGI :) The point of the paper is that a genuine AGI should be able to comprehend environments that involve rewards with a more sophisticated structure than can be accurately represented using real numbers.')
