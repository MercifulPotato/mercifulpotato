In grad school we were taught that the most efficient way to skim journal papers was to read in this order: (1) abstract; (2) conclusion; (3) if still promising, skim parts in the middle.<p>For my qualifiers I had to pound in excess of 100 somewhat dense papers in 3 weeks on a subject outside of my specialty.
