It also encourages posturing as strongly as possible, rather than accurately, since it&#x27;s all based on perception - it&#x27;s not like you can <i>prove</i> you&#x27;ll do a better job than another team.  To make it worse, if a highly valuable project seems like it might fail, the company will likely throw more resources at it - the risk to the <i>team</i> for getting in over their head is relatively low (and still looks great on a résumé), compared to the risk to the <i>company</i>.')
