He never mentions the biggest reason people join companies (esp. in SV): to get rich. It is true that undergrads will intern for company&#x27;s brand and that makes sense b&#x2F;c just having FAANG on your resume completely changes your job search experience. But most fulltime employees are looking primarily to maximize their pay + RSUs.<p>Also, as others have mentioned, companies&#x2F;leaders need to give people something to &quot;give a shit about&quot;. For some people that may just be working on &quot;High quality training and validation data for AI applications&quot;, but I imagine for most people that&#x27;s probably not quite enough to make them excited about work. But, who knows? :shrug:')
