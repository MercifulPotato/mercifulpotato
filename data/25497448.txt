This included the total cost minus what was covered by insurance so the initial cost of the procedure was in the ~$1200 range. BUT, then they said if we just paid them directly and they didn&#x27;t have to bill through insurance it would only be $650. So our insurance didn&#x27;t even cover the absolutely ridiculous amount of overhead that was added just to deal with our insurance provider.')
