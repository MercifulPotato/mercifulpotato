Item(by='mgkimsal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601727639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671453, text='&gt; The overwhelming majority of content that people see on Facebook is not polarizing or even political—it’s everyday content from people’s friends and family<p>This seems like it&#x27;s totally dependent on the politicalness of your friends and family.  The past few months, <i>many</i> of my friends and family have been overtly political on facebook, and I ended up seeing it.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s easily avoided in a contentious election season.<p>I made an attempt at stopping using facebook about 3 weeks ago, and have been successful so far.  Then I just learned another family member joined and I&#x27;d like to connect.  With my family spread out so far, it&#x27;s one of the few ways most of us can stay connected.  So... I&#x27;ll probably be back in the FB world small doses in the next week.<p>That said, I didn&#x27;t find leaving all that liberating.  Some people talk of some sort of new found freedom after stopping using facebook, but I didn&#x27;t feel that way.  I just have a bit of extra time during the week, which I&#x27;ve mostly filled with phone calls to other people, so there&#x27;s probably not a huge net win from a time perspective.  There may be some benefits re: privacy&#x2F;data collection, but I&#x27;ve been on it for ... 11 years at this point.  I&#x27;m not sure a few weeks off makes much of a difference yet.  :)')
