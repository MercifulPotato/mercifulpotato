Since I tinker with it from time to time, I ended up just going with Ubuntu Server, but it isn&#x27;t hard to see the appeal of CentOS.<p>Not to mention, enterprises love to save money.  Plus, I imagine it&#x27;s pretty attractive for many engineers to avoid the headaches of license management when dealing with containers and VMs.  If you&#x27;re not going to use the enterprise support that comes with REHL, why would you even bother with it?')
