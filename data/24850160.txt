It rests on a clearly wrong assumption, that you can&#x27;t represent number sets with higher cardinality (there are more real numbers, than natural numbers) using the sets of lower cardinality.<p>You can use natural numbers to represent real numbers with arbitrary precision. You can also use natural numbers to represent non-Archimedian number systems.')
