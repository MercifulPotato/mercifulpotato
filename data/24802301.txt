Comma was really far ahead of everyone 5 years ago. But... we have gone from a situation where the Level 2 systems available in most new cars went from an impractical gimmick, to very useful and comparable to this in just a few years.  New Toyota&#x27;s (MY 2020) are pretty comparable to this at no extra cost.  It&#x27;s really hard to see why you would buy this system for $1100 if you can just buy a new car and get this all for free, plus a bunch of additional safety features that OpenPilot obviously can&#x27;t include: backup sensors, blind spot monitors, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think manufacturers will outsource the development of their ADAS systems to Comma (or anyone else for that matter) because they view it as a potential short-term differentiator.  The existing differentiators are collapsing quickly: reliability is no longer a major concern for EVs, infotainment is lost cause (Carplay and Android Auto won decisively).  Aside from ADAS, we&#x27;re looking at a scenario where in 10 years the only reason to buy from company X vs company Y might be price.')
