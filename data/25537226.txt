I love a range of programming languages, but I never had a reason to learn Ruby. It looks so powerful and seems to have a lot of quality of life features (backticks for a subprocess seems awesome for scripting). When I&#x27;ve considered to sit down and learn it, the big question always pops in my head: &quot;is Ruby dead?&quot;. I think that&#x27;s because of the lack of its prevalence in my life, because it seems like HN loves it and this most recent version seems fantastic, especially with some more advanced static analysis.<p>I wish I didn&#x27;t have that idea of Ruby being dead for as long as I had, because it really seems beautiful. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to make Ruby my next language project.')
