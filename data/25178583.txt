Once you get there, it seems this new level of kindness in society tends to self-sustain, and that&#x27;s when you know a country has become part of the &quot;first world&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s rare, though... I believe the latest example is South Korea, which has become a very advanced nation in just a few decades... wish there were other examples, but I&#x27;m not aware of any others besides perhaps China - but China does not exactly have a population and government I would decribe as &quot;kind&quot; :&#x2F; but I think they will get there eventually.')
