It’s reading this story and immediately telling someone about it. Imaginarily. And that being ordinary and about as far as it’s likely to go. Then experiencing  awareness of what just happened...of what is happening, walking across the room and stroking the dog’s fur while  saying the first words of the day.<p>The grabbable grips are in writing. Externalizing the monologue. Turning it into an artifact. Here a public artifact as the channel through which it runs. Through which profound loneliness converts to creative expression.<p>How imaginary conversation gets out into the world.')
