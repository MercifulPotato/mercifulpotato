You simply have to look at the uptick in the number of news reports from other countries dealing with the above subjects over a period of time. Now all of these are important but they are nowhere near as important as the discussion&#x2F;outrage needed over poverty alleviation, social ills, economic development etc. in my country. A good example is the recent &quot;Me too&quot; movement. Our entire media jumped on this bandwagon while all other essential news disappeared from the channels. This is a great way to divert people&#x27;s attention and hide actual problems.')
