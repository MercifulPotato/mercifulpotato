I ended up spending more time figuring out what package&#x2F;build&#x2F;testing tools to use than I did actually writing code.<p>Looking up best practices for Express.js project structures, I found that every blog post&#x2F;article had a different &quot;best&quot; structure.<p>I&#x27;m happy that my new job is still primarily Rails. I&#x27;ll take convention over configuration any day.')
