Above is the tide gauge for Key West (very close to Miami), and it shows a 0.3m or about a 1 foot rise since 1910. That is consistent with millenia long trends, as sea levels have been rising since the beginning of the Holocene ~12K years ago.<p>The parts of Miami Beach (the island near Miami), are caused by the fact that parts of the island are sinking.<p>Houston was built at the meeting point of two bayous in the early 1800s and flooded shortly after it&#x27;s founding. It has experience frequent floods since then. Here&#x27;s photos of them: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dtn.com&#x2F;houstons-history-of-floods&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dtn.com&#x2F;houstons-history-of-floods&#x2F;</a><p>We don&#x27;t have records on Houston going back 500 years so I don&#x27;t know where you got the 500 year figure from. Needless to say, the above is proof that floods are very common in former bayous.')
