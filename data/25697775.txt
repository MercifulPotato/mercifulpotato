In this election, at least in the polling locations where election fraud is alleged, observers (at least Republican ones) were prohibited from coming within 6 feet of workers, unless they already had an objection, which makes it impossible to see many of the things you might object to.<p>It by no means requires conspiracy by hundreds. It requires action by hundreds, but they don&#x27;t have to be acting together by any means. And keep in mind that these people are lifelong committed Democrats, who hate Trump viciously - no one could possibly deny how Democrats feel about Trump.<p>No one trusted the polls this time since they were so wrong in 2016. Trump certainly didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s who you suggested knew he was going to lose.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely possible Trump tried to steal wisconsin and failed, possibly due to Democrats stealing it better. In either case, there is no basis upon which to claim Trump knew he was going to lose.<p>The facts I present are clear and undisputed by anyone vaguely familiar with the political situation in this country. Democrats viciously hate Trump. Democrats run the election facilities in the major cities in the 6 contested states. Observers were obstructed from carrying out their duties in a meaningful capacity in those locations.<p>They wanted to get Trump out by any means. They had the means to steal it. There is no publicly known smoking gun, but all publicly available facts point clearly and loudly to them having done it.')
