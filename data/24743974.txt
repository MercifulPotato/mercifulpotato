Every other day there&#x27;s some blog post on HN about some analogy on some self improvement topic like learning, project management or complexity or whatever...<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what learning isn&#x27;t. Learning isn&#x27;t coming up with new analogies for concepts you already completely understand over and over again.<p>I and pretty much everyone on this planet already knows what learning is, and unless you have a new learning technique, what is the point of comparing learning to a fractal? There&#x27;s nothing new here.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to reprimand what this person wrote this but when you see some flavor of this on HN all the time it gets old.')
