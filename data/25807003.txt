Just do it!<p>I&#x27;m so tired of these &quot;rewrite in rust&quot; articles that have no code behind them. Spend the time and write a replacement for curl, ship it, and people will start using it instead of curl. In some years time, you can write a paper showing how many vulns your replacement had vs. rust. curl continues to be written in C because it has someone actually doing the work to write and update it. A theoretical rust replacement does not exist because no one is doing the hard work of writing and maintaining it.<p>It&#x27;s like LibreSSL vs OpenSSL. Did LibreSSL end up being more secure? At least we can find out instead of just guessing about whether removing crappy code from OpenSSL would be a good idea.')
