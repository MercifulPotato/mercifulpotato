Item(by='dvtrn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607111319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306773, text='<i>Isn&#x27;t it reasonable to fire someone for dragging other employees into a personal dispute with the person&#x27;s manager?</i><p>I absolutely do not believe it is, barring mitigating circumstances or policies that neither you nor I are privileged to access.<p>In most cases, this is called &quot;venting&quot;. I have NO doubts my subordinates probably talk about me in DM or have gripes about some of my issues as their leader. But I know and have seen my direct reports be <i>very</i> opinionated with me in 1:1, they are very outspoken with me. One person had a moment of raw emotion, not because of something I had done but the organization at large.<p><i>And I encourage all of it</i> because it means I can trust them to be honest with me when I need that candor, and in return, because I meet people where they are, give them room for expression and authenticity, they know they can trust me not to bring retribution upon them for being opinionated, even amongst themselves. I might not always be able to move the needle in the direction they wish, but they know I will always make sure their opinions have a voice at the leadership table-even if it means I am the one who has to take the hit for it while we continue trying to meet our mission as Ops Engineers. That&#x27;s Leadership. Capital L.<p>Among larger groups? So what? No really, so what? Can I tell you that I am a founding and sitting member of an org wide DEI initiative and we actively encourage affinitized groups of employees to form resource groups, kvetch among themselves and present areas of contention to us to enact positive change at large? That we have two diverse members of the executive team on this initiative? That it has the full support of our board of directors and even our group of investors?<p>Would you believe me if I told you we had five people accept offers at the company who specifically said <i>the</i> reason, not <i>one</i> reason, <i>the</i> reason they accepted the offer was learning that this was something our organization has in place?<p>Now:<p>This is not most cases-granted, but I am regressing my interpretation to the mean intentionally because reacting to outliers in any direction as a default response gives room for extraneous and unnecessary harm. I default to maximizing good and giving people a voice, not looking for a reason to exclude them from making the business better for customers and employees with equal vigor.')
