Why should the government dabble in deciding how social media builds its product? You&#x27;ll just crate a mat that entrenches FB and the like.<p>I think people VASTLY overestimate the influence of things like the FB feed on the real world. The best evidence they ever seem to have for any claimed effect is the number of people FB say saw&#x2F;interacted with a post. They have a long history of inflating those numbers, yet the critics are all too happy to use them. The activity on social media that seems to actually result in real world outcomes seems to generally be the boring work of community building.<p>Also, how do you deal with spam or noisy posters in a &quot;1:1 and neutrally ranked (e.g. by timestamp)&quot; feed?')
