Item(by='dbsmith83', descendants=None, kids=[25718837], score=None, time=1610302805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717289, text='To me, simply saying &quot;False.&quot; with a link is not any colder than saying &quot;That is false.&quot; or &quot;that is untrue, see this ___&quot;, etc..<p>I admit, I agree that &quot;Lie.&quot; was a little on the cold side.  I find that when people blurt out something so obviously and verifiably false that they are either being lazy or facetious which also does not &quot;lead to a constructive conversation&quot;.  Perhaps if I had the ability to downvote it I would have done that and moved on.  Not an excuse, just an explanation.')
