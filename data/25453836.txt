For many of us, it was the first real connection to the world and the people in it.<p>Late night AM with a long wire antenna, maybe directional loop, and or tuned coils, filters, is a great experience, particularly on older radios.<p>Starting sometime around the 80&#x27;s, AM radios got kind of lousy.  It varies a little by manufacturer too.  Ford, oddly enough, produced great ones into the 00&#x27;s.<p>Anyway, at night, you get the various stations, and depending on propagation, they could be very far away stations, and also the sounds of the world all mixed together.<p>I can remember late nights listening to all sorts of programs, people telling stories, music, talk programs on a wide variety of topics, and often frank in style and form.<p>And that electric fence, tick, tick, tick.<p>A car starting.<p>Storm brewing.<p>Electric appliances.<p>All sorts of things just added in.<p>As a purist interested in the program, these are all kind of crappy.  Hard to ignore.<p>People like FM because it rejects most all of that stuff.<p>But, as a curious person?  It is like another sense.  Electro phenomena mapped into sound.  Very fun, and an interesting way to perceive what&#x27;s around you.<p>IMHO, this is a big part of why making computer sound on an AM radio is cool.<p>Everything I just wrote applies to the short wave bands too, though those are messy today.  Best done away from a metro area.<p>If you want to experience this at all, score an early radio, even a vacuum tube one ( my favorite ), get a long wire and venture out somewhere and just listen.<p>Camping is a great time for it, and I still do every year.  For an hour or two, it takes me way back to early times.<p>A portable, transistor one made a while ago is best and still cheap.<p>Older GE Super Radios are real good.  The ones made prior to 2010 or so are best, and not expensive.')
