But author doesn&#x27;t state that there is ideal science (STEM) and science muddled with politics (social sciences).<p>Author says that there are good social institutions (like American judicial systems) and bad ones (like Russian judicial system), and that STEM is the case of the former one (although it has quite a lot of problems as well), while social sciences are rather a case of bad corrupted institution.<p>I think that author&#x27;s idea of feedback loop is really interesting and reminds me of how things are going in other social institutions as well.<p>When we have feedback loops which incentives corruption, we get corrupted badly functioning institutions and vice versa. I think ``Why nations fail&#x27;&#x27; approach this from the same angle.')
