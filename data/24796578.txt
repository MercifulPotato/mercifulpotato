It is unclear how they determine these time cutoffs.<p>Then they discuss a 14-member focus group, and based on that Q&amp;A alone, speculate that symptoms of &quot;ongoing Covid&quot; are &quot;fluctuating in severity and moving around the body&quot;.<p>In other words, non-specific, irregular symptoms, self-reported by a group of people who self-identified as having an illness, and further self-selected as willing to participate in medical research.<p>Covid-19 may very well affect people in long-term ways -- in fact, <i>we see this in many other common viruses</i> -- but without well-controlled data on which symptoms, how often they occur, how severe they are, and how sick the participants were <i>before</i> getting Covid, this is just further speculation.')
