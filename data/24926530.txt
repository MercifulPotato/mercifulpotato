It&#x27;s exclusively derived from the fact that there is no package manager. Python has a few package managers. Node.js also has package managers, and Rust has too. In C or C++ the only package manager there is is a linux distro&#x27;s own generic package manager, which isn&#x27;t exactly designed to handle independent projects.<p>There is no coincidence in the fact that node.js&#x27;s npm and conan are services offered by private for-profit companies which have a free tier and paid tier targeting enterprise customers. It&#x27;s no coincidence because packaging and distribution is a generic software engineering need that is not tied to a specific programming language, and is value-added that, done right, is worth paying for.')
