If the article is true to Highsmith&#x27;s character, I&#x27;d doubt she&#x27;d want that, or that she&#x27;d really care.<p>Writing (and reviews of that writing) aren&#x27;t generally meant to absolve the writer of whatever sins they&#x27;ve committed. Writers are entertainers trying to make a living, and they are successful to the extent they are entertaining (and lucky.) If you find a writer entertaining, then the writer&#x27;s done their job, nothing more. If you don&#x27;t want to read an author because you despise them, that&#x27;s on you. No absolution required.')
