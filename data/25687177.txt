In some states, the sperm donor may legally request custody or visitation rights.<p>Family law is different in each state, making this a thorny issue.  For example, Arizona&#x27;s law states that a surrogate mother is the presumed mother of any baby she births.  And if she&#x27;s married to a man, her husband is the father.  Making a contract that says otherwise in Arizona is not legally recognized.  So...  very few people choose surrogates in Arizona.')
