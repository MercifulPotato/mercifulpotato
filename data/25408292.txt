I can&#x27;t see my typing and TUI&#x27;s output is totally busted. CTRL-L doesn&#x27;t fix this, I have to exit the debugger and run &quot;reset&quot; in my terminal.  Does anyone know why this happens or how to fix it without exiting the debugger?<p>I&#x27;ve even tried suspending with CTRL-Z, running &quot;reset&quot;, then resuming gdb. This fixes the shell, but TUI is still busted, even with CTRL-L.')
