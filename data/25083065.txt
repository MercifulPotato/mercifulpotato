I really want Linux to succeed on the desktop, and I think one very important step is to be able to get all the software (or clones) that people use running on Linux.<p>So far, LibreOffice covers the majority of cases for MS Office and the average person can get by. Firefox and Chrome are covered, video players are covered, and honestly, I don&#x27;t know what the average non-technical user uses besides those. Getting Adobe products to really work well would also be a huge win.<p>I think the Linux desktop is mostly ready, there just needs to be a need for it at this point.
