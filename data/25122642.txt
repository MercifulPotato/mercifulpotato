This is easy!” and they’ll end up with something worse than Swing because they don’t realize the work that went into Swing even though I’ll be the first to admit it’s not the best. So I guess what I hope this becomes is that a group of people who actually understand desktop UI come together and take this to make a good toolkit, and I’m trying to caution people who want to just dive in without fully understanding what this would offer them. An analogy might be a blog post announcing LLVM IR, and I advising caution against just going and writing your homebrew language against it and then shipping your software on that. This is just a part of a good UI toolkit, and I think the blog post is looking too far into the future.')
