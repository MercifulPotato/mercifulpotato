The one I work for is huge (50k+ emps) and is very much like a family. One of our engineers got a really rare, debilitating disease and they kept him on even though he couldn&#x27;t work for 2 years and they helped raise thousands of dollars for his medical bills. My manager even helped me find external jobs when things weren&#x27;t improving here. Probably rare but it happens. My coworkers here are easily my best friends.')
