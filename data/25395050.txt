Work they can do to get those approved in the next few weeks are what can end the pandemic in Q1.<p>In the US, given by Feb, there will have been about 100M infected, It really only takes about 100M vaccines to hit herd immunity. Between Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J and Astrazeneca it&#x27;s reasonable to expect&#x2F;demand 100M out by Feb.<p>The FDA&#x27;s approach of &quot;moving slow to give confidence&quot; cost lives and does not actually build confidence. Allowing this vaccine to be taken by the willing was among the easiest decisions ever made, and their pretending otherwise was absurd. It would have built more confidence if they said within 24 hours of the EUA filing &quot;hey public, this was an easy call. We already looked at all this data over months, cut no corners. This isn&#x27;t a borderline approval, this looks amazing.&quot;')
