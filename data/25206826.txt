You ask about &quot;all the other non-Covid content that the channel is prevented from uploading during the suspension&quot;. I think that is the whole point. An excuse has been found to suppress that content. OAN is despised by the people who work for YouTube. Had this content come from CNN or MSNBC, the YouTube fact checkers would have accepted it as the new facts, or at least found some other way to be lenient.')
