We had a cheaper one that was great for a student to print their reports, but it had a lot of plastic parts and thus if you did too much printing you could have problems with rollers and gears shifting.  The manufacturer included the duty cycles on how many pages it should print in a single job.<p>The more expensive printers had Bakelite and Metal frames and parts.  The duty cycles was so high you could basically run the printers for 24 hours without damaging anything. But the printers were a lot more expensive.<p>Take a guess which models cheap business men (and it always seemed to be men) insisted in buying even when we explained in detail why the cheaper printers should not be used in a business environment?')
