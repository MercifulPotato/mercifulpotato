Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I prefer strict comparison, and prefer strongly typed languages because of it, I just feel that this is a strange design choice.<p>In addition, the @ operator seems to have functionality changed, and there is plenty of other backwards incompatible changes to go along with it, and yet, one of the main reasons to not choice the @ symbol for annotation&#x2F;attributes was because of backwards incompatibilities. Personally, I find the introduced syntax for attributes terrible, especially when @ is well recognised in the php community thanks to phpdoc annotations.')
