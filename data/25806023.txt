It is simply regulation around an industry.<p>We regulate all sorts of industries.  Food gets regulated in the name of public health, cars get regulated in the name of public health, broadcast TV gets regulated in the name of public health.  All sorts of stuff.  In fact I&#x27;d say that government regulation has become the <i>rule</i>, not the exception.<p>The argument here is: suppression of dissenting opinions is bad for public health.  That&#x27;s all.  No &quot;freeze peach&quot; arguments, no first amendment (or citizen united haha) arguments.  None of this craziness.  It&#x27;s just government finally coming in to regulate how these GIANT corporations operate their business, JUST like every other business gets regulated.')
