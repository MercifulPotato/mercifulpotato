Item(by='amatecha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608456150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479825, text='I&#x27;m surprised by people saying they haven&#x27;t had issues.  Have they just not noticed the issues?  Like characters in completely static, motionless poses?  Every little while there will be an NPC stuck motionless somewhere, or sliding along the ground as if they are a, well, non-animated 3d model.  UI elements appear when they shouldn&#x27;t, and a prompt to &quot;[C] Skip to next&quot; is almost always showing at the bottom right of my screen, during pretty much all gameplay.  Further, I&#x27;ve had repeated crashes of the game which actually crashed the GPU driver (NVIDIA) and required me unplugging and re-plugging my HDMI cable so the GPU would reset and work again (most people seem to just reboot their computer altogether in this case due to not knowing the unplug&#x2F;replug workaround).<p>Outside of straight-up bugs, the performance is utterly atrocious even on &quot;Low&quot; settings, and my PC exceeds the recommended specs by quite a decent margin.<p>At the same time, CDPR&#x27;s prior games have received a ton of post-launch support so I can only hope Cyberpunk 2077 will receive a good amount of improvements in the new year.  Fingers crossed!')
