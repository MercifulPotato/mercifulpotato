You can always pull a fully qualified name on any version of Docker. Red Hat just wanted their install to pull from a different registry if you did &quot;docker run ubuntu&quot; which is kind of confusing for users. You can always just do docker run mydomain.com&#x2F;ubuntu or whatever on any version.')
