Gyms are closed here in the UK so a lot of us are out running instead.<p>Running Level has running standards for your age&#x2F;gender over many distances like 10k&#x2F;marathon&#x2F;mile. The calculator on the homepage helps you rate your running performance against other people your age&#x2F;gender, predicts race performance and recommends some training times.<p>I was hoping to do a Show HN or Product Hunt but marketing has never been my strong suit. Hope someone likes it!')
