If all the platforms disappeared tomorrow, our lives would not be disrupted (personally I think we’d be even healthier, but that’s a personal view). This doesn’t change the fact that these networks can reach and move the masses.\nI also don’t believe that these problems would be solved by creating alternative national platforms controlled by governments: why should users migrate from fb&#x2F;twitter&#x2F;...? Governments wouldn’t spend huge sums on engineering engagement and addiction (as they shouldn’t).')
