Depending on the local job market, his family situation, etc, it might have been a reasonable option for him.<p>I stuck with a job where I was undervalued for about a year. I was more focussed on other parts of my life, and an easy job where I could coast when it was beneficial to me was useful.<p>(Straightforward example: Gust might have a partner in a less-flexible field. They agreed that the partner would spend 1-2 years looking for a good opportunity in a different state; once that was found Gust would quit and they&#x27;d move together.)')
