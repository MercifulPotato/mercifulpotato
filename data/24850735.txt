Moreover, he linked these reef types through an evolutionary model in which an atoll is the logical end point of a subsiding volcanic edifice, as he was unaware of Quaternary glaciations.<p>&gt; Here, a comprehensive new model is proposed... During the multiple glacial sea-level lowstands that intensified throughout the Quaternary, the tops of these banks were karstified; then, during each of the five mid-to-late Brunhes deglaciations, coral reoccupied their raised margins and grew vertically, keeping up with sea-level rise and creating the modern atolls.<p>All coral atolls, therefore, were formed in the last 500,000 years with 100 ky glacial cycles and their associated 120m sea level change. Very cool.<p><i>Blue Holes</i> like the one in Belize [2] are collapsed sinkholes created by the same mechanism.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.annualreviews.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1146&#x2F;annurev-marine-122414-034137" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.annualreviews.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1146&#x2F;annurev-marine-122...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Blue_Hole" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Blue_Hole</a>')
