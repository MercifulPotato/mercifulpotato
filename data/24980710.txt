I&#x27;m sick and tired of the way our education system is failing our kids at all levels and I want to completely rehaul it. I think everything about it is backwards and it needs to be thrown out and started from scratch.<p>Since March, I&#x27;ve been building a movement around what I&#x27;m calling Modular Learning- an approach that&#x27;s really personalized, really flexible, really involves families in the learning process and very much nurtures children&#x27;s natural curiosity and love of learning - in a nutshell, a more holistic and child-centered approach that allows for total flexibility and personalization.<p>I&#x27;ve been hosting workshops for thousands of parents and kids impacted by school closures on issues ranging from communication with children to curriculum planning, food, financial security and talking to kids about racism.<p>I&#x27;m now working closely with a group of 20 families (mostly in tech) with kids ages 3-12 in personalizing their children&#x27;s education through a combination of 1-1 instruction, social-emotional learning, electives and parenting workshops, closely measuring how kids perform in a parent-driven approach. We&#x27;ve also written hundreds of blogs on  the best curriculum and apps for parents to support their children&#x27;s learning. based on their learning styles.<p>I need to find a co-founder who can share this big vision with me and has really bold and smart ideas on using technology to scale something like this, and of course is at a stage where they&#x27;d be excited about taking on a project of this magnitude.<p>Anyone interested?<p>If so, email me at manisha@modulo.app')
