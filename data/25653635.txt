For example a few years ago we were eating asado here in a restaurant in Argentina. Some Mexican tourist asked what we were eating. We were eating chinchulín [1]. We were not sure if we should explain the details and how to explain them, but in the middle of the explanation, they just say &quot;OK. It&#x27;s tripas!&quot; and they eat them gladly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chunchullo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chunchullo</a><p>PS: If you are going to eat chinchulín, always ask for a well cooked one, almost burned. It is horrible, when undercooked.')
