IMO the &quot;way you think&quot; about distributed systems - if you want to be effective - will basically end up looking exactly like you think when writing a TLA+ spec, and learning TLA+ is a fast-track method of thinking like a distributed systems engineer. This is much, much more important in day-to-day work on distributed systems than knowing how a bunch of distributed systems algorithms work.')
