I think one could argue that deliberate exposure and waiting around for enough people to be &quot;naturally&quot; exposed are pretty equivalent in terms of end results, but that&#x27;s not a winning argument so far. Might be harder to recruit when you know you&#x27;re definitely getting exposed vs. no change in risk from the no-action option.<p>But that does presume your methods of exposure are equivalent to what&#x27;s happening in the real world, both in terms of method and dose. And those are both open questions here and could have bearing on efficacy.')
