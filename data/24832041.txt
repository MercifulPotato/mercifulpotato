If you subscribe to my newsletter, and Google decides they don&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m saying, should they make sure you don&#x27;t see it? If I publish an anti-government newsletter through the mail, should the post office decide not to send it? What about my ISP? Should they have a say in what I read?')
