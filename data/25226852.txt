Given that, is it realistic to think about using any kernel in with a kernel version between 5.5 and 5.7 in production where any bug would incur an availability impact, or should this still rather be a considered an ongoing implementation effort and revisited at some 5.xy version?<p>An extensive set of unit-tests would make it a bit easier to gain trust into that everything works reliably and stays working, but unfortunately those are still not a thing in most low-level projects.')
