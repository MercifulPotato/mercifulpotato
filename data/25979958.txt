What I like about the OP&#x27;s model is it also explains the asymmetry of social media where people do very little at all and talk about is <i>a lot</i> because the kind of non-linear success we are aiming for is a function of exposure.<p>When you have wealth of any kind, you naturally orient to getting exposure to opportunity for diversified parts of it, but when you have a scarcity view, your decisions are necessarily all&#x2F;nothing, and it even becomes a class culture thing. It&#x27;s circumstances, but also learned attitude.<p>Related, I&#x27;m sympathetic to what&#x27;s happening with GME and WSB, if a young persons net worth is four digits, it seems insane <i>not</i> to gamble it on options, as the housing bubble has cut off the last way for working people to get leverage.  GME may mark the inflection point in the markets where young people realize it&#x27;s their best or even only opportunity for leverage, and meme stocks are going to be the new normal because the economy doesn&#x27;t provide anything better to invest in for under $50k.
