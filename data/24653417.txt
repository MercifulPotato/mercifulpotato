Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[24653819], score=None, time=1601571907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652099, text='Alright, I guess I was wrong above; it certain <i>is</i> a &quot;USB-C connector port.&quot; In fact, I would even say that it <i>is</i> a &quot;USB port&quot; (although they can&#x27;t say that for licensing reasons.) Nintendo seem to <i>expect and encourage</i> you to plug USB-C <i>peripherals</i> into said port (e.g. any random USB game controller.) Nintendo will support such configurations just fine. You&#x27;re not voiding your warranty by doing that.<p>What the port isn&#x27;t, is a USB <i>certified</i> port. USB certification guarantees that it&#x27;ll be safe to plug any USB-certified thing into any other USB-certified thing. Without that certification, the device isn&#x27;t guaranteeing its ability to handle weird things that other USB devices might do—like sending it lots of current without doing a specific proprietary negotiation first.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like FCC certification for &quot;accepting radio interference.&quot; Devices that have it, are guaranteed to not melt down&#x2F;throw sparks if you bring them close to e.g. HV power lines, or a radio tower. Devices that don&#x27;t have it, <i>aren&#x27;t</i> guaranteed to not do that. They might or they might not; but they weren&#x27;t <i>required to be tested to find out if they would</i>.<p>But unlike FCC certification, where it&#x27;s illegal to sell something in the US containing an antenna if it&#x27;s not FCC certified, it&#x27;s entirely legal to produce and market a device that has USB connectors, but isn&#x27;t USB certified. There&#x27;s nothing stopping companies from doing it—other than the expectation that consumers might care about the USB logo being on the product. If a company thinks consumers <i>won&#x27;t</i> care about that in their case, they have no reason to bother.<p>(That&#x27;s not to say Nintendo shouldn&#x27;t have made their product fail safe under out-of-tolerance conditions from other USB devices <i>anyway</i>. It would just be good engineering to do that, even if you don&#x27;t want to pay the licensing fee. But they didn&#x27;t think to test for those conditions—likely because the USB Consortium wasn&#x27;t invited to come breathe down their necks reminding them about things like that.)')
