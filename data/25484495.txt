Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=[25484720, 25486893], score=None, time=1608447573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483388, text='If you&#x27;re telling yourself, &quot;the only difference between me and Bezos&quot; is his &quot;privilege&quot;, and &quot;If I had that 300k I would do the same&quot;, I think you&#x27;re missing out on how important his personal choices were, and your own.<p>If you don&#x27;t see the choice factor, I think two things happen: 1) you stay where you are because you think, nobody is in fact successful, they only had it given to them, and 2) and you think it doesn&#x27;t matter what you do, so you will not navigate your path with choices, and see yourself as an agent, but instead see yourself as basically a helpless leaf in the current, tossed this way and that by fortune and fate.<p>Personally, I feel it&#x27;s really important to take personal responsibility for my own path, and see where I am as a result of choices. Not just for things like business, but for all of life. I think that&#x27;s perspective puts me in a position of power, and taking that perspective is something I can control. Even in the context of things like harassment, or accidents, or childhood abuse and trauma, I don&#x27;t think about it as, &quot;I chose for this to be done to me,&quot; but rather as, &quot;I choose what I make this mean, and I choose how I respond.&quot; I feel if I give that up that perspective, I willingly take on a disempowered perspective, so I see giving that up as giving myself a disadvantage.<p>I understand if you and other people want to see things that way, and I myself have the reflex where if I see someone successful I immediately ask myself, &quot;Yeah, but who did they know? Who gave that to them?&quot; and I try to let go of that because I see that as a trap that will make me feel better (by comparatively telling myself, it wasn&#x27;t my fault, I just didn&#x27;t get so much given to me, and also by letting me bring down in my own estimation the significance of their success, and thereby their capability, by eroding its legitimacy, since it wasn&#x27;t them, it was just what they got given) -- and I try to remember that such notions won&#x27;t help me get anywhere. So I try to emphasize to myself how inspired I feel about this, as in, &quot;I like this. How can I get some of that for myself?&quot;<p>One way I try to remember this to myself is, &quot;If I can&#x27;t get from where I am to where they started, how would I ever get from they started to where they go to?&quot; And &quot;win from any position&quot;. All the same, I&#x27;m not suggesting these are appropriate attitudes for you or others, since everyone has a different path and purpose, and we need a diversity of people who believe different things...but I just hope that sharing this, can give you some insight into the other perspectives that are out there about this. I know how hard it can be to hear even a simple set of ideas like this, because these ideas, if you entertain them run the risk of removing the comfortable distance you put between your own path, and those of others, by being able to explain it away as not having any responsibility yourself. It&#x27;s a lot easier to psychologically deal with knowing about &quot;people more &#x27;successful&#x27; than me&quot; if I can tell myself &quot;it&#x27;s not my fault&quot; and even &quot;they are not responsible for their success&quot;. Taking that responsibility, even just in a perspective sense, prompts you to look at where you are at, which can be very painful. It&#x27;s not my intention to initiate this sort of response in you by sharing this, and it&#x27;s not an attack on your position, just sharing my relationship to that kind of thinking, and how I understand it can be a very difficult type of thinking to try. I hope it was insightful and worth your time reading, but if not, at least you have the perspective you already know and like.')
