It&#x27;s not different from other medical procedures. As such, it&#x27;s part of patient-doctor confidentiality.<p>Put differently, when asked, you are not obliged to answer any questions about whether or not you are vaccinated. For instance, if I ask you whether you had a flu shot last year, you do not have to answer me.<p>What about public authorities? Same thing applies, unless vaccination is legally mandatory. Then we&#x27;d have a different discussion.<p>Finally, how many private businesses are willing to risk a court case over refusal of service because a patron isn&#x27;t willing to divulge medical information? Not to mention potential violations of discrimination laws.')
