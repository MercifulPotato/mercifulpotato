It would mean a catastrophic interruption to the customers application exactly when its the most popular&#x2F;active. And theres no practical way to determine whether the customer is “trying it out” or running a key part of their business on any particular resource.<p>This is simple wrong.<p>Depending on your use-case disabling active resources is the right reasonable solution with less downsides.<p>E.g. most (smaller) companies would prefer their miscellaneous (i.e. no core-product) website&#x2F;app&#x2F;service to be temporary unavailable then have a massive unexpected cost they might not be able to afort which might literally force them to fire people because they can&#x27;t pay them....<p>I mean think about it, what worth is it if my app doesn&#x27;t go temporary unavailable during it&#x27;s free trial phase <i>when it means I&#x27;m going bankrupt from today to tomorrow</i> and in turn can&#x27;t benefit from it at all.<p>Sure hug companies can always throw more money at it and will likely prefer uninterrupted service. But then for every hug company there are hundreds smaller companies which have different priorities.<p>In the end it should be <i>the users choice</i>, a configuration settings you can set (per preferably per project).<p>And sure limits should probably be resource limits (like accumulated compute time) and not billing limits as prices might be in flux or dependent on your total resource usage or similar so computing it is non trivial or even impossible.<p>I often have the feelings that hug companies like Amazone or Google often get so detached from how thinks work for literally every one else (who is not a hug company). That they don&#x27;t realize that solutions proper for hug companies might not only be sub-optimal but literally crippling bad for medium and small companies.')
