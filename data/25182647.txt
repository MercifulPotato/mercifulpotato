I&#x27;m a programmer and I&#x27;m not delusional enough to think I&#x27;d make a great product manager BUT to me it would seem as the no 1 skill for a product manager is learning how to say &quot;no&quot; to stakeholders. I don&#x27;t mean in a non-productive way, I mean more like <i>actually challenge</i> poorly thought out requirements, deadlines etc etc etc.<p>PMs only add value when they serve as an interface between the business, challenging and parsing requirements into actionable tasks with a clear definition of done, aligning with other teams to eliminate blockages etc etc.<p>Unfortunately, many (most?) PMs do none of this, but instead see themselves as some kind of overbearing slavedriver who cracks the whip on behalf of stakeholders and their every whim without question, demands 100% insight into what everyone on the team is doing at all times, creating stress and throwing people under the bus when the shitty requirements and deadlines aren&#x27;t met. It a ubiquitous and fundamental misunderstanding of the role that make them not just useless but positively harmful.')
