For the last 15+ years I have treated it episodically using Sumatriptan and it still works 100% for me. Newer formulations such as Rizatriptan, paradoxically, don&#x27;t work as well. I tried other prophylactic drugs such as valproic acid (worked but liver-toxic and caused weight gain), topiramate (caused loss of stream of though) but the side effects were not worth it.<p>There is one interesting experience which might be of value to other people: for a year I went on a zero carb diet -- and I mean zero with no cheating -- to lose fat. I lost the fat but also lost all migraine episodes as well. Completely migraine free for a year. Just that makes me want to go on the diet again.')
