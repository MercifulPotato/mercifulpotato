(IP would be more than sufficient - but since it&#x27;s a location service, even if all the apps run the requests through a proxy, location-at-time and location&#x2F;destination pairs are also useful to help link.)<p>In the end I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything privacy-conscious app developers can do other than eschew external services as much as possible, clearly inform users when external services are used, and push for stronger regulation (from phone &#x2F; OS manufacturers and the government) about data privacy.')
