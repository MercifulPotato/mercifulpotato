Perhaps sentencing should take this into account (e.g. a different sentencing bracket until ~24?). Also, there&#x27;s another argument to be made that younger people have had less time to sort themselves out, and a longer time to redeem themselves or make something of themselves (which I think we see here, not to say an elderly person couldn&#x27;t do that).<p>With regards to less intelligent people who are imprisoned, I would even say their plight is maybe even <i>more</i> tragic. Less intelligent people probably have faced many more hardships in life and&#x2F;or had a harder time mounting a strong legal defence (though intelligent people are more likely to abuse drugs [1]).<p>I suppose this struck me in particular because it&#x27;s a strong condemnation of the stereotype that prisoners are &quot;certain kinds&quot; of people. The contrast is what made it stand out. Maybe it can serve as an example for those who believe you only end up in prison if you are one of those &quot;certain kinds&quot; of people.<p>Again, it wasn&#x27;t a calculated sentiment, it just struck me how absurd getting sentenced to up to 30 years of imprisonment is, especially as a 19 year-old who probably could&#x27;ve ended up at a top university if not for life circumstances.<p>I also think our justice and prison system is fundamentally flawed and should be reworked, especially for non-violent crimes (which this borders on the edge of).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bigthink.com&#x2F;mind-brain&#x2F;adult-brain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bigthink.com&#x2F;mind-brain&#x2F;adult-brain</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-scientific-fundamentalist&#x2F;201010&#x2F;why-intelligent-people-drink-more-alcohol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-scientific-funda...</a>')
