For this reason there is also immense trust in the system. Its not exactly 100% but its high <i>compared</i> to India. I have personally lived there and it works for the most part. It is possible to impeach a president in US on grounds of merit. Try doing this in India without triggering a pogrom, or a major civil strife.<p>They don&#x27;t have land sharks raiding and occupying lands illegally, or people faking documents to sell the same lands to 10 people, like its common in Bangalore. The system as a whole doesn&#x27;t have as much fraud, dishonesty and cheating as much as India. When you have this your courts don&#x27;t get flooded with pointless cases, which shouldn&#x27;t even exist at the first place. This allows the courts to focus on real issues, and helps fast track clearance of cases and quick delivery of judgement. You won&#x27;t have this in India until the society as a whole reforms and moves towards developing universal qualities of merit, fairness and justice. Im not talking of enforcing them, but these values existing and being respected in our society as a part of our culture.<p>&gt;&gt;India is far far more employee friendly than Europe and most parts of US.<p>Not even remotely close.<p>&gt;&gt;There is exactly zero cases of employees have lawsuits by their employers.<p>Hard fact! That&#x27;s for a simple reason, these employees don&#x27;t matter :-). Most hop jobs every 1 - 1.5 years. Until you land a big cheque from the VCs. Then you rewrite your systems anyway.<p>By the time you settle your case over a decade they might have hopped like 7 companies. The original case is largely meaningless.')
