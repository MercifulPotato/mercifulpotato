Just to name some examples.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m pretty sure people are allowed to stay children for longer nowadays, instead of being told to marry and work in the coal mines in their early-to-mid teens.<p>More cynically &#x2F; conspiratorial &#x2F; on the other hand, people are kept infantilized as well as a means of control by various parties in whose interest it is to keep a population docile and dumb. Can&#x27;t overthrow the government if you&#x27;ve got scantily clad teens to watch.')
