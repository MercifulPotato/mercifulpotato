Advertisers are lazy and fickle, they won&#x27;t waste time and effort putting content (jobs) on your site for no return on investment (applications)<p>To attract recruiters (advertising on behalf of companies) you will need:<p>* Integration with third party job posters\n * Time and a lot of hand holding\n * To offer cheap but not free posting (nobody values anything that&#x27;s free!)\n * To offer them something tey can&#x27;t do themselves or are too lazy to do themselves such as marketing their jobs for them on social media which raises their brand awareness and application rate.<p>To attract candidates you will need to offer them something they don&#x27;t get anywhere else, or do but you do it better &#x2F; more efficiently with less hassle.<p>I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest showing your analytics to anyone, they don&#x27;t know the context of them for example...<p>You could have 200 jobs on your site and 200 people that you&#x27;ve targetted specifically for those jobs apply for them each registering a unique hit on your site but those hits generated 200 applications which would not be the same as a spray and pray approach that most other job boards take.<p>Also get your jobs on Google For Jobs and Indeed - it&#x27;s a ton of free targetted traffic!')
