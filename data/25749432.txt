I&#x27;m a software engineer.  I know how to write software.  So I did the responsible thing - I did not write software.<p>I literally opened Notepad.exe, and started making double-entry accounts of all of my expenses.<p>I broke them down into recurring expenses, surprise expenses, and then discretionary spending.<p>For each recurring expense, I made its own ledger of dates and the expense.  I could then predict my future expenses.  Given the current date, and knowing when the money would next be due, I could calculate how much I needed to set aside PER DAY, in order to be ready to meet that expense.  Once that critical next date passed, I could achieve a steady state, of how much I needed to set aside PER DAY, for that expense.<p>I then started doing double-entry accounting on my main, available cash account, on a daily basis, subtracting the recurring expense daily amount each day.  So, I had an actual balance, but then I also knew how much was left for my surprise expenses and discretionary spending.<p>I then went after my surprise expenses, and tried to come up with a rough flow rate for them, as well.<p>And then I gave myself an allowance for discretionary spending.<p>Mathematically, everything I just described was incredibly simple to do.  No software required.<p>Having that discipline saved me from going in to debt.<p>I maintained that discipline until my cash crunch wasn&#x27;t so tight.<p>And now I kind of wish I had the time to write the software.  :-&#x2F;<p>I also wish I could get my stupid bank to give me &quot;Read-Only Credentials,&quot; so I could write software to poll my bank, and not feel so recklessly irresponsible about it.  (Having ONE account, with the ability to disperse funds, it feels wildly irresponsible to leave software running with those credentials.)  I know there&#x27;s also the problem where someone receives 17 cents, and then reports &quot;I got 17 cents&quot; in order to establish the ability to make withdrawals from accounts.  So then my idea of having the software running with read access could be used as an exploit to steal my money.  <i>sigh</i>  That&#x27;s a big pile of BS.<p>Anyone have any recommendations for banks that would HELP ME securely do any of this, or do it for me?<p>I&#x27;d really love it if my phone went DING every time I spent money, and it asked me to classify the expense, right then, right there.  Way easier than doing it after-the-fact.')
