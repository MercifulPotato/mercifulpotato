Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610253703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703426, text='&gt; &quot;Reform the police&quot; is a slogan and accurate.<p>IIRC, &quot;defund the police&quot; grew out of frustration with various police reform efforts that failed to address these problems [1].  It wouldn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to take up the slogan of one of the things you&#x27;re opposing.<p>[1] For instance I watch a video of some police deescalation training (in Seattle, IIRC), where the rank-and-file were talking back and not taking it seriously, and the instructors were not very enthusiastic or in control.  I can&#x27;t imagine that reform effort did a lot of good.')
