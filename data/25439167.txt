Item(by='onecommentman', descendants=None, kids=[25439443], score=None, time=1608093900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434665, text='“Reflexive and shallow” seems to be a “talking point” on HN today.<p>The parent post to this was talking about a pro-authoritarian slant, not the quality of post.  Pro-authoritarian =&#x2F;= reflexive, shallow, generic, angry.  Can be.  So can anti-authoritarian.  Just as much.  Sometimes more.  Much more.<p>I don’t know how the pro-authoritarian observation leads to the analysis above.  Frankly, I don’t see the pro-authoritarian slant from the top posts.<p>The whole discussion I’m reading is about the changed&#x2F;expanded definition of a “journalist” for gathering stats.  A valid, almost instinctive observation because practically everyone has a high-quality video camera in their pocket nowadays.  And has then wondered, “well, if I capture an event, am I a journalist?”  Not a deep life-changing musing, but everybody who has recorded a video event on a smartphone has thought it.  So the 2020 mind is primed with those thoughts.<p>A result like this is posted, and the definitional issue is immediately brought to mind, because it isn’t that far away from lived current experience.  The only issue I have with the discussion is nobody answered the basic question in the top responses...so was the definition of journalist responsible for the effect?<p>The name-calling against “pro-authoritarian” suggests that, in fact, it was.  But just a guess.')
