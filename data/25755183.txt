People will eat less beef and production will also go down.<p>What won&#x27;t move the needle:<p>I walked to the store one time.<p>What will:<p>Creating more accessible, more frequent, and more pervasive public transportation, even for small towns.<p>City planning that doesn&#x27;t require a car for most things.<p>Eliminating the government subsidy for fossil fuels -- which would make the price of fuel as high as it should be, which would cause less production and less demand.<p>I&#x27;m a fan of trying to take responsibility. I&#x27;m also a fan of not pissing into the wind.')
