But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s healthy to hang all of your life&#x27;s needs on work.  The bonds you form from work are usually temporary and conditional upon continuing to perform well at work.  This can add a lot of pressure: you can lose your coworkers and your &quot;friends&quot; in one fell swoop.<p>The bonds I form outside of work are simply because we enjoy eachother&#x27;s company.  Or a shared hobby.  Something that doesn&#x27;t require me to be at the top of my performance.  As long as I don&#x27;t do something ridiculously inappropriate, they will still be my friends.')
