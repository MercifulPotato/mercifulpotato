I just spent the last 4 years building out a parking management software firm which was recently acquired by our largest PE backed competitor. In doing that, I raised money, handled all forecasting &amp; accounting, ran all sales operations (municipal is mostly done via an RFP process) and managed the high level product roadmap from our strategic objectives backwards. Most importantly, I have experience in successfully building long term relationships &amp; contracting with over 250 Cities across the US, which I believe will be key to success in monetizing your product long term. If you&#x27;d like to chat further, please shoot me an email at dhyj7771@gmail.com. I have some ideas for open-source first monetization I think might be useful to you, even if we don&#x27;t find longer term synergy from a conversation.')
