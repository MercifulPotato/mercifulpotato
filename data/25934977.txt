I refuse to believe that number is &quot;0 hours&quot;, that would be an inhuman (without an &#x27;e&#x27;) expectation.<p>Time to decompress is super important, and frankly, it is the very essence of living. It is not at all a waste of time - it&#x27;s their time anyways, who are you to judge? To anyone reading this: The attitude displayed above is toxic and actively harmful. Please ignore what they&#x27;ve said; you can be successful AND drink with friends or get high, even a lot.<p>Balance is important, but you are not obliged to work on self-improvement at all times (or at ANY TIME - full stop). This insinuation smacks of victim blaming and a superiority complex. The concept that you&#x27;re &#x27;wasting time&#x27; by spending it enjoying yourself is absolutely absurd, insidious, offensive, and IMO just plain mean.')
