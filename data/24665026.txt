Financial aid comes in many forms - grants, loans (multiple kinds), work study. Excluding some of these might be fair. Excluding others would be chicanery.<p>The source explains it better than I can:<p><i>The amount that students and their families have to pay for enrollment, “net price,” is generally much less than the published price (“sticker price”), for two primary reasons. First, students often receive grant aid from federal and state government programs. The Pell grant program allocates up to $6,345 per year to students enrolled fulltime in postsecondary education. Students from the poorest families receive that full amount, and the award size declines as family income and wealth increase.</i><p><i>Second, private colleges and universities sometimes give discounts to students based on their perceived ability to pay. This practice has the benefit of allowing students to enroll who otherwise would not be able to afford to do so. But it can also be viewed more pessimistically as price discrimination, which is generally perceived as a predatory behavior when exercised by for-profit companies. Essentially, colleges charge students the highest price that they would individually be willing to pay, up to the sticker price, in order to maximize revenue.</i><p>&gt; Want to guess how tuition has increased at Texas A&amp;M or Ohio State vs. a legion of tiny schools that barely achieve accreditation?<p>The source includes that information as well:<p>&gt; <i>students at public four-year colleges have seen their net costs go up significantly because of increases in tuition that were not offset to the same extent by aid and scholarships. The average annual net cost at a four-year public college has grown by almost 81% beyond inflation over the past decade, to $3,870.</i><p>On its own, that looks really bad, but once you account for the change in ROI, the net outcome looks a little different. The upfront cost is higher today, but the long run benefit is even higher.')
