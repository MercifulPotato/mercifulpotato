Item(by='adamsea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603031155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24815663, text='&gt; To put it differently: you cannot understand whatâ€™s going on in the world just reading the NYT and watching CNN<p>Absolutely. At the same time, regardless of what other news you consume, all Fox News is good for is taking the temperature of the American paranoid right and&#x2F;or your low-information voters with authoritarian sympathies. Or folks who just like the news babes.<p>Or of those who have a difficult time acknowleding uncomfortable truths. Or do not wish to say certain things out loud.<p>And before you admonish me - the issue is not a lack of broadmindness on my part, or a lack of desire to debate&#x2F;discuss. The issue is that Fox News is propaganda pushing morally and ethically outrageous policies. They&#x27;re not the only one but they&#x27;re by far - by far - the worst (at this time).<p>Propaganda is not balance. Fox News these days is propaganda. No news organization should be such. That is the truth, as unpleasant or difficult as it may be for some people to connect the dots to get to the point where they understand that.<p>Second. I&#x27;m pretty sure if you talk to people on the Left - the real Left, not the &quot;center-neoliberal-not-far-right&quot; which sorta is the placeholder for the Left in the United States (although I&#x27;m glad to see Progressives beginning to win elections), they&#x27;ll disagree with you about the media bias of large media organizations.<p>I think that&#x27;s part of what prompted the creation of The Intercept. I don&#x27;t always agree w&#x2F;them but they&#x27;re clearly more of a Left publication.<p>Consider these issues:<p>- The Gulf War\n- The invasion of Iraq (Gulf War 2)\n- Until recently, police violence\n- Until recently, climate change\n- Capitalism<p>And probably more. Plenty of the media outlets you named (and I think NY Times does great investigative reporting) often have not been alignment with the left on these issues, at least initially.<p>I am always down for discussion but not for obfuscation of facts, denial of the truth, or equivocation on the fundamentals of equality, respect for fellow people, and human rights. If we have to politely agree to disagree, so be it. But please consider what I say.<p>Oh. And it&#x27;s important to distinguish between the tens of thousands of people protesting racist police violence since the murder of George Floyd, and the people who have been looting, whether out of rage, poverty, or simply opportunity.<p>There were <i>lots</i> more peaceful protestors.<p>In fact, that you kinda tried to imply that falsehood when talking about CNN (who probably did do something dumb) is <i>exactly</i> the kind of fact-distorting intellectually dishonest behavior that is so problematic. It&#x27;s not specific to Fox, but it is endemic at Fox.<p>Lastly the recent rise in violence in some cities is worth talking about some other day, in some other conversation.')
