But I think personas (or something similar) can be useful for those other parts of the process, especially if they&#x27;re based in research and aren&#x27;t &quot;imaginary&quot;.<p>For example, thinking about how a particular user flow would work for a specific relevant persona&#x2F;JTBD is useful for design decision making. It helps you see things from a user archetype&#x27;s eye, rather than through your own designer eyes or through the eyes of &quot;the user&quot; which isn&#x27;t specific or helpful.<p>This is all assuming, of course, that you&#x27;re building personas correctly, which in my experience is rarely done.')
