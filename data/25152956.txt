Engagement-based revenue models, aka Clickbait, are <i>killing people</i> at this point. This is why people don’t wear masks and believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories—of course, not BuzzFeed or HuffPo directly on those particular issues, but this engagement model for “news” completely undermines trust in news on all sides of the political spectrum. Anything you happen to loosely believe, you can find some clickbait article which plays to all of your confirmation biases. Share it on social media to your like-minded friends, have a few of them disagree with you and cite other clickbait “articles” supporting their disagreement, and you end up with the majority of America having no idea what’s real anymore.')
