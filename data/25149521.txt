Go and Rust certainly have this nailed down better (having used Go on a daily basis for the past 5 years).<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s nothing magical about compiling a file with GHC, just like compiling with gcc. So a simple Makefile might suffice in a lot of cases (like doing AoC challenges).<p>Things start to get more complicated when you add Cabal (and Stack) into the mix, but even with just Cabal you get a lot of added benefits which not too much added complexity.<p>Things like IHP go one step further and go all-in on using nix. I&#x27;ve looked at using nix for a few hours and decided it is - right now - not worth the effort of actually learning it. Nothing to prevent me from using it to build something with IHP though.')
