I would still recommend the book to most people, but with a number of caveats. I think the most important takeaway from that book is the concept of embracing mental discomfort to strengthen yourself.<p>Learning to work with intention and not just when I feel &quot;focused&quot; or &quot;energized&quot; has been hard work for me and something that this last year has really forced. His book was very helpful to me in framing mentally uncomfortable things as &quot;workouts&quot; and opportunities to grow.<p>It&#x27;s a great book if you apply that concept to things like family, marriage, work, LIFE, and not just increasing your suffering personal record.')
