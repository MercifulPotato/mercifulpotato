Then they must receive permission from a judge to file any new lawsuits.  Courts don&#x27;t do such things quickly.<p>It&#x27;s not the job of courts to force people into the care of the a mental institution.  The government must petition the court for permission to do that and show that the person is a danger to themselves or others [1].  Sometimes a court will recommend mental hospital rather than prison for a convicted criminal.  This Craig Wright person doesn&#x27;t seem to be using violence on himself or others and hasn&#x27;t been accused of a crime.  Therefore the system will not force him into a mental institution.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vexatious_litigation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vexatious_litigation</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lanterman–Petris–Short_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lanterman–Petris–Short_Act</a>')
