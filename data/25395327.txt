I know how to control it. Without a reasonable interface to do so, being completely at the mercy of some &quot;UI visionary&quot; (probably the kind who decided we shouldn&#x27;t be able to change the default fonts in programs made for text messaging), it&#x27;ll be even more useless to me than most modern UI:s already make it.')
