They now need to sustain it, that&#x27;s a very different task and one better served by moderation. They are already being out-competed on how extreme a community can be by the various newcomers.<p>They are the incumbent now, with the incumbent&#x27;s advantages. What remains to be seen is if they will move to take on the incumbent&#x27;s responsibilities (which they have done here and there, and seem to be doing more of) or if they&#x27;ll shirk it (which they did for far too long). In the long term they will make more money in a world that isn&#x27;t on fire.')
