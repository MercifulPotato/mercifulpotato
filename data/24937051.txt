It&#x27;s the industrial scale collection, storage, analysis, and sharing of data that becomes a problem.  I don&#x27;t care of Joe Smith the security guard sees me pick my nose or scratch my ass when they&#x27;re watching security cameras because it&#x27;s not noteworthy to them and they&#x27;re not going to recognize me or remember it.<p>However, I do care if the cameras are feeding into a huge system for analytics and data sharing.  What if I cough 2x more than the average person?  Does that get tracked, stored, and sold to a health insurance data supplier that ranks me as high risk for respiratory problems?<p>Does the machine learning algorithm that analyzes footage rank me as a potential thief if the database says I hang out in a lot of poor neighborhoods?<p>These will turn into class profiling systems that will amplify everything in your life so much that whatever your economic status is when you&#x27;re born is what it&#x27;ll be when you die.')
