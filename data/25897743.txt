The author correctly points out the uselessness of that.  He correctly identifies that the complexity lies in providing a <i>useful</i> JSON serialization library that is both compliant in input&#x2F;output yet flexible enough to be configured to go from JSON object model to business model.<p>It&#x27;s actually a complex problem, going from one type system to another.
