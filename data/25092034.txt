Item(by='coder543', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605358563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25091996, text='&gt; You could pay someone to host it with reasonable guarantees they won&#x27;t delete your account on a whim.<p>Each user having to find a hosting provider and pay them... it seems like a non-starter. Think about the non-technical people in your life. That solution would only help the very few people who both understand the details of OpenID, and <i>care</i> about the possibility of losing account access at a deep level. Most people have other important stuff going on in life, so good luck convincing them to adopt self-hosted OpenID at greater cost (and effort) to themselves.<p>This is even assuming that the hosting provider also acts as a domain registrar so each person doesn’t also have to figure out how to buy and own a domain name, to truly own their OpenID, because that would either make this solution much less meaningful in terms of control (with no custom domain), or make it that much harder.<p>&gt; Same for email, which is what identity relies on instead of OpenID.<p>I’m not here to argue for self hosted email. There are many email hosting providers that make it relatively easy for you to bring your own domain name... but this is irrelevant. Signing in with an email and password continues to work even if the email account has been suspended. So, it’s not the existential threat that the article is concerned about.<p>I think the more realistic solution for users is the new FIDO2 standard that will hopefully see adoption soon.<p>I think Google has done a similar thing on Android, but Apple has for sure made every (up to date) iPhone, iPad, and Mac able to act as a FIDO2 Platform Authenticator.<p>Even if the user signs up via OAUTH, websites can give the user the choice to sign in via FIDO2 on each device. At that point, users could sign in from those devices even if their Google account were suspended, giving the website a chance to help the user migrate their account authentication.<p>The FIDO2 flows seem very user friendly, but... the standard is so new, broad adoption remains to be seen.')
