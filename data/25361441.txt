Material Design is pretty great imho and I like most of their UI choices (for applications that seem to sometimes get priority).<p>I think what this comes down to, is that their best technical minded developers are busy working on tooling, platforms, systems or other lower-level development.  Their best design focused developers on public facing applications.  This tends to leave the most junior of developers working on internally facing developer UIs. The payloads themselves are irresponsibly large on this application to say the least, and the ability&#x2F;skill and understanding needed to make it better are probably not within the team(s) working on this UI to begin with.<p>Personally, I absolutely hate Angular and it&#x27;s ironic that Angular&#x27;s chosen primary UI toolkit @angular&#x2F;material gets roughly half the downloads of the third party material-ui for react.  Not even counting boostrap adapters.<p>Most web applications can easily be done in JS with an initial JS payload of ~500k-1mb (download size, compressed), with code splitting can have payloads for different areas&#x2F;components come up as needed.  Charts is probably the biggest beast that is practically impossible to tame, there have been a few times that I just generate the SVG directly in a React component to save the overhead of using a charting library, which is surprisingly easy to do.')
