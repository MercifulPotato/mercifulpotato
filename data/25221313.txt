And ruby is not statically typed.<p>So if in rails you declare an active record model with belongs_to etc it&#x27;s hard to keep track of what is <i>really</i> happening under the hood.<p>In php you have almost no runtime metaprogramming so the things that could happen if you read a piece of code are reduced to a smaller set of options that are easier to understand. well you have reflections but at least they are used in a more static way.')
