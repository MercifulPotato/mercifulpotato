You&#x27;re not basing the stock price on earnings but intangibles. You believe there is a disconnect between the long term value of Tesla and it&#x27;s current price based on your perception of market factors. Every single point you made could change in 6 months for <i>reasons</i> and negatively affect Tesla. Ford could come out with a contract to install electric charging stations throughout the US. Federal regulators could insist that all future EVs have a standard charging port&#x2F;platform resulting in industry cooperation.<p>My point is, &quot;the short sellers are all fucked if we keep buying this and we will make money&quot; and &quot;Tesla is run by a godbrain and can&#x27;t fail&quot; are the same thing: speculations, not spreadsheets.')
