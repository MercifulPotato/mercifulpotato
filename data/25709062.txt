Most of that content currently dominating YT (at least, at the quantity that it&#x27;s produced) is only possible due to these creators making YouTube their full-time job and getting paid to do it. Linus Tech Tips (which also runs Techquickie and Techlinked) attributes 26% of their total revenue to YT Ads[1], and the other categories (like merchandise&#x2F;affiliate links) aren&#x27;t something everyone can do if their videos aren&#x27;t about products available on Amazon or can&#x27;t grow their merch at the rate LTT does. If PT is just about sharing videos, then you might as well run a nextcloud instance instead since &#x27;no ads&#x27; is a huge downside to PT for creators.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;youtube-is-closing-its-private-messages-feature-and-many-kids-are-outraged&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;youtube-is-closing-its-pri...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-zt57TWkTF4?t=395" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-zt57TWkTF4?t=395</a>')
