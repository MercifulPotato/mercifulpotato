Desire is possibly even to weak of a word, but I can&#x27;t come up with a better one.  I have it, one of my daughters has it.  My wife does not.<p>I would say that I do not feel like <i>me</i> if I don&#x27;t have time that is unobserved by others (and I&#x27;m not using this as a euphemism for masturbation).  Even though the things I do then are typically inane.  My browser history is fairly inane, and yet I would not publish it.<p>I had kind of noticed this before, but didn&#x27;t really have to put it into words until trying to explain my daughter&#x27;s need for privacy to my wife.  She is a <i>very</i> empathetic person, but it took several conversations for her to start to get the idea that &quot;I want to do something without someone looking over my shoulder&quot; is different from &quot;I want to hide what I&#x27;m doing from someone&quot; (though absolutely the latter can be used as a smokescreen for the former, particularly by teenagers).')
