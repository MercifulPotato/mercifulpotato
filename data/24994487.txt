At some point one figured out that they could make their personal ads into &quot;1-900&quot; numbers, and rolled every free paper up all over the country within a few years, first making them bland, then shutting most of them down after people stopped reading them. A very few survived when their parent decided to spend a minimal amount of money on them (as the bottom fell out of the &quot;900&quot; number biz.)<p>I guess you take independent writing anywhere you can get it these days, but I&#x27;m not sure much has been lost. There will still be a market for those papers after covid, because they&#x27;re basically entertainment programs, like maps to amusement parks. Maybe if what is now Village Voice Media are out of the business, they&#x27;ll have a chance to flourish again.')
