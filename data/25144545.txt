XBox Live Indie Games for 360 was also not an issue. Sony had sideloading for homebrew on PlayStation at various points in time too.<p>I think making it a required policy (with allowed constraints) would not be harmful to consoles at all.<p>Requiring third party stores is more difficult, but honestly I don&#x27;t think most people would need them if you can just sideload.')
