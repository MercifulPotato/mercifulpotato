Admittedly, my expectations were very low, and it&#x27;s certainly a long way off high-quality professional printing.<p>But for something temporary like a photo to pin to the fridge for a few weeks, it&#x27;s actually good enough.<p>I think this is relevant for quite a bit of the market.  Most people getting photo prints online don&#x27;t seem to care much about quality - the results vary a lot between companies and many cheap ones are really bad.<p>I&#x27;d say the colour laser get fairly close to bad ones ordered online, and is significantly better in quality to some other photo products (custom birthday cards, that sort of thing).<p>So I think for many causal users&#x2F;uses it&#x27;s pretty viable')
