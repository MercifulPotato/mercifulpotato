I remember being interested in CEP when it was said that it was like writing database queries against event streams instead of static data.<p>I tried some CEP software called Esper over 10 years ago. I wrote a query that did some simple thing like counting how many events of each type were received within a window. After a short time, my application ran out of memory. Apparently each event that contributed to the count was being retained in memory, rather than just relevant information, such as the event type and the count. That didn&#x27;t seem like a viable way to perform CEP, so I gave up on that. I assume they&#x27;ve improved since I just googled for Esper and it&#x27;s still around. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espertech.com&#x2F;esper&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espertech.com&#x2F;esper&#x2F;</a><p>Since I haven&#x27;t heard much about CEP lately, do people use it, or do they use some competing paradigm?')
