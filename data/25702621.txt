And not just some banana President, but one that presides over an absolute superpower. USA looks more like decentralized China by doing this.<p>No issues with Trump have been fixed, dirt has been swept under the rug. Silencing someone doesn&#x27;t undo their words and, ironically, it tends to amplify their message.<p>Impeach him, sue him, shutdown the government, rally against him persistently and systematically. That is the right way. But it takes effort, much, much, much more effort than hitting the ban button and calling it day (and achieving nothing in the process).<p>These corps play by the FOTM. Thinking that they aligned with your just cause is crazy. Have you forgotten they cuddle with China as well?')
