How weird is that???)<p>Buy something without a number pad. Unfortunately most 15&quot; laptops do have one.<p>If anybody from HP is reading this, I&#x27;ll pay an extra for a keyboard without number pad on your 15&quot; ZBooks with 3 buttons on the touchpad. Space bar and touchpad aligned with the center of the screen please.')
