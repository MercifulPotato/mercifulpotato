It&#x27;s great at cutting down smoke as it has a re-burner section that keeps the temperature high enough that their is almost no smoke once it gets up to temperature.<p>But there is a lot more maintenance with something like this.  I have to have about 6 cords of wood to make it through winter (which mostly comes off my property) but that also means handling the fuel (bucking and then splitting the wood as well as having the space to let it season for a year to dry it).  Filling up the furnace once or twice a day depending on the weather.  Cleaning out the ash once a month. And now that it&#x27;s getting older (8 years) I have to fix up some of the welds inside the main chamber.<p>I don&#x27;t mind the extra work as it saves a lot of money in electricity bills and all that splitting of wood has been good exercise.  But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you have the time and energy to do the work.')
