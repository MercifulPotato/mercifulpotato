As a grizzled founder, who is becoming numb to the entitlement that is easy startups, easy funding, easy results.<p>I know many founders - and they were broke, broke, broke (and went broke to bootstrap). This &#x27;finding about your parents&#x27; can make those straight out of college who don&#x27;t stick with it feel better.<p>Reality is... entrepreneurship is an incredibly hard game that takes years of grinding away after hours, or eating away at your own savings and your free time.<p>Founders I know (including myself):\n- One worked years on the side to grow it enough just to get seed. With newborn kids, then quit his CompSci job to live off his teachers wife salary for years.\n- One was on foodstamps for 6 years, and kids on medicaid to pull his shop through\n- One saved for years, and spent most of his money to get through the rough spots and is coming out the other side just now.\n- One failed 4 times - each attempt taking a few years, entered bankruptcy to try on a 5th attempt.\n- One lived at poverty means for years with a family while bootstrapping.<p>So.... lets stop the entrepreneurship is easy pr0n. It sucks so hard you&#x27;ll hate your life. If blowing all your time and money getting there isn&#x27;t worth the suffering you&#x27;ll feel - don&#x27;t try.')
