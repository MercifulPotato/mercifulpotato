Why should it change?<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether a program that works <i>for you</i> is a good indication that it no longer needs to change.<p>&gt; When we have a software that works well and solves our problems, we should celebrate it, not complain it doesn&#x27;t find new problems to solve.<p>I think anyone can agree that, at the very least, screen tearing and proper support for mixed DPI setups are problems that fall squarely in the responsibilities of X and yet it <i>still</i> didn&#x27;t manage to solve them after so many years.<p>So it&#x27;s hardly the case that X is just so good that users nowadays have to try really hard to find new problems for it to solve.')
