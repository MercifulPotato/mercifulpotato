It&#x27;s one (!!) line. And the (huge) advantage is: Everybody <i>can</i> create their own allocation macros. Not all allocations are born equal: Some need specific contexts or arenas&#x2F;pools where to allocate from, some want a specific alignment, some want zeroed memory...<p>And again, you don&#x27;t even need this macro, it&#x27;s just cosmetic. Better invest in some structure that reduces the number of required allocations to a small constant (per type or subsystem).<p>&gt; and not everyone does it right<p>This is like saying, don&#x27;t write code because not everyone is doing it right. This is almost the simplest type of code you can imagine.<p>&gt; 2 - Actually it fails with certain kinds of type given as parameter<p>Which ones, then?<p>---\nFor the rest, trying to de-flame this and not to reply, and maybe be actually productive for an hour this afternoon :-)')
