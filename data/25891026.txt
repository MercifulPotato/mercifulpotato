Clearly &quot;major&quot; numbers are insufficient, the only real answer is to rename the entire freaking language when you make incompatible changes to it.</i><p>Perl and Python are the only two examples of this to my knowledge: most open source languages do fine introducing breaking changes in major versions.<p>The question is why Perl and Python had such problems while for example NodeJS, PHP (comparable webserver scripting languages) have had no such issues.<p>I wonder is it anything to do with the areas they&#x27;re used in (Python &amp; Perl are popular local&#x2F;cli scripting languages in addition to webâ€”has Bash had similar version woes?), or is it purely that the changes they made were more significantly breaking than others&#x27;? That&#x27;s probably true of Perl6&#x2F;Raku at least.')
