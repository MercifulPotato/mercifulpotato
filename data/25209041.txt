I took it really slow and first few months I did IF and skipped breakfast. Then one time a week started skipping all meals in 24h period. Finally I got to the point were skipping meals for 48h was possible with water and bone broth if I am really hungry. All of this seemed impossible if I had something carby or sweet day before. For some reason itâ€™s much easier if I have veggies&#x2F;unsaturated fat and some protein. In terms of sleep I experienced same issue. I was so energetic and could not sleep as long. It went away 3ish weeks in.')
