Nobody is working for Apple for free. People are working on their own time (or supporting the project with their own money) because they want to see this happen.<p>There is no skin in this for Apple either way.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why people insist on criticizing a project which won&#x27;t fundamentally affect them at all. Having Linux on Mac isn&#x27;t going to hurt you and stands to benefit the community as a whole.<p>While the GPU port is unlikely to benefit others, it&#x27;s very likely some of the other work will. Any improvements to the Broadcom drivers will be useful for the entire community. Improvements and optimizations to ARM64 support will likewise  benefit the whole community.<p>Really tired of the mis-directed zealots who think they have the right to tell other people where to direct their time and energy.')
