I started at a -2.25 diopter prescription in each eye. So for about $120 I got every pair of glasses down to 0.25 diopters, and a Snellen chart to track progress. Today, I&#x27;m down to a -1.25 prescription, although I plan on seeing an optometrist to confirm this once it&#x27;s safe in the world to do so again.<p>The things I noticed during this experiment:<p>&gt; It takes about a month minimum to drop down a prescription (I measure it as once I can reliably read to the 20&#x2F;30 line on the Snellen chart).<p>&gt; Given the above, I wear `current prescription + 0.5 diopters` whenever driving to make sure I&#x27;m well above the legal limits for driving (which is 20&#x2F;40 vision)<p>&gt; Going outside and just looking at stuff that&#x27;s far away has the biggest positive effect on improving vision.<p>&gt; Given 30 seconds of actively focusing, I can see temporary gains to my vision for the next 30 minutes or so<p>&gt; My vision is waaay better in the morning<p>&gt; I can now work on my laptop without needing glasses (still difficult to watch tv, though)<p>&gt; Given the focus on what is and isn&#x27;t blurry, I&#x27;ve started noticing the insane effect the brightness of a room has on how blurry things are<p>&gt; I&#x27;m terrible at tracking data, given that I only have about 10 entries in my very basic excel sheet<p>&gt; This has made me go on walks more often, which is just a net good all around. It feels &quot;productive&quot; to go for a walk rather than boring.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s very possible that this has only a limited return it can provide, since I&#x27;ve been plateaued at -1.25 for the last 3 months.')
