For the longest time I have been looking for something that puts association first, works as fast as the mind, and allows you to stay in flow state. Making building a second mind, playful and rewarding.<p>If anyone is interested, I have added the link below. At this point I am slowly letting on the first users, and hoping to gather as much feedback as possible. The explore link on the homepage leads you to a live demo you can play with.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kokoro.app')
