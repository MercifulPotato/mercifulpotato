For example, the shower head we wanted to get is illegal in California, because the flow is too high.  When we bought a new toilet we had to get the low flow toilet, which definitely clogs more than the old ones did.<p>What I don&#x27;t agree with is that this bad.  These are minor inconveniences.  Sometimes I have to use the plunger, and the shower is less relaxing.  Not a big deal.  I&#x27;d rather that than water rationing.')
