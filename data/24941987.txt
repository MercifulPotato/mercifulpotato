Item(by='thu2111', descendants=None, kids=[24946656], score=None, time=1604064672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934551, text='<i>Tucker Carlson claims that his evidence &quot;got lost in the mail&quot;</i><p>No he didn&#x27;t - where did that come from? He claimed the mail had been intercepted, someone had ripped open the parcel in transit and stolen the documents, and that the courier firm had even shown them pictures of the ripped-open package. He then made a series of remarkably precise claims about their interaction with the courier, the search the courier firm mounted to try and find the stolen documents and so on.<p>According to sibling comments this story was now confirmed in its entirety by UPS.<p>Ironically, I learned what Tucker Carlson said by reading the Guardian. Their top story yesterday (in terms of views) was something like &quot;Tucker Carlson mocked after claiming evidence was lost in the mail&quot;. Obviously the Guardian, and those people who mocked him or lied about his claims now look very foolish and naive indeed, because his claims have been verified in their entirety by the courier firm themselves. The real story here is that UPS has been corrupted by the same kinds of win-at-any-cost leftists who blocked the story at Twitter and other places: they are so desperate for this to go away that they&#x27;re actually destroying their own customer&#x27;s valuables in transit. In the USA every line of communication is being shut down by these radicals, even postal mail.')
