In 2021, I&#x27;d appreciate search running from object storage (e.g. S3), with a dynamic compute layer over the top providing all of the compute--especially with indexing being such a source of variable compute.<p>Also, why do we have to re-index all of the time?  Most textual customization can happen at query time, with only a mild performance hit.<p>I&#x27;m curious if we ever truly get a cloud-native, easy-to-maintain search thing, or if we have to wait for ML to eat search in order to get nextgen tech.')
