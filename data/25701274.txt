Errant mutations that would cause compositional changes to the shape of the protein are almost guaranteed to cause functional failure. Using terminology, this is what we call a highly conserved area.<p>In both cases for the South African or UK strain, if you take a look at the areas where mutations have occurred, youâ€™ll see that the code responsible for generating the spike protein is basically completely unaffected. This will generally hold true  for any successive future strains.')
