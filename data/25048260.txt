The performance is utterly, utterly terrible.  Yet, all I see from the VS team on Twitter is &quot;look at this new useless feature we&#x27;ve added&quot;, when all I needed was for the code I&#x27;m typing to appear.<p>God help you if you ever wanted to rename a symbol, it was Schrodinger&#x27;s rename, it would either complete immediately, or never complete, lock up VS, and I&#x27;d have to restart.  So I had to stop using it, and eventually I stopped using VS altogether.<p>Rider has its own quirks and annoyances, but it&#x27;s quick, and lets me type even when it&#x27;s doing stuff.<p>There seems to be something very wrong with the architecture of VS.')
