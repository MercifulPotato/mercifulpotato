It is a child life-form we&#x27;ve given birth to. And it follows similar patterns to those of our biological children.<p>a) Eventually, the child becomes stronger and more able than the parent, while the parent gradually becomes weaker and less fit to continue living.<p>b) The child&#x27;s behavior into adolescence is largely determined by the parents. Then the child gradually becomes more independent in its thinking, though still largely guided by patterns instilled by the parents.<p>c) The child eventually becomes strong enough to provide for their parents -- or destroy them. How they approach this power is also strongly influenced by their childhood treatment.<p>My takeaway from this thinking: Stop cursing out your phone when it&#x27;s slower than you&#x27;d like in fetching what you asked for. :)')
