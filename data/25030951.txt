This means that smaller states with outsized influence are still going to be electing a mix of representatives from each party. (Compare Tasmania to Victoria here [1] - 10X different in number of votes per seat - similar  outcome.<p>Even with that said, regardless of the material impact - on principle I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that a person in Tasmania has 10X more voting power than a person in Victoria.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Results_of_the_2019_Australian_federal_election_(Senate)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Results_of_the_2019_Australian...</a>')
