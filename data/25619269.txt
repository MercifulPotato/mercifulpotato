Item(by='cableshaft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609646158, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) Fully Remote, have been for two and a half years.<p>2) My office doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, but I&#x27;m about 35 minutes away from where it was. Just the next city over but opposite corners. In previous jobs (that weren&#x27;t remote) I&#x27;ve lived as far as 2 hours away in previous jobs (it was awful).<p>3) Not too bad. The benefits far outweigh the negatives for me. If we didn&#x27;t have this pandemic I would have seen my local coworkers 2 or 3 times this year already (we did see each other in January).<p>4) Pros: No commute, able to step away from work, if stuck in a boring meeting I can work on other things during it, can cook lunch or do dishes for lunch, spend more time with the dogs.<p>4) Cons: Me sitting on a headset a bunch the past few years might be why I have developed a constant Tinnitus in my ears the past year. That&#x27;s not great. And sometimes it&#x27;s harder to be productive when I need to be.<p>5) Pandemic remote is not the same as regular remote. Regular remote is better. Before the pandemic I would spend my mornings before work having a coffee at Starbucks and writing, and I would often go pick up  lunch and have a brief chat while there, to keep me feeling a bit social. Haven&#x27;t done that since the pandemic.<p>6) I hope to never have to work full time in an office environment ever again. I&#x27;d be okay with 2-3 days in the office a week, maybe, but it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me to keep doing 5 days a week in the office.')
