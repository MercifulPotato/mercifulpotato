I am however skeptical, and I suspect the skepticism is very similar to the other side who think nuclear is not economic viable compared to batteries.<p>However we don&#x27;t need to chose as long as we both agree that the grid need to be carbon zero and the cost to the climate from fossil fuels need to be added so that either nuclear or lithium-ion batteries will be guarantied cheaper than continuing running fossil fuels plants when wind&#x2F;solar are not producing. As long that is true then the market will figure out which one is cheaper, and the consumer can enjoy the cheapest energy grid which do not burn fossil fuels.')
