Item(by='somebodynew', descendants=None, kids=[25100794], score=None, time=1605369137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25092163, text='As a C++ developer, highlighting the lack of destructors made me curious how resource closure is typically handled in Go. A brief review suggests that it is often handled using a &quot;defer statement&quot;, which accumulates a stack of statements to be executed when the function returns, to execute a &#x27;close()&#x27; method. While I can see some benefit to the explicit appearance of &quot;defer&quot; in the source code, I think it is outweighed by the risk someone forgets to write it (or tries to close something without defer but misses a path). The execution of a destructor is inevitable and automatic.')
