From employees driving to work to the electricity needed to run the servers.<p>In this case, I don&#x27;t think the dumpster fire produces more than a few kW of heat. If it was done inside an office space, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough to heat to room to a comfortable temperature. The server infrastructure required to stream the video most likely produces more CO2 than the fire itself, and I don&#x27;t usually see an ad on web net saying &quot;we bought carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gases that video produced&quot;.<p>Here there is a visible fire, so people think &quot;OMG, the planet&quot;, not realizing that their computer may be connected to a much larger fire in a coal plant.')
