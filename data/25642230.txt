I&#x27;ve got a very particular setup that&#x27;s comfortable to be at and work at for a while, and then I can raise the desk (standing position) because that makes me feel good too.<p>I do a fair bit of cycling and every-other-day core workouts that are kinda needed because cycling makes my hamstrings and lower back tight. It all happens to come together and I feel the same as you, much better shape in my 40s than my 20s.<p>I might dare to say I feel pretty darn good physically, most of the time. And can even push myself to pretty hard points (where things hurt, but not in an injury type of way) when I want. I hope I can keep this up, but sort of feel like a bunch of good practices that already are in place can lead to that.')
