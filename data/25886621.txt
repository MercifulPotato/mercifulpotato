And I can see an inverse effect as well. People willing to work for free on a project, who aren&#x27;t as willing to work for $50.<p>But I think often times the bounties will go to the people who are already maintaining the project. Who likely would have resolved the issue anyways.<p>And rather than a ton of people commenting &quot;same&quot; on an open issue. They could chip in a couple dollars and support the developers.')
