I have an EEG headband (Muse) that tracks a single composite measure of “calmness” while meditating. When I use it, the graph looks like a random walk—it barely registers what subjectively feels like a deep state of calm. I just assumed it didn’t work and stopped using it.<p>Then I gave it to my dad, who has been an ER doctor for 40 years but has no knowledge of or experience with meditation. Within seconds, his calmness graph plummeted to the minimum value (lower = better) and flatlined. There was a brief spike in attention when the dishwasher changed cycles in the other room, then it cratered again. He just nonchalantly explained that he can control his heart rate to calm himself down, which sounds like a superpower to me.')
