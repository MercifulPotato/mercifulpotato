I started talking a lot to them around February which is also when we all started to improve but I didn&#x27;t know them well enough last year to be able to do a before&#x2F;after comparison.<p>I can comment on myself though. I&#x27;m very low conscientiousness&#x2F;have ADHD (without conscientiousness issues I&#x27;d probably have gotten 3-4 times as much done as I otherwise have). Around 2 years ago, and much of last year, I was pretty miserable. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what my thought process was back then (since I think differently now) but I got stressed very easily, could not message people without bad anxiety&#x2F;overthinking, was in poor fitness, got little done, etc. etc..<p>I&#x27;m not sure what percentage of it I can attribute to supermemo (since you can&#x27;t tell where memories come from) and I still struggle a fair bit but I&#x27;ve been able to get significantly better at managing stress sanely, not stress about talking to people so much, improve fitness and other lifestyle changes. A lot of these seem like they&#x27;d be things you just sort of do build but for the stress stuff in particular, I think I&#x27;ve been influenced heavily by stuff I&#x27;ve learned (though a big part of that influence also comes from creator of supermemo himself, both over email and from supermemo.guru). If I get back to incremental writing, I think you&#x27;d be able to see some of the benefits I&#x27;ve had in terms of creativity. Some days I can&#x27;t sleep because there are just too many ideas popping up to be written down. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten into the habit yet though I plan to establish a few other baser habits (like better sleep, ironically) and after to move back to it.<p>If you want to hear a miracle story where I started using supermemo and then wrote 10 research papers and completed lots of huge projects, you won&#x27;t find that with me (I think 5-10 years from now you might). I don&#x27;t regret it all though because the delta from where I started and to where I am now is huge (though it&#x27;s hard to feel it day to day because of hedonic treadmill).<p>I would note, if you do try SuperMemo, maintain skepticism. One mistake I made especially when I first started is just importing neat things and memorizing them, without thinking about application. I&#x27;m certain that there are users at least 3x better than me, entirely because  they&#x27;re good at being selective&#x2F;have more base knowledge so they can get rid of more overlapping inputs.')
