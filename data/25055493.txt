The final phase’s selection isn’t random, but many intermediary phases are.<p>I think randomness is an underrated tool for introducing a sense of “fairness” to problems with strange power dynamics: where everyone is interested in a fair outcome, but the best outcome for any individual causes some harm to the group.<p>Salary negotiation is one example. Imagine haggling over the range start or range size, and then picking your salary from a uniform distribution contained by that range. I wonder how the distribution of (un-)satisfactory outcomes of this system that would compare to the one we have today.<p>It’s also interesting to note certain parallels to structures existing today. The group stage draw for the UEFA Champions League comes to mind.')
