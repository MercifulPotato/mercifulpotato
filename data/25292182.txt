Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25296643], score=None, time=1607018716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290586, text='a taser is just one point along the use of force continuum. police are trained to always maintain a tactical advantage when confronting someone, but to only go as far along the continuum as is necessary. obviously they don&#x27;t always do this correctly, and they are granted a lot of leeway when they mess up. it&#x27;s unclear to me how removing a midpoint along the continuum would reduce instances of excessive force, unless there&#x27;s something specifically bad about the taser.<p>it seems to me that it would be better to focus on the negotiation skills themselves; people won&#x27;t bet their life on skills they don&#x27;t feel confident in. or better yet, raise the bar for what justifies a confrontation in the first place. the cops who killed freddie gray didn&#x27;t even have a charge in mind when they decided to pursue him. they chased him just because he ran away.')
