Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=[24745785, 24745770], score=None, time=1602423997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745569, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s entirely true. When most people talk about investing in index funds they&#x27;re largely talking about funds like eg. $SPY, not total market funds like $VTI.<p>My personal performance of investing in all three categories (total market index, S&amp;P 500 index, NASDAQ-100 index) matches every chart you can find online over last 5 years; the total index funds are carrying the baggage of all that &quot;not S&amp;P&quot; weight and are worse returns than the 500, with the 100 achieving almost twice the performance as the 500 (near 24% returns over 5y).<p>The new &quot;target retirement date&quot; funds are falling below all three with the highest expenses and lowest returns, worse than a generic total market fund, $0.02 anecdata from a lifetime passive investor in index funds. (I&#x27;m still in the red this year on small cap specific and world growth and similar &quot;diversification&quot; funds, they&#x27;re by far the biggest money wastes compared to passive index fund investing in my portfolio)')
