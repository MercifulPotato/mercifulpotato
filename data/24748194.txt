Unless you have a powerful ebike, most bikers accelerate 5x slower than usual car, even slower than scooters, and max speed around 25-30kmh on flat road. So they become obstacle that is often difficult to avoid safely in the car.<p>There are +-2 countries that I&#x27;ve seen implement bikes seriously - Netherlands and Denmark. Both have more bikes than residents AFAIK. The magic is to have <i>dedicated</i> bike lanes that nobody else uses. You only slow down&#x2F;stop on intersections with car roads or pedestrian paths, otherwise its all for you, wide enough to overtake slower biker.')
