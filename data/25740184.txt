Ethical experimentation to prove causation definitively is difficult to say the least, but there have been various &quot;natural experiments&quot; that can be learned from.<p>At the very least, an extreme skeptic would still have to grudgingly acknowledge that violent speech is a leading indicator for violent behavior, and that interventions that reduce violent speech also reduce violent behavior, but the evidence is strong that the link goes beyond mere correlation. Here is one recent study: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;10584609.2013.852642" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;10584609.2013.85...</a><p>A quote from the abstract: <i>&quot;Across all three experiments, mild violent metaphors multiply support for political violence among aggressive citizens, especially among young adults.&quot;</i><p>Not really a surprising result, but those who wish to employ violent speech for their own ends are of course quite resistant to the notion that there is a cause and effect link to be found.')
