After all we now have more ways to manage data, so we generate more data. And usually this means more administration. The question is, are we getting more out of it?<p>Also, we see what reduced administration looks like. Every webshop, every online platform where you just click something and you can buy&#x2F;sell&#x2F;report&#x2F;ban.<p>Aaand, there&#x27;s the incumbent lobby doing regulatory capture to resist de-administration, eg. filing taxes.<p>&gt; Harvard is still Harvard.<p>It took this pandemic to show the world how fragile that status quo is. Plus the recent admission discrimination lawsuits and scandals show that it isn&#x27;t really about education.')
