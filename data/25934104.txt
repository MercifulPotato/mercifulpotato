They&#x27;re completely different models, trained on different data, and vastly different sizes. GPT-2 had 1.5B parameters, and GPT-3 has 175B. It&#x27;s two orders of magnitude larger.<p>Sure, both models are using the same structures (attention layers, mostly), so it&#x27;s a quantitative change rather than a qualitative change. But there&#x27;s still a hell of a big difference between the two.')
