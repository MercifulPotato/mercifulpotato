I wrote a far less thorough blog post on the same topic a few months ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vericred.github.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;migrating-to-aurora.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vericred.github.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;migrating-to-aurora.ht...</a>.<p>Overall, we&#x27;re happy with our decision to migrate to Aurora. We feel it offers better performance, observability and scalability compared to heroku postgres. To echo some other comments:<p>1. Jesse at Heroku is great. I had never setup my own postgres instance before, and his guidance helped me a lot.<p>2. We used DMS, and it was ok, not great. Dealing with LOBs was a bit of a pain. In order to keep the migration time to a minimum we setup multiple DMS tasks and grouped tables into those tasks based on their max LOB size. Most of our tables didn&#x27;t have any LOB columns and they migrated quickly.<p>3. The ability to fast clone a database is nice. We can create a copy of our production database in about five minutes for use in non-prod environments. This would take a couple of hours in heroku.<p>4. The Aurora IO costs are ridiculous. Are there any good tools to see what is exactly causing so much I&#x2F;O?')
