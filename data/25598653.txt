It is reminding me a lot of one of my favorite John Cleese videos[0].<p>One of the things that I think makes this so difficult is that language has a lot of limits that people don&#x27;t realize. Since we often don&#x27;t run into issues with communication (or rather don&#x27;t notice since the errors are small) it is difficult to realize when we&#x27;re in boundary cases. For example there&#x27;s priming[1]. Many may learn that this is a useful way to influence people and many are aware of the psychological experiments, but it is also a fundamental part of how we communicate. We try to communicate the most information with the least amount of words. But this same factor is why good faith arguments are so important but also difficult to maintain. We could not easily converse if we didn&#x27;t make certain assumptions about another person&#x27;s views. This is normally fine but we run into problems in heated topics where we often act like someone can only hold an extreme opinion (and of course, mine is not extreme and just common sense). It&#x27;s the &quot;oh, I&#x27;ve heard this argument before&quot; and while one person may have subtext another may not (why it is difficult to identify dog whistling). Removing nuance from a topic makes it easy, and we like easy things. But that&#x27;s not beneficial to resolving issues and like you say &quot;leads to a wilderness of mirrors&quot;.<p>But it is impossible to tell if priming like this is actively being pushed or naturally happening, since we do have a natural predisposition to form tribes and groups. We&#x27;re nuanced and thoughtful with our arguments while <i>they</i> are overly simplifying and idiotic. <i>They</i> just want a win while <i>we</i> want to actually fix things. And since this kind of talk is natural it is also almost impossible to figure out if I&#x27;m doing the thing I&#x27;m actively complaining about or not.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HLNhPMQnWu4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HLNhPMQnWu4</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;basics&#x2F;priming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;basics&#x2F;priming</a>')
