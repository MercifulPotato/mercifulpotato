It&#x27;s simply a technical&#x2F;design lock-in. Going from unstructured to structured data presents problems, and if you do that, it&#x27;s rightfully up to you to fix.<p>This is true, but it&#x27;s also kind of vendor lock-in because there&#x27;s a whole query language and aggregation pipeline for Mongo that&#x27;s completely different to other databases. If I was using an RDBMS and was switching from MySQL to Postgres I think I would likely have a much easier time, because fundamentally it&#x27;s all SQL (I know, there are differences between Postgres and MySQL, but it&#x27;s a lot less, and a good ORM will smooth some of it out for you - at least initially)<p>I think this is basically equivalent to your example of not being able to easily move from AWS to Google Cloud because of their different APIs.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like SQL-to-Mongo is impossible to implement, because there is third-party tooling for that (which I haven&#x27;t tried): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio3t.com&#x2F;knowledge-base&#x2F;articles&#x2F;sql-query&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio3t.com&#x2F;knowledge-base&#x2F;articles&#x2F;sql-query&#x2F;</a>')
