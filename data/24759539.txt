It is cold, and I am happy.<p>Because I am in the sun room.<p>I bring a task onto my mental desk. Considerations, insights, possibilities start spilling from it immediately with no effort required.<p>I seem to have micro thoughts within larger ones. Little jokes I make to myself, flashes of pleasant memories, ideas for tangential projects while the larger loops churn away.<p>I love to code here, though one must keep an eye for refactoring hubris when sitting in the sun room.<p>In this room I have the idea to start naming familiar states of consciousness like rooms of a house. The sun room, the doorless room, the infinity cupboard, the hole.<p>Sadly I&#x27;ve only found coffee for opening this door but daily use quickly builds tolerance in me.<p>So I&#x27;d very much like to know, has anyone else has found a key to the sun room?')
