In 2017 I had launched a similar &#x27;chat-app network&#x27; platform[1] for privacy focused dating using Bot API of the respective platforms allowing communication between,<p>Messenger &lt;-&gt; Telegram &lt;-&gt; Viber &lt;-&gt; LINE<p>It was quickly selected for acceleration by one of those platforms.  The features included half-duplex messaging(user had to wait for reply to send a message to prevent harassment), optional location, near-far dates switch etc.<p>Adoption was quick, the first major issue I ran into was that in SE Asian countries many used their children photographs for profile picture in chat apps, which obviously was a no go for dating, so I had to implement Amazon Rekognition to detect age and make those users change their profile picture and their profiles weren&#x27;t displayed until it was changed. At peak it processed 200,000 images&#x2F;month.<p>Obviously bridge approach as in Beeper(Matrix) is a more reliable approach than using Bot API, especially due to UI&#x2F;UX limitations and even platform stability issues(Some bot API were nascent).<p>In about a year it even crossed the Trough of Sorrow with ~2,40,000 users on Messenger alone.[2] But had to let go of it as I fell sick(was told I could become quadriplegic[3]) and as single founder bus factor hit my startup.<p>I received several offers to buy the platform, but I didn&#x27;t sell it as I was not sure whether the buyers would stick to the privacy promises. So I just nuked the platform.<p>Even if I had continued, I&#x27;m not sure whether I could have monetized successfully as selling digital content was explicitly prohibited by these platforms because of Apple Tax&#x2F;Google Tax(it would mean that the chat apps function as app store).<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aeuL8_Qinhs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aeuL8_Qinhs</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20181203031208&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finddate.co&#x2F;goodbye-finddate-is-shutting-down&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20181203031208&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finddate....</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abishekmuthian.com&#x2F;i-was-told-i-would-become-quadriplegic-68c0371e6f05&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abishekmuthian.com&#x2F;i-was-told-i-would-become-quadrip...</a>')
