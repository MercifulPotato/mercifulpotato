That world view (or massive amounts of cognitive dissonance) is a necessary prerequisite for being willing to tolerate this kind of government invasion or privacy.<p>Making these people uncomfortable with giving the government all that info will just move them from the naive camp to the cognitive dissonance camp.  Other than actually experiencing significant government abuse I don&#x27;t think anything will change these people&#x27;s minds.  Political ideology is like a religion these days.')
