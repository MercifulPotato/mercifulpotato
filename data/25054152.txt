The person who witnessed the events he relayed may be a lawyer, but he is not an election lawyer and also not from PA, so his specific knowledge of their rules and regulations may be lacking.<p>Assuming the person making these claims accurately relayed his observations, what he saw sounds just as likely to be workers setting up &amp; testing the machines for proper functionality.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a chance that&#x27;s not the case, and something else was going on. But lacking evidence to the contrary, this account seems explainable by something other than election fraud.')
