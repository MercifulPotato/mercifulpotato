I feel like this should be a compiler&#x2F;lib option for those of us who would opt into the breaking change for increased safety.<p>But since it isn’t, augmentations may be an option. I’m not at my computer right now so I can’t verify that this would work, but you may be able to add an overload that returns `unknown`. Unfortunately with overloads, I’m pretty sure the built in types would be selected first without some additional specificity.<p>This feels like a good opportunity for a safer standard library package wrapping globals, DOM, Node built-ins, etc.')
