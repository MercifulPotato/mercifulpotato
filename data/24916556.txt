You see, I agree with pretty much everything in the article and write code like that all the time. Because yes, it does work. But you learn stuff like that automatically after a couple of years. Still, this is just one simple function; the actual hard part is scaling that to 1k+ functions while still maintaining something clean and understandable. Sure you can draw this in an onion diagram, but actually executing that in real life is something else, and I almost never see practical examples of that in online articles simply because that is not possible I guess, only in actual code or in more alaborate books.')
