And then someone posts something like &#x27;I tried installing Ubuntu but thing X didn&#x27;t work, how can anyone do real work on this joke operating system? I stopped using it immediately&#x27; and they just want to provide a different perspective.<p>Personally I bought a highly-recommended Windows laptop a few years ago and had to stop using the OS because both sleep and the Intel wifi drivers simply didn&#x27;t work. Yet if I tried to use that experience to proclaim that that Windows was a non-functional, useless operating system developed by people who don&#x27;t give a damn, I would not be taken seriously.<p>By the way have you considered what reporting bugs like this for Windows is like? You end up on one of those Microsoft support sites staffed by non-technical non-employee Community Experts who have absolutely nothing useful to add. Talking to real driver and OS developers directly on Linux bug reports is magical in comparison.')
