Article II of the Constitution makes it constitutional for The President and Congress to enter into treaties which may have otherwise unconstitutional aspects - such as international sanctions - but would be constitutional by Article II if the supermajority passed the sanctions treaty. I wonder if the First Amendment overrides that because it was introduced later.')
