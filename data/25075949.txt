So no, it&#x27;s quite appropriate for mgechev so reject generalization if the point doesn&#x27;t apply to them.  And that in no way a rejection of the facts presented.  The same way that the generalization &quot;apples are red&quot; can be rejected by the presence of green apples without denying the existence of the red apples.')
