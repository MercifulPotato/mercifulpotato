So the evoution of the placenta needs to be seen in the immune system context, a more simple immune system may not have a problem with a non-self embryo in the body. So the virus gene could be one of the factors that enabled a proto-placent to evolve along an adaptive immune system. [Note this is pure speculation, I haven&#x27;t read up on the evolutionary timescales of either.]')
