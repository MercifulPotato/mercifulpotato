But if you must build upon the work of a <i>different</i> programmer who is not <i>you</i> and that programmer chose `class Foo{}` instead of `Foo=class{}` then the codebase is now rigid and inflexible for purposes of prototyping and experimentation. You are going to have to save the JavaScript to a disk file and edit it there to get rid of the non-redefinable `class Foo{}` or `const numColumns=80`.')
