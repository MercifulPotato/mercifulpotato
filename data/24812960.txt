I don&#x27;t understand what they mean by reservoirs.<p>As a related question, I&#x27;ve read that we all have cold viruses inside of us all the time, and they can be triggered by an immune weakness (such as by being in the cold outside). I&#x27;ve also read that you get a cold only because the virus is transmitted to you from someone else (which is more likely in the cold months when we&#x27;re huddled together). Which is it? Can you develop a cold from a pre-existing internal virus with zero contact from another person?')
