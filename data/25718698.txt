The word intelligence is subjective. You can&#x27;t say something like Asians in general are more intelligent then white people but you can say Asians in general have higher IQ.<p>So a better way to talk about this topic is to ignore the word &quot;intelligence&quot; all together. Just talk about how and why Asians have higher IQ.')
