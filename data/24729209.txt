While it is commonplace to assume that the scientific revolution and the progress of technology were inevitable, in fact the West is the single sustained success story out of many civilizations with periods of scientific flourishing. Like the Muslims, the ancient Chinese and Indian civilizations, both of which were at one time far more advanced than the West, did not produce the scientific revolution.&quot;<p>.. so far, so good. There&#x27;s always the risk that the West might internally reject the scientific revolution. This paragraph is a useful reminder that historical &quot;progress&quot; isn&#x27;t linear or monotonic.<p>This article is very good on the background in the era of the Caliphate and early scientific progress in medieval Europe. Where it falls down is the past century. We can draw  comparison with the Meiji restoration; Japan went from insular agrarianism to a world power to collapse to continued scientific development through to the 21st century. As did much of the Far East. Why not the Middle east?<p>Anyway, excellent longread.')
