Nix is an excellent build tool while Docker is useful as an universal software distribution format. They&#x27;re really useful together because Nix is actually good at creating compact Docker images. But of course, if you don&#x27;t have to worry much about distribution, it would be much nicer to stick with Nix as you&#x27;ve mentioned.')
