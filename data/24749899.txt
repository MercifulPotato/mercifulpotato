A doc nomination would be a first (and there&#x27;s a best doc category), but there&#x27;s no rule against it. It is an absolutely transcendent piece of narrative; so much more captivating than most fantastical things a great writer could conceive. It deftly trumps the best narrative-cum-reality of the type that Herzog regularly delivers.<p>(If Black Panther can get a nomination, and this can&#x27;t, I will consider the Academy a truly dead institution.)')
