(I would ask the KDE team the same question.) It feels like what we are losing most with the transition from X11 to Wayland is commonality of implementation for the various system services <i>other</i> than input or presentation which were formerly handled by the X server, and which are now handled either by the compositor itself (Gnome and KDE) or by a shared library (Sway and any other wlroots-based compositors).<p>It is good that we at least have standardization at the protocol level, but just the same in my opinion it is … unfortunate … that the two largest desktop environments chose to forge their own paths in terms of the implementations of those protocols, with various desktop-specific extensions.')
