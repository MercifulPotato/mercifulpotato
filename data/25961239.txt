GitHub is nowhere close to a delight as people make it out to be.  Settling for GitHub creates as many problems as it solves.  This is not a recent development, and there&#x27;s nothing surprising about any of this (at least it shouldn&#x27;t be considered surprising at this point).<p>What&#x27;s interesting that if you ask people why they love GitHub, they&#x27;ll probably say, &quot;because of its community and its UI — they&#x27;re great!&quot; and if you ask people who hate GitHub why they hate it, they&#x27;ll agree that it&#x27;s about the community and the UI — except, from their perspective?:  &quot;They&#x27;re terrible.&quot;  It&#x27;s not hard to figure out what&#x27;s up with the disparity.<p>GitHub is a two-dollar bill: better than a one-dollar bill, and worse than a five.')
