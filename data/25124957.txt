The reason assembly is harder is because it&#x27;s a lower level language and requires significantly more code to accomplish the same. Most term re-writing languages are actually higher level than python. And so in theory would take fewer lines.<p>The real difference is noone has created a set of libraries for the web api domain space in a term re-writing language. If they did, it&#x27;d be easy.<p>And similar to others in this thread, I think term re-writing languages will be prominent in programming future. The same way many years back people could see functional programming over the horizon in programming future.')
