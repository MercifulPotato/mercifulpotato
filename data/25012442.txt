I think not: there are things Intel has always been doing very well and post-Netburst improvements after Core 2 have also been significant.<p>I believe that a big element is basically luck: you invest in a certain progression path and that investment <i>will</i> yield results so you keep going. Another path might be sufficiently better to write off the inferior path investment but <i>you don&#x27;t know that</i>. Perhaps the unsatisfying path taken is the least bad of all. Even Netburst improved over time, a bit, and so did whatever forgettable AMD had been building between the Athlon glory days and those of Ryzen. As long as you see progress, it&#x27;s very hard to just give it up for a fresh start (that may or may not be better). We can just be lucky that a luck&#x2F;lock-in imbalance has never persisted long enough to make the lucky one the only survivor, because then they would never leave the left dead-end they&#x27;ll inevitable run into some day.')
