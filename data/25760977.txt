If your dependency is used by more than one package within the distribution, it should be split out and not vendored - ultimately, this will reduce the total workload on package maintainers.<p>This however does not mean that distros should be splitting <i>every</i> dependency into a separate package by default, much less have a separate package in the archive for each build configuration - there&#x27;s no need to litter the distribution repo with idiosyncratic packages that will never have more than a single project&#x2F;app&#x2F;library depending on them, and that&#x27;s precisely where a vendoring&#x2F;bundling focused approach might be appropriate. Such dependencies are more like individual source-level or object files, that have always been &quot;bundled&quot; as part of a self-contained application.')
