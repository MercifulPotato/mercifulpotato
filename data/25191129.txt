Then for a football field to be &quot;crowded&quot; you would need more than 57,600 &#x2F; (pi * 36) = ~510 people evenly distributed on it. If the social distancing recommendation is 20ft, then you can only have 57,600 &#x2F; (pi * 400) = 45 people on the football field before it starts getting crowded.')
