We have an incredible number of regulations from the 1930s still on the books, 90 years later. These regulations come at a great cost. For example, Moderna&#x27;s mRNA vaccine technology languished on the shelves, unused, for <i>ten years</i> before our present crisis forced its hasty validation. As the New York Times reported recently, mRNA-1273 was developed in just <i>two days</i> in January 2020. According to the Worldometer tracker, we just crossed over four hundred thousand COVID-19 deaths in the US (January 15th, 2020). Had fewer regulations impeded its development and testing, a great number of these lives might have been saved.<p>Before you reflexively downvote me, please note that I&#x27;m not a Trump supporter or even a conservative.')
