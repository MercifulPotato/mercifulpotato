All the way through Caluclus classes and Diff EQ and up until the first half of Linear Algebra, everything is plug and chug. After the first half of Linear Algebra when proofs started making an appearance, I came to the realization that proofs are another type of mental activity entirely. Survey of Algebra, Basic Real Analysis, and even the dedicated proof writing course I took were all exponentially harder to pass.')
