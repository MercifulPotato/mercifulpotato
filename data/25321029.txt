I&#x27;ve noticed when I get off of it, it is basically the same as when I had depressive episodes. I start to feel completely lethargic, don&#x27;t care about anything, I want to sleep and I consume all food within a 10 mile radius. I&#x27;ve notice the same thought patterns coming off of adderall as I do when I am depressed. I don&#x27;t care about anything, I don&#x27;t want to exercise because who cares, eat a box of donuts, sure it feels good now, and who cares about later.<p>When on adderall I can be shorter with people and get angrier quicker; however I am also less likely to act out because I have better control of my angry impulses and am able to recognize it for what it is. I also don&#x27;t deal well with distraction on adderall because I want to just go go go and focus on one thing. Take that for what it is worth.')
