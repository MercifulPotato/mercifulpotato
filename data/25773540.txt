I always find it surprising that people talk about TSMC so much and not mention ASML; people talk about &quot;TSMC&#x27;s 5nm process&quot;, but it&#x27;s really ASML&#x27;s tech that powers all of that.<p>Setting up a new factory to replace TSMC is not trivial of course, as it&#x27;s operationally hard, but none of the core tech would be &quot;in China&#x27;s hands&quot;.')
