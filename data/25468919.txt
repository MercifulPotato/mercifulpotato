Add &quot;abstract&quot; to your search query to surface papers.<p>2. Search for &quot;... reading list&quot;. For example, Heidi Howard maintains <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;heidihoward&#x2F;distributed-consensus-reading-list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;heidihoward&#x2F;distributed-consensus-reading...</a><p>3. Read blogs like &quot;The Morning Paper&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.acolyer.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.acolyer.org</a>) but skip fields that are outside your scope. You don&#x27;t have time to follow more than one or two (or three) major fields.<p>4. Use Google Scholar to find the most cited papers, or to find papers that build on papers you think are good.<p>5. Keep an eye out for the conferences where these papers were presented. Then read the other papers that were also presented.<p>6. When you come across an amazing paper, read other papers by the same authors or supervisors.<p>7. If you&#x27;re lucky you might also find good &quot;survey&quot; papers that cover and reference the state of the art.<p>8. Lecture notes from Stanford or MIT or another university can also be a great way to get a big picture of the evolution of techniques for a given data structure or problem. For example, these lecture notes are just brilliant for getting started with stuff around memory hierarchies: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp&#x2F;~tau&#x2F;lecture&#x2F;parallel_distributed&#x2F;2018&#x2F;slides&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;memory2.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp&#x2F;~tau&#x2F;lecture&#x2F;parallel_d...</a><p>These are a few tricks that I find useful.
