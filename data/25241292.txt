It has some confusing semantics relating to reference counting and in-place modification (e.g. [0]) that make it really hard to use as a &#x27;real&#x27; language (as opposed to small bits of code for scripting).<p>The mitigating factor is that it&#x27;s got good bindings support and a codebase that&#x27;s very tractable to poke around in, so you can easily extend it in other languages.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;godotengine&#x2F;godot&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15265" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;godotengine&#x2F;godot&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15265</a>')
