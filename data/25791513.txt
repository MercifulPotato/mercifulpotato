I really wanted a MacBook with a touch bar as I find the idea of it really good. I realize that it had many design problems but I still think that it has merit.<p>Would it make sense for Apple to keep the touch bar ABOVE a row of physical function keys? That way people wouldn&#x27;t constantly accidentally press it as the function buttons act as &quot;shield&quot; from touching it accidentally.')
