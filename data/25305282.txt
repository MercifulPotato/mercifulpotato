I mean this as a middle-of-the-road SWE on a decent team.)<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure where the GP got stressful, but it is soul-sucking if you expect your work to be interesting, impactful, and creative, which doesn&#x27;t really happen apart from a few core or research teams. There is a ton of piping and rewriting of frameworks going on <i>all the time</i>, even when it need not be extremely useful. This is the main reason I found it thoroughly drabâ€”even though it is likely that the lines of code I wrote there are likely to touch many orders of magnitude more people than anything else I ever work on for the rest of my life.<p>I guess that&#x27;s just how it goes, though.')
