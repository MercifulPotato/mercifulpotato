Typos and spelling errors can be fixed by machines for a very long time already. Editing for space is less necessary when writing for the infinitely long pages of the web - a good writer knows how much detail their audience wants better than an editor does. It&#x27;s not clear why news has to be filtered through biased editors anymore when technology has eliminated space and distribution constraints.')
