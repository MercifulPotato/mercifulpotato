So easy to migrate. Wa restore can take up to an hour from gdrive, telegram is ready as soon as it is installed<p>2. It&#x27;s always on everywhere, i.e. when i open web.telegram.org or desktop qpp it just connects instantly, web.whatsapp otoh requires my phone to be connected, takes forever to start and fails half the time.<p>3. I can restore year old file on tg while wa fails unless i have it in a backup.<p>4. The api. So easy to implement and such amazing bots. Just search skeddy for an example.<p>5. Huge groups. Our housing group has 1100 members, don&#x27;t think its possible on wa<p>Biggest con compared to wa:<p>1. An amazingly bonehead feature that fills up my inbox: it has tell me x or y has joined telegram with a red badge. Seriously and i would care why? I add hundreds of people to my contact list. I can&#x27;t even turn off this feature.')
