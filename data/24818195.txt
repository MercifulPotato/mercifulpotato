The way nouns could sometimes modify other nouns in that tongue had always been one of his weak points. In Latin, as in most simple dialects of the region, a construction like</i> servus puer <i>meant about the same thing as</i> puer servus, <i>and even in English</i> slave boy <i>meant</i> boy slave. <i>But there the similarity ended. He had finally learned that</i> house cat <i>did not mean</i> cat house, <i>and that a dative of purpose or possession, as in</i> mihi amicus, <i>was somehow conveyed by</i> dog food <i>or</i> sentry box <i>even without inflection. But what of a triple appositive like</i> fallout survival shelter?&quot;<p>(Brother Francis goes on to assume that it is a shelter for the Fallout, which as far as he knows is a wandering demonic spirit, to survive in.)')
