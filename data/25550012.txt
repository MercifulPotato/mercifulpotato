Thus, I&#x27;d trust first party docker images, but repackaged applicaton images would fall out of date more often and remain out of date for longer than most distro packages IMO. And, with distributions, there&#x27;s a community of maintainers that try to package everything to a standard, with docker, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.')
