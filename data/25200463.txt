I find most of the comics funny, but there are a few that really make me laugh.  I actually have a folder on my desktop dedicated to so some of my favorite cartoons.<p>Comedy isn&#x27;t universal at all: I&#x27;m sure there are people who don&#x27;t find Robin Williams funny.  With Garfield, there are several layers to the strip, and the more of them you understand, the funnier the strip gets.<p>I think you have to ...<p>1) Understand the role of each character;<p>2) Empathize with Garfield (easy to do, he has many common failings);<p>3) Feel like cats in general are lazy, eat the same thing, somewhat anti-social, and prone to melodrama (i.e., be a cat owner);<p>4) Feel superior to Jon, as everyone else in the comic does, but also find him lovable (having a dorky dad helps);<p>5) Appreciate absurdity<p>...for the humor to translate.<p>Here&#x27;s a random comic I chuckled at : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gocomics.com&#x2F;garfield&#x2F;1986&#x2F;03&#x2F;22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gocomics.com&#x2F;garfield&#x2F;1986&#x2F;03&#x2F;22</a><p>The foundations of humor are certainly present in this strip, regardless of how much the reader knows about Garfield.  It is absurd (a cat crying and watching a sad movie) and incongruous (turns out, he&#x27;s not watching a movie at all; his reaction is not proportional to the situation).  But I think what elevates the strip is the repetition of Garfield&#x27;s struggle with diets and how Jon always tries (and fails) to cheer Garfield up, combined with the fact that Garfield acts exactly like real-world cats do (crying for attention&#x2F;food).')
