Good grief this show sounds wretched.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of this podcast before.  Unless someone wants to make the case that it&#x27;s much more than it appears to be on the tin, I&#x27;m going to write it off as the bland and uninspired &quot;analysis of our enemies&quot; flavor propaganda that it looks like.  If someone wants to hate Weinstien, just listen to him and decide that for yourself. You don&#x27;t need a big-brained podcast to do it for you.')
