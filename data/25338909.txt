Back in high school, I wrote quite a bit of short stories and thought myself as pretty okay. I was encouraged to actually write something about it, a scene, an outline, a beginning, anything.<p>I tried for a weekend, scratched my head through it, and came up with an embarrassing draft for a chapter. As I tried to translate the ideas in my mind to actual words, all the flaws, holes, and awkward characters suddenly showed up. My ingenious ideas were not a blueprint of grand palaces, but a pile of ugly rocks scattered all over the place. I barely managed to connect them in a circle.<p>She told me, that the fact that I had a scene written was already better than most people who regarded themselves as &quot;wanting to write&quot;.<p>There is a mismatch in people&#x27;s expectations. Without going through the actual work, many people regarded their vague concepts in their imagination as genius. They are often not.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve stopped listening to people who say &quot;I&#x27;ve never done XXX, but how hard can it be&quot;.')
