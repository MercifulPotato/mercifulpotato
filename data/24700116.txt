Instead of nitpicking OP, its worth the attempt of empathy.<p>The small towns of PA (hey! loved that someone put this here) can be just as racist as the small towns of Colorado but somehow this doesn&#x27;t extend to the small towns of California.<p>I say this as someone who has not lived everywhere but has lived in places where the common question (and yes, each town&#x2F;city I lived in had a common question&#x2F;conversation about my race)ranges from:<p>Are you black?<p>Are you jewish?<p>Are you honduran?<p>Are you armenian?<p>Are you [some subgroup of..] indian<p>Only in Japan, so far, am I - told - that I am American. Its amazing.<p>Exposure matters. Certainly there are a smattering of places in the midwest where things are progressive. That being said, they are not as well known and compared to my life in SF&#x2F;LA&#x2F;DC (still kinda conservative)&#x2F;NY, the amount you&#x27;re allowed to live and let live varies.<p>I&#x27;m more likely to hear some random comment about where I do or do not belong or some idiotic belief I have to disabuse about who I am in the Midwest and South.')
