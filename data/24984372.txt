Why did northern europe become protestant? Why is indonesia muslim?<p>The answer is because the elites wanted it that way. Religion is a way for the elites to control the population. Maybe Europe, China, Russia, etc found better ways of controlling the population?<p>If the elites need religion again to control the population, we&#x27;ll have a revival. But modern societies have other tools for population control. It&#x27;s why we are becoming less religious in the US. Maybe more religious than europe but less than we used to be.')
