Why not &quot;ditch Pandas&quot;, which this is much closer to. Better yet, why not just create a tutorial on using Julia without mentioning other tools, and let the reader decide? Julia lets you SUM an entire column! Unbelievable! And you can rename a column? I&#x27;m blown away!<p>Excel has tons of point-and-click capabilities that don&#x27;t require IMPORTing anything or knowing what an IOBuffer is. When you try to pretend that Julia can <i>replace</i> Excel, you just make yourself look foolish and uninformed.')
