No simple rule of thumb exists.<p>Sometimes it results in a much better solution, great! Sometimes it&#x27;s a new wheel but with more awkward square-ish corners. Sometimes (and this is the worst because it&#x27;s hard to explain) it is actually better but still likely has been a waste of the engineer&#x27;s time - high cost vs low benefit, also often cooccurs with lack of team&#x27;s capacity to maintain the new thing.')
