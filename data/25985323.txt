We use it on basically every microcontroller device that can possibly support it.  The recently announced Raspberry Pi Pico &#x2F; RP2040 microcontroller have given UF2 a boost by placing a UF2 bootloader directly in the ROM of the microcontroller.<p>With no additional software to install, you do something as easy as &quot;double click the reset button&quot; or &quot;hold down button while plugging in the USB cable&quot;, and then just drag a downloaded file into the drive that appears.  Almost everyone can handle this step!<p>It also works well with integrated environments like Arduino and you can craft &quot;make flash&quot; type rules in any build system.<p>The usual way, with the bootloader as a &quot;first stage&quot; that loads the real program such as CircuitPython or an Arduino sketch is still susceptible to occasional overwrites by buggy software, so it&#x27;s occasionally necessary for end-users to resort to other techniques like DFU or SWD reloading of the firmware.  That&#x27;s when you really remember how not great the bad old days were.  But RP2040 even avoids that, because there&#x27;s no way to overwrite the UF2 bootloader!')
