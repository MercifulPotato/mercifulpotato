Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;Etc have been absolutely spammed by echo chambers that all assure themselves that self-driving cars have been invented and will be released soon.<p>The population is awash with the viral idea that they&#x27;re possible, exist, and are on the way, because that&#x27;s just what they&#x27;ve been told for years. The average person repeats the idea because that&#x27;s what the internet told them is true, which makes it even more &quot;true&quot;, since now there&#x27;s another person repeating it.<p>What percentage of the population that goes online and talks about how self-driving cars are coming soon actually have the engineering background &#x2F; technical knowledge to come to that conclusion?')
