The parent said:<p>&gt; <i>$50 a month for liability</i><p>...so I presumed a resident of the US.<p>US car insurance policies vary from state to state, so I&#x27;ll just say how I understand it in layman IANAL terms.<p>In my state, personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability (PDL or commonly just &quot;liability&quot;) coverage are the <i>minimum</i> requirements to legally drive a vehicle. There&#x27;s also bodily injury liability (BIL), but since my state is what&#x27;s called a &quot;no-fault state&quot;, it&#x27;s not a hard requirement unless you&#x27;re a taxi (although my coverage bakes it in; I understand this to be applicable towards passengers).<p>The parent also said:<p>&gt; <i>Pleasantly tolerable fee for a day where my car hits black ice and physics takes the wheel</i><p>In this case, liability coverage as I understand it won&#x27;t cover damage to the insured&#x27;s vehicle while driving, which falls under &quot;collision&quot; and is entirely optional for a vehicle that is outright owned (i.e. no lien on the title) in any US state, as far as I&#x27;m aware.<p>So PIP would cover your injuries, PDL would cover damages to the property of others, &quot;collision&quot; covers your property while driving, and this other thing called &quot;comprehensive&quot; covers your property when <i>not</i> driving...and if that doesn&#x27;t cover all the medical&#x2F;property bills, then involved parties are free to sue each other.')
