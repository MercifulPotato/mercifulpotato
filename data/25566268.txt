Item(by='pontus', descendants=1, kids=[25566746], score=6, time=1609210848, title='Ask HN: Resources for Cryptography and Cryptocurrencies', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m an ex-physicist (theory) looking to learn more about cryptography and cryptocurrencies. Much of the stuff I can find on cryptography are general purpose textbooks that start from the beginning with cyphers etc. For the cryptocurrency side I generally find stuff for the non-technical audience or for engineers (focused on implementation), but not much for the more mathematically oriented audience.<p>Can someone suggest a good thorough primer on cryptography and cryptocurrencies that discusses things from a more mathematical perspective? Ideally something that nonetheless doesn&#x27;t assume too much familiarity with the field. I&#x27;m imagining a 50 page pdf called something like &quot;A primer on cryptography and cryptocurrencies for physicists&quot;.')
