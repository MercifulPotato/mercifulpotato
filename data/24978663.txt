Those things aren&#x27;t meant to change often.<p>These are entirely reasonable concerns, and I have a dedicated zone for _domainkey.ryanc.org set up to manage that risk.<p>&gt; There is no need to start doing things that require you to set very low TTLs on your domain zonefiles and then blindly trust that every caching DNS resolver out there on the internet will respect that (breaking news: they won&#x27;t! it will break mail delivery in new and amazing ways!)<p>Also true, and it&#x27;s why despite the 5 second TTL I wait days between revoking the selector and publishing the private parameters.')
