It reminds me of a software engineer who says &quot;I HATE GIT IT RUINED MY LIFE&quot; without ever suggesting an alternative.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to the idea of classism, but in my experience whenever I ask people what concrete changes they would support (in the old system or the new), they are at a loss. This is disappointing to me because it seems pretty trivial to come up with dozens of great changes (e.g. judges being blind to the class of the person they are sentencing, or perhaps juries, etc...). Then most interestingly of all, the people who seemed so angry about these problems seem deflated&#x2F;annoyed by the suggestion of solutions rather than energized and aligned.')
