I guess we&#x27;ll find out.<p>Seems I&#x27;ve lost a point.  Someone took exception to what I said above.  Not sure how I went wrong, but if enough people feel similarly, then my post will fade away. It will be censored.  Make of that what you will.<p>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve got a point back since I wrote this comment.   I won&#x27;t keep editing this comment each time my comment is voted for or against.  It&#x27;s enough to say that people sometimes downvote when they don&#x27;t like an opinion, or the way it&#x27;s expressed at least, even if it is not rude.')
