It runs sub 1080p most of the time, lighting and shadows are horrific, it&#x27;s technically speaking the worst looking PS4 game I&#x27;ve played, including on an actual PS4.<p>Visually in terms of atmosphere it looks great, if you can see through the low resolution and terrible LOD. I believe they can and will fix these things; what I&#x27;m not confident will ever be fixed though, is the AI&#x2F;game logic, it seems like it just hasn&#x27;t been written&#x2F;implemented at anything more than the most basic placeholder.')
