They are doing quite the opposite.<p>(And yes, as the other reply pointed out, almost all democracies in the world can point to their foundation in bloodshed. At some point you had to transfer power <i>away</i> from the undemocratic regime previously in power, and they usually were not willing to be peaceful about it. Meanwhile, a desire to preserve peace in the face of a growing unsympathetic-to-democracy party who&#x27;s gaining power for now through democratic means is the backstory of many of the times democracy has been lost.)')
