Small files work acceptably quickly, the cost can&#x27;t be beat, and the reliability probably beats out anything else I&#x27;ve seen. We saw latencies of ~50ms to write out small files. Slower than an SSD, yes, but not really that slow.<p>You do have to make sure you&#x27;re not doing things like re-establishing the connection to get that, though. If you have to do a TLS handshakeâ€¦ it won&#x27;t be fast. Also, in you&#x27;re in Python, boto&#x27;s API encourages, IMO, people to call `get_bucket`, which will do an existence check on the bucket (and thus, double the latency due to the extra round-trip); usually, you have out-of-band knowledge that the bucket will exist, and can skip the check. (If you&#x27;re wrong, the subsequent object GET&#x2F;PUT will error anyways.)')
