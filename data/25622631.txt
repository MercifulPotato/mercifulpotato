I switched to ECC memory in 2013 or 2014 with a Xeon E3 (fundamentally a Core i7 without the ECC support fused off) and of course a Xeon-supporting motherboard (with weird &quot;server board&quot; quirks: e.g., no on-board sound device).<p>I love that AMD doesn&#x27;t intentionally break ECC on its consumer desktop platforms and upgraded to the Threadripper in 2017.')
