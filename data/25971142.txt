They hate them since forever. Poland should be given the choice to play by the law and value human rights or see what nationalism is worth without the EU. They won&#x27;t leave. They will follow. They have much, much more to lose.<p>&gt; EU need those countries mainly because of cheap workforce<p>Who &quot;needs&quot; what? Exploiting cheap labor from Poland only works for Germany, because legal working standards and payment is allowing for this. German people would benefit too, if general exploitation was fought against.<p>If we tax industries according to their societal, environmental or climate damge, e.g. carbon tax, we can redefine our &quot;dependencies&quot;. We don&#x27;t need cheap farm workers, if we cut the meat industry; we would have much, much, much less demand in labor, land and energy, going for a mostly plant-based food production. Mass meat production is only viable because it&#x27;s subsidized by the government and  it&#x27;s environmental&#x2F;climate impact collectivized.<p>The industry <i>needs</i> cheap workforce. Capitalism <i>needs</i> a cheap workforce. Economic growth and exploitation of natural ressources <i>needs</i> a cheap workforce.<p>If we want to survive the shitshow ahead, <i>a lot of things</i> need to change. Compromising with populism and cultural degeneration is contra-productive.')
