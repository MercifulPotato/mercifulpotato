He has no shortage of people who have seen his taxes, and no shortage of disgruntled folks. Whereas a conveniently placed laptop just left somewhere with incriminating emails seems to test credulity. The laptop seems like a foreign psyop, the taxes seems like something everyone thought inevitable, and that he told us he was going to do himself.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that sources remain anonymous, and I&#x27;m not sure I see an equivalency here. Look at what happened to Lt. Colonel Vindman. It seems like having a standard of &quot;you must lose your livelihood to alert the world to something&quot; might be a good way to keep all sorts of secrets bottled up, to everyone&#x27;s detriment.')
