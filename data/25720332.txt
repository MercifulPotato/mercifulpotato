We dumb down our reality all the time in order to fit it to our agenda, selectively picking and choosing the bits we like, and what else can we do in a world with over 7 billion conscious minds?<p>My worry about your line of thinking, and the everything is political one, is that it feels a bit like eradicating diversity of thought and experience. To relate it to the start of this thread, plenty of the world outside the US will have so much of their own shit to deal with than the politics that are _important to you_ are not at all important to them.<p>For anyone to suggest or demand or require otherwise would seem to be quite imperialistic to me.')
