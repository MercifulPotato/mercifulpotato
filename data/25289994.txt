My guess is that her manager Megan was being nice to her by saying that this is not firing but &quot;accepting resignation&quot;. Unfortunately, her manager was obviously not trained in firing. Never &quot;accept resignation&quot; if employee didn&#x27;t actually resigned, even if you want to nice to them.')
