And that something about his personality drives people to take advantage of him.  That impression comes from his apparent business incompetence.  He is capable of screwing up &quot;sure things&quot; such as casinos and hotels.  Best I can tell, he ends up getting a raw deal, then proceeds to make the shit roll down hill by screwing over people down stream of him (i.e., not paying contractors).<p>He&#x27;s clearly a capable actor.  He pretends, rather convincingly, to be this amazing, confident, shrewd businessman.  And I think a lot of people idolize him because he embodies what they think of when they think of a smart, successful business person.  But I think real smart, successful business people spend two minutes with him, and paint him as a rube.')
