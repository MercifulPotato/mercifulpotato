Now I&#x27;ll grant that enough to live on is low standard of living, but it will pay for food, health care (most get some form of medicare), your apartment, and you can afford a basic car. Of course if you live in a high cost of living area like San Francisco it isn&#x27;t enough, but for most of the US you will live an nice enough life.  You can always want more, but your needs are met.<p>Third world conditions are much worse than that. I&#x27;ve seen families sleeping on sidewalks.  No car, no health care.<p>Sure everybody wants more. There are a lot of retired people who would like a job, but that is as much about the social connection as money. There are also those who lost their money (scams target retired people) and need a job, but that isn&#x27;t most of them.')
