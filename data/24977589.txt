But the topics I mentioned in my prior comment were not about a specific tax provision, or even tax policy generally. I  was just stating the facts of life. It will always be the case that big companies will find it efficient to engage in certain revenue-producing activities that smaller companies&#x2F;individuals will not.<p>Just as I don&#x27;t have feelings about laws of physics, I don&#x27;t have any feelings about economies of scale.<p>Lobbying is a bit different. Like most folks, the idea of &#x27;lobbying&#x27; strikes me as wasteful&#x2F;corrupt. But if you try to come up with a definition about what &#x27;lobbying&#x27; is, and how you might try to restrict it, you realize that it is very difficult to do so without being underinclusive or overinclusive (or both!). So while I find the idea distasteful, I don&#x27;t have any answers on how to &#x27;fix&#x27; it.')
