I don&#x27;t speak French. There were no other options. So the guy that rear-ended my rental car actually had to help out with the call.. even that was problematic, he lived in France but wasn&#x27;t a native, apparently his French wasn&#x27;t quite good enough for the system. Hertz, that&#x27;s <i>not</i> something you should have as your user interface at your Hertz office at an international airport.')
