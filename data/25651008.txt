The final buyer was determined by the specifics of their offer, not just their final price.  FHA with 3.5% down just adds additional risk for closing that 20% conventional doesn&#x27;t.  That risk is minimal, but it&#x27;s a risk the buyer doesn&#x27;t have to take.<p>I&#x27;ll also add that in competitive markets you also get into a situation where it&#x27;s a bidding war and you&#x27;re pushing what the property might appraise for.  If you&#x27;re doing 3.5% down, even though you might be approved up to X, the bank may not be willing to stretch the appraisal for the property.  With 10% or 20% down, that&#x27;s less of a concern.<p>Also FWIW, for new cars, how you pay does matter.  The dealer makes money on the financing, so they will give you a different cash price vs if you go with their financing.  The reason being is that they want to sell you a &quot;zero percent&quot; loan that effectively bakes in the interest up front, so their financing will look better, but the final price will be higher.')
