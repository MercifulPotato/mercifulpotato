I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> tried to get out of jury duty, because I see that as part of my responsibility to my community.<p>That said, in the half-dozen or so times I&#x27;ve been called, I have yet to be selected for a jury.<p>But I&#x27;ll do the same next time, because it&#x27;s the <i>right</i> thing to do.<p>I&#x27;d add that if I were involved in a trial, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want someone who would prefer to shirk their responsibilities as a citizen on my jury, that&#x27;s for sure.')
