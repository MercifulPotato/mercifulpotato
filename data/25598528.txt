I want to go to a show at a  popular venue (arena or theatre sized) in an area I know. If I know vaguely where it is, I’ll drive into the city centre and probably meet a one way system and follow the signs for the venue.<p>2. I want to visit a National Trust property. Head for a major road that runs past it and there will be brown signs that give you the best route to it.<p>3. Travelling somewhere and decide there is a problem with traffic &#x2F; the weather and look for a detour. Signs are often perfect for choosing the best roads to head for another waypoint and then the best way from there to where you were originally heading.<p>I’m not some kind of crazy person who will only navigate by signs - I check things out on maps and put sat nav on, but I know the limitations of all and often the signs send me on the best route.<p>The people who figure these out and keep them updated are amazing at their job.')
