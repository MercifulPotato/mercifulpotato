Silicon carbide was only discovered in the 19th century and doesn&#x27;t occur in large deposits naturally. I assume you mean corundum, which is most definitely workable with time, patience, and lots of abrasive powder. All of these were part of the Egyptian toolkit.<p>Secondly, I assume you&#x27;re referring to the sarcophagi of the Serapeum. They&#x27;re impressive, but nothing outside the realm of the known tools if given enough time and skill, neither of which they were short on.')
