Bitcoins are 100% traceable, and when these coins were moved yesterday it was instantly posted on many news sites, before today&#x27;s announcement that it was actually a seizure by law enforcement.<p>My guess is that almost all exchanges would flag any account that deposited coins from a list of known tainted addresses like this one, and either immediately freeze it or prevent withdrawals. And any exchange that didn&#x27;t do it automatically would do it manually after it hit the news.')
