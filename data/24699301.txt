The mainstream platforms know they have Windows users and seem to do a great job of supporting them.<p>I used to use Docker to meticulously duplicate my staging&#x2F;prod environments on dev machines, but honestly don&#x27;t bother anymore. My CI&#x2F;CD environments would catch any of those issues, and I don&#x27;t run into them much anymore. Having first-class support for Linux containers is great, though.')
