You want to look at consumer spending <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Consumer_spending" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Consumer_spending</a><p>Please google for macro economics, consumer spending index, impact of tax changes on consumer spending , consumer spending and GDP.<p>If I have to reword my above comment in a concise manner. 1. More consumer spending stimulates economy. 2. Consumer spending increases with tax cuts. 3. Consumer spending increases when there is less savings and more income. 4. These indices are directly proportional to size of population.(a tax cut in Finland has a lesser impact on economy and consumer spending than a tax cut in USA which has a lesser impact than a tax cut in India etc)5. All this is tied to interest rates.<p>If I have to explain everything, I will have to condense three semesters of macro economic theory in one comment. I am sure an online search of key words will do a better job and you can learn at your leisure.')
