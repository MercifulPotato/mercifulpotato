Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612007405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967621, text='&gt; There is a solution implemented in the US, the sex offender registry, meant to address this exact problem.<p>Well, you glossed over a lot in that one sentence, namely:<p>1) Prosecutions are usually plea-bargained in the US, so no proof is required that the accused actually did anything to get on the list.<p>2) The average person cannot afford a defense, so again the registry might mean they didn&#x27;t have $100k - $200k for legal fees.<p>3) How are incorrect entries updated?<p>4) Since being on that list geo-fences the accused from areas of town, they end up living under bridges on the outskirts of town. Is that what we as a society want, especially given the above?<p>5) &quot;Sex offender&quot; in the US includes an 18-yo receiving a nude photo from his 17-yo gf, which is the most common category. That&#x27;s some level of puritanical.')
