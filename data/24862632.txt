But it&#x27;s pretty frequent that I forget and tap on Halide thinking I&#x27;m going to record a quick video.<p>I&#x27;m not even talking about professional quality video, just &quot;I want to record 5 seconds of my cat being cute.&quot; But I guess the reservations are partly that if you added basic video capability, people would expect it to be amazing in the same sorts of ways that it is for stills?')
