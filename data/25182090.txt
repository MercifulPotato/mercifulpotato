I was far from being in shape but I passed the requirements to be selected (if I had to do it today I&#x27;m not sure I would pass.  They up their game on entrance requirements!). It didn&#x27;t help that my mom was telling me that I shouldn&#x27;t do it and that I should think about my family.  But it was actually my family I was thinking of.  I knew if I didn&#x27;t do it right then and at that moment I would never do it and would regret it for the rest of my life.<p>Fast forward to April 2020 and the department agrees to pull me out of the field because of Covid since I have a chronic liver disease.  I thought I got a new lease on life as I was getting tired of the field.  But it was more frustrating &quot;upstairs&quot; than in the field and I started applying for almost all remote programming jobs.<p>When I finally got a legit job offer came doubt again.  As a FF-PM in good standing with the department there was little chance of ever getting laid off or fired (the dept has a high, high rate of turnover).  Now I had to decide to leave a secure job or take a job in the private sector.  From money standpoint it was a no brainer, but from a security standpoint not so much.  Ultimately I made the decision to leave the department.<p>Look at where you are and where you would rather be in 1 year, 5 year and&#x2F;or 10 years and work backwards from there.  What can you do today to move you toward that 1 year, 5 year or 10 year position?<p>Don&#x27;t give up and don&#x27;t stay in something you don&#x27;t like.')
