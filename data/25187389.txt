I&#x27;m not insisting that we must, I would just like some day for people that assert or imply that we cannot, to explain (in logically consistent detail, using objectively true statements) <i>why</i> we cannot (or will not).  But to be crystal clear, I&#x27;d never <i>insist</i> that the majority needs to explain or justify their behavior or unwritten rules, here or elsewhere - I realize this is simply one of the fringe benefits of being the majority.')
