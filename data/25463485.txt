It looks like $FreeBSD$ tags are now deprecated, because they aren&#x27;t supported in Git; I recall these tags have always been the biggest blocker in any VCS considerations for both FreeBSD and NetBSD.  TBH, I got the impression that they&#x27;ve never been properly supported by Subversion, either -- you had to install a FreeBSD-specific version of SVN for the tag expansion to work &quot;properly&quot;.<p>I still think SVN is the worst out of all the VCS -- it has all the drawbacks of a centralised Git without many of the benefits, plus none of the benefits of CVS.  For example, I wanted to have a local mirror on the history of the tree, which is absurdly easy to do with CVS with rsync -- you can even selectively ignore certain parts of the tree like --exclude &quot;…src&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;???…&#x2F;&quot; --exclude &quot;…src&#x2F;gnu&#x2F;…&#x2F;…&quot; (how do type a star symbol on HN?), but mirroring SVN was so complicated and inflexible that I had simply given up after it had used up way more space than the prior rsync mirror of CVS had ever required, and still wasn&#x27;t even done.  I then decided to entirely bypass SVN by directly switching to an &quot;unofficial&quot; git repo once the export from SVN back to CVS was completely deprecated and deleted at one point.')
