Had they built a separate VM to manage requests for these objects, it would have been no problem: VM crashes, host app just restarts it. But Java did not exist yet and VMs were not really a thing, resources were too scarce.<p>I do think the ideas behind COM&#x2F;OLE were pretty good, unfortunately real development on desktop OSes basically stopped mid-&#x27;00s so we might never know what it could have been.')
