The person who runs the EU, the most powerful organisation in Europe, is appointed via a secret process decided in meetings with no public agenda and no published minutes.<p>The closest I&#x27;ve ever seen to an explanation was one well known senior MEP&#x27;s claim that &quot;the next head of the EU must be a woman&quot;. Same thing as Kamala Harris. von der Leyen in turn then insisted that 50% of the Commissioners be women. Constitutionally, the head of the commission does not get to pick the commissioners, the countries do, but if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about the EU over the years it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a big fan of law as long as the law is convenient for its own goals. Given it writes those laws that&#x27;s usually pretty easy, but the moment the rules go against what it wants politically they are very suddenly ignored, often to a breathtaking scale.<p>Observe how von der Leyen blatantly lied about the contents of the redacted contract to the whole world. She was only caught because the Commission suck at PDF. It&#x27;s hard to imagine it&#x27;s the first time she has boldly lied like that.')
