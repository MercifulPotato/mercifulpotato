That thing should just be the beginning.<p>A keyboard has lots of space for ports. A huge number of ports. HDMIs, USBs, USB-C, headphones, sd cards, firewires, thunderbolts, displayports, network. A wide variety of ports. Why do I have to buy a separate USB hub?<p>Wired vs wireless doesn&#x27;t have to be a choice. Why doesn&#x27;t my keyboard have a rechargable battery inside of it? Why doesn&#x27;t that battery recharge while I am in &quot;wired&quot; mode for maximum reliability, but enable bluetooth when I am not wired?<p>Wait, why am I carrying an external battery pack for topping off my phone? Scratch the small battery. Bigger please.<p>If my keyboard is serving duty as a hub, why isn&#x27;t it a KVM that can be switched to any of 3-4 different computers? Even if video is expensive&#x2F;hard, why can&#x27;t the other ports be provided switchably between computers? Why can&#x27;t it at least do KM and wake up computers wirelessly via the USB plugs?<p>Why don&#x27;t virtually all of them have smartphone and tablet parking places, maybe even enable those devices to sync or even be another display?<p>And since we have all those ports, sure, let&#x27;s integrate a raspberry pi for a minimal computer.<p>We probably still have space. \nMicrophone? sure. \nWebcam? Ok. \nFlash storage so we don&#x27;t waste a port on a drive? Sure. \nTOTP fob? YES! a cheap LCD away, although probably not the best physical security.\nModular sections for arrow&#x2F;home keys and the numpad? OK!\nTrackpoint! It&#x27;s out of patent, right? Trackpoint me like the lenovo keyboard. Or trackball. Or both. Trackpad! gimme all three.<p>You know we can probably fit a network switch in?  Ok that might be overkill.<p>Can I get an lcd ribbon?<p>Why doesn&#x27;t the wrist rest give me wrist massages?<p>Why doesn&#x27;t it function as a universal remote?<p>Sim slot and wireless modem? Probably comes on the SOC.')
