Apple is this single entity that creates these products that run this unique OS alone, while Android manufacturers are a dime a dozen - too visible. If I don&#x27;t get the latest Samsung, I don&#x27;t mind because I&#x27;ll just go ahead and buy the latest OnePlus or Huawei or something. But I have nowhere to go if Apple stores run out of the iPhone, and if I&#x27;m really bought into the whole design oo-la-lah shtick, I&#x27;ll just camp outside the Apple store (aside: I have seen fewer campers with each passing year).<p>Ferrari is a luxury product because every engine made is a machining masterpiece largely created by hand. Most and Chandon is a luxury product because it takes a good year and tons of time to perfect that taste. Apple fans may have had something to boast about with the design quality during the Steve Jobs years, but right now, there&#x27;s little to boast about their mass-produced devices made by underpaid workers in a Chinese&#x2F;Vietnamese&#x2F;Indian factory, so they generate artificial oomph over things like the fonts or the app store or whatever. As a Tesla owner, I&#x27;ve seen the same kind of behavior from other Tesla owners, although I find Tesla to be a relatively flawed product compared to other cars such as a Porsche or an Audi.<p>Honestly, I suspect that if Jobs were alive right now, he wouldn&#x27;t be really happy with today&#x27;s Apple. Out of the nearly a decade since he&#x27;s passed, the only thing that was really revolutionary on Apple&#x27;s part were the Airbuds. And with Jony gone, I suspect there&#x27;s going to be less of that too.')
