But only one (East) Asian male + white female couple.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if the advent of things like BTS will alter dynamics, as quite a few non-Asian women seem to go crazy over K-pop boyband idols. Then again, I&#x27;m pretty sure if you&#x27;re ridiculously good looking, extremely fit, and hugely successful like a boyband idol singer, you&#x27;re likely to do well on the dating scene regardless of ethnicity.')
