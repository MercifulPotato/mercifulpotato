But it really is rather noticeable that the Biden story is being suppressed. Newspaper articles are being removed from twitter, journalists are resigning from their organisations. It is largely unclear that a similar story about speculation of a Trump-Ukraine story tied to Eric Trump would get this treatment. Years were spent on that Russia business that turned out to be largely baseless, and nobody was suppressing articles on Twitter for baseless speculation.<p>That level of bias is well worth highlighting. This is material information for voters in future elections (after 2020). I wouldn&#x27;t know about this story at all except for the backlash over the censorship being news. That is pretty impressive from an information-flow standpoint.')
