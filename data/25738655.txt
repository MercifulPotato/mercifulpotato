Seems like a pretty easy thing to stay clear of.<p>This is key advice that a lot of founders seem to forget. Capturing a capital is an extremely bold and risky action, which shouldn&#x27;t be attempted by anyone with fewer than 4 or 5 high-production cities of their own (some of which ideally also having an Encampment district to support training siege units faster). I encourage new players to focus on obtaining a scientific or cultural victory instead, as these are more straightforward for beginners.')
