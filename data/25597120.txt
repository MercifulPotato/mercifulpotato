I understand what you mean though (i.e. that the hiker is the delirious family member who doesn&#x27;t know they are in danger), and that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s a different and worthy analogy all the same.<p>But identifying what won&#x27;t work is only marginally better than doing nothing, because we&#x27;re still no closer to suggesting what will&#x2F;might work.')
