The issue is limited historic data is a very poor fit for future risks.<p>Looking at gold over the last say 2,000 years years shows a very bumpy ride with large long term negative returns. Stock data doesnâ€™t have anything close to that kind of history, but looking at various historic stock markets again shows a lot more variety than simply reviewing a winner like the US stock market.<p>Essentially, with bad enough assumptions or data any calculation is meaningless.')
