I proved that I was driving the car when the ticket was issued so the claims made by the metro officer about how they issued the ticket were not true.<p>My car was licensed at the time and the license was displayed correctly.  I was not guilty of the offense and the whatsapp messages allowed me to prove that the officer who issued the ticket was lying.')
