I have several friends and family who think this way, and are nearly offended at the suggestion that eg Trump making fun of Biden wearing a mask is innapropriate. My general view is i am less concerned with the origins and more concerned with our preparedness for the next outbreak. So while i am not one of those down voters you speak of, i do legitimately fear that if it does turn out to be lab made, the far right will win back ground and we wonâ€™t see any meaningful progress towards bolstering out defense against the inevitable next outbreak.')
