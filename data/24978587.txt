They probably aren&#x27;t ignoring the risk of data flowing back as much as noticing that the flow is obstructed and that it is the flow, rather than the foreign counties knowledge, that is the problem.<p>Using a local ISP means that domestic spies will easily hoover up traffic and have easy ways link it back to all sorts of data about you. Using a VPN means that first the VPN provider has to be compromised somehow, the data has to be aggregated into the pool of domestic data - not a trivial task.<p>It is a pretty simple improvement that puts more of a burden on data collection agencies.')
