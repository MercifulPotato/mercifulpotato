Telling yourself you&#x27;re useless, stupid, etc. eventually becomes self-fulfilling. So why not try to maintain a positive self-view?<p>That being said, what&#x27;s seems to have gone wrong is how to build self-esteem. It&#x27;s simply not a gift given to you by others, or even yourself. Instead, it&#x27;s something that is earned. It&#x27;s a muscle that when exercised develops depth and breadth over time. Put another way, you don&#x27;t develop self-esteem by avoiding adversity; or canceling anything remotely uncomfortable.<p>You build proper self-esteem by facing the darkness, not closing your eyes and pretending the lights are on. Self-esteem isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s said, it&#x27;s something you do. Like anything of value you have to put in the work, you have to put in the time. There are no shortcuts.')
