Their crypto tips feature added tip buttons on various websites (like Twitter). This is not ok. People would be hugely annoyed if Chrome started adding &quot;Tip with Google Pay&quot; under each tweet.<p>I get that they&#x27;re a company and need to make money. Their stance on privacy is awesome but I wish there was a better way to do this. I would pay for Brave+ with none of this bundled stuff and all of the privacy features.')
