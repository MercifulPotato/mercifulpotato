Or that our notion of what equality is evolves?<p>Both, to an extent. Avoiding problems in a large company is presumably a constant uphill struggle, and certainly society&#x27;s view on it does evolve (often quite rapidly; I personally went from strictly speaking being outlawed before 1993 to having employment protections in 2000 to being allowed to marry in 2015, for instance).<p>&gt; as it only requires that opportunity be similar<p>Even if you restrict it to that, it remains a huge problem for employers.
