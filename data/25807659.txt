Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=[25807746], score=None, time=1610852231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806182, text='&gt; Power train, electrical, doors, windows, brakes, lighting<p>The power train is <i>much</i> simpler in a sane EV design than what you need to get plausible performance&#x2F; efficiency out of ICE. Fewer, simpler parts means less to maintain or repair.<p>The braking of an EV can be (and usually is) regenerative which means instead of wearing out brakes you&#x27;re just running the motors backwards. You will still see some brake wear, but unless you&#x27;re a maniac it&#x27;s far less than before.<p>Lighting, as in the home, is going LED and thus you can choose to have it last more or less as long as you wish for increased capital outlay - unlike with incandescent you aren&#x27;t obliged to also give away efficiency if you want longer life, two 1W LEDs under-driven to 500mW can produce more light than a single 1W LED <i>and</i> enjoy increased lifespan, the downside is mainly the capital cost to buy the more expensive lamp. That&#x27;s a factor choosing &quot;light bulbs&quot; in the grocery store (or in a smaller store, a choice the store owner made for you) but hardly top of mind for a $20k+ new car.')
