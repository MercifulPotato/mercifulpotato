Item(by='Syzygies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611511856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890717, text='In the Pentagon &quot;War Room&quot; scene, the walls are lined with backlit code transparencies, and Nash infers they&#x27;re lattitudes and longitudes. The Art department was creating one slide at a time in Adobe Illustrator, and people can&#x27;t pick random digits, so I wrote a C program to generate all the slides, that Art could control for creative effect. As the scene drew near, I was asked to pick locations along the US&#x2F;Canada border, such as Starkey Corners, Maine. Russell, fearing we were making these names up, challenged Akiva to prove they existed. Luckily I had a Maine atlas in my car.<p>Art made an error entering a longitude by hand. It moved the spot 200 yards, so instead of pointing this out I updated the script (mistake #1). Day of filming, Art tells me they caught the mistake, and had overnighted a corrected slide just in time. The &quot;wrong&quot; slide matching the script in Russell&#x27;s trailer was two hours away. There was no question in Akiva&#x27;s mind that we should get it. We sent a driver.<p>Now, I knew Ron Howard would be asking me which slides were which, when we filmed the crucial scene. I asked Art so I could move slides as needed, and was told the head of Art had spent all day positioning them. I innocently found the head of Art to ask him to relay his permission.<p>Oops. In front of dozens of crew he eviscerated me, telling me I was assuming too great a role, I was just a consultant, I should learn my place. (My role had indeed expanded. There&#x27;s too much to do on a film.)<p>After we each had a word with Akiva, I discovered that the soon-arriving &quot;wrong&quot; slide was already in perfect position for filming. I had needlessly prevailed in a confrontation I could have avoided (mistake #2).<p>During preproduction I had offered to Russell that if he ever wanted to use me in a joke, I was game. Russell had missed the festivities so far. Rehearsing at a map table, he feigned not knowing where one of the locations was. The room froze for what seemed an eternity; he didn&#x27;t mind. I snuck up silently to point on the map. He bellowed &quot;Fuck off! I&#x27;m acting!&quot; and turned to match my grin.<p>No one laughed. Anyone surprised I hadn&#x27;t already quit that day was sure I&#x27;d quit now. Russell had no idea. He came to me later, wondering why no one laughed, he thought that was funny. I told him, &quot;I thought it was funny. Who cares what anyone else thinks!&quot;<p>We then spent half a day filming in front of the now-arrived &quot;wrong&quot; transparency matching the script in Russell&#x27;s trailer. It turned out that Russell had memorized the coordinates (I hadn&#x27;t). Yikes.<p>Akiva and I gave each other a silent hi-five look over this. Right call, getting a driver. This could have gone badly. So many decisions on a film set are a game of chance.<p>I even patched things up with the head of Art. The cinematographer Roger Deakins discovered that if he pulled down the slides the wall made a great backlight. The crew could only restore the original slide pattern because I&#x27;d made a chart. There was a strong pattern to the slide colors; this would otherwise have lead to continuity gaffes that many viewers would have noticed. So it appeared at first that I was the heathen about to destroy this artwork, when I was the person in the room who saved it.')
