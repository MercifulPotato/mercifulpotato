One thing to watch out with Linux on HP laptops with AMD currently are problems with standby mode. They lack S3 deep sleep power state - only provide S2Idle so called Modern Standby. Although there are ways to mod ACPI tables there is still some black screen issue when the return from suspend happens - search stories on Reddit. I hope constantly improved Linux kernel will bring some workarounds and HP will do more Linux testing too on their quite decent HW specs.<p>I finally decided to go with proven option and ordered Lenovo T14 with 48GB RAM. It works flawlessly with Linux 5.8 because Lenovo added &quot;legacy&quot; S3 power state mode toggle in BIOS setup specially for non-Windows OSes.')
