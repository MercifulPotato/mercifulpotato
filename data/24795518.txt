Breaking down enormous problems. Deep collaborative work.<p>Can you do this in a virtual room? Yes. Will you achieve the same outcome? Early results (in my case) seem to indicate the answer is &quot;no&quot;.<p>I want the ability to pace around the room at times. Look my collaborators in the eye. Pick up on non-verbal cues that are often impossible to see remotely. Step away as a group to share a much needed lunch break.<p>And when passionate people are involved, and many viewpoints are present, the ability to all argue&#x2F;debate a topic vigorously - even show frustration at the right moments - and then all share a beer at the end of the day, is critical. Having that same vigorous debate on Zoom and then dropping off to our individual lives doesn&#x27;t leave room for reconnecting with each other as <i>humans</i> - something that is critical for maintaining relationships.<p>Not every project requires this kind of interaction. But for things that do, the remote format just doesn&#x27;t work well for everyone.')
