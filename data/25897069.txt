Pay $1, get it back if the recipient clears you up.<p>- Want to make a comment for the first time on someone else&#x27;s thread? Poster decides the minimum amount to leave as scrow. Really good comments could even collect some of the money from spammers&#x2F;hostile ones.<p>- Want to report someone because you don&#x27;t like them or their views? Put $10 in scrow for the moderators. If accepted, you get the money back. If there is no grounds for the report, the reported person gets to choose which charity to donate the money and the next report from you will cost double.')
