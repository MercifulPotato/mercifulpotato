For me, I prefer it for two reasons:<p>1. Distractionless editing - not fiddling with formatting or things like that is quite nice. Especially since I work with markdown and LaTeX, it is easy to convert over to a word file once I get the draft of the version done thanks to pandoc. From there, then I can really worry about the formatting - if I need to as pandoc is great!<p>2. I like the speed and lightness of a text editor for writing. Don&#x27;t have to wait for boot, can easily grep and replace, and jump to where I need to go.')
