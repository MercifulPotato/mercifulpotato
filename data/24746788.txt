The point of cookieless domains is that you can use a very simple web server to serve content (no need to handle user sessions, files are pre-compresses and cached, etc.) and it lowers incoming bandwidth a lot. If you have a lot of requests (images, css, js) the cookie information adds up quickly.<p>Opening video thumbnails from ytimg.com will still be cached for youtube.com as before. The only thing that will change is for embedded videos on 3rd party websites as those won&#x27;t be able to use caches ytimg.com thumbails from elsewhere.')
