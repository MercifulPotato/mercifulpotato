You provide code in a dynamic library format and the normal dynamic linker links the necessary calls (e.g. malloc) at runtime, exactly as a wasm would provide that environment (via WASI or whatever). Since those calls are all only implemented in terms of write,read,exit,and sigreturn you are guaranteed a high level of security.<p>Wasm is no different in this regard. You don’t get libc for free with wasm. The only thing you get with a wasm format is memory bounds checking but again that isn’t necessary in the seccomp model.')
