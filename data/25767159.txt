It does asks for contact access permission, to show in the app the names that <i>you</i> have set for your contacts.  But you can just answer no and everything works.<p>On the contrary, if you answer the same to WhatsApp, it plain refuses to work.  But it actually created an account on their servers, and from that on you appear on your contacts who do use WhatsApp as another user of WhatsApp, which invites them to write to you there although you cannot receive their messages.  To fix this, you have to find the option in WhatsApp to delete your account.<p>Tally:<p>Signal 1 \nWhatsApp 0')
