It is also a generationally-unique case and far from any kind of norm.<p>Detentions of journalists in the context of protests etc needs to be carefully monitored but also has legitimate safety impacts in some cases. The trend in the US was not good this year, but it was an unusual year in multiple ways and the trend was not that bad either. The part that matters more is that very few are being tried for anything. A short detention is not &quot;jailing journalists&quot; in the traditional dictatorial sense.')
