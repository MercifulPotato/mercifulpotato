Being involved in a customer service software Saas, I learned that for most companies, 80%+ of the interactions&#x2F;transactions with customers are positive. But as you say, most people wonâ€™t leave a review - unless you ask them and make it easy for them to leave it. It also helps if you ask them to review a specific person (so they feel like they are helping someone).<p>What Google Play has done is not the right way to fix the ratio of positive to negative reviews, especially given the issue at hand. It also should be RH the one fixing its own reviews by addressing the problem with its user base.')
