Item(by='satysin', descendants=None, kids=[25214666, 25215930, 25216040, 25213880, 25213695], score=None, time=1606333848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211414, text='Installed to tryout it out. I dislike it <i>requires</i> yet another user account just to try it out[1][2].<p>Overall it is pretty simple to use with a decent UI and worked fine for my quick test of a Signal desktop app video call by selecting the mmhmm virtual camera in Signal.<p>It did not work in FaceTime as there is no way to change the camera from the built in one (however I was able to change the audio source to mmhmm audio fwiw). Not sure if this is a FaceTime limitation or mmhmm?<p>For £20 I would probably buy it but £10 a <i>month</i> (or £100 a year)?! No. Sorry.<p>I fail to see why this type of application needs to be a subscription service and a rather expensive one at that. Unless I am missing something it doesn&#x27;t rely on a backend service the mmhmm developers would need to maintain and outside of adding new features it isn&#x27;t likely the OS APIs used to access the camera will change much, if at all, on a desktop OS these days so on going development costs to the core camera functionality already present is likely to be minimal.<p>A nice product but not worth an indefinite £10 a month to me personally.<p>[1] Also there does not appear to be a delete account option anywhere on the website. I hate this when forced to sign up just to <i>try</i> the software. I have emailed using the address on their website to request deletion but it should be a clear option on the account management page.<p>[2] Also accepting an 8 character minimum (requiring upper, lower and special character) password while rejecting a 4 word (27 character) passphrase is laughable.')
