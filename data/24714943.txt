Nobody, China, West or anywhere else really has something approaching authentic freedom.<p>Over here we can argue we have freedom, but the freedom we have in our choices is like going to Westworld (relevant Bruno Macaes piece[1] from yesterday). We are encouraged to go backpack to Australia, participate in a protest, and then we are supposed to &#x27;grow up&#x27;, get a family, and so on. There&#x27;s no point in that process in which you actually do something that amounts to more than simulating freedom, there&#x27;s no point where you actually might get hurt.<p>In that sense if anything a lot of cultures like in China are just more honest, they tell you to sit your ass down and do rote memorization for 10 hours, whereas we get a ping pong table in the office and free smoothies and Disneyland, there&#x27;s really no difference at the end of the day.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tabletmag.com&#x2F;sections&#x2F;history&#x2F;articles&#x2F;what-comes-after-liberalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tabletmag.com&#x2F;sections&#x2F;history&#x2F;articles&#x2F;what-com...</a>')
