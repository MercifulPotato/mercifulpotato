After I moved to a new place (in South Bay), I found that many of my neighbors had some kind of video doorbell installed, usually Nest but sometimes also Ring. Initially I was quite horrified by the fact that when I&#x27;m taking a stroll around the neighborhood I would be captured by all these cameras. And if I&#x27;m having a conversation while walking it&#x27;s quite easy for the neighbors to overhear. This all changed when I decided to install Nest Hello myself. You get this inexplicable satisfaction from having a camera that watches passers-by and knowing they aren&#x27;t messing with your property (even though statistically you probably know they won&#x27;t). It really taps into that part of human nature.')
