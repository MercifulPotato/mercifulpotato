BLM is responding to the very recent history of murder, oppression, and disenfranchisement by the police and government.  It was captured repeatedly on brutal video this very year.  And that&#x27;s not even going back decades to the true horrors of history.<p>Whatever delusional &quot;wrongs&quot; the Right feels they&#x27;ve suffered from the government doesn&#x27;t come close to comparing to that.  In a true Godwin&#x27;s Law type fashion, even attempting a comparison might be enough to end the argument.')
