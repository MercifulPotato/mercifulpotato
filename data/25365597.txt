I don&#x27;t know were you got that from. If they are effective or not is also a matter of debate, the specific action mechanisms are not well understood even in simple models like mice, and all the evidence in humans in anecdotal.<p>They are only recommended and it&#x27;s usually preloading and not postloading.<p>The most common side effect on people with ASD is anxiety and difficulty concentrating, and on people with PTSD it&#x27;s anxiety or depression. They happen in around 50% to 25% of the population and they also happen on people taking placebo. Here we are talking about people _with an actual serious mental condition_ that is leading to chronic social anxiety or dissociative episodes even when not under the influence of any drug.<p>That&#x27;s all data from MAPS sponsored published research studies. I&#x27;m not sure where you got the idea that supplements are mandatory to prevent a really large comedown period, but I think you might have confused yourself from reading too much anecdotal data, or you have been lied to.<p>Data gathered from surveys on recreational users point out that depression happens only in something like 10% to 15% of the population but it&#x27;s tricky to get conclusions from self reported studies.')
