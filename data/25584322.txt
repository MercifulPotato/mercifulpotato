Item(by='jlglover', descendants=None, kids=[25585092], score=None, time=1609352327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584033, text='Property tax is bundled into our mortgage payment, so even after considering the 1 % maintenance, our large house and yard worked out cheaper per month than our small rental condo and balcony. Unfortunately, we just had to replace our roof in Sept, but it only cost $6k (despite multiple quotes in the $15k range).<p>I will acknowledge that owning a house is sometimes like having an extra part time job. I&#x27;m forever fixing little things or gardening or changing things about the house. I consider this to be a new hobby, but if you consider it work then that&#x27;s something else to consider.<p>edit: I put our loan details into the NYT calculator and it said &quot;If you can rent a similar home for less than... $1,618 PER MONTH... then renting is better.&quot; That might get you a 1 bedroom condo around here, instead of a 4 bedroom house with a yard like we got.')
