Perhaps making more micro apartments. There&#x27;s probably a large marker for people that would still keep their suburban home, but if they could afford it would get an apartment to stay in for fun over some weekends, or overnight during the workweek. Living in the Suburbs has many benefits. Larger homes, backyards and is safer for kids to run around. All valid reasons to chose them. Lets not try and change people, but work with their preferences.')
