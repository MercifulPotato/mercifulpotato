He constantly delegitimized them, do you think they wouldn’t strike back and pour as much mud as they could on him?<p>I actually liked a good deal of his policies and some I found ridiculous and others awful.<p>But how you speak matters. He set himself up to be mocked and ridiculed. He picked fights as much or more as they came to him.<p>I get it - he was “playing to his base”. But I don’t think he was. In fact I think it got to a point his base controlled him. He just couldn’t help being repulsive to a lot of people, media or not.<p>It’s sad too because he could have been great. He was independent and free from obligations to either party. But he couldn&#x27;t get out of his own way. He couldn’t act “presidential”.<p>He should have picked his battles better instead of making everything into one. It gets tiring.<p>And that is why he lost.')
