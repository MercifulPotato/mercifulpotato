Anything can be interpreted as a computational process.<p>This is completely wrong. The opposite is true: computation is a mechanical process, it does not depend on an observer giving it meaning. It&#x27;s true that the same mechanical process can be interpreted as different computations, but they will have the exact same computational properties (e.g. complexity), only the result will be interpreted differently.<p>In particular, it is extremely unlikely that the wall is implementing Word Star, because WordStar is a highly structured computation. The wall MIGHT be implementing some very simple additions, and essentially any process is implementing any one step computation.')
