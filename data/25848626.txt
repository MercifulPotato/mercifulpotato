I know the dangers of a day 0 exploit. I also know the dangers of an x.0 release of software.<p>Security is often in tension with convenience&#x2F;usability (as in this case).<p>Concretely: I don&#x27;t update to the latest MacOS day of release. I do update after a few weeks of &quot;no significant issues reported&quot; (or I&#x27;ll update manually faster if I learn of a serious exploit). I still haven&#x27;t updated to BigSur as some of the software that I rely on doesn&#x27;t work on BigSur yet, so I&#x27;m on the latest patch of Catalina.')
