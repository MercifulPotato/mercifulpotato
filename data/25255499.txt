Item(by='Rochus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606753747, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255227, text='&gt; <i>What are the immediate real-world applications of this?</i><p>A protein is actually a linear sequence of amino acids, but in a cell this sequence has a three-dimensional arrangement like a clew of thread. The arrangement is not random, but dependent on the specific composition of the sequence (i.e. selection and order of amino acids) and some other factors. To understand the function of a protein, we need to know this three-dimensional arrangement (i.e. structure). Up to now the structure determination process was mostly manual, complex, time-consuming (several months up to more than a year) and error prone. If structure determination by DNN is reliable, this is a big win for life science. There are still a lot of problems open: e.g. the structure is not constant over time but there are &quot;moving parts&quot; in the structure which are important for its function.')
