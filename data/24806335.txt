I sure hope it&#x27;s not allowed, I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to pay income tax for every state in which I have a client that I earn money from.<p>&quot;Massachusetts previously allowed out-of-state residents who worked for Massachusetts-based entities to deduct whatever portion of their income was derived while working from home. In practice, this meant a worker who commuted four days a week but worked from home one day a week could reduce their taxable income by 20 percent.&quot;<p>So MA knew what was justifiable, and is now not doing it.<p>Based on this reading if I take my MA incorporated LLC and move to another state I&#x27;m still supposed to pay a chunk of income tax to MA? I guess for me it&#x27;s easy enough to reincorporate in a new state or country, but it&#x27;s clearly ridiculous to try to grab taxes out of what I&#x27;m already paying the place I actually live and the state I actually do work from.')
