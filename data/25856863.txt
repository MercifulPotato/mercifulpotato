To me &quot;tree shaking&quot; was implicitly talking about the dependency tree and removing unused library dependencies. While &quot;dead code elimination&quot; would be a &quot;deep&quot; clean done by a linker when making a static binary (mostly C&#x2F;C++ land..). There you&#x27;re looking at a finer granularity than libraries&#x2F;compilation-units. That&#x27;s necessarily a bit trickier and I wasn&#x27;t even thinking that far.
