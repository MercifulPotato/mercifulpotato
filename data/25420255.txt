Item(by='bonoboTP', descendants=None, kids=[25420666], score=None, time=1607966769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419520, text='This is a bit of a bait and switch or motte and bailey.<p>Now you&#x27;re arguing that people should do philosophy.<p>The original argument was that we need philosophers, as in we need to take professionally trained philosophy graduates more seriously and bring them into the software industry so they can help us make better software.<p>The first is probably useful, everyone benefits from a broad range of knowledge and activity. Including sport, novels, humanities, philosophy, natural sciences, computer science, people management and psychology, etc. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean we need graduates of all these fields in the software shop.<p>I suspect part of this push comes from a certain resentment from philosophy majors that their expertise is not valued much and they can&#x27;t find jobs.<p>But for all but the richest places like Google, it is totally ridiculous that a software company could employ philosophers and pay their salaries for coming up with publishable articles according to the academic standards they learned at university.<p>Most software places are already annoyed how unpractical and far removed from the ground the CS graduates are compared to day to day practice. Them <i>hiring philosophers</i> is completely out of the question.<p>When I read philosophers takes on AI for example (eg Precht&#x27;s new book), it&#x27;s painful. It&#x27;s as if their philosophy is still stuck at decades ago. They are asking the wrong questions, answer them clumsily, not using mathematical tools right or misunderstanding them, taking simple and well-understood things to be profound new insights and thinking that something is simple when it&#x27;s actually really hard.<p>Philosophers (as in these actual real-life current humans) tend to invent problems for themselves completely orthogonal to what would actually be interesting and complex to investigate, probably out of fear that they are not technically adept&#x2F;trained enough to engage with the details.<p>There&#x27;s a component of tech-envy here that makes this type of discussion quite heated and tribal.')
