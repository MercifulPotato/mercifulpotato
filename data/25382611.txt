As a simple example, if you are in a wheelchair, you should have (by law) access to bathrooms and any other facility you&#x27;d expect to have access to at work.<p>The thing is though, a wheelchair is a very easy example - it&#x27;s obvious and it&#x27;s understandable how acommodation can help.  But when it&#x27;s an invisible thing, like a cognitive issue, or hearing loss or chronic pain, it&#x27;s a lot harder to address.  It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;we will put in a ramp for you&quot; for someone in a wheelchair.  Not so much for the more &quot;abstract&quot; disabilities that aren&#x27;t visible.')
