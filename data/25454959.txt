I guess they named it that way because cockroaches are believed to survived since the dinosaurs. I guess be the same if you named it BedBugDB, they are hard to get rid for some people too.<p>But I think some just dismiss it based on the name. I think if I was going to build a startup, it&#x27;d be on the top of the list for database choices only thing I really wish it had was Full Text Search and CIText but I guess those will be added some day. I think it&#x27;s a neat piece of engineering though so far!')
