The 2d canvas of Chrome at least render to a texture layer only by appending commands to a display list that is only executed on the final stage (merged with all other commands) on the final stage in the gpu process.<p>So it is as fast as it can get.. for instance its basically the same for the Chrome painted by C++ and you actually have to use canvas primitives to paint widgets.<p>Once (if) WASM have access to something like this, it will be a canvas, the same one you have bindings for javascript.<p>So i would not call it a hack, as you basically have raw access to paint primitives that are very optimized.')
