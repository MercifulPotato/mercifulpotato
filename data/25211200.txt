As you say this can only truly be used by people you understand regular expressions; and they would most likely prefer not to use this stuff.<p>There&#x27;s a niche where this might be useful, but by definition it&#x27;s small. I understand regexes a moderate amount, and can construct arbitrarily complex ones when necessary.  But I do it just infrequently enough that it can be painful and halting above a certain level of complexity, with lots of testing and reference-checking. It&#x27;d be nice to use something sane like this, and I think I fall squarely into the category of &quot;people who understand regexes but would prefer to use stuff like this&quot;. Though as I said, this niche is almost by definition small, and on top of that I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used Java.<p>Completely independently, in any non-trivial engineering system, readability is important, and this helps a lot there.')
