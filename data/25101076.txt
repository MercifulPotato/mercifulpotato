For instance, there is nothing improper about an improper fraction.  This is just idiotic nomenclature.  It&#x27;s not racist.  It&#x27;s not traditional.  It&#x27;s just stupid.  Same thing with &quot;numerator&quot; and &quot;denominator&quot; ... or &quot;co-efficient&quot;.  All ridiculous, idiotic names for simple, basic concepts.  And the unimaginative math teachers who apparently cannot speak simple english or consult a dictionary just parrot away what they learned and robotically drill dozing students with this kind of preposterous terminology nonsense. Widespread numerosity will never improve until mathmaticians create new, appropriate, accessible terminology for all the delicate abstractions of mathmatics. Failure to address and change this underlying problem has caused great disparity in scientific understanding. Scientists and educators have no one to blame but themselves for this situation and its consequences, especially in America.')
