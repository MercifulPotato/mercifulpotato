Pretty much all of the books I&#x27;ve seen look no different than your average blog post, and not interesting or good ones at that. The only book I saw that I thought might actually be worth any time is &quot;The Case of IBM 386 PC: A Detective Story for Techies.&quot;<p>&quot;Indy books&quot; should be about indie subjects. Topics that have little public information on them, but that can be interesting, valuable, or in some way beneficial. Yet all I see are books that hold the equivalent of 2010&#x27;s Buzzfeed titles. Indie books could even be from indie authors, in the regard of creative writing (as my example above). But listing books on how to do something that&#x27;s been discussed, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m exaggerating here, millions of times, doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;re &quot;helping developers find indie books.&quot;<p>I like the concept, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the execution.
