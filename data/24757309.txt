If they&#x27;re instead designed to impale people who force it open that&#x27;s going to be illegal in most places even if trespassing is also a criminal offence there. Not least because the law may authorise people to force that garage open, and it doesn&#x27;t want authorised people getting hurt, regardless of how you feel about that.')
