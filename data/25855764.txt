You can take matter out of a local system and make that local system less massive, but it’s not a violation of physics because the broader system maintains a steady state.<p>So isn’t the simple layman’s answer that the “system” also spans the 4th dimension and you are just displacing mass around in a 4D space instead of the typical 3D space?')
