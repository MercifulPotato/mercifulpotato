But the model that correctly predicts all those observations does not have &quot;neutrons&quot; that are countable with integers everywhere and at all times between observations.<p><i>&gt; including explaining why particles come in countable units.</i><p>What <i>observations</i> of particles are you claiming that QM (which includes quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics) cannot explain? I&#x27;m not aware of any.<p><i>&gt; many people think that QM predicts that EM waves come in &quot;countable&quot; units called photons.</i><p>No, many people think that when you <i>observe</i> faint EM fields, those <i>observations</i> come in discrete units. When you shine very faint light through a two-slit apparatus onto a screen, you see individual dots on the screen as individual photons hit. The interference pattern that the wave model predicts only shows up over time in the pattern of the dots. Each individual photon observation <i>is</i> discrete. And that&#x27;s what QM predicts. But QM does <i>not</i> say that there are <i>always</i> countable little photons everywhere and at all times between observations.')
