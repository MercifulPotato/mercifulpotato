Maybe VC with the intent to sell all ownership to the first person that offers them a 20% ROI...<p>Netflix wants to bring in NEW customers... Existing customers are unlikely to unsubscribe, but getting new customers is hard at this point.<p>Best way to get new customers is to throw new shows at people, lots of them, get them hooked. If people join, again, unlikely to leave -- they will find other cool things to watch.<p>For Netflix, the value if a new hot show is way higher than season 4 of a very hot show... Nothing short of GOT (mid seasons) would be good enough to make it to season 5-6...
