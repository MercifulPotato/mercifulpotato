However, many doctors and researchers believe there is no mechanism for that and that it isn&#x27;t really gluten at all, but something else.<p>We have found that it isn&#x27;t so much the quantity of gluten, but the quality of the product. For example, a piece of cheap, white bread has bad effects, but a piece of whole grain, organic bread or sourdough is usually fine. This could be fodmaps, but we have tried cutting those without much effect.<p>Right now, our working theory is contaminants and mimic weeds that make their way into wheat and other cheaper products where as the supply is a bit more controlled in the higher end and organic products. But we are still mostly befuddled.')
