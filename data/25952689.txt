Your attention needs to be on the screen at all times in order to wait for the UI and aim the mouse.<p>Next time you go to your bank web site to pay a bill, think to yourself: Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if, rather than navigating their cumbersome UX, you could just hit a known string of keystrokes that you memorized, hit enter, then walk away to get coffee while all the Javascript and page reloading chugged along and paid your bill?')
