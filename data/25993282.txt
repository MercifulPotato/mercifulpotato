It&#x27;s the same with all medications, that&#x27;s why I pay doctors to prescribe medication and monitor my health while taking it. I already have physicals every six months because of another condition. With the Adderall, I get blood pressure taken monthly and an EKG every three months.<p>The goal of almost any medication is to create a stop gap to create or find non-medication solutions. Without Adderall, I can&#x27;t focus on creating systems and tools to help me stay on track.<p>Demonizing Adderall isn&#x27;t helping anyone. No one should be afraid of taking a medication that will change their life for the better. If someone goes through normal channels and gets properly prescribed it, they should be treated no different than any other ailment.')
