They&#x27;ve no doubt invested a lot of time and money into this; there&#x27;s no way, now that they&#x27;ve jettisoned Intel, they haven&#x27;t gamed this entire thing out. There&#x27;s too much riding on this.<p>Yes, Apple&#x27;s entry level laptops smoke much more expensive Intel-based laptops. But wait until the replacements for the 16-inch MacBook Pro and the iMac and iMac Pros are released.<p>By then, the geek world would have gone through all phases of griefâ€”we seem deep into <i>denial</i> right now, with some <i>anger</i> creeping in.')
