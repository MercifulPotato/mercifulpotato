Yes, because the law says they are. Does that matter? Not much outside the realm of law.<p>I don&#x27;t think hacking&#x2F;cracking should be illegal. If I send you a series of electrical pulses and that causes your systems to do something stupid, that&#x27;s your problem. You are not a &quot;victim&quot;.<p>Laws against physical violence and against stealing physical objects have good reasons to exist, because otherwise there would be no point in having any moral conception at all, because everyone would solve their problems through violence.<p>On the other hand, sending messages through a wire doesn&#x27;t have good reasons to be outlawed. We could live peacefully sending each other all sorts of bytes, and each entity would make an effort for their own systems to behave correctly.<p>Most people disagree with me, but their abstraction is leaking, because even they agree with me on a fundamental level, they just don&#x27;t know it. The moral discussion is so disconnected from concrete actions and formal definitions that it devolves into dumb analogies like &quot;but if you left your door open blah blah&quot;.<p>Having a &quot;right not to be hacked&quot; is of the same nature as having a &quot;right not to be offended&quot;.')
