I found that I was coding almost exclusively in a functional style, in Ruby (because it was easier code to test and it seemed to produce less bugs&#x2F;fewer mental-model problems), then realized I was still missing out on the <i>guarantees</i> that Elixir gives you, then I thought, what&#x27;s the point in staying when I could get guarantees that eliminated entire classes of bugs <i>for free</i>?<p>Having done Elixir for a few years now, I RARELY have to go into &quot;debugging mode&quot;, I&#x27;ve never even had to fire up Elixir&#x27;s version of &quot;pry&quot;, and my tests have caught all but a few bugs. All my logic lives in sensible locations. It&#x27;s pretty nice! At least for web dev.')
