This subthread isn&#x27;t about the claims of the study — it&#x27;s about epistemiology :) To be clear, I wasn&#x27;t proposing an alternative <i>potential fact</i> for you to <i>evaluate the truth of</i>. Ignore the textual content of my hypothesis; it&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>What I was trying to do, was to propose a <i>question that needs an experiment to answer</i> (a hypothesis); and to <i>use</i> that question to make clear that the implicit thought people jump to thinking when reading a headline like this is <i>also</i> &quot;a question that needs an experiment to answer&quot; (a hypothesis.)<p>The point of differentiating the two, is that hypotheses, by themselves, do not <i>convey information about the world</i>. You should not perform a Bayesian update based solely on the fact that you generated a plausible-sounding hypothesis. A hypothesis is a question, not an answer.<p>Certain facts about the world are contingent on a given hypothesis proving out. By <i>privileging</i> a hypothesis — thinking about it and no other — you may implicitly raise your expectations of <i>those contingent facts</i> being true. And that can lead you astray. Those facts haven&#x27;t <i>earned</i> a place in your mental model of the world. They&#x27;re not paying rent. They&#x27;re freeloaders. And it&#x27;s potentially <i>dangerously</i> false to allow yourself to believe them.<p>The point of generating other hypotheses isn&#x27;t to find one that could be <i>more</i> true. It&#x27;s to scrub those contingent-fact of a privileged hypothesis from your brain, by throwing <i>other</i> contingent worlds at it — hopefully <i>many</i> such contingent worlds — until your brain just gives up and avoids absorbing <i>any</i> of those contingent facts, treating them all as they should be treated: as mental noise, unworthy of more than a moment&#x27;s consideration.')
