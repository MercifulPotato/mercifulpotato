In fact, please ignore the textual content of my hypothesis–it&#x27;s entirely irrelevant. I was just trying to take this opportunity to talk about a technique for good epistemological hygiene.<p>What I was trying to do, was:<p>1. to propose a <i>question that needs an experiment to answer</i> (a hypothesis); and to <i>use</i> that question to make clear that the implicit thought people jump to thinking when reading a headline like this is <i>also</i> &quot;a question that needs an experiment to answer&quot; (a hypothesis.)<p>2. to propose that when <i>you</i> encounter a headline like this, <i>you</i> should do the same — generate alternative hypotheses, in order to remind <i>yourself</i> that the first interpretation you jumped to of the study&#x27;s correlation was <i>also</i> just <i>a question</i>.<p>The point of differentiating the two, is that hypotheses, by themselves, do not <i>convey information about the world</i>. You should not update your mental model of the world based solely on the fact that you generated a plausible-sounding hypothesis. A hypothesis is a question, not an answer.<p>Certain facts about the world are contingent on a given hypothesis proving out. By <i>privileging</i> a hypothesis — thinking about it and no other — you may implicitly raise your expectations of <i>those contingent facts</i> being true. And that can lead you astray. Those facts haven&#x27;t <i>earned</i> a place in your mental model of the world. They&#x27;re not paying rent. They&#x27;re freeloaders. And it&#x27;s potentially <i>dangerously</i> false to allow yourself to believe them.<p>The point of generating other hypotheses isn&#x27;t to find one that could be <i>more</i> true. It&#x27;s to scrub those contingent-facts of your intuitively-privileged hypothesis from your mind, by throwing <i>other</i> contingent worlds at it — hopefully <i>many</i> such contingent worlds — until your brain just gives up and avoids absorbing <i>any</i> of those contingent facts, treating them all as they should be treated: as mental noise, unworthy of more than a moment&#x27;s consideration.<p>Or, to put that another way:<p>When there&#x27;s evidence in favor of two things being somehow connected, but nothing has been proven about <i>the way</i> in which they&#x27;re connected, the only rational thing to believe about that connection... is nothing. :)')
