Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25425342], score=None, time=1607991307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424760, text='edit: expected downvotes of course; nobody dares to engage on this particular discussion about the vast sums the Europeans must be made to pay for their evil deeds (which they&#x27;ve skirted for hundreds of years now, like cowards)<p>&gt; Next we need to figure out who profited the most from slaves and where that money is today.<p>The most? The Europeans. Where is the money? It&#x27;s in London and Amsterdam among a few other former empires.<p>The Europeans transported around 12.5 millions slaves to the Americas. They owe so much in reparations it will bankrupt half the nations in Western Europe.<p>It&#x27;s very interesting how the Europeans - who were responsible for African slavery in the Americas - never want to talk about it and how nobody in the US ever asks any questions about how much the Europeans are going to pay.<p>The Europeans transported close to five million slaves to Brazil, nearly ten times as many slaves as were transported to the territory that became the US. One can imagine the reparations tally just for that alone to be in the tens of trillions of dollars.<p>Britain and the Netherlands should just go ahead and write a check equal to 10% of their entire national wealth to African-Americans. That might get things started on the path to justice. All of the assets of the British throne should be liquidated as part of the process and put into the reparations pot.')
