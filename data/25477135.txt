If the plane can&#x27;t be brought up to snuff without you fudging the test results then you can the thing. There is no other way.<p>Because if you don&#x27;t can it what&#x27;s going to happen? More crashes. The subsequent investigations will reveal that there is still a problem with the plane. Investigators will follow the trail back to the certification, and then you&#x27;ll find yourselves in a whole heap of trouble.<p>Oh, and Boeing will go under. Where&#x27;s your shareholder value then?<p>Of all the short-sighted, obtuse, shady, unethical, blithering idiocy we have all witnessed in various quarters in 2020 this ranks amongst the worst.<p>I honestly no longer care what the certification status of the 737 Max is. There is such a cloud of untrustworthiness around the plane, its systems and its certifications that there is no way I will ever risk flying on one.<p>Boeing have done some amazing things in the past. The 747, for example, was for its time an extraordinary aircraft and is still without doubt the most iconic passenger airliner even today. The Boeing museum near Seattle is incredible, and I highly recommend it. In more recent years it&#x27;s clear that they&#x27;ve lost their way, but I hope that they are able to get back on track, and back to building more amazing aircraft. It&#x27;s time to let the 737 Max die though.')
