Item(by='westwing', descendants=None, kids=[25187010], score=None, time=1606138151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186314, text='&gt; This study says live virus has only been confirmed to be seen for at most 9 days. However, (presumably inactive) virus particles can be shed for months afterwards and can show up as PCR positive.<p>The paper cites 34 replication cycles as the lower bound to obtain viable viral cultures. Whether a PCR test is reported as &quot;positive&quot; depends on the chosen replication cycle threshold (Ct value). As far as I&#x27;m aware, this &quot;magic number&quot; is usually chosen to be 35.<p>Beyond that, it is possible to do more cycles to demonstrate the existence of trace amounts of PCR fragments, but such a test would not be considered &quot;PCR positive&quot;.')
