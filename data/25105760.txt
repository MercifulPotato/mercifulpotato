Others talk about how he &quot;[learnt] a valuable lesson&quot; or act like he is only a few more failures away from a successful startup. It&#x27;s condescending and misguided.<p>I think he&#x27;s the only one giving worthwhile advice here. You&#x27;re very unlikely to succeed at bootstrapping a startup and people often don&#x27;t realise this or act like through perseverance they will definitely succeed. He&#x27;s lucky to have realised that he had other things in his life he cared about more after only a year.<p>Many people want a family or want to buy a house. Others want to enjoy their 20s (or 30s for that matter). Others want to put money into investments or a pension for their old age. You could sacrifice all of these things chasing a startup dream and end up with nothing. There is a high likelihood of this. Unless you believe you&#x27;ve very different odds or a much lower cost (e.g. an investor) you probably shouldn&#x27;t do it.')
