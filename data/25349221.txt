Here you have a company with scandal after scandal regarding their bad long term durability - batteries being neutered, keyboards with keys that break, laptop displays that disconnect, unibodies that aren&#x27;t unibodies, laptop coolers that don&#x27;t cool -, embarassingly bad repairability and expandability across their product range, and that has one of the worst warranty programs of all of them. And for one inexplicable reason (stockholm syndrom? No experience with other products? Status thinking as the sole decider on what is good?) people still claim that stuff. That&#x27;s also where the cult classification is coming from.')
