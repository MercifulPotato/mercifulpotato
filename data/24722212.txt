And in larger companies, you have enough labor to manage monorepo tooling.<p>&gt;  Using multiple repos, one per shared product (library, SDK, web site, documentation package) is harder to manage because you need to manage your dependencies much better and pull in the correct versions for the current product.<p>This is the pointless busy work I was alluding to. See also: the diamond dependency problem. Meanwhile the benefits are unclear.<p>Multi-repos makes sense for entirely disconnected projects or products, or for collaboration in the open-source world. Most companies aren&#x27;t going to run into significant issues with scaling a monorepo and they&#x27;ll save a ton of work.')
