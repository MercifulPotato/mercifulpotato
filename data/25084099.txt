It&#x27;s certainly true that neither side is squeaky clean, but the left does not deny basic facts, and in particular, it does not attempt to dispute the outcomes of elections when the results are clear (and indeed has in the past thrown in the towel even when the results were not clear).  I could go on and on, but those two things are key.  Once you subscribe to the idea that whatever the Dear Leader says is true, evidence be damned, you are lost.  The right is doing this even as I write this.  The left never has.')
