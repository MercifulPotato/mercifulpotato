You mean our hospitals would be full for a few months. It&#x27;s not like the healthcare industry would be destroyed.<p>I would like to remind you of the situation in northern Italy in february. People suffocating in hospitals on chairs in the corridor, because there was no one to look after them and no beds for them to lay down. And that was not because the doctors were absent, it was because they were overwhelmed by the amount of sick people.<p>Perhaps you prefer an US example, I&#x27;d say it is sign of a collapsing health care system, if they have so many deaths, that they don&#x27;t know were to put the bodies. That happened in New York City, not some rural place with too few hospitals.')
