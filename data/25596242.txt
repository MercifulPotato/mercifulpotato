Sure, things have been differently exposed, maybe some ultraviolet light has been brought into the visual spectrum; but for all intents and purposes, the light from the subject(s) hit the lens(es) at the same time and the composition is true to what actually happened.<p>Now, with all that being said, there are many famous photos that are actually composites [2] and what makes &#x27;a true photograph&#x27; is still hotly debated.<p>Digital processing is such an integral part of modern photography that trying to decide what makes a &#x27;true photograph&#x27; is bound to get messy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petapixel.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;10&#x2F;incredible-color-photographs-of-early-20th-century-russia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petapixel.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;10&#x2F;incredible-color-photograph...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2NeyTEO_JP0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2NeyTEO_JP0</a>')
