Item(by='arugulum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608103496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438857, text='&gt;Your main character says not all cops are bastards.<p>IIRC this comment was made when you&#x27;re on a quest and partnered with probably the one good cop on the force, who was also suspended for doing his job. The quest started based on the incompetence of the police leading to him needing to ask V for help to pursue the case. And the comment was made in reference to this one guy you&#x27;re trying to help out. Meanwhile the next quest V will matter-of-factly state that the cops can&#x27;t be trusted to handle so-and-so issue.<p>So please don&#x27;t take lines out of their context.')
