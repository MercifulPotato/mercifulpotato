As it is structured, the government has the incentive to test their boundaries constantly, as there is no risk in doing so. The worst that can happen is any actions they take on such information gets thrown out in court.<p>That isn&#x27;t a disincentive...they can continue to violate the law, because there is nothing stopping them...merely laws that prevent them from <i>using</i> the illegally acquired information if the defendant has a competent lawyer. But never a penalty for illegally acquiring the information in the first place.')
