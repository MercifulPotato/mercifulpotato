It actually supports multiple number types, with decimal being the default for values with a dot.<p>&gt; you would need to know that when your number needs more than float precision or otherwise doesnâ€™t follow the rules, it should be in quotes<p>Not really. The configuration value should either be a number or not, which is determined by the application reading the config. As a config writer you only care to make the type match (so, in json, if the application uses number you make sure you use number, and if it expects a string you use that)<p>(disclaimer: I work for amazon, but have nothing to do with Ion other than having used it. Opinion is my own, not my employer&#x27;s, yadda yadda)<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.github.io&#x2F;ion-docs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.github.io&#x2F;ion-docs&#x2F;</a>')
