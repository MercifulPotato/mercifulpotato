I&#x27;ll definitely reach out.<p>I first got into Permaculture from reading my parents&#x27; copy of the Next\nWhole Earth Catalog ~25~30 years ago.  (Yeah, I&#x27;m a California cliche. lol)<p>Right now I&#x27;m living in a small townhouse in San Francisco with a tiny\nyard.  Somehow the covid virus pushed me to do what I can in the space\navailable.  I got some chicks and we&#x27;re raising them and I&#x27;ve been\ngrowing things in large containers.<p>I can&#x27;t really grow a lot of vegetables, we&#x27;re out by the ocean so we\ndon&#x27;t get the warm climate typical of CA and it&#x27;s the wrong season for annuals anyway.\n  It was foggy 50F this morning.  So I&#x27;ve been concentrating on building rich soil (for when I eventually\nget access to more land.)<p>I take wood chips that have been amended with chicken manure and feathers\nand layer it with Kellogg&#x27;s GROMULCH[1], about four or five layers, water it\nwell, then broadcast a dense seed mix (different mixes in different bins,\nwhatever I have on hand at the time.)  I call it &quot;layer cake&quot;.<p>The GROMULCH mycelium rapidly pervades the wood and converts it to an\nalmost chalky consistency.  (The earth &quot;akin to the vegetative&quot; of the\nhugelculture quote.[2])  Part of the idea here is to see how well various\nplants&#x27; roots integrate with the mycelium.  Another aspect is that the\nseedlings are so dense that their roots will form a mat or fiberous layer\nover the whole surface.  The leaves will cover the soil quickly,\nprotecting it and creating a moist micro-climate.<p>Before long the bin will be all soil (instead of half wood chips and half\nsoil) and it will be enriched by the growth of the fungus and plants.<p>At that point, I put the bin in the chicken run and let them eat the\nplants, then dump it out and cover it with more wood chips and let the\nchickens kick and scratch it out.  I&#x27;ll store it there and rake it up for\nbuilding planting beds in the Spring.  Eventually, I can use the material\nitself to make layer cake instead of buying more GROMULCH from the store.<p>In one bin I added some starting-to-rot lettuce and some woody growth\ntrimmed off a hedge, in another it&#x27;s just wood chips and GROMULCH.  In a\nthird bin I added some nightcrawlers...<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;m starting perennials like dwarf tamarillo and alpine\nstrawberries, again for when I have access to more land.<p>Enough about me.<p>In re: your project, first, congratulations!  I think you&#x27;ve identified\ntwo key pieces of the puzzle:  a plant database and a specialized online\nmarketplace.  (The garden log and planner is also awesome, just I\npersonally don&#x27;t see it as as big of a barrier as the other two.)  I\nthink we also need a marketplace for land (Airbnb for small plots of\ngarden&#x2F;farm, eh?  Hosh mentioned <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedearth.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedearth.com</a> but I didn&#x27;t get\nany response from the site when I tried it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23887329" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23887329</a>\nHosh if you read this, sorry for not contacting you yet, I fully intend to...)<p>There are a few existing plant databases, mostly not as useful as they\ncould be, my advice there is to focus on standards and open data, don&#x27;t\ntry to reinvent a wheel, rather engage and cooperate with the folks who\nare already ahead of you.<p>Same thing with the specialized marketplace: there are e.g. online&#x2F;digital\nFarmer&#x27;s Market systems and sites, but again, they don&#x27;t seem as useful\nto me as they might be.  I&#x27;m thinking Craigslist+Etsy for handmade food\nand food products, combined with scheduling and bidding features (e.g. I\nam a chef and I want to plan out meals for my restaurant, the site should\nhelp me pre-order ingredients.  Or I am a grower and I want to pre-sell\nmy crops before I even sprout them...  Eh?)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kellogggarden.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;kellogg&#x2F;gromulch-2-in-1-planting-mix-and-mulch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kellogggarden.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;kellogg&#x2F;gromulch-2-in...</a>\nThey don&#x27;t mention it on that apge but to me the big advantage of GROMULCH is the rich and active mycelium culture.<p>[2] &quot;Then the earth itself will have the tendency to come inwardly alive\nand become akin to the vegetative.&quot; ~ Herrman Andr√§, 1962\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.cahnrs.wsu.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;fs283e&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.cahnrs.wsu.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;fs283e&#x2F;</a>')
