(The only practical one is that the sorts of families who can pass down expensive art also control society.)<p>You didn&#x27;t work for that art or car; you simply had the fortune to be born into a family with one. Every single reason why it is unjust for someone to inherit a government role applies here. If you don&#x27;t think King James the Nth should rule simply because King James the N-1st did, why do you think James Jr. should have 30 million dollars in financial power simply because James Sr. did?<p>Just like hereditary rule, hereditary property breaks the fundamental relationship between work and reward that is common to any functional society. If you work hard and get a spare $30M to buy a car, sure, whatever, we can say you were incentivized to work hard and produce $30M of value. But if you work hard and give your kid $30M, how is your kid incentivized to do anything?<p>And the argument that well-off parents have an inherent right to make their kids&#x27; lives easier leads directly to the correlation between class and race&#x2F;caste. If it&#x27;s moral for me to make my children better off than others&#x27; children, who is to say it&#x27;s immoral for me to make my nieces and nephews several times removed better off, too? Who is to say it&#x27;s immoral to make all the people in this town who came from a certain ancestral lineage better off?<p>And on top of all that, it usually doesn&#x27;t even work. We associate &quot;nepotism&quot; with waste and corruption, not just distasteful behavior, because we understand those who are chosen because of their family relationships generally aren&#x27;t more qualified than the rest of the candidates. Even at the smallest scales, when you hear stories of the CEO&#x27;s college-age kid getting an internship, it&#x27;s almost always the case that the child has not inherited any particular talent, and in fact is probably <i>less</i> talented than would be needed for the job.<p>Parents should be allowed to provide for their children to set them up for adulthood - they should be able to pay for housing and food and clothing and education. When they can&#x27;t, society should step in to help them, and we&#x27;re almost there: we have welfare programs and private charities for basic needs, free public education, and (at least among private colleges with sufficient endowments) full need-based financial aid. Parents should not be able to do more than that, in a society that prizes democracy and equality over the natural superiority of certain families.')
