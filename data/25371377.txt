Most sites need a small amount of JS. Some benefit from quite a bit more, and for that there are things like Stimulus. And maybe you need a ton and it needs to work offline and manage a ton of local state - for that there are the usual SPA suspects. But those are and should be outliers.<p>The fact that “let’s use React with a JSON API Backend” is becoming much less the default is a very good thing. Web dev went into a dark time for awhile there and I’m hopeful we are coming out of it.')
