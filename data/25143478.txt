I think the answer is to have a court opinion declare that app store commissions are not <i>naturally related</i> to iOS. It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to prove this given that third-party developers are not the same developers that created iOS and that iOS is a fully-featured enough to be considered a general computing device.<p>There&#x27;s already legal precedence for this with United Sates v. Microsoft where Microsoft tried to ban Netscape and Java from being installed on Windows [1]. Epic could&#x2F;should be using that in their lawsuit in order to be allowed to run on iOS. The App Store is Apple&#x27;s territory, and that&#x27;s fine. iOS isn&#x27;t the App Store and the user should have the right in deciding what code runs on the device they purchased.<p>&gt; Tying is the practice of selling one product or service <i>(ie: commissions from App Store)</i> as a mandatory addition to the purchase of a different product or service <i>(ie: iPhone)</i>. In legal terms, a tying sale makes the sale of one good (the tying good) to the de facto customer (or de jure customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the tied good). Tying is often illegal when the products are not <i>naturally related.</i> In the United States, most states have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice enforces federal laws against tying through its Antitrust Division.
