It used to bother me a lot too. The reason I write articles like this is to explain the things I used to not understand, using words that I hope would have helped past-me understand sooner. Maybe it will help you too. If not, no harm done.<p>Thanks for writing this. I too can relate because these things used to bother me too. I like your math being the favorite subject anecdote because it&#x27;s one I can relate to, and coaching colleagues and reports past the fear of looking like or even admitting that they&#x27;re wrong has been a much more significant part of my career than I probably ever would have expected. The funny thing is that if you had told me that at the part of my career where it bothered me, I would have not listened. I had to stumble through it to realize everyone (including people like you) who warned me about this was right. I almost wonder if it&#x27;s a rite of passage for engineers.')
