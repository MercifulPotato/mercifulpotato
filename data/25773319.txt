Then I can keep my cushy American salary and afford to travel, avoid dealing with VISAs, and France get my cost of living &#x2F; tourism money without me taking a Frenchman’s job.<p>Hopefully countries will also warm up to remote work and will create legal avenues for individuals to do remote work while still paying taxes.')
