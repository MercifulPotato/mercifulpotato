There are political factions that explicitly <i>want</i> complete negligence by government and&#x2F;or want the government shut down. Small, but nevertheless valid, political actors.<p>Now the situations are very different, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that bringing charges against politicians for negligence is crossing dangerous and uncivil lines. One persons negligence is literally another person&#x27;s vote winner.<p>Furthermore, politicians can reasonably be incompetent in the face of crisis and should not be held accountable for that - they are at the end of the day just ordinary people. They don&#x27;t know any more than we do what is going to happen in their term. It isn&#x27;t fair to punish them for negligence if there isn&#x27;t some formal standard of competence in appointing them (which is a totally silly idea and would be abused like mad in any political arena). &quot;I don&#x27;t understand water and chemistry and these experts looked untrustworthy&quot; is a totally acceptable political defence, no matter how stupid that sounds or how damaging the outcomes. It is simply a matter of fact that politicians make decisions about things they don&#x27;t understand and regularly make bad (read: horrible, horrific) decisions.')
