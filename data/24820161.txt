A Federation of independent states unified under a federal government is kind of how the whole U.S. thing works, no?<p>You also seem to be trying to make a political statement. Should a &quot;red&quot; state like TX not request disaster relief funds (say, after a hurricane) if a Democrat is president?<p>Also, keep in mind that 57% of forests in CA are Federally managed. Only 3% is managed by the state.')
