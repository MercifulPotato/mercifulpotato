In reality, genes don&#x27;t belong to the individual, or a tribe or species for that matter. Genes belong to the ecosystem i.e. genes favor behavior which is good for the fitness of the ecosystem (you could say it&#x27;s because of the other way around, but you get the idea), even at the expense of the individual itself or other lower level organisms or super-organisms.\nIt will be clear if you look at it from a different perspective. White blood cells kill bodies own cells all the time. If you think the reason might be to protect the larger organism, it makes more sense. But there&#x27;s more.<p>Think of the &quot;freeze&quot; response that, say, deer have when they get caught by a leopard. It would be best for the deer (and its family i.e. those with similar genes) if it didn&#x27;t have a freeze response. It would be much better for them if they had a &quot;fight till death&quot; response. That way, every time a leopard caught a deer, it would get most likely get injured and leopards would be able to hunt fewer deer.<p>The deer has a freeze response because it has nothing to do with what&#x27;s good for the deer and everything to do with what is good for the ecosystem. It&#x27;s best if it outruns the leopard... but if it gets caught, it&#x27;s best if it freezes while the leopard kills it.<p>P.S. The mainstream explanation of the freeze response is that &quot;it helps the deer deal with the pain&quot;. However, they fail to explain what the evolutionary benefit to not feeling pain as one is being eaten is.')
