I did exactly two things with it:<p>- For a few days, I maintained a connection between my personal Linux desktop and my personal Windows sidearm, because I was using both simultaneously and didn&#x27;t want to shift back and forth on my desk every 2 minutes.<p>- Every now and then, connected to my mom&#x27;s personal laptop, to reset her buggy Bluetooth headset.<p>That&#x27;s it. Their heuristics decided I&#x27;m a commercial user. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the first point that tripped them - keeping a connection mostly idle for half a day is probably not a typical thing.')
