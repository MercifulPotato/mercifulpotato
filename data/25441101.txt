It would have been smarter not to do it in every conceivable way. For user security, for diplomatic standing, for certifying the intelligence community isn&#x27;t actively undermining the values it is supposed to defend. So what result did they get in return for all that? A huge waste of taxpayer money, lies about domestic policies and agency abuse, compromised network security and totalitarian whistleblower prosecution.<p>No, western governments cannot call China out on their practices because they would do the exact same things. Weak sauce.')
