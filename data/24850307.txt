In my opinion it has very little to do with that and a lot more to do with the billions of dollars invested into developing, extending the platform, creating and supporting APIs, establishing contracts with OEMs, developing apps, etc etc. Android wasn&#x27;t some magic thing that anyone that purchased it would have been sure to be successful. Just look at how well MS did with Nokia&#x27;s purchase.<p>So yes, Google did purchase Android but Google didn&#x27;t purchase their mobile success story by purchasing Android.')
