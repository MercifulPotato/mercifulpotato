One of those facts is that there are newly released pictures of Hunter smoking crack, which isn&#x27;t particularly interesting.  All the other stuff about emails, provenance of said emails, etc., has not been verified by anyone but the NYP, who, contrary to typical reporting practices, are not sharing their info so other venues can confirm the accuracy.  So, as far as I am concerned, that is unverified and quite likely inaccurate info and Twitter and Facebook has no responsibility to disseminate unverified and quite likely inaccurate info.')
