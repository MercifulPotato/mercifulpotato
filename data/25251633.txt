Like almost no one can tolerate ketosis but they can do extreme diets like day+ fasting or fad diets.<p>They don&#x27;t actually succeed. They succeed for a short time, because of the motivation rush, and will post about their success; then they will lose the motivation and consequently their shape, but then obviously won&#x27;t post about that.<p>Restrictive diets are bound to fail, because it&#x27;s like fighting gravity, and it&#x27;s impossible to succeed for one reason or another - burning motivation&#x2F;mental health being another factor.<p>Dieting is something successful in the extremely long term, ie. decades.<p>- overweight person loses weight in the short term: interesting blog post (for uninformed readers)<p>- overweight person loses shape in the medium&#x2F;long term: uninteresting because it shows that silver bullets don&#x27;t work.<p>- fit person stay fit through exercise and balanced diet: uninteresting, because it goes against the silver bullet approach.')
