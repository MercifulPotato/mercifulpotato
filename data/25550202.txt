Ask for multiple pages in parallel, ask for offset=18 etc. Make calculations on those parameters.\nIf you only providing a token, like &quot;next_page=abcdef1234&quot; with some encoded structure, you&#x27;re limiting your client in what it can actually do, but simultaneously simplify backend architecture and make it more forward compatible with future changes  in backend (after all, that next_page token can actually be just an offset and limit encoded)')
