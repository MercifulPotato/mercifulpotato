(Or it exists, but the M1 outperforms it in every metric!)<p>I suspect that many Apple-focused journalists are similarly constrained by tunnel vision, limiting their view of the world as &quot;things that Apple created in the past&quot; and &quot;things that Apple creates now.&quot;<p>For the already Apple faithful, it&#x27;s not a bad way to go. &quot;Is this new Apple Silicon desktop going to outperform the only option I have now, an Intel Xeon-based Mac Pro?&quot; So it&#x27;s not too surprising that Intel is their benchmark, even if it ignores much higher performing alternatives available to those outside of Apple&#x27;s walled garden.')
