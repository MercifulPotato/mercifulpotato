There are two reasons to price higher than the lowest. One is to make a little more profit because your book will sell as soon as the cheapest book sells. The other is to avoid my pricing bot fighting with someone else&#x27;s pricing bot down to $0.01. I would rather accidentally shoot the price really high than give the book away for a loss. Especially considering a lot of the books were $150+ used textbooks.')
