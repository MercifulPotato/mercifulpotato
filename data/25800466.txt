Or tell yourself that you are smart, and they are dumb and simply lucky, because most fail. Either way, find a way to spin it so you are right and they wrong, and definitely don&#x27;t actually reflect on how you could get some of what they have, nor improve yourself in any way. Remind yourself instead why their success is not actually so good, or so special, and especially remember to tell yourself that it&#x27;s not and it&#x27;s never your fault if you don&#x27;t succeed. Align with your true nature and surrender to the inevitability of your powerlessness. This is right, for you, oh sheep. This is your good path. Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of hoping, or idolizing, or being inspired. Never dream. Remember to always be critical and find fault with another&#x27;s success, in order to protect yourself. This is your way. Go forth and just be.')
