So what&#x27;s the point of your argument other than to tug at our heartstrings about those orphans?<p>Oh, and if the mom and pop shop is bankrupt, or has little capital, and there isn&#x27;t family or close friends able and willing to take care of the kids, then who will?<p>Oh, right, &quot;some state system.&quot; So if you are so concerned about these children, perhaps we need better orphanages and better support for the foster system.<p>Now, how do we fund those improvements?')
