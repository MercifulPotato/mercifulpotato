(small portable HDMI screens are also available, but for occasional use buying one is overkill). VGA capture modules are more expensive, but should also exist.<p>Otherwise a traditional way is a serial console, which again would need a serial adapter for whatever device you use with it - again depends if your hardware has a serial port and (if BIOS is relevant) if the BIOS talks over it.')
