We were bidding into a large hospital network. After the long sales cycle, we checked the most boxes, clinicians liked the feel of ours the best, they said ours was the most intuitive, helped them do their job the fastest, etc.<p>The clinicians weren&#x27;t the ones writing the check though.<p>Our competitor approached the main insurance provider in the area and convinced <i>them</i> they could save x% in additional claims if the hospital network would adopt their software. Competitor&#x27;s deal was to split the bill between the insurance company and the hospital network. To the admins writing the checks, they had the choice between two vendors that more or less did the same thing but one came in at half the cost. Clinicians&#x27; preferences didn&#x27;t matter, it was a no brainer for them.<p>No amount of software engineering would have saved that deal.')
