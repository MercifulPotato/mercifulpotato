I have yet to find a foundational framework that captures this inherent intentionality (the ‘how’) that is better than the λ-calculus.<p>Yes! Lambda calculus is my &quot;native brain programming language&quot; and I can&#x27;t find a language the expresses it better than the Lisps. I never have to bend around the language, it feels as if I can always do exactly the method I wanted to solve something.<p>Another big benefit is the simple syntax makes complex metaprogramming achievable. You just move the s-expressions and atoms around. Unnest and nest them. Like normal code. It makes sense.')
