From experience I can say that at the pricepoints being mentioned (a few thousand USD, which is a few days of work, if that), you can barely break even on just the amount of effort small towns will expect you spend <i>on writing the proposal</i> (so not even mentioning the actual work!). You&#x27;ll have to write a project offer, business case, ROI calculations, breakdown of spend, and that&#x27;s just to be <i>considered</i>, i.e. they&#x27;ll expect several firms to do this and then they&#x27;ll pick (the cheapest|the mayor&#x27;s nephew|the guy the CEO plays golf with). I&#x27;m very hesitant too to work with this sort of client, there needs to a real possibility of a substantive follow on (and not a hand-wavy &#x27;yeah this might grow into something bigger&#x27;) to make it worth while.<p>But maybe I&#x27;m thinking of the wrong sort of services, so it would probably be illustrative to have some examples of what were&#x27;re talking about here.')
