I know the word falsify has become prominent in the last 15 years or so, but a &quot;theory&quot; that doesn&#x27;t agree with some real world data is just a hypothesis. In other words a theory needs confirmation in addition to not being falsified. This is where the divide should exist between physics and mathematics. You can have a bunch of cool math, but that&#x27;s not physics. It&#x27;s not scientific theory by itself. You can hypothesize that it describes the real world, but until there is confirming evidence that assertion is just mental self-gratification.')
