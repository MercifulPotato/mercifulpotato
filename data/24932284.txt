Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=[24932717], score=None, time=1603989106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932078, text='I remember 2002 and 2003. And 2008. You&#x27;re right. These are real worries for real people in the real world.<p>Let&#x27;s ground this in more realistic numbers: you can reasonably buy a $500k residential property in the SF Bay on <i>a single $140k salary</i>. That&#x27;s a salary that&#x27;s very achievable for a senior engineer - which is to say five years of experience, which many will hit by 30. It&#x27;s one that you can keep getting when you hit 35 or 40 if you don&#x27;t move into management or technical leadership so long as you don&#x27;t insist on working solely for startups founded recently by 20-somethings. It&#x27;s a pay packet that will enable you to rid yourself of student loans in relatively short order, should you choose to do so.<p>The nice thing about the &quot;the tech industry&quot; is that one name covers a shockingly diverse swath. I&#x27;ve seen personal finance, business finance, high finance, business services, medicine, consumer electronics, and more all under the name of &quot;tech&quot;. They are not <i>nearly</i> are industry-correlated as calling it all &quot;tech industry&quot; might lead someone to think. Often they have little in common with one another except using a bit of Python or Ruby.<p>With that in mind, and that any property appreciates in value over enough time (or at least is exceptionally unlikely to lose significant value in the SF Bay), we&#x27;ve got a scenario where of 0-4 concerns, only #2 is really a big one in this new world of remote work. 0 and 1 aren&#x27;t big issues, as mentioned previously. 3 isn&#x27;t a huge deal - you&#x27;re sitting on an asset in which you have a non-trivial chunk of ownership that you can use. 4 is a universal issue that will arise in literally any scenario where you don&#x27;t have 1%-grade resources, and no change of location (or income) will fix that.<p>Your concerns are wise, and clear-headed. I applaud your foresight and caution! I think it just might be possible that grounding numbers in reality might change the calculations slightly.')
