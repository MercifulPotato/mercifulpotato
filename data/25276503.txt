Facebook&#x27;s initial(?) React demo where they pointed out how they used React&#x27;s render(state) single source of truth to keep the notification count badge consistent was enough for me to relate.<p>Another example are mobile apps which are basically still in jQuery-soup-level-APIs with seldom exception. Sure, they don&#x27;t have the same sort of runtime bloat that you point out with JS SPAs, but the tooling and paradigms are also for the most part stuck in an imperative old-school.<p>Also every time I download a website&#x27;s native mobile app alternative, it really does feel like an old jQuery-soup app. Buttons that don&#x27;t work and badge counts out of sync with the data. Of course, more things explain this situation, but the worse DX of Android&#x2F;iOS has a share of the blame.<p>Turns out client development is hard. Better abstractions may come with bloat, but it&#x27;s not all downside for the user.')
