Item(by='vmchale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604590962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998787, text='&gt; I think one thing programmers underestimate is how many scientists and academics are using Python. It&#x27;s not just ML, it&#x27;s pretty much every kind of scientist and tons of non-science academics too. The fact that it&#x27;s a great &quot;casual&quot; or part-time language is huge for these people. They aren&#x27;t full time (or even self-identifying) programmers, but their programs are non-trivial. The readability, portability, tooling, and massive package ecosystem is huge for them.<p>I&#x27;ve found the reliability and tooling really unsatisfactory, at least compared to Haskell.<p>The libraries are there, though, and familiarity is in the departments (psychology (maybe more R?), physics, &amp;c.)')
