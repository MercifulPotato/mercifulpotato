After all the flashy stuff was introduced in KDE 4 things went downhill fast. Similarly with Gnome, Gnome 2 was the best series, Gnome 3 was awful.<p>It seems somewhere around the late 2000s both projects got very nice and usable desktop environments, couldn&#x27;t figure out how to &quot;evolve&quot; next (because apparently software just can&#x27;t not evolve) and started throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. And unsurprisingly, a lot of it did stick.<p>To its credit, KDE 5 does seem to try to clean up the mess a bit though in that over the years it is the only between the two that doesn&#x27;t compulsively make me want to remove it from any Linux machine i get my hands on (and can remove stuff :-P).<p>Sadly XFCE seems to be heading down the same way.')
