It confirms an underpinning assumption, threat, emotion they feel. It’s more productive IMO to understand how people feel about something. A simple example is desperately wanting to go back to “normal” during Covid, or feeling their status or livelihood under threat (working class in the US and elsewhere)<p>People reach for scapegoats and facts to fit the narrative they have. They have a strong feeling or grievance, and desperately want it validated.<p>If the goal is to influence someone’s beliefs, when we fact check them, we can be seen as invalidating their underlying emotion or feelings.<p>Instead it seems more productive to get the underlying issue out in the light of day and put less shame around it.<p>As a society and individuals I have no idea how we do that. But I just know fact checking people often has the <i>opposite</i> effect and just makes people madder.')
