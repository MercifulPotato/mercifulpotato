Consider the killing of Walter Wallace, one of the &quot;psychiatric incidents&quot; you&#x27;re talking about:<p>&gt; Several 9-1-1 calls were made by Wallace&#x27;s sister, brother, and neighbor, telling dispatchers that Wallace was assaulting his parents<p>&gt; The two officers arrived in the area to respond to a domestic dispute. When they arrived, Wallace walked out of his house carrying a knife. The two officers backed away while telling him to drop the knife, and as Wallace walked in their direction, each officer fired several rounds at Wallace, hitting him in the shoulder and chest. He later died from his wounds in the hospital. Wallace&#x27;s family stated that Wallace was having a mental health crisis.<p>&gt; Protests and demonstrations against police brutality and institutional racism in response to Wallace&#x27;s killing took place across Philadelphia throughout late October.<p>&gt; The then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris published a joint statement saying, &quot;Our hearts are broken for the family of Walter Wallace Jr... We cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death.&quot;[34]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Killing_of_Walter_Wallace" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Killing_of_Walter_Wallace</a><p>Body cam video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xl1QBL8TijI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xl1QBL8TijI</a><p>Edit: And it really says something about our ability to discuss facts on Hacker News when quotes from Wikipedia and a body cam video are downvoted to invisibility.')
