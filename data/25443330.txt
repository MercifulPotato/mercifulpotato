My own opinion is negative of them, and I wish they did not exist but that does not mean others are not allowed to work there or do not have different opinions. However, I am curious, is the work interesting? Is the pay too good? Or do you feel that there is no negative impact of Facebook on the world and humanity in general or that its positive influence outweighs the negative?<p>Id love to hear why people stick it out there when there are many other companies that could pay as good or provide more fulfilling (again, subjective) work for less pay.<p>Edit : For context, I thought of this when I read about the ad Zuckerberg put out against apple recently, which is obviously far from the truth&#x2F;false.')
