I know at least one person opened an issue regarding this on the site issue tracker at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salsa.debian.org&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;317" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salsa.debian.org&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;...</a> and I also believe I recall one of the Rust regex crate developers mentioning this too.<p>I know that using PCRE2 in a Python program isn&#x27;t typical but the Benchmarks Game does allow using other libraries and many of the previously submitted programs have been doing this for a long time already. The pidigits benchmark is the other benchmark that is heavily dependent on the libraries being used as is illustrated by their being a nearly ten way tie for second place by a bunch of programs that all use GMP.')
