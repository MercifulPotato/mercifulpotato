It comes from the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; where Neo is given the option to take a blue pill and stay in simulated reality or a red pill which will cause the machines to unplug him from the simulation and allow the members of Zion to come and rescue him in the real world.<p>Here Snopes is being lampooned for a tactic in which Snopes assigns some claim a &quot;Mostly False&quot; label (which is what everyone processes and then moves on from) but then when you read the content of their article it tends to be some trivial technicality or some subjective opinion upon which they assign the label where the actual substance of the claim is substantially true.<p>Satire and pointed mockery is among the most effective means of taking down a tyrannical structure. It breaks through people&#x27;s unconscious responses which, for good reason, is usually to defer to some authority and gets them to engage consciously with some idea which may challenge the legitimacy of that authority. Mockery breaks down the sense of authority itself.')
