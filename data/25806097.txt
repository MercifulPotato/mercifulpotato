Item(by='DonaldFisk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610835929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803956, text='The article fails to make a distinction between misinformation (untruthful, false information that is spread, regardless of intent to mislead) and disinformation (dishonest, deliberately misleading or biased information).   All disinformation is misinformation *, but not all misinformation is disinformation. And I don&#x27;t see how a comparison with drugs is helpful.<p>There are two things that can be done:<p>One is requiring misinformation to be corrected, with penalties for disinformation.   This won&#x27;t be popular with free speech advocates, but maybe they should reconsider whether malicious lies (which have adverse consequences) ought to be protected.   There&#x27;s also the more practical problem that the disinformation might not be detected, or detected too late.<p>The other is to ensure that people are educated from an early age to spot dubious information and fallacious reasoning, and learn how to fact-check sources.   An understanding of science (along with its acceptance of being proven wrong), history, and folklore is also helpful.<p>* There are rare exceptions to this.')
