It was so fast and easy to get an idea out.  I&#x27;ve played with Rust too, and have done a project in it.  I like it too, but as a necessity, not out of a strong love.  I do love the package manager Rust has though.  It&#x27;s so nice to not have to worry about that kind of thing.<p>Once Raku has dataframes, and it is stable, I&#x27;ll definitely be checking it out.')
