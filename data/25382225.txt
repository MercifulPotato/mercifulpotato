I put a dollar amount on my free time, although for most people I think it&#x27;s a mistake to say that the value of my time is $salary&#x2F;(40*52)<p>However if you work a salaried job, saving an hour on cleaning won&#x27;t necessarily increase your income by $salary&#x2F;2080. Maybe if I spent that time working I&#x27;d get a bonus or something, but the hours have diminishing returns.<p>On the other hand, I used to work at a job where I could choose to work overtime, so it was true to say that if I paid $X more in monthly rent to shorten my daily commute by Z minutes I could treat it as an &quot;investment&quot; by working an extra Z minutes per day.')
