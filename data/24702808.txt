This isn&#x27;t even getting into the export of environmental destruction (&quot;out of sight out of mind&quot;) or the export of American technological expertise to unfriendly totalitarian states.<p>H1B programs can be shady this way too. It&#x27;s not as shady as actual slave labor or near-slave sweatshops, but there is certainly a serious power imbalance when your employer can pay you sub-standard wages and threaten to cause you to be deported if you don&#x27;t keep your head down.')
