When I give bad results, I&#x27;m not permanently denied entry. Instead, the data is sent back to Google and it notes that decision and I get to try again. If enough people were to always select all 3 squares, or an entire road that you can walk across rather than a painted crossing marks, or whatever false positive, then Google Captcha’s idea of a correct answer is more broad.<p>I can’t get rid of captcha. However, since it’s a data training game, I can try to eliminate the issues as much as possible by feeding it extra data so that people don’t have the 1&#x2F;3 tiles question.<p>That question is difficult to answer because captcha has no rules. This is because it’s not actually used to identify if you’re human or a bot, that’s a side effect.')
