They have morphed into a desktop oriented build with snap packages and auto-updates enabled by default (among other strange decisions).  There&#x27;s a ton of stuff we always end up disabling in the new release because it&#x27;s super buggy and doesn&#x27;t work well (I work at a small MSP). I&#x27;m not sure who replaced Ian Jackson, but Debian seems rudderless.<p>Centos was the rational other free choice, not that Red Hat hasn&#x27;t made other equally strange decisions.<p>Sometimes I think we&#x27;d be better off rolling our own, like Amazon does.')
