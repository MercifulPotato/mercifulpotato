All of the interesting research required to hit &quot;print&quot; on mRNA-1273 was already done in MERS. It would have been surprising if the vaccine didn&#x27;t work.<p>If a new pandemic emerges from a less well understood family of viruses for which we don&#x27;t have any good preclinical vaccines, it could still take decades.<p>Sticking the genome into synthetic mRNA isn&#x27;t the rate limiting step, it&#x27;s knowing to target the spike protein, inserting the stabilizing proline mutations, &amp;c and also having experience getting safe and protective responses from a similar vaccine for a related virus.')
