They adjusted for US GDP (richer countries spend more on healthcare), then broke down costs by category and figured out how much more&#x2F;less the US spent compared to OECD countries.  Very eye opening if you check out the graph at the bottom of page 4.<p>Findings: 1) out-patient care is driving ~70% of the extra cost, 2) in-patient costs are ~10% higher than OECD, 3) the US spend 50% more on drugs, but it&#x27;s a small part of overall spending, 4) administration is 200% higher, but again, it doesn&#x27;t add up to that much, 5) the US spends less on long-term and home care and 6) the US invests 50% more in healthcare, but it&#x27;s not a large absolute amount.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mckinsey.com&#x2F;~&#x2F;media&#x2F;mckinsey&#x2F;dotcom&#x2F;client_service&#x2F;healthcare%20systems%20and%20services&#x2F;health%20international&#x2F;hi08_american_health.ashx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mckinsey.com&#x2F;~&#x2F;media&#x2F;mckinsey&#x2F;dotcom&#x2F;client_serv...</a>')
