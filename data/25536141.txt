A folder full of .ps1’s (that were .ahk’s) begs to differ on this point :-)<p>Some random examples i use all the time:<p>* i have a bunch of apps (i think of it like a workspace) that i open for specific tasks - e.g. when playing ham radio i’ll open a tool that lets me duplicate traffic to&#x2F;from a serial port (com0com) so that multiple apps can share 1 physical port, a tool that lets me control my radio (flrig), a tool that lets me route audio between devices and software without a mess of cables doing it in hardware (voicemeeter banana), a tool that encodes&#x2F;decodes messages (wsjtx), a tool that shows what grid squares i’m hearing (gridtracker) and a tool for logging (home brew). They all need to be arranged in fairly bespoke ways across a couple of screens to let me work effectively - bind the shortcut to the .ps1 to a keyboard shortcut and i’m done.<p>The same idea exists for my other workspaces (dev work - there’s different flavours for this one by task, photo editing, researching, presenting, etc. Etc.)<p>Things like sending “PS1;” CAT control command to my radio (this turns it on) are actually less lines of code in .ps1 than .ahk. My .ps1’s are about 2&#x2F;3 the size of the .ahk’s in practice.<p>Before .ahk i was using python2 with the win32 module, .ps1 is comparably expressive to python2 - which surprises me.<p>Other .ahk’s i use all the time are basically glorifed macros for common actions i perform. Again shorter to express in powershell.')
