How much of a cable modem&#x27;s life is spent booting? Probably not much. Fiddling with the bootloader to make it faster on production hardware would make it harder to debug if needed. They did leave the UART pins accessible on the board, so they may have expected to possibly need to tftp boot the boards in extreme circumstances.<p>You could make that require a jumper somewhere, but 2 seconds added to the boot time, when a working modem probably doesn&#x27;t boot more than once a month is simply not a lot of time.')
