That’s a good start, and it’s important that everyone understands that mask are <i>not</i> protecting you when you go outside. People should not feel safer by putting on a mask. And if masks give people a false sense of security then that can do damage by encouraging behavior that would otherwise be avoided.<p>Beyond randomized controlled studies, we obviously have very strong <i>observational</i> worldwide evidence that even high incidence of mask wearing is not enough to prevent a seasonal outbreak. You basically need an island nation with strict border controls to do that.<p>To me the big remaining question around wearing a mask to protect <i>others</i> — since I can’t see how that’s something that can be tested in a randomized controlled study — becomes a materials science question of how these homemade masks dampen the spread of larger particles versus potentially aerosolizing smaller particles.<p>Was there ever any scientific study of the effect of non-surgical masks on aerosolizing the virus? I recall reading an article specifically warning against for example bandanas, or basically any single-ply cotton could actually <i>amplify</i> the spread.<p>Lastly, if some people who have mild symptoms think it’s safe enough for them to go out because they are putting a mask on, it’s likely to tilt the overall balance of help vs. harm decidedly against masks.<p>In short, the question isn’t really just whether surgical mask use by the general population can somewhat reduce the R factor — you’d like to think that it could, although scientifically this has not been proven and many studies show otherwise.<p>It’s first about homemade masks used haphazardly by the general population, and secondly it’s a behavioral question of what happens if you tell people to wear a face covering and they reasonably assume that wearing one would be somehow helpful.')
