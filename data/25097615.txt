Unfortunately this has the opposite effect of Parler&#x27;s stated goal of being &quot;the world&#x27;s town square&quot; since it simply isn&#x27;t attractive to people with opposing views of those who did move.<p>I think free speech is important and I think that social media platforms can be a bit overzealous in their moderation of the content of its users. I just don&#x27;t think you can sell a platform on it alone. It should be a feature of your platform, not the only thing going for it.')
