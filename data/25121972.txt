It doesn&#x27;t matter that they are all printing the same currency. This activity is happening within the physical confines of individual states and they are using that money to pay their debts.<p>The simplest interpretation is the correct one. Especially when you consider the history of the US.<p>If the law was merely about not allowing states have sovereignty over their own fiat currencies then they would not have mentioned the words &#x27;gold&#x27; or &#x27;silver&#x27;.')
