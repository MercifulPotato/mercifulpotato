Not all data stores support decimal numbers, and every programming language I&#x27;ve used uses floating point numbers my default. JS doesn&#x27;t seem to even have a native decimal implementation at all.<p>Strings work everywhere, and are first-class data types it most systems&#x2F;languages. They take more bits per digit than numbers (though you can choose a wider alphabet to mitigate that, such as ASCII 33 &#x27;!&#x27; through 126 &#x27;~&#x27;), but I&#x27;m happy to trade the storage away for using a first-class data types.')
