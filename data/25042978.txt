Like you said:<p>&gt; CSP is hard for many problems where classic shared-memory using locks and atomics are well defined (think of classic concurrency programming textbooks).<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem with Go&#x27;s particular flavor of CSP, this is just a fact--it can be hard to translate simple modules that use locks into modules that use a CSP paradigm.<p>&gt; Now with Go, you have this extra problem of &quot;should I be using channels or locks?&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re arguing against yourself here... if it&#x27;s important to answer the question &quot;should I be using channels or locks?&quot; correctly, then wouldn&#x27;t you be in a bad situation if the language only provided channels or only provided locks?<p>This is no different from the problem of &quot;should I use recursion or iteration?&quot; or &quot;should I use a tree or a hash table?&quot; Some times, either option is workable, but at other times, one of the options is better than the other. CSP versus locks is the same thing, it&#x27;s just another decision you have to make when programming.')
