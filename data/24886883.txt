Or my personal favorite is in-ear for sound isolation without needing active noise cancellation. I&#x27;m not sure what the wireless world for those is like, outside of adapters. I do have a Jabra 75T pair I use with mobile devices, that does some sound isolation and recently added noise cancellation (haven&#x27;t tried it). Their newer ones have better support for noise canceling (must include a chip for processing).')
