This is an excellent time to listen to their opinions. Unfortunately, this period is usually quite short for most people.<p>Is there? Or is this an unfalsifiable classification that people one agrees with can be put in, and people who one doesn&#x27;t agree with can be pushed out of?<p>The idea that opinions have no relation to expertise is a general argument against expertise. The magic period during which people have expertise but don&#x27;t have opinions seems related to that magic period for journalists when they understand all of the facts about a story accurately but have no opinion about what is true and what is not true.')
