Item(by='berdario', descendants=None, kids=[25570041, 25571981], score=None, time=1609245275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568798, text='Citymapper is nice, but I disagree that it&#x27;s massively superior:<p>1- When I was living south of London, Citymapper was completely pointless, since it only showed commuting options with SouthWest trains, and not Southern trains (my station was served by both). I suspect Citymapper might&#x27;ve fixed this since.<p>2- Maps also gives you all different options, and since some time ago they also started to offer mixed ride-hailing and public transport (they appear to offer that only if your public transport station is far enough from you probably &gt; ~15 minutes walk?)<p>3- The other features are not that useful: since you&#x27;d use a monthly travelcard or pay as you go on your oyster&#x2F;bank card, the cost estimate is not really something that you have to worry about. If you&#x27;re a cash-strapped student, you&#x27;re probably just going to always opt for the bus to save one or two pounds compared to the tube... so, just picking Bus as your preferred mode of transport is enough to cover that use case.<p>4- Citymapper is&#x2F;was also inferior to Google maps when you need to quickly check&#x2F;compare  a (different) train that you just managed to hop into if it&#x27;s not shown in the UI (maybe because it was delayed, and so it was not shown among the options). With Google maps you could just amend the start time for your trip.<p>5- One really nice feature that Citymapper has is the instructions for which tube exit to use when you arrive at the destination. It really helps to diminish the &quot;which side is north?&quot; disorientation. Otoh, you don&#x27;t get that unless you actually start the trip (if you only use Citymapper to browse the route options, for example). OTOH, Google maps has AR navigation, which covers the same use case (orient yourself when you do the last bit of your trip on foot)<p>6- Both Maps and Citymapper have alert notifications for when you should get out at your stop. I almost never use the feature though, because I missed my tube stop a couple of times due to Citymapper triggering their notification AFTER the stop was already past)<p>7- Both Maps and Citymapper have a way to share your trip with other people. Citymapper is nicer though, since you can see all of the people that shared a trip with you on the same map (nice when you&#x27;re meeting with more than 1 other friend from different parts of London)<p>That said, I dislike monopolies, so when I&#x27;ll travel around London again (after the end of the pandemic) I&#x27;m planning to try to use maps.me (which uses the OSM data) as my first option.')
