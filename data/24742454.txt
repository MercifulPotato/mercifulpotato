What&#x27;s happening to all the babies who survive today that would have died in childbirth had they been born at any time in human history before 100 years ago? Since infant mortality was so high, it must have been an close battle for evolution to keep it under control. Now the brakes are off and whatever mutations were regularly killing babies (and mothers) are now free to propagate to subsequent generations.<p>Not that that&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing. We&#x27;ve already evolved to become dependent on technology (cooking, clothing, shelter) and it probably does us good by freeing up our body&#x27;s resources to do other things better. So perhaps becoming dependent on healthcare for childbirth will eventually happen too and nobody will be worried when women can only give birth by C-section or whatever.<p>A related issue is immunization. People are so worked up about the politics that they don&#x27;t want to think about this, but could it be that immunizing ourselves is taking away the evolutionary pressure to maintain a good natural immune system? Multiple generations of measles vaccinated people might end up like the native Americans who were vulnerable from their ancestors having never experienced measles.<p>This seems like a whole alternative kind of morality - protection of the genes of future generations. But it goes against the popular short term moralities that people have so it seems too objectionable.')
