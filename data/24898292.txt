I had an XPS 13 2020 Dev Edition for about 2 months, and long story short, Dell support sucks, and we decided to return the device, and went with a Lemur Pro as the replacement.<p>Pros:\n- Great battery life, I develop in typescript currently and am getting a full day of battery<p>- Using a dock, I can get up to 3 displays, maybe four if I try with the on-board HDMI port<p>- Charges with USB-C with up to 65W, so one cable for everything.<p>- Full sized USB A ports for quick flash drive access<p>- Typing on the keyboard is very solid (however I do have one con listed below)<p>- Can turn off camera via software (with Pop_OS)<p>- Linux from the get-go<p>- Came packaged pretty well<p>- Lots of goodies came along. Pins, stickers, etc. Not everyone will care but I thought it was a nice touch<p>- Recyclable box, plastics, tc came in the packaging.<p>- It&#x27;s SUPER light<p>- Good amount of customization in my opinion<p>- Has another m.2 slot you can put your own or buy it configured and filled up<p>Cons:<p>- Regardless of configured RAM, first slot is always 8gb, so anything beyond 16gb total will always be non-dual-channel. Believe this is soldered.<p>- Touchpad could be bigger<p>- I believe the max brightness is something around 300 or 350 nits, which may cause issues when working outside, haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to because of COVID<p>- The keyboard has pg_up and pg_down on top of left and right keys, which is rather obnoxious and I wish they would have went with pg_up and pg_down for fn + arrow instead.<p>- Possible con for people: SD card slot is only micro, not full sized<p>- Only one USB-C port<p>- No thunderbolt<p>- Power button is unintuitive imo, but I&#x27;m nitpicking at this point<p>- Compared to the dell, the bezels are a bit larger than I like, but again, nitpicking&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t really bother me')
