At a quick glance, none of nginx, traefik, httpd, or haproxy support running as non-root out of the box either.<p>That does not sound like an adequate excuse, does it?<p>I&#x27;m afraid none of your remarks makes a reasonable point. Even if you believe that running random stuff as root is ok, if you do not have any reason to do that then why should we mindlessly follow bad practices? If we aim at running a safe system.and there is absolutely zero drawback in following best practices, then why should we continue to make the mistake of intentionally using poor practices?')
