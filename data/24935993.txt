FB seems to be doing pretty well:<p>a. Both DAU and MAU continue to grow. FB now has 2.7B MAU and 1.8B DAU. Combining across all their products (WhatsApp, Insta..) the DAP is 2.54B<p>b. Ads is the source of income and FB makes $39.6 per user in the US&amp;CA and $7.89 avg. world wide<p>c. Operating expenses are kind of stabilizing which is a good thing for FB.<p>The presentation is a good easy read. I like how FB define the metrics like DAP etc.')
