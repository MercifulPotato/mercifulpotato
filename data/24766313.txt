After reading this article I was a little shocked because the author didn&#x27;t do any configuration or setup for the other machines, so I thought, wow! Plan 9 was so advanced that all you need are multiple machines present on the same network and it will automatically &#x27;clusterize&#x27; them.<p>So I went out to make my own cluster and realized that no, sadly, the author simply did not activate nor configure the other machines at all.<p>I still love plan 9 and still use it on the occasion, but I&#x27;d love more detail on how to actually set up a plan9 cluster and really &#x27;get into&#x27; the power of distributed computing.')
