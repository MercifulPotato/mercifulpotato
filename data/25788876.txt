On the other hand also I have colleagues who learnt to code after Visual Basic&#x2F;Studio became a thing and work entirely in Visual Studio and manage to deliver top quality work year after year without basically ever having to touch the command line, so it certainly doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary.<p>If you really want to learn to program without learning to use the CLI you probably shouldn&#x27;t pick and OS who&#x27;s entire development environment is built around using the CLI.')
