Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603125854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826924, text='&gt; I think the hard part is preventing users from learning to always click &#x27;yes&#x27; to web-app level permissions just because the page instructs the browser to do so. I don&#x27;t know the solution to this.<p>The key requirement is that putting a site into app mode must be a <i>tradeoff</i>, not a mere expansion of capabilities&#x2F;permissions. There has to be a disincentive to discourage non-app sites from unnecessarily requesting app-mode permissions. The most natural way to accomplish this would be restrictions that make it less practical and more expensive to exploit broader permissions to abuse users. Eg. if you want the browser to prompt me to give your site access to my location data, your site should have to surrender the ability to load trackers and ads from somebody else&#x27;s serversâ€”you should have to serve that up yourself from your own domain, or not at all.<p>This would obviously break a lot about how things are commonly done on the current web, but most of what would be broken is the creepy stuff that we probably shouldn&#x27;t be tolerating to begin with, like the monstrosity that reCAPTCHA has turned into under Google&#x27;s stewardship.')
