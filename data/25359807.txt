They are designed to be resistant to that, not unbreakable. Uncapping is not new and has been around for a long time, it just takes a lot of expensive hardware and expertise. Ultimately, the keys are bits on silicon, and with some acid, a scanning tunneling electron microscope, and a lot of time, the keys can be pulled off.<p>There are even articles from 2016 on how this is possible:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;how-the-fbi-could-use-acid-and-lasers-to-access-data-stored-on-seized-iphone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;how-t...</a><p>It is very unlikely this sort of technique would be used against anyone but the most extreme threat actors (potential terrorists, etc). But with physical access, all bets are off. It isn&#x27;t a matter of if they can decrypt, but how long it will take them given the resources available.')
