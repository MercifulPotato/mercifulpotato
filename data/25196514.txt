The issue is they are still battling out is: is public carry a right or a privilege? Currently the state views it legally as a privilege, per the last supreme court ruling, thus at the moment it does not fall under the purview of the 2nd amendment. And can be restricted not unlike a drivers licence as driving is a privilege. If that changes, then all states would be restricted from placing any requirements on the public possession of weapons. The problem is there  is a lot of precedence dating back to at least the early 1800&#x27;s on the restrictions of carrying in public. See my post above for details on the right vs privilege of public carry.<p>To be clear, the argument that is being played out is not on owning weapons, that has been decided. The argument that is being played out is does the spirit of the 2A incorporate a conferred right to carry in public. History and precedent dating back to the early 1800&#x27;s says it does not. But there is that tricky &quot;bare&quot; part in the 2A as the spirit of the law would assume that they were not just protecting the right to &quot;bare&quot; them on one&#x27;s own private property, given the pre clause about people needed to be armed so that the militias had a good supply of armed men, to ensure a free state.<p>On a related note, I see magazine restrictions as a more direct affront to the 2nd amendment. If they stand, then it can be abstracted to the amount (any amount) of ammunition can be restricted, which means the most restrictive states can and will outlaw everything, but single shot weapons to comply with the letter of the 2A rather than the spirit.')
