Item(by='openasocket', descendants=None, kids=[25864642], score=None, time=1611241747, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25856516, text='You don&#x27;t need any sort of &quot;repetition&quot; of Dedekind cuts to construct the real numbers, it&#x27;s actually fairly straightforward. The set of all Dedekind cuts is a subset of the power set of rational numbers (i.e. each Dedekind cut is a set of rational numbers) satisfying the following properties: for each Dedekind cut A<p>1. A is not the empty set<p>2. A is not the set of all rational numbers<p>3. A is closed downwards, meaning if x is in A and y &lt; x, then y is in A<p>4. A has no greatest element, meaning for all x in A, there is a y in A such that y &gt; x.<p>And each Dedekind cut is in one-to-one correspondence with a real number. You can define the usual arithmetic operations on them, show that every rational number has a corresponding Dedekind cut (for any rational q, we have {x in Q | y &lt; q } as the corresponding cut). I haven&#x27;t seen a proof of the uncountability of Dedekind cuts using the diagonalization argument, but you can prove there is a one-to-one correspondence between Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, which is another construction of the reals. And there is a fairly straightforward proof that those are uncountable using diagonalization.<p>But as you can see, you don&#x27;t need any sort of repetition to do the construction, it&#x27;s just a set of sets of rational numbers satisfying a few simple properties.
