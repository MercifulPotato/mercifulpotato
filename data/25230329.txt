There is literally no difference. If you cannot do a one click install, then how are you supposed to figure out how to make a Pivot table?<p>Of course learning to code is a higher barrier. I don&#x27;t think anybody challenges that. But as you begin using Excel much beyond the trivial I will argue it is actually easier to learn how to code.<p>Code has the advantage, that it is very easy to document and explain with text. Explaining how to do things in a Excel through text is not easy. You will need images, videos etc which are not searchable. You cannot copy-paste and image to repeat an operation from Excel. With code in contrast you can copy and paste in code you find in blogs, help documentation or anywhere else.<p>Basically is much easier to reuse and modify. Once you learn how to code you can advance your capabilities much quicker.')
