C, C++, Java, JavaScript.<p>Examples of tools based on the starting expectation that languages are context-free? Yacc, Bison, Jay.<p>Examples of the problems this causes? Well we&#x27;re using the wrong tool for the job, right from the start. Instead of using an appropriate tool the first thing we do is bend our tools out of shape. We use side-effect actions to subvert the tool&#x27;s model in an uncontrolled way. We don&#x27;t get the full benefits of the tool&#x27;s original model and can&#x27;t rely on its guarantees.')
