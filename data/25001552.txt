What you show or not show, the way you show it just make a different movie.<p>If you make a good movie denouncing dog mistreatment, that is good. The fact it may sexually excite some people mistreating dogs is not really relevant... Those fetishist should see a doctor for being excite by this, and can find plenty of other exciting material on internet.<p>If the movie was targeting those sick people, or was using this displaced erotic tension in mistreating puppies, of course that would be wrong, because it fuels and use this &quot;sickness&quot;... Here this definitely not the case<p>And I hope we won&#x27;t ban gymnastic competitions, or forbid skin-tight pre-teen jeans cause it may excite pedophiles...')
