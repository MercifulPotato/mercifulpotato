Item(by='Crespyl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608122289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440905, text='Being heavily keyboard-first (or only) is one of the reasons I&#x27;ve tended to bounce off of tiling wms I&#x27;ve tried in the past, despite liking the concept generally.<p>I tend to alternate between wanting to do everything from the keyboard and wanting to use my mouse heavily.  I&#x27;ve never liked having to switch my hand between keyboard and mouse when I&#x27;m in the middle of something, so I usually have customizations for both input modes, eg FireFox addons for mouse gestures and vi-keys active simultaneously.<p>For window management I&#x27;ve always liked the idea of tiling wms, but they tend to have less mouse support than I&#x27;d like, or getting the support they do have to work the way I want is more involved.  Ironically, I recall ratpoison being pretty good in that department, when I tried it years ago.<p>These days I use KWin (designed for a primarily floating workflow) with an addon script Krohnkite[0] to add automatic tiling layouts and hotkeys on top of the usual KWin behaviors.  This lets me use all of KWins standard mouse features and extra niceties, but with decent tiling that required almost no configuration to get something that feels completely natural to me.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;esjeon&#x2F;krohnkite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;esjeon&#x2F;krohnkite</a>')
