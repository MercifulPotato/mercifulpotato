To me the interesting thing about Forth-like languages is the postfix&#x2F;rpn syntax, which Kitten moves to far away from. I really liked how `if` in Factor was just a postfix word like any other, where the then- and else-clause was just quotation arguments.<p>I&#x27;m sure Kitten is a fine language, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.')
