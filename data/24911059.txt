Some clever marketeers here &amp; there will stretch this distinction but it&#x27;s an established convention.  The internal architecture between FPGAs and CPLDs is typically different, based on cost of memory vs. logic and typical use cases.  FPGAs tend to be used for higher-capacity computations but require more life support; CPLDs tend to serve smaller, true glue logic applications, where the low config overhead (just apply power) and quicker &amp; simpler power-up is a strong pull.<p>So CPLDs will have some kind of NVRAM wear-out concern, and this is almost always specified as a number of maximum erase &amp; program cycles.')
