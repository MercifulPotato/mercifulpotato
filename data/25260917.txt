Its just harder using Trig: SOH CAH TOA.<p><pre><code>    tan(angle) = opposite-leg &#x2F; adjacent-leg.\n    arctan(opposite-leg &#x2F; adjacent-leg) == angle.\n</code></pre>\nThe more I do this, the more I realize that the linear-algebra approach might be easier... but the Trig approach can certainly do what you are asking for.<p>I mean, I recognize that I&#x27;m just &quot;reinventing cross-product&quot; here to get the length of opposite-leg and the direction of adjacent-leg. But it does seem feasible to do all of these things in Trigonometry alone.<p>A little bit of Linear algebra (cross product creates an orthogonal vector) would definitely make this problem easier.')
