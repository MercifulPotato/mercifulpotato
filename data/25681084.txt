Your shitty 1990 ford fiesta is a very nice 2020 BMW. Your shitty healthcare plan is a great healthcare plan, but the main difference is how nice the plants at the doctors office are. If you want to get a divorce your new partner looks a lot better than your old one. Your furniture isn&#x27;t chipboard from Ikea, it&#x27;s hand made ethically sourced mahogany. Your flights aren&#x27;t economy class, they are business+&#x2F;first class. You don&#x27;t have to run your washing machine, you pay someone to do it.<p>If you want anything interesting, like say a nuclear reactor in your basement, or a jet two seater Canard, you can&#x27;t afford it because no one makes it. Unless you have the connections to start a company to make them, or have literal billions lying around, you don&#x27;t have the resources to do anything but live middle class+.')
