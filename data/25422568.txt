If someone is saying this they&#x27;re taking a huge risk because it if people don&#x27;t take them seriously it&#x27;s over for them.<p>Like we&#x27;ve all been on the internet in tech forums right? Some guy on Github literally threatened to kill me if I didn&#x27;t implement some feature he wanted. This shit is rampant and it spills over to companies populated by the kind of people who hang out on tech forums. Like our community isn&#x27;t that big -- that hackerdude70 who threatened to rape you on your issue tracker because because you dropped sysv support is <i>someone&#x27;s</i> coworker.')
