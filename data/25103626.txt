Item(by='geoah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605466329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100313, text='Interesting project, a couple of points that seemed odd or I&#x27;d like some more information about:<p>- [minor] &quot;MVP&quot;: is used in a number of places and I&#x27;m not sure if it means &quot;minimum viable product&quot; or some weird type of framework (model view presenter or something).<p>- &quot;decentralised&quot;: from the post alone I&#x27;m not sure how this is accomplished, is this a federated or p2p network, does it require some sort infrastructure? if not, how is the browser to browser communication achieved? Web RTC or some other kind of magic? How is peer discovery handled?<p>- &quot;file-based approach to storing data&quot;: do we consider indexdb file-based or did I miss something?<p>- &quot;blockchain&quot;: I cringed when I first read this, mostly cause I don&#x27;t personally consider blockchains a good solution for decentralizing personal data. -- as I continued reading the post I got confused a bit more as it doesn&#x27;t seem that an off the shelf blockhain is being used, but rather the primitives behind blockhains, basically a dag&#x2F;merkle-tree with groups of messages that the author calls blocks. -- in traditional blockchains, only one the longest chain in the possible tree of blocks is considered the accepted&#x2F;verified one, but I&#x27;m not sure how this branch is chosen in this case, or if all paths are accepted, which is fine to do but then I don&#x27;t understand the need to group messages and call this a blockchain. This also fits in with the conflict resolution a the end. In a blockchain fashion the conflict resolution would have been happening during the block creation as the events would have been validated.<p>- open source, contribution, docs: I&#x27;d be interested in learning more about the project but neither the post nor the homepage offers any links to github or other repository for the code or documentation. any way of following development and chatting with the team would be nice, irc, slack, discord, matrix, gitter -- literally anything other than email :P<p>ps. When I found this thread there seemed to be a comment by the author of this framework to which I was trying to reply to. Either the comment has been removed or HN is being flaky, in any case, to the author: this is really interesting, keep up the good work :)')
