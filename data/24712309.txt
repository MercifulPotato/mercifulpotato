From a cost optimization perspective, I don&#x27;t think SQS will ever hit the level of price per instruction that RabbitMQ does. SQS also doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near spitting distance on latency either. For my needs, though, it&#x27;s always done a great job on reliable throughput.<p>If you have folks with deep expertise with RabbitMQ, I can see why you&#x27;d go with it. It means that you can essentially neutralize its operational risks and maximize its strength, which is performance (as well as great integration codebase maturity).')
