We could be launching interstellar probes now with current technology. They&#x27;ll just take 10s&#x2F;100s of thousands of years to get anywhere.<p>The real problems are political, technological and ecological stability.<p>No one has ever built electronics capable of lasting hundreds of thousands of years. It&#x27;s not obvious if it&#x27;s possible because on those timescales everything crumbles to dust, especially if it&#x27;s constantly being abraded by dust and radiation.<p>And if you don&#x27;t put your travellers into long-term suspension, political and cultural stability are even more fragile.<p>And small eco-systems are far less resilient than planet-sized systems - which, it turns out, may not be resilient at all on longer timescales.<p>So the gap between launching Voyager I&#x2F;II and launching a self-replicating probe which can reproduce itself physically <i>and culturally</i> is beyond huge.<p>If you happen to have massive amounts of energy some of these problems get easier, because you can get where you&#x27;re going more quickly. But some remain immensely difficult.<p>Which is why percolation is a much better model. There will inevitably be some attrition in any colonisation program, and there may well be a hard limit on the amount of entropy any colonisation program can survive.')
