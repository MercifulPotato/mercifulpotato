The number of founders I have met who show the attitude that they are trying to change the world and I should be grateful to have a chance to work for them is astonishing. There is nothing wrong with having a business that doesn&#x27;t change people&#x27;s lives in a fundamental way. But don&#x27;t sell me BS that your another social media app is going to change the world in a good way, while you, being a founder, take all the winnings and I, being an ordinary employee, have to overwork without proper compensation and feel good about it.')
