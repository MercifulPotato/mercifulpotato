I live in a major US city (Houston), with excellent air service available in two airports. However, as with nearly all such cities, we are VERY VERY VERY well served by the carriers that &quot;hub&quot; here (Southwest and United). Choosing them usually means a direct flight, and more options for departure times, and probably lower fares.<p>There are situations where choosing something else is viable, but usually only if you&#x27;re picking an airline that hubs in the city you&#x27;re going to -- for example, choosing Delta to fly to Atlanta, or American to fly to Dallas.<p>The tl;dr is that avoiding the MAX from here would be hard without creating a materially worse experience. (Of course, crashing is an even WORSE experience, so...)')
