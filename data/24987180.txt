I owned an original Apple LaserWriter II, which I retired in working condition, an HP LaserJet, which I retired in working condition, and an Epson ET-2650, which works OK. It&#x27;s cheap to operate; I have to pour in some more ink once a year or so. Doesn&#x27;t seem to jam. It is subject to nozzle clogging if not used for a week or two, but a few cleaning cycles fixes that.<p>It&#x27;s on the end of a USB cable and driven from Linux, so it doesn&#x27;t phone home or require an Epson account. Prints fine. It&#x27;s also a scanner, using the terrible SANE software for Linux, but it scans fine once.')
