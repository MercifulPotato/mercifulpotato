If the were a &quot;normal&quot; police reaction (say midway between BLM and this, like in Hong Kong), they would have never gotten inside, and this would be a non-story.<p>Going after Trump fans is just center-left back-slapping, and all the worse because ignoring the police partisanship is extremely reckless and irresponsible.<p>Our civil liberates will continue erode for no good reason, and our institutions will be no safer. Replace the police with something else they&#x27;re not afraid to hold accountable. If there is to be a monopoly of violence, it must be held only in (small d) democratic authority.')
