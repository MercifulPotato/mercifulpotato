Consider the &quot;sometimes behave so strangely&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speech-to-song_illusion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speech-to-song_illusion</a>) for a fascinating illustration of this.<p>For many genres, you fundamentally have repetitions at every power of two interval. For example, the hi-hat repeats every eigth. Kick drum every quarter. Snare every second quarter. Maybe an effect every bar, a rhythmic variation every second bar, phrasing covering four bars. Cadence repeats every eight bars. Melody maybe 16 bars. Verse or chorus 32 bars. ABAB song structure. It&#x27;s repetitions all the way down.<p>As with all &quot;rules&quot; in music you can ignore them to whatever degree you like. But ignore too many and it just sounds like a mess.<p>On a related note (no pun intended), I am starting to notice that, for me, getting tired of a song coincides with &quot;hearing&quot; the repetition of material (e.g. chorus) at larger and larger intervals. Of course you know that the chorus repeats, but here I specifically mean that it sounds like an echo of the chorus a minute ago.')
