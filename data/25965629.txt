It may be interest free margin, but it&#x27;s still margin. It is money that has not settled into your account yet. If it&#x27;s not on margin, you can&#x27;t use it until it&#x27;s settled.<p>Hell if you sell a stock and then immediately buy a new one, that is <i>also</i> margin, because, again, <i>the funds have not settled into your account yet</i>.<p>If you want a Cash account (a non-margin account), you can downgrade, and &quot;You won’t have access to instant deposits or instant settlements&quot;.<p>The fact that you have to do this manually however is, in my opinion, predatory, and setting up a house of cards that will <i>eventually</i> fall over, because users won&#x27;t understand what is actually happening.<p>But the fact that it&#x27;s predatory doesn&#x27;t make it not true.')
