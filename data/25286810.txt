As a non-American, the concept of &quot;at-will&quot; employment is utterly bizarre to me.<p>But, as a matter of practicality, it&#x27;s less likely that,  after you&#x27;ve signed your contract, Google comes to you on your first day and says &quot;I&#x27;m altering the terms of our deal, pray I don&#x27;t alter it further&quot;.<p>This is all mostly about managing unexpected risks, and my point is that it&#x27;s actually pretty common for contracts to contain&#x2F;omit clauses that you <i>really</i> take issue with.
