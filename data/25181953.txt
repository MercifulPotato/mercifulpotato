That it&#x27;s blacker than anything natural, i.e. blacker than objects in real life, that it becomes an &quot;unnatural&quot; level of contrast.<p>It&#x27;s a bizarre idea that started gaining traction maybe around 5 years ago, that using #000 in designs is therefore bad because it doesn&#x27;t occur in nature.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m pushing back against. The #000 on your screen <i>does</i> occur in nature, because its output on your screen is just a normal household black like lots of other objects.')
