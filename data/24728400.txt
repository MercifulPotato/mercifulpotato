Item(by='jasode', descendants=None, kids=[24728931], score=None, time=1602237758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24728102, text='<i>&gt;Do people really mislabel tech debt?</i><p>The most common way I see &quot;technical debt&quot; used is: deliberately code a quick &amp; dirty low-quality-short-term fix to address an immediate problem and we know we&#x27;ll have to clean this up later for a high-quality-long-term solution that&#x27;s easier to maintain.<p>This differs from Ward Cunningham&#x27;s idea of future unknowable specs not aligning with yesterday&#x27;s code.<p><i>&gt;To be contrarian, even if we aren&#x27;t getting it exactly right - is it so bad?</i><p>IMO, it&#x27;s not so bad.  A lot of short and snappy terminology gets a life of its own that doesn&#x27;t match the original meaning.  Examples:<p>- <i>&quot;worse is better&quot;</i> is typically used very differently from Richard Gabriel&#x27;s original usage<p>- <i>&quot;object-oriented&quot;</i> as popularized by C++&#x2F;C# (static binding at compile time as default) is different than Alan Kay&#x27;s original definition (dynamic extreme late binding)<p>- <i>&quot;REST&quot;</i> as &quot;API endpoint as url&quot; is used differently than Roy Fielding&#x27;s paper of Representational State Transfer (http itself exposes the navigation &amp; discovery of system capabilities)<p>Since most people discussing &lt;any_topic&gt; are not going to rigorously research the precise etymology of a term, the popular meanings can drift away from original usage.  Today, politicians use the word <i>&quot;liberal&quot;</i> differently than its earlier associations with &quot;economic freedom&quot;')
