Heroin is not cool at all, nobody does that willingly. Coke is a bit more common in certain scenes like big business.<p>But really, whoever wants to do these drugs is doing it already. Legalising is not suddenly going to make people want to use them. In the Netherlands cannabis is legal but it&#x27;s a really uncool thing to do. Nobody wants to be a stoney. Most people try it once or twice and move on. Others get addicted yes, but really they&#x27;re going to get it one way or another.<p>There&#x27;s also a big range between legalising or promoting something. It can stay forbidden but just remove the huge penalties. Because that&#x27;s what drives those prices up: It attracts the most unsavory types that are willing to take the heavy risk. It drives the huge profits they make and the violence.<p>And yes I&#x27;ve never used any drugs outside of alcohol (which I use infrequently). Not even weed.')
