If we found it, would we even know?  Would we be willing to acknowledge it, and practice it?<p>&gt; But it seems to me that the best way to find the truth (with a small T) is by rationality; the alternative is irrationality which seems unlikely to be effective.<p>This seems like a bit of a false dichotomy to me.<p>Reality is rarely exactly as it seems.<p>&gt;  My hope is that, by collaborating using the tools of reason combined with our own personal Truths, humanity could do our best by everyone involved.<p>Perhaps, assuming (at least) we have no major flaws in our premises, or our systems (democracy theatre).  I do share your hope though.<p>&gt; I don’t know for certain that it will work, but it seems like the best way we’ve got.<p>It may be the best we&#x27;ve got now, but have we put any serious effort into finding alternatives?  The horse and buggy was the best we had until someone invented the car; NASA was the best we had until Elon Musk started SpaceX, and so forth and so on.<p>As we sow, so shall we reap.')
