Figma can make a library of colors&#x2F;fonts, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything to enforce spacing constraints.  It&#x27;s very possible your designer would have been happy with w-6 or w-8, but their design tool didn&#x27;t give them that feedback loop, so they pushed ahead with 28px.<p>I&#x27;ve been curious what a &quot;Tailwind Linter&quot; plugin for Figma would look like....<p>And when you watch Adam&#x27;s screencasts, you&#x27;ll see him take a design which has some &quot;custom&quot; pixel values and then use his judgement to snap it to a built in size.')
