I cannot “handle” Discord. Discord is far worse for me. By default, the interface bombards me with either notifications or “soft”  notifications that change the color of channels to make you wonder what’s going on in there. I’ve come to loathe it. I recently quit Discord, despite the fact that I run a Discord community of several hundred people. Basically just abandoned it. It was killing me. Twitter is like a pleasant minor distraction compared to this quagmire.')
