They all fulfill most of my requirements but have some serious issues as well:<p>- Contentful is fine, but as it&#x27;s very expensive as soon as you want to add second workspace. I don&#x27;t wont to violate the terms of use by creating another account.<p>- Strapi has similar issue as above and it requires Docker container or VM. If possible I&#x27;d like to limit this to something simpler like basic web hosting.<p>- Cockpit works really nicely on my basic web hosting, but it&#x27;s missing some basic documentation<p>What would you propose to try out as a basic CMS that would:<p>- provide a graphical UI to import, manage and edit the data<p>- expose RESTful API to fetch and edit the data<p>- be relatively secure<p>- inexpensive (few $&#x2F;month top)<p>- be self-hosted on basic web hosting or Heroku&#x2F;DigitalOcean&#x2F;Netlify instance')
