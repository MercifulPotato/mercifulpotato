There was a free Flash-like environment that came out around 2005 or so (I think it was called Adobe Air) that you could use to compile a .swf, but it didn&#x27;t have the animation capabilities of proper Flash.  I&#x27;ve always been curious if the Flash animation studio really had anything to offer in terms of usability over, say, modern HTML5 in WebStorm or Visual Studio.<p>I remember being amazed by the sophistication of the animations some Flash developers could put together using it and I always wondered if the tooling made it easier, or if somebody painstakingly drew cells one by one and then spliced them together with an otherwise relatively dumb video creator.  I remember people going on about (then non-free) ColdFusion back in the 90&#x27;s - when I actually got a chance to use it years later I was shocked at how awful it really was and how little the development environment actually offered over a simple text editor like Sublime.')
