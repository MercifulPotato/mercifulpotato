Please put a little more effort before shooting.<p>Lazy web: The Thiel question is &quot;What is something you believe and that nobody agrees with you.&quot;<p>It stands to reason that if you ask a crowd this question, you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of out-of-whack answers (that&#x27;s the <i>whole</i> point) and mostly false answer (&quot;it&#x27;s not that contrarian are often right, but when they&#x27;re right, they&#x27;re very right&quot;).<p>This isn&#x27;t super valuable, it&#x27;s just played for humor value. Each of these Thiel answers could still be interesting in its own right if the reasoning&#x2F;motivation behind it was supplied.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t agree with a contrarian statement, there&#x27;s sometimes gems to be mined in the thinking that led to it.')
