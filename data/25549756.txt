It&#x27;s almost an alternate universe version of Stoicism which I was pretty interested in when I was younger and harder on myself.<p>I definitely agree people way overestimate what they can predict about their choices. There are a few choices you can&#x27;t take back but most of the time you&#x27;re continuously choosing (mainly on auto-pilot) along a path, it&#x27;s not a binary choice. Like most of us could, tomorrow, stop working in software and&#x2F;or move to a different country for example. It would be hard but it&#x27;s not like you chose once and now you&#x27;re stuck forever.')
