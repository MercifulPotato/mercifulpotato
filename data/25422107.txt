Or a &#x27;graffiti wall&#x27; where customers are allowed to contribute to the cafes eclectic art, but it&#x27;s not exactly curated?<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is Reddit wasn&#x27;t started with the idea that it had to vet content, if you put the responsibility for content on the website owner&#x2F;operator.. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong, but I think it&#x27;s hard to draw a parallel on the high street, just because of the scale of the internet I suppose.<p>A debate society perhaps, that keeps rigorous records - in parliament for example, if a Member said something egregious they&#x27;d be personally called out on it, apologies (or resignation) demanded, etc. - but it wouldn&#x27;t be struck from record. People might also think the Speaker ought to have stepped in sooner, etc., but then I suppose that&#x27;s the problem again - there <i>is</i> and always has been the expectation of moderation there, the record keeping isn&#x27;t some passive web form -&gt; database, it&#x27;s human presence.<p>(I&#x27;m honestly not sure where I stand on it, I&#x27;m not arguing one way or the other; just thinking - and putting those thoughts into a passive web form -&gt; database that has only some light retrospective moderation. ;))')
