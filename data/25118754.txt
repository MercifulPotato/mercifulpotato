A quick google seems to show that this holds up — I found a number of other easy sources that say the same thing.<p>They also mentioned wide variation in lactose tolerance, including between the north and south of Italy. You&#x27;d probably want to make sure that Albania is expected to have a similar lactose intolerance as Italy&#x27;s population. Even within Europe the variance is very high — head a country or two north and you suddenly get up to _huge_ population-level tolerance levels of 75-80%+ in Scandinavia.<p>You mentioned butter&#x2F;cheese and the video covers that specifically, saying that especially hard cheeses only have a tiny fraction of the lactose content that milk does (~5%, but varying by the type of cheese). So there&#x27;s no reason for cheese to be treated with the same level of care.<p>Who knows, but I found the video to be as convincing as any other rationale for the taboo.')
