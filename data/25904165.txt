It started with 9&#x2F;11 conspiracies and just spiralled down from there.<p>I engaged with him, because I care deeply about him, but it just got worse and worse. Initially it was 9&#x2F;11 and questions about wealth and power distribution and there are some valid questions that can be asked (although all the 9&#x2F;11 stuff is bonkers). It soon became crazier and crazier, it was about &quot;energy from the vacuum&quot; (essentially a code-word for perpetual motion), how Gates is trying to sterilize the population through vaccination.<p>The irony was that he was seeing himself as a freedom fighter who is speaking the truth to prevent the next fascist regime, completely ignoring that many of the people he followed or supported were literal Nazis.<p>Engaging with him was not possible. He would bombard me with links that somehow were supposed to proof his point. If I brought up counterarguments, he would say that he has strong evidence that one can not believe mainstream media, science, logic ... And that I&#x27;m just a sheep blindly following &quot;propaganda&quot; and he knows better.<p>There was absolutely no way of getting through to him or engaging in any kind of discussion. This was just his monologues and flooding me links (many I suspect he did not even read&#x2F;watch).<p>In the end I had to cut contact, because it was affecting me mentally, the interactions would just leave me exhausted angry and incredibly sad.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution, we need to somehow find a way of how people can be drawn into these crazy web of conspiracies and I don&#x27;t think that creating forums were these crazy things are debated like they are valid opinions is an answer.')
