I understand how my phrasing can be taken as a generalization of everyone in HN, but that was not my intention.<p>I wasn&#x27;t trying to say that everyone in HN was advocating for censorship (if anything, I always feel a little better when I read people defending free speech, they&#x27;re what keep me coming back, at least to this type of posts); I was talking about what those in specific who speak in favor of censorship say.<p>I&#x27;ll edit it to make it less ambiguous. Thanks.')
