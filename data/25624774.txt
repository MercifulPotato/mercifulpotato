Closure is implemented in Java; and the only apparent way to write it is via Emacs.\nThe zero-eth issue I see: functional programming espouses absolutely no side effects, meaning no capability of handling network of physical I&#x2F;O errors\nThe implementation being in Java means that it is not possible to use it in embedded environments (which might not be a problem for some users) but it does mean that performance is JVM limited.\nPersonally, I find the requirement of Emacs to be QUITE odious.  In my opinion, Emacs is an OS&#x2F;environment and not an editor.  I&#x27;ll use it if I want to edit a binary, but when an editor includes a psychotherapist mode (Eliza) it is not suitable for software development.\nI have also seen some quite talented researchers&#x2F;engineers spend multiple seconds trying to remember the sequence to do X in Emacs, when it would have taken FAR less time in vi or vim.  Too many parentheses make the code UNMAINTAINABLE in a production environment.')
