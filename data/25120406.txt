Those of us on upper quad never locked our doors. This had apparently been a thing on upper quad all the way back to the start of the university and that only changed when we moved to the new buildings with electronic locks. I&#x27;d say once we moved into the new dorms 75% or more of us were jamming the doors&#x2F;locks so that they wouldn&#x27;t lock. This only really started to change after &quot;the adults&quot; started reprimanding people for refusing to lock their doors (There were concerns about ability to compartmentalise&#x2F;hide in an active shooter situation as well as potential fire safety issues).<p>It was a really unique and pleasant experience. So much less stressful being able to completely trust the people around you. It&#x27;s a shame that the tradition has started to die out.')
