I&#x27;m not sure whether there&#x27;s a better way to balance the admin-load against all the scamming, or to avoid &#x27;favoring&#x27; one nation&#x27;s industry or other. When you do something on processors, you&#x27;ll probably have to keep the door open to all big &amp; small European actors, right? I feel all the administrative overload is a way to avoid all kinds of political problems.<p>Yes, Europeans complain about bureaucracy from the EU and here about the ERC, but the moment someone comes with more &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; processes, either you see some 10+MEUR-level abuse quite quickly, or you get some blast about bad management of the tax payers money, and calls for more oversight.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution, and without a united EU military&#x2F;defense budget I don&#x27;t see anything DARPA-like emerging. And it seems only European military budgets (still sovereign) and regional budgets (regionalism being, to me, the biggest flaw in the modern EU vision) seem spent on &#x27;low admin we trust you let&#x27;s try this just convince this panel of scientists and admins&#x27; funding. While I think it&#x27;s great for labs&#x2F;research funding, for product derisking and creating competitive edges for the local industry, and for SMEs and overall high tech employment, you&#x27;re not going to create a semiconductor industry like this.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the results of several ERC consortia projects and am sometimes impressed with what EU-based research (academics+smb+large groups) can do with so little money (on each subject) and, yes, so much admin overhead.')
