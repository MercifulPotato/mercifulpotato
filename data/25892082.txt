Hence many companies stopped shipping overnight.<p>The problem is the worst for supermarket and perishable, see many news about cargos stuck at the border and expiring. The UK relies very heavily on imported food. It&#x27;s really scary if we can&#x27;t import food anymore and grocers are going bankrupt with cargo rotting at the borders.')
