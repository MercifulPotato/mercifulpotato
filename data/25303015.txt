She sent it to him, and this changed her life.<p>I mean that&#x27;s sad and all, but there are food lines in Texas and all over the country, and the politicians are too inept or unwilling to do anything about it. Also, police seem to be able to murder people or at least have a reckless disregard for life, and the system doesn&#x27;t prosecute them for it intentionally. There seems to be wide scale corruption on all levels of government and institutions, but nothing to see here. There&#x27;s also a mass incarceration problem that exists to keep people in jobs and for profit prisons stock up. Oh and mass surveillance that was never resolved. If you get sick enough, you&#x27;re go bankrupt and probably end up in essentially debtor&#x27;s prison.<p>Ignore all the big problems, think of the children.')
