The number where there isn&#x27;t a better metric available is likely even smaller. If you are a transcriptionist, output is nicely metered—many get paid by the word. Even most admin assistants have so much phone work and other jobs where time in O365 is only a fraction of their job.<p>I think this is mostly a big todo about nothing. Any manager who uses something as basic as this as a metric is almost certainly worthless regardless.')
