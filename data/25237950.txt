Amazon provides almost everything in one store - so I don&#x27;t have to buy at half a dozen shops - combined with great customer service. I can even buy used books from many sellers via Amazon. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t want to support regular shops but as a customer Amazon is just the most convenient option.<p>Example: a local book chain sells me a book for 10% more money and takes 4 weeks to order it - Amazon sells it cheaper and it&#x27;s delivered 2 days later.')
