It&#x27;s because a lot of devs are coming into the web ecosystem having primarily learned frameworks at boot camps (or on their own).<p>Most front-end devs that I&#x27;ve worked with who started in the last 5-10 years have such framework-specific knowledge that they can&#x27;t really jump between frameworks or work on vanilla JS.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is categorically bad. I use heavy abstractions on top of web languages (TypeScript, Webpack, Sass, Svelte) even for static sites, so I&#x27;m not arguing that they should be writing vanilla JS.<p>It&#x27;s just interesting that JS is so flexible, and some of these abstractions are so strong, that you can learn something like React without really learning JS at all. It&#x27;s like a DSL on top of JS.')
