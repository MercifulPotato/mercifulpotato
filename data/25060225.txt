Your partner&#x27;s assets become &quot;yours&quot;. You get to live like you were making more money, because costs will not scale to equal 2 incomes. In fact, many costs can half, and other savings are significant too, like taxes. 2 people making $200k are taxed much less than one making $400k. If you combine finances, you&#x27;re also investing more for retirement and will see a larger compounding effect over time.')
