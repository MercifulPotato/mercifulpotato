This makes a lot of tricky things easier, but there are pitfalls.<p>Years later, in the fifteenth re-implementation of some part of some service, somebody is going to forget to read that bit. Or an errant database migration isn&#x27;t going to transfer it properly. Or the database will be leaked, and all of the &quot;deleted&quot; content will still be there (e.g. the Parler dump). Or a race condition will cause the check to occasionally be ignored every other Sunday.<p>Discovering that this is happening can be next to impossible. An application might read the deleted bit correctly when generating the ordered list of stuff you&#x27;ve looked at, but might not read it correctly (or might deliberately ignore it) when generating your advertising profile or when making content recommendations. I swear I&#x27;ve seen this on Amazon, though of course, I&#x27;ll never be able to prove it.<p>Chilling effects &#x2F; social cooling includes stuff like this. &quot;I&#x27;m not even going to click on that, because I don&#x27;t trust the platform to clear my history properly.&quot;')
