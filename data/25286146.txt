See the ridiculously unethical actions the Trump administration is taking against TikTok after they ruined his Tulsa rally, for example.<p>&gt; Companies have no allegiance to the people and must be checked.<p>And governments do? Governments abuse their power to the maximum extent legally possible all the time. Often, they go further. A cursory reading of United States history will show you that the government is not your friend, it never was, and at every moment possible it is also vying for more power, more control, more surveillance.<p>As long as Apple has not turned into a monopoly there isnâ€™t really a concern here. There is an available market for the products you want. Just because they are not as capable as the ones Apple makes, does not mean you get to coerce Apple into doing your bidding.<p>&gt; &gt; Support free products with your wallet instead<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not how society works.<p>But it is. There is a flourishing community around libre products. The PinePhone has been a hit. There are large communities around reasonably open Android phones.')
