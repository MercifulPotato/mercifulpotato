Got away from it, but I still have an OSS project I work on here and there which is a &quot;FB like&quot; social network product, and another which is a &quot;Reddit like&quot;. Neither currently has a <i>lot</i> of specific support for decentralization &#x2F; federation, other than use of RSS and ActivityStrea.ms at the moment. But I would like to pick up some activity in this area again at some point and work on integrating with the &quot;Fediverse&quot; and maybe look at TBL&#x27;s SOLID and see if there&#x27;s anything there to incorporate.<p>Time is the biggest challenge, unfortunately.')
