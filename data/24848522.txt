I understand <i>why</i> clinical trials are needed — because otherwise we&#x27;d still be using mysterious compounds and procedures without having a clue if they actually work — but I believe that at some point we&#x27;d become so advanced with knowing how the human body works that we won&#x27;t have to do that, and so could progress much, much faster, while knowing that our treatments work, and theoretically, instead of experimentally, proving that they should work.')
