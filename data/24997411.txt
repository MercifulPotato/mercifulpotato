It does say that they&#x27;re thinking of suggesting that the private dwelling exemption is removed, but that covers a wide range of options:<p>1) Remove it and criminalise &quot;stirring up&quot; in private dwellings<p>2) Remove it and add private conversations in private dwellings, thus continuing to allow stirring up in private dwellings unless it&#x27;s a public meeting in someone&#x27;s home<p>3) Remove it and add protections for private conversations, thus adding protections for hate speech that are private conversations but not in the home.<p>It&#x27;s a consultation, this is how Law Commission consultations work.
