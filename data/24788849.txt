This isn&#x27;t a matter of free speech and never has been.<p>If you call up Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern in the middle of afternoon drive hour and he doesn&#x27;t like what you have to say, he&#x27;s going to hang up the phone on you (assuming you could get through in the first place).  This is no different - google has absolutely no obligation to host your garbage on their site.<p>If you want to post conspiracy theories, go buy a server from dell, pay for a business line from your ISP, and setup your own site, and host your own content.  If the content you&#x27;re hosting violates laws, it&#x27;ll probably get taken down.<p>You&#x27;re free to say whatever you want, nobody else is REQUIRED to listen to you, host you, or advertise you and never has been.  About the only way out of that box is if you can prove they were discriminating against you because you were a member of a protected class (in the US) and not because of the content of your data.')
