Item(by='a4444f', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607153195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310779, text='The author has experienced switching perspectives, therefore concludes that what has remained unchanged is reality. But it is possible to switch realities (timelines) as well, though writing about that kind of experiences is kind of pointless, because the new &quot;reality&quot; may not include old writings, and if switching realities is possible, than humans beings are not what they are commonly considered to be. (and one may as well write something on the surface of a lake, and expect permanency). How many downvotes for this comment?')
