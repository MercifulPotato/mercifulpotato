Item(by='rc-1140', descendants=None, kids=[24654252], score=None, time=1601572257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652502, text='I get <i>why</i> this is being downvoted but it&#x27;s still a very good point: an ex-con needed a previously-established connection with someone who just so happens to be CTO of a <i>reasonably successful</i> startup who knows another engineering lead at a fintech company who took mercy on the ex-con&#x27;s predicament to get a job.<p>It&#x27;s brazen, I admit, but the ex-con part can be substituted for other more fortunate people, like those with little experience, non-traditional backgrounds, those who never got advanced degrees (undergraduates mostly). The oh-so-different software industry isn&#x27;t that different from any other industry these days in that it&#x27;s more about <i>who</i> you know rather than <i>what</i> you know to find employment, but the added bonus for software types is that often enough it&#x27;s both! Maybe I&#x27;ll look back at this comment and feel it&#x27;s overly pessimistic, but I hope that&#x27;s because things changed for the better.')
