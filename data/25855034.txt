Even though we know these people committed these heinous crimes, there&#x27;s going to be a line for where it&#x27;s not ok to sentence someone to death because the proof is not airtight. When cases are close to that line, there&#x27;s always the chance that they weren&#x27;t actually guilty. I believe this will be the case no matter where that line is.')
