Why? Most of them because they <i>haven’t really tried anything</i>.<p><i>To fail, you have to try. If you never try, you never fail.</i><p>Since early on, we take pre-planned paths such as standardized testing and getting A’s. As long as you do nothing dumb and do what teachers tell you, you will be fairly successful. Just be complacent and follow others. Simple, right?<p>Real-life is not like that.<p>Once you graduate college and <i>you are finally dropped off at the so-called “real world” with no instructions</i>.<p>Most people struggle with how to be successful. You try things and you fail.<p>The first failures are rough because you aren’t used to them, so they are cruelly painful. Like when you told that one girl in fourth grade you liked her, but she rejected you. Well, maybe it’s not that painful.<p>You try things and you fail. Then one of two things takes place. You either try again and learn and improve or you avoid pain altogether.<p>Again, neither is right nor wrong. Each one comes with pros and cons.<p>The first option of trying things and failing is a lot tougher short-term but benefits people long term. Few people take this road because<p><i>humans love comfort and avoid pain</i>.<p>The second option of avoiding pain is far more common and<p><i>causes people to stick with jobs and careers they don’t like because it’s “too hard” to change. This road is easier in the short-term but leads many people to become depressed and “giving up,”</i><p>which is what I’m talking about when people grow up and “lose ambition.”&quot;')
