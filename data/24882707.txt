I never said that polls are always wrong. My political desires don&#x27;t hinge on the current polls being wrong.<p>I&#x27;m simply asking a question about whether the pollsters have corrected their methodologies. There was clearly something wrong in 2016 when they repeatedly failed to predict the GOP primaries and failed to predict swing states and even some states that weren&#x27;t considered swing states in the general election.<p>You&#x27;re right that I haven&#x27;t read the analysis that you say exists. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking for it. Which pollsters have done the reweighting on their 2016 data and shown that they then align with reality?')
