Short activists don&#x27;t help make better competitors.<p>If you want the market to encourage people to investigate fraud and bad news, then they need to be able to profit off of announcing it.<p>When people <i>don&#x27;t</i> figure out fraud, the company still suffers eventually but it does so much harder and hurts more people.  For example, if Enron&#x27;s cheating had been exposed a lot earlier it could have been stopped.<p>Shorting has real and important benefits.  And real downsides too, when shorters try to tank companies that had perfectly acceptable fundamentals.  But it&#x27;s definitely a tradeoff, not shorters being parasites.')
