They&#x27;re ui toolkits.<p>And I never claimed that. Again, as a user the difference between gnome, cinnamon or unity is not all that interesting, so I simply wrote &quot;gtk-whatever&quot; as an umbrella term and &quot;qt-whatever&quot; for kde plasma and lxqt.<p>My basic question is the following:<p>- If I find software that is only available as a snap, I will use snap. It works on any distro.<p>-If I find it only available as a flatpak, I will use that. It works on any distro.<p>- If I find only an app image, I will use that. It works on any distro.<p>- I get an installer from some big commercial software. It unpacks itself in &#x2F;opt or uses a docker image or... . Again works anywhere.<p>Why should I, as a user, care which distribution mechanism you chose if they all work anyways? Why is &quot;fragmentation&quot; an issue, if whichever you choose works everywhere regardless?')
