I may remove it, but for now I want to garner discussion.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how disallowing a reference for a map key would cause repetition and space wasting. Keys are generally small, so a reference would in many cases end up taking a similar amount of space. Can you talk more about allowing references as keys? I need different points of view NOW, before I finalize v1 of the format! The negative is that it complicates processing, since you could reference a non-keyable value and attempt to use it in a key.<p>Everybody PLEASE chime in with your thoughts on the format, because I want to make sure I get it as close to right as I can before I finalize V1!')
