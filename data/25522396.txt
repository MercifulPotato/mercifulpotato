I love the automatic updates, I feel safer with the sandboxing, and I appreciate the convenience of visiting a single point to download almost everything I want to put on a new Mac.<p>I also cherish having control over subscription renewals from one list and the Apple&#x27;s easy refund process in the event of a third-party app not turning out to be worth the money (or an outright scam).<p>And as a dev I like knowing that anything <i>I</i> publish will be available to all Mac users.<p>I do hate the crappy App Store.app UI though. Feels like navigating a clunk web page, and why the fluff did they remove the download progress stats?? You have to hit F4 to see the actual size&#x2F;downloaded numbers in the Launchpad (or in the Applications folder I guess).')
