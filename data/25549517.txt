Some of it is used for protecting the structure (ablative armor, essentially). But that requires much less water than is actually used. This is why Sea Launch&#x27;s launch platform also had a water deluge system. They&#x27;re far enough out that the only people that can really hear it are the control ship, but they have the deluge to help keep the exhaust from scorching the launcher.<p>Similarly, the Saturn V MLP had &quot;rainbirds&quot; to wet it down, even though the vast majority of the water used was down the exhaust trench for sound suppression.')
