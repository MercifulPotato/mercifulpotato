I wanted to print off a bunch of recipes to put in a binder and was very happy with how clean and simply formatted each recipe was, often with room to write notes on the paper. My only wish is they would implement a &quot;family&quot; option where I could easily share my library of recipes with my girlfriend without having to share them one at a time.')
