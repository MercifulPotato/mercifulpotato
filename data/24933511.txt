Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603995507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931475, text='&gt; If Grubhub actually took a stand and showed they not only did not do this sort of behavior, I would actually use it, and I would pay the premium for delivery (to make sure the restaurant makes money and the driver makes money).<p>You may well faithfully adhere to this promise, but the reality is, most people simply don&#x27;t know (and it would be generous for me to assume they would care even if they DID know).<p>So much of the GH&#x2F;DD&#x2F;UE model is reducing friction to drive transactions. Click button, throw some amount of money at the company, receive product. Just like Amazon.<p>Having to stay abreast of the news, the competitive landscape, the various companies&#x27; business practices, and then factor that all in when making an online transaction, is probably too much to ask of a consumer when the entire point of the service is not having to know or care too much about the details.<p>You could even argue one of the features of these services is abstracting away things that people don&#x27;t WANT to know about- Tipping policies, labor practices, what the parking is like at the restaurant, how pleasant the staff is to deal with, how the owner&#x27;s doing today, etc.<p>I&#x27;m with you- I almost never order anything delivery, I pick up my own orders on the rare occasion I takeout, etc. This whole delivery gig economy thing makes me pretty uncomfortable. But we&#x27;re a rare breed. (and I&#x27;m not claiming to be better than most people; I order far too much from Amazon than I&#x27;d like to admit).')
