I think universities are systematically not valuing teaching enough in my opinion. That said, at my university (UCLA), if you are a great teacher, teaching large, popular and impactful classes; you will get recognized and promoted for it. But when people bring up the publish or perish trope, it&#x27;s not about spending time building better classes and teaching material.<p>In terms of 6-12 months, if you don&#x27;t have that much time, it&#x27;s likely your past bets haven&#x27;t paid off and people aren&#x27;t that willing to give you more resources. I definitely had lots of projects that still haven&#x27;t paid off 7 years into them; but I get to keep playing on them because some of my other bets have. That&#x27;s the way it works, but I don&#x27;t think that is that bad. There are many professors with terrible ideas that they think are great and are indignant that no one will support them unconditionally.')
