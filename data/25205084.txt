Even outside and wearing a N95&#x2F;KN95&#x2F;KF94&#x2F;FFP2&#x2F;FFP3 mask, I still keep a distance - the bigger, the better. Sometimes people get closer, I step backwards to keep the distance - I don&#x27;t care what they think about it, all PPE does is to reduce the threat, it does not eliminate it completely. Also, when I&#x27;m being selfish, I make sure the wind blows into my back or sideways, ideally when there are no people around, not into my face. Very rarely for very brief moments and possibly when there&#x27;s a possibility of people passing by, I could wear a ASTM Level 3 surgical mask, but I am not gonna wear a mask with no certification!<p>Also, it&#x27;s surprised how people don&#x27;t understand the fluid&#x2F;air dynamics and actually want happens during basic activities. There are so many ways to breathe in concentrated contaminated air without even realizing it.<p>For example, getting a concentrated exposure when you open doors, when the the person at the drive-thru opens there small window and all the inside air flows right into your car, etc.<p>Well, of course, these are not highly contaminated spaces, but, still, we oversimplify things all the time.<p>Another vector is dog walking. In Spain, a study showed that dog owners have 78% change of getting COVID. How? Well, we know dogs and cats can carry the virus, so, you play with your dog with a mask, you give them the virus, they give it to the dogs they encounter during the walk, and that dog gives it to their owner.')
