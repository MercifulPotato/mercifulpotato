If Apple has any concrete concerns, it&#x27;s that developers would prefer to pay Amazon for the time they need on a Mac rather than purchase an entire Mac for themselves. It&#x27;s an anti-developer move.<p>This idea that Apple is worried about an EC2 instance replacing a personal Mac is way, way, out there. What is much more likely is that a developer buys a lower cost, not Apple laptop and uses that to connect to a Mac on EC2 for the few tasks that require a Mac. Again, it&#x27;s an move _against_ developers, it&#x27;s not designed to make the lives of developers any easier.')
