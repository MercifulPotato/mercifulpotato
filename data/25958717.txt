Then he was ousted by the investors. Then the company was acquired by a giant corporation. It all went downhill from there. At some point I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and quit. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to betray my users, I felt personally responsible for what I put out. Now, it&#x27;s increasingly a money-making machine. Many sane people left. There are now KPIs tied to metrics. There are now managers and hierarchies. There are managers who have no clue what they&#x27;re doing. There are now a&#x2F;b tests, server-side settings, dark patterns, unwanted algorithms, omnipresent analytics, and user manipulation. It&#x27;s effectively a B2B company now, and your attention is the product.<p>Even though I quit 5 years ago, it still pains me to see what has become of something I put my soul into, something I lived for, something I enjoyed using myself and recommended to everyone.')
