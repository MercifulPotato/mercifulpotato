Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[25975975], score=None, time=1612067038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975809, text='&gt; Who knows what would have happened had RobinHood and others not shut down buying. I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have retired.<p>This is another misconception: Robinhood didn&#x27;t exactly <i>choose</i> to shut down buying. The extreme volatility required significant extra collateral to be posted, which Robinhood probably didn&#x27;t have the money for. This is why they had to do an emergency raise of a billion dollars and draw down their credit lines.<p>Robinhood also makes all accounts margin accounts by default. They try to hide the fact that trades don&#x27;t settle until T+2 days by making the margin invisible to the end-user, but it still draws down their credit. Robinhood Instant [transfers] also consume margin while they wait for incoming bank transfers. Without an infinite supply of credit, it just wasn&#x27;t possible to allow unlimited buying (margin buying in most cases, due to T+2 settling or bank transfer delays) of GME stock.<p>Congrats on the value of your shares, but I would implore you to come up with an exit strategy. Even &#x2F;u&#x2F;DFV has been slowly taking money off the table during this entire run-up. Don&#x27;t let yourself be one of those people talking about how you had a paper gain of a million dollars for a brief moment in 2021 before you lost it all.')
