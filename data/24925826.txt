Partly because &lt;atomic&gt; doesn&#x27;t compile in Clang&#x27;s C++11 mode (which the .cmake files use when testing for atomics), and partly because it can&#x27;t detect Clang&#x27;s host&#x2F;target (don&#x27;t know) triple. I recall getting build-time failures as well as CMake setup problems.')
