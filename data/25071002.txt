Most people don&#x27;t even use DI in their tests. DI is just spaghetti code.<p>The main thing holding C# back is the culture around the DI and weird hostbuilder code associated with ASPNET. If you just skip that part, it&#x27;s great. Unfortunately a lot of web examples, solutions, and code libraries themselves are ASPNET-focused, and more and more of the code becomes some truly bizarre, unreadable framework injection in an inside-out fluent builder.')
