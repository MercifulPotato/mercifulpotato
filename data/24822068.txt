Remember all 1-bit ReLU (linear non-linear rectifier) are just are one way to think about the same thing as say a dirac function using the language of mathmatical physics. Better to pretend that something like all ad networks or dynamic pieces of web browsers could be influenced to do stuff using other pieces of hardware influenced software that apparently already coded to do that. Solve the &quot;well known&quot; abc or apple google microsoft (lua) = use the wisdom of the crowds to look at symbolic differentiation. Or look at it in 2 elementary bit boolean l-r modular problems so solve the calculus of arbitrary excitations&#x2F;fluxtions in inductive-coinductive in the calculus of categories of ends and coends using modern elementary mathmatical physics just by using noetherian algebras (understsnding why things don&#x27;t commute rather than associative properties create transitive closures). Understand why noether&#x27;s theorem and abelian categories are more powerful aways of computing and energy saving by energy scavenging power. Sorry for the sameless plugin and hit me up at sashmit@gmail.com if you want to know more or collaborate. All this can be understood more clearly by treating neural networks as more elementary computer vision applied to more mature algos with more ethical ways of using it.')
