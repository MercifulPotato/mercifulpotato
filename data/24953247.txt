If it was just limited to the supercharger network I would somewhat understand, it&#x27;s their network and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge deal to disallow salvage cars on it. But they are removing the ability to charge even at third party chargers, basically removing any ability to go on a reasonable road trip with your car, with no warning. Completely insane, especially since many salvage cars just had body damage.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t want a car connected to the internet. The behavior of my 50k vehicle should not change unexpectedly because some guy in silicon valley pushed an update.')
