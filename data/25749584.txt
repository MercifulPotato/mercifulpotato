Nothing is stopping Parler from plugging in and managing their own servers. I see AWS as a convenience, and as such I don&#x27;t think anyone is entitled to it.<p>As a side note: I would like to take a minute to remind the youngsters that no one owes them a revolution. If you want to go fight against the status quo, you should <i>really</i> have a plan for when the status quo fights back.')
