Normally when someone turns to face you they&#x27;ll spin around while staying in a head-upward orientation. That puts your right hand and their right hand on opposite sides because they&#x27;ve spun around, while your reflection&#x27;s right hand stays on the same side as your own because the mirror <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> flip anything.<p>If you instead expect the other person to turn to face you by doing a hand stand, then you can say &quot;Why is my reflection&#x27;s head on top?! It should be on the bottom! The mirror has flipped it vertically!&quot;')
