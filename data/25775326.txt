I suppose logic could be a bit more on the objective impersonal side of things but philosophy and science are definitely not. That is, only if logic is actually logic in the sense of logic. If one start talking about tings like &#x27;logical falacies&#x27; (e.g. ad homininem, argument from authority and so on) as often is done on forums like these one is already very far from anything objective. For one thing, one is probably inclined to be much more severe in pointing out &#x27;logical falacies&#x27; in statements that one disagrees with rather than in statement that one agrees with.')
