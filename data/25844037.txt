They don&#x27;t act in a constructive way.<p>Let&#x27;s take Timnit&#x27;s paper for example. She found out that Google had been using a biased language model in search. The bias was like - &#x27;male&#x27; association with &#x27;doctor&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;woman&#x27; association to &#x27;nurse&#x27;. But she didn&#x27;t show how this is harming anyone in a concrete way. Just theoretical. And then she offered no solution, just blaming the work of others, using her paper as a soap box to raise scandal and make herself holier than thou.')
