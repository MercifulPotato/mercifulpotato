Now, I&#x27;m not an expert either, but my sister is and you&#x27;d get an earful from her for your comment as it is potentially very harmful advice.<p>I hope readers here hear my concern more than anything: don&#x27;t take parenting advice from random people on HN! If you&#x27;re considering &quot;cry it out&quot; parenting, or its inverse, attachment parenting, talk to a professional before ignoring your crying baby because it&#x27;s &quot;manipulative&quot; or &quot;can soothe itself&quot;. We&#x27;re talking about a developmental stage that comes before -object permanence- and the comment above refers to -emotional manipulation- from an infant?<p>Please folks, try to understand when you&#x27;re talking about something outside of your field...')
