Perhaps you imagined some kind of 6 month training program?<p>You can be very productive in your first few days, weeks and months but in terms of <i>experience</i>, the topic at hand, internally and externally that time doesn’t have any value on a resume.<p>This is on the assumption that you are looking for ‘experience’ as in <i>experienced team developers who can focus on this particular business&#x27;s goals</i>.  If you’re looking for people “experienced at writing code in [some language]“ then, yes, any time spent writing code in the job is experience.<p>If you work somewhere with a large code base and a fluid enough engineering team it does indeed take many months before one can see the bigger picture, and expectations of developers are set accordingly.<p>This is especially so with infrastructure &#x2F; dev tools &#x2F; internal tools where new projects are often driven by individuals.  You have to use the infra itself — a lot — before you will have the insight into what can be improved.')
