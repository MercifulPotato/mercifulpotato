So that generations to come are harmed by this shit. It&#x27;s absurd.<p>In Germany, we technically have the &quot;Rat der Wissenschaften&quot; but it basically has no purpose. It&#x27;s just there for nothing, and has no power over any other instance.<p>The irony is that in Germany the only instance that was able to do anything against the misinformation cases was actually the Bundeskartellamt, which serves the purpose of finding out wrong flows of money and does financial audits in illegal syndicates.')
