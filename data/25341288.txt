Pulling over does not mean a thing. If a small number of cases go violent, and you don’t know which ones, you cannot just ignore them. If 99.9% of contacts are non-violent, a cop who makes 1000 contacts is dead.<p>Violence has never gone down from defunding. Although this should be obvious, an alarming number of people don’t seem to be thinking rationally on that topic. It has certainly gone up after defunding, however.')
