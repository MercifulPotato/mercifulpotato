Here&#x27;s a good thread on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CookingIssues&#x2F;status&#x2F;1084888303613214720?s=19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CookingIssues&#x2F;status&#x2F;1084888303613214720...</a><p>There have been studies which get self-selecting individuals to test their reaction, which would make #2 less likely. The best study, I think is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;027869159390012N" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;027869...</a>, where none of the individuals tested knew what they were being tested for. Maybe all msg sensitive people opted out of any food challenge, but that&#x27;s not always the case, given the 2000 study in the linked tweet.<p>I think #1 is the most likely explanation, fwiw.')
