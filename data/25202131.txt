What do we do then?<p>How about simply pulling the plug of the computer or even just the network cable?<p>More to the point, how would an AI even learn about such mysterious exploit if it doesn&#x27;t have access to an external network in the first place? Even run-of-the-mill supercomputer centres aren&#x27;t directly connected to the internet for security reasons, so why change that with a potentially dangerous computer program?')
