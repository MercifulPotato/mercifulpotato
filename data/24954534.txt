In 2005 the entire web market in my country <i>was</i> PHP with a few uncool Java enterprisey jobs here and there.<p>Being able to mix PHP and HTML code was brilliant and setting up PHP on a server was child&#x27;s play compared to Java. Because state was stored in the DB and individual pages were ephemeral, we didn&#x27;t have any issues with e.g. memory usage or performance.\nAt that time I was already familiar with C, C++ and C# and I didn&#x27;t find it worse to use PHP. It was a good match for the job.')
