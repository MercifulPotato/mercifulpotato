Remember the home computing landscape of the 80s &#x2F; early 90s but also the diversity in server architectures and OSes</i><p>I&#x27;m not so sure. Or at least, I don&#x27;t think a balkanized landscape like that would last very long before the market converges on some type of de-facto standard, much like things ultimately did in the 80&#x27;s&#x2F;90&#x27;s, and late alternative ::ahem, Itanium:: failed to gain traction in the market.<p>Also, instead of a variety of (often vendor-specific) OS&#x27;s, we&#x27;re really only dealing with two major candidates: Windows &amp; Linux. Linux with its multiple distributions is more complicated, although AFAIK the main server distros there are Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian, and CentOS. So the chips that best support these OS&#x27;s would likely be the one the industry converges on, assuming it&#x27;s available as a commodity component. (i.e., not just in a propriety cloud) And it would be smart to make sure desktops&#x2F;laptops can run the flavor of chips running in clouds because that&#x27;s where much development&#x2F;coding happens.')
