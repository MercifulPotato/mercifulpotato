If it helps type faster by keeping the device from jamming, then... it helps type faster. If it only jammed because you type too fast, you could(&#x2F;must) just slow down, no fancy layouts necessary. It didn&#x27;t jam because you pressed any key too fast, it jammed when you pressed <i>adjacent typebar</i> too fast, and with proper layout (making sure that common digrams weren&#x27;t on adjacent typebars) these situations could be minimized.<p>Weird thing in these discussions is considering that <i>most jam-free possible layout</i> and <i>as fast as possible</i> was somehow different design goal. But, in world of early mechanical typewriters, it was the same! You couldn&#x27;t have &quot;fast&quot; layout that jammed because it wouldn&#x27;t be fast, and if you had jam-free layout it probably was fast, because it weren&#x27;t forcing you to depress each key completely before pressing next.')
