I&#x27;d be surprised if the majority of sales made via push-based advertising which wouldn&#x27;t have been made in a pull-based system are actually beneficial to the end user (loosely measured by some combination of regret and opportunity cost), and a system that exists purely to extract value from the populace is not worth keeping around in my opinion, especially as a roundabout and inefficient method of payment.<p>I think most of the downsides would be in second-order effects (like the paywall bit you pointed out) and in effective enforcement (advertising dollars might just shift to realistic-looking review sites for example). I&#x27;m hopeful that free content would still be produced, especially given that for my own personal use I&#x27;ve noticed that ads correlate negatively with quality, and with a few exceptions like academic publishing all the best content is free and without ads even in today&#x27;s world where it&#x27;s easy to ad ads to a site.')
