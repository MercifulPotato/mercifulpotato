By your usage of “goto,” I feel like you’re implying like this is a negative thing. But state is an inherent part of computation. A Turing Machine can be seen as a slightly more powerful state machine, and most if not all of the code that we write can be easily modeled with the less powerful state machine.<p>And no, functional programming does not actually help this.')
