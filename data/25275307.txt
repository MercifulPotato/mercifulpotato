They haven&#x27;t made any &quot;I have to buy this right fucking now!&quot; worthy revolutionary improvements in the iDevices lineup recently, the Western market for smartphones is near saturation - and with Corona tanking the US economy for wide masses, people don&#x27;t have the hundreds of dollars just lying around to shell off for the latest iteration.<p>I believe that both the last (horribly expensive at that, and still people kept buying it) Mac Pro and the new M1 lineup is a sign that Apple wants to shift back attention to the non-mobile sector - because the competition there is asleep on the wheels. Everyone uses Intel who has managed to fuck up its lineup for many years now, Microsoft has thoroughly pissed off the privacy-conscious folks with Win10 and (judging by a random walk through a Mediamarkt) build quality in Windows laptops still hovers barely above &quot;acceptable&quot; - cheap plastics, tiny touchpads and abysmal screens are the norm, whereas Apple is only robust aluminium cases, <i>giant</i> touchpads and crystal clear, bright screens.<p>What I&#x27;m <i>really</i> excited for is when Apple decides to put an Mx chip into an iMac, paired with a decent AMD GPU. The thermals and energy profile should be allowing a <i>lot</i> more leeway for resource usage than a Macbook...')
