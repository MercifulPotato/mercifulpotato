Now I&#x27;m looking for something new to invest my time in.<p>My expertise is in the field of artificial intelligence, and with great experience both in front-end (React, Next.js, Typescript) and back-end (Elixir, Python, Rails) since I worked as CTO for many years.<p>I have a great interest in the following areas:<p>- Digital Ads, how they can be optimized through AI (mainly when it comes to retargeting)<p>- Latin America in general<p>- Note Taking: How AI + Humans can increase productivity and understanding of concepts, something well oriented to RoamResearch (Zettelkasten) but simpler from the user&#x27;s perspective<p>But I&#x27;m open to other ideas.
