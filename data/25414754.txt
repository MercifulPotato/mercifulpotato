Remember that Bloomberg &quot;the Chinese put spy microchips on our motherboards&quot; story?<p>I&#x27;m not accusing the WaPo of being distrustful here, I just think that in these cases the potential for manipulation, half-truths and technical mistakes from their sources is very high, and without either knowing who these sources are or what are the concrete element they&#x27;re using to make their conclusions I find it very hard to blindly trust these sources.')
