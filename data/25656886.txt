You need a VM host for the CI; now you have a VM host, you can build git servers and so on (bring the email inhouse, perhaps?).<p>As far as maintaining the system is concerned: setups that are hosted by 3rd-parties also need maintenance. Someone has to understand how it all fits together, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. So you <i>still</i> need a team-member working part-time on SCC, CI and deployment.')
