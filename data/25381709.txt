If it&#x27;s generated by a program and fed to a program, you&#x27;re better off using protobuf or something like that. In fact, since you&#x27;re probably using the same language on both ends, why not just write a regular value in your language?<p>This probably sounds like a strawman, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s how a lot of e.g. Python projects are configured - the &quot;config&quot; file is just a normal bit of code that gets run to produce a value. Unless you&#x27;re using a programming language that absolutely sucks at expressing plain values (e.g. C or Java), it&#x27;s much better than separate config files, IMO.')
