Without data on the problem it is easy for criminals to stay under the radar, or for the public to know if it is really a problem. A number of states have towing laws that require reporting any towed vehicle to the state within an hour. If a car is towed without being reported, in theory it is theft, or could lead to the business license or drivers license or insurance being revoked if enough people complain. And the second part is going after the money. The tow company can&#x27;t legally charge anything if they didn&#x27;t report the tow and follow the law. They can be sued for 3x the cost of the tow and any other out of pocket costs, and attorneys fees, so it is worth it for attorneys to take these cases on instead of small claims, and just a few of these to make this scheme more expensive than doing things the right way')
