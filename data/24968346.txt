Every time I&#x27;ve had to email them (which admittedly has only been a handful of times) with proof of something, I always end up calling them up and they&#x27;ll say &quot;but protonmail isn&#x27;t on the blacklist that IT posted, so you&#x27;re lying or you sent it to the wrong place,&quot; then I&#x27;ll send screenshots from a different email provider proving that I sent the protonmail email(s) to the right place, then they&#x27;ll say &quot;oh, I promise to talk to IT to get this straightened out.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s pretty obnoxious.')
