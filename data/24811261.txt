CloudFiles entries being &quot;inaccessible&quot; after saving for no known reason, happens a couple times a month. Had a managed MySQL slave replica down for 5 hours because they changed the IP of the master (mandatory maintenance) and failed to update the replica, no way to do this on my own.<p>AWS and Azure might not be better, but they&#x27;re definitely cheaper.')
