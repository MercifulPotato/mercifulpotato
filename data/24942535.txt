E.g. in &#x27;lxml&#x27; it&#x27;s trivial to add XPath functions with Python. Homegrown, of course, but still possible. In addition to extension elements this is about the only way to hook XSLT into the rest of the system. How else one is supposed to read environment variables from XSLT? The only other way is to pass everything via command line as parameters.<p>It&#x27;s insecure to run untrusted XPath, but isn&#x27;t it same with untrusted anything? A good solution here could be a way to sandbox such XPath, i.e. to limit which functions can be called, the same way it&#x27;s done with XML where you can forbid the processor to use network or access arbitrary files on case-by-case basis.')
