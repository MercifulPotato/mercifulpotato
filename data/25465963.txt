So is your overall take on life now a positive or a negative one? Or is it somewhere in between?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m only now just starting to settle into what I see as a &quot;decade long effort&quot; on a new set of goals.<p>Goals can lead you astray, though. Sometimes you don&#x27;t actually want to achieve them[0] or you do want to achieve them but don&#x27;t and end up frustrated because you keep on measuring yourself against them. Or, well, you do achieve them and still end up being miserable.<p>Years ago I read this blog post[1] and it resonated a lot with me.
