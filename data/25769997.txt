The <i>have</i> to do it well, or else they fail. It makes me nervous as a customer whenever I see them trying to &quot;grow&quot; by offering other products.<p>I don&#x27;t trust Microsoft, Google or Amazon one bit with their competing products. Those are gigantic companies that don&#x27;t depend on those working well, and they could kill them overnight.<p>The problem though is this mindset that everything has to <i>constantly</i> grow. That&#x27;s what makes me nervous as a customer. I don&#x27;t see what could be so wrong with building a product that works well and maintaining that long term, being satisfied with having a customer base that allows the business to be self-sustainable. If that customer base grows, great. More money. Otherwise, as long as it doesn&#x27;t shrink to the point where it becomes unsustainable, it should be just fine. But often I have a feeling that that kind of feeling is verboten for tech companies.')
