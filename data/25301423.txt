You can vote out the union leadership and all important decisions require a ballot.<p>Power structures can be abused, but they can also be a way to concentrate the will of many to achieve something that cannot be done individually.<p>What&#x27;s important is the material incentives of those involved. Even if they were to be insincere (in which case they often are removed), union leadership are incentivised to raise the wages of all members since dues are the main way they are funded. Employers are always incentivised to reduce wages as much as they can get away with, since they wish to maximise profits.')
