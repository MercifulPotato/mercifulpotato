Showers clean less effectively - you only need to go to a country with no &quot;eco&quot; pressure or flow rate limitations to notice this yourself. Washing machines and dishwashers perform poorly with low flow rate and no TSP.<p>Basically any appliance that people complain about and have a bad time with is only that way because of environmental regulations.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t even know what an &quot;inferior toilet&quot; is<p>That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re used to using garbage and you&#x27;ve never experienced anything better.<p>Toilets are probably the least acute example, since they have mostly gotten them almost back up to their former reliability.
