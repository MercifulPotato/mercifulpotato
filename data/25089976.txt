There may have been some Pareto improvements and its clear that certain people benefitted and others did not.<p>&gt; When communist countries fell, life did not get better for those who lived there. It got worse.<p>This is because the centrally planned economy depleted vast amounts of capital in their desperate struggle to keep the economy moving and competitive with the west.<p>&gt; They say that most things were better, but acknowledge those that were worse, and when they say they&#x27;d support a return it&#x27;s not to an identical state, just a similar one. But their political systems prevent this. One must wonder why.<p>Cynically I could offer the same answer a communist would offer when asked why people weren&#x27;t permitted to own factories in the Soviet Union: because that would put &quot;the wrong people&quot; in charge of the means of production.<p>Less cynically, its not clear how a centrally planned economy would know how to correctly allocate resources, so there&#x27;s no reason to return to the central planning model in the absence of a solution to the problems that caused it to fail in the first place.')
