What needs to be transparent to people is how votes are counted, not the logistics of how they are communicated and stored. People are doing pretty well where other countries have much more complicated systems (look at Australia having used IRV for over a hundred years. IRV has many rounds of voting and is substantially more complex).<p>If your goal is full transparency of every component, I don&#x27;t think a lot of people here could understand that. There&#x27;s a lot happening and to understand everything at a low level takes a lot of expertise. Understanding at a high level &quot;experts use fancy math to make my vote private and immutable&quot; is easy but also requires a lot of trust. Something we have to do regardless of full transparency, because someone could in fact hire a bunch of people to rig things.<p>The problem is the breakdown of trust. Fox has been talking about voter fraud for well over a decade and while they do have clear examples, they are over inflated at their significance (sorry, one person counting twice does not constitute a rigged election with a million voters. It constitutes a mistake). The president has a devout fanbase and echos this rhetoric from a very privileged platform. The problem is trust. There&#x27;s the old saying &quot;trust but verify.&quot; The transparency is the ability to verify, but does not require that every person is able to. So don&#x27;t needlessly tie your hands behind your back.')
