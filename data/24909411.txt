This feels like a very specific direction for such a general framework to take, but I can see how it makes sense: e-commerce occupies kind of an awkward middle-ground in the standard document-app dichotomy, making it potentially an ideal use-case for Next.js&#x27; hybrid approach.<p>On the one hand you have lots of &quot;casual&quot; or one-time visitors, for whom site responsiveness is going to have a big impact on conversions.<p>On the other hand you&#x27;ll probably want to support real-time searching&#x2F;sorting&#x2F;filtering, dynamically managing a cart and account, etc. You&#x27;ll probably also have some users who stay and browse for a while, and would benefit from a partially SPA experience.')
