Expect more Chinese billionaires to disappear for a while and happily praise their relinquishment of ownership.<p>Side track but similar situation in S. Korea: Current Korean administration is also trying to force Jay Lee (Samsung Heir &amp; ex-CEO) to sell a huge chunk of his shares to the government (would force the share prices to tank). Word on the street is Samsung is going to nationalize which would spell disaster for the Korean economy which relies 25% of its GDP on Samsung.')
