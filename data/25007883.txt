Yes, it&#x27;s far from a programming language design marvel.  But it covers all of the edge cases, and once you learn it, you can be very productive.  (But, the strategy of &quot;copy paste a oneliner from Stackoverflow the one time a year I need it&quot; isn&#x27;t going to work.)<p>I think structured data is so common now, that you have to invest in learning tools for processing it.  Personally, I invested the time once, and it saves me every single day.  In the past, I would have a question like &quot;which port is this Pod listening on&quot;, and write something like &quot;kubectl get pod foo -o yaml | grep port -A 3&quot;.  Usually you get your answer after manually reading through the false-positives.  But with &quot;jq&quot;, you can just drive directly to the correct answer: &quot;kubectl get pod foo -o json | jq &#x27;.spec.containers[].ports&#x27;&quot;<p>Maybe it&#x27;s kind of obtuse, but it&#x27;s worth your time, I promise.')
