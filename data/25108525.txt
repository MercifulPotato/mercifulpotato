Just because you think something should work the way you want, doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s reality.<p>There is no &quot;health insurance market&quot; in the US, since you can&#x27;t actually negotiate with any entity in the insurance industry.<p>Even for most companies, come Jan. 1, they switch providers to the lowest-cost they can find since there is no ability to negotiate with their current provider after the inevitable and compulsory 20%&#x2F;annum increase.')
