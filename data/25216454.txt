In my country, &quot;big government&quot; is a bad word meaning taxes on corporations, any sort of industry regulation and breaking up monopolies.<p>When I think of &quot;big government&quot;, I imagine a militarized police force, lack of access to medical care, pervasive surveillance, unchecked imperialism, billionaires writing their own rules and to tie a bow on the top: a propaganda wing to manufacture the consent of the governed.<p>If you think what I wrote about above can only happen in &quot;authoritarian&quot; or, gasp, &quot;communist&quot; countries, you are certainly mistaken.')
