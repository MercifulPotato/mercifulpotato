For the third time, nobody is arguing that raw renewable generation isn&#x27;t cheap. The issue is that translating raw renewable generation into usable, dispatchable power is very, very expensive.<p>Yes, we absolutely can build nuclear in much much shorter time than renewables plus storage. I don&#x27;t think you fully comprehend the staggering mismatch between the scale of storage required and storage produced.<p>We cited the same source on battery production. Take a closer look at the graph: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextbigfuture.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;bloombergbatteries2030.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextbigfuture.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;blo...</a> The small magenta segment that says &quot;stationary storage&quot; is the portion of battery production actually going to renewable storage. Even by 2030, it&#x27;s still being added at a rate of less than 200 GWh per year. The world uses 2,400 GWh of electricity per <i>hour</i>. That&#x27;s more than the entire height of this graph. It&#x27;ll take well beyond 2035 to even provide <i>just one hour of grid storage</i> with batteries.<p>By comparison, France increased it&#x27;s share of nuclear generation from under 15% to over 80% in 15 years: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_in_France#Messmer_Plan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_in_France#Messme...</a>')
