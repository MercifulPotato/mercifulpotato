Lots of arguments with spouses and other family... I won&#x27;t pretend these people represent the majority of conservative voices.<p>Edit: I realized this probably isn&#x27;t a very informative comment. To maybe give a better picture, here are the kinds of people in my social circles who dislike Trump:<p>- The &#x27;liberal&#x27; Christian: people who are fiscally liberal (free healthcare and college, &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; types) who are socially conservative (not fans of LGBT or identity politics).<p>- The &#x27;conservative&#x27; Christian: people who like Trump&#x27;s policies but not his persona. They see Trump as the opposite of a good Christian, e.g. he is worldly, arrogant, impious, etc. They think he is a sign of the moral decline of American society.<p>- The libertarian: these people really care about small government and policy. They realize Trump claims to care about these things but really doesn&#x27;t. They get upset when he does things like take military action against Iran, or bans some apps with an Executive Order.<p>The takeaway is all these people are &quot;&quot;Republicans&quot;&quot; simply because there is no real alternative that they feel represents them.')
