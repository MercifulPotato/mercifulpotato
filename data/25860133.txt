It&#x27;s even worse.<p>On OSX I only had problems with GUI running in docker. I was used to sharing X between linux host and docker container also running linux.<p>For some projects, the only working solution I found was to run a VNC server in docker. \nSpecific example: in a docker container, run a GUI built with Kivy and view the window on the OSX host. If anyone manages to do this without VNC, I&#x27;d like to know how!')
