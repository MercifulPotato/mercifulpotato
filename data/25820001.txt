Item(by='CraigJPerry', descendants=None, kids=[25820084, 25820128], score=None, time=1610962855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810708, text='Spending more for a “last a lifetime” product is super frustrating if you ever misplace that item.<p>In 2019 I bought a second hand thinkpad x260 for £200 as a durable travel laptop. It’s almost perfect, the battery life is great, i wish i could fix the two problems with it:<p>1. It overheats far too easily. I don’t need all the speed of the processor so undervolting would be a good fix but doesn’t appear possible in this bios. Making a custom cooling solution that doesn’t compromise travel-ability is beyond my skillset.<p>2. The screen is too low resolution, too low brightness and too restrictive on viewing angles. I’d love to be able to swap a better panel in.')
