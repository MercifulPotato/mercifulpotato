These speeches, along with news broadcasts, make assumptions about their audience, and their content is carefully designed to appeal to that audience&#x27;s biases and value system while appearing &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;factual&quot; on the surface.<p>In this case, Trump&#x27;s speech makes the assumption that his audience sees themselves as &quot;patriots&quot; and subscribe to the narrative that their way of life is under attack by people who &quot;hate America&quot; and want to indoctrinate people to do the same. This paints the other side as being against their value system and champions their values.<p>The problem is, even explaining that in those terms will cause people to take exception, so it&#x27;s both difficult and dangerous for a website to do so and remain &quot;factual&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot;.<p>Take a look at the 5-star reviews for this book:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Patriots-History-United-States-Entitlement&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1595231153&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1?crid=2PB6RNITBHKAV&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=patriots+guide+to+american+history&amp;qid=1602184941&amp;sprefix=patriots+guide%2Caps%2C158&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Patriots-History-United-States-Entitl...</a><p>Compared to this book:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Peoples-History-United-States&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0062397346&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1?crid=WQB1DQ99V2CC&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=zinn+american+history&amp;qid=1602184998&amp;sprefix=zinn+american+%2Caps%2C159&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Peoples-History-United-States&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0062...</a><p>Most people really hate it when you tell them things that run counter to their narrative, and have a hard time even seeing their narratives as biased one way or another.')
