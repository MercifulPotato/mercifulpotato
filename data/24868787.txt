You seem to be attempting to conflate them because you just don&#x27;t like the <i>idea</i> of copyright.<p>But that&#x27;s a different issue. In fact it&#x27;s perfectly consistent to enforce copyright through a combination of DRM <i>and</i> legal challenges.<p>Legally copyright is the default. Nothing is in the public domain unless it&#x27;s explicitly handed over to the public domain.<p>So software items with DRM can&#x27;t be &quot;stolen from the future public domain&quot; because the DRM is part of the product or item. And it&#x27;s up to the rights holder to decide whether or not they want to free it. This is a deliberate choice on their part. (It&#x27;s a little more complex with other content because the content is assumed to have an existence independent of its realisation or distribution model. Not so much with software.)<p>None of this justifies Adobe&#x27;s actions, and a class action against Adobe would also be reasonable. (Realistically not likely to succeed - but hardly baseless.)<p>But it would be an argument about real&#x2F;assumed&#x2F;implied breach of contract with buyers&#x2F;license users, and not over copyright terms or DRM.')
