Based entirely on your experience of Americans recommending movies to you?<p>It would be tempting to suggest that European schools fail to teach critical thinking, but I&#x27;ll resist that urge, as it&#x27;s obviously unfair. Your comment doesn&#x27;t suggest to me a failure of European schools, the problem is likely much more specific.')
