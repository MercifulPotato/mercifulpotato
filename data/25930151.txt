How about $400?  $1,000?  $10,000?&quot; and eventually enough people sell.<p>If they don&#x27;t (let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s no price they&#x27;d sell at), a few things can happen:<p>The short-seller can sell their short position directly (transfer liability) to someone who thinks they can convince the stockholders.<p>The Company can issue more stock, diluting all shareholders, and sell to the short-sellers.<p>The short seller simply goes bankrupt, at which point liability gets settled in court (details depend on how they shorted, middle-men, etc.) - other people like brokers could get dragged into this too as they may guarantee the trade.')
