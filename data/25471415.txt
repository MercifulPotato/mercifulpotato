Theoretically, ne wouldn&#x27;t have any trouble because possession is legal&#x2F;decriminalized. If any drugs are found in a search by police that aren&#x27;t in the state-approved containers, they are confiscated and destroyed, but the possessor is obviously not charged with anything. Problem solved, mostly.<p>I also don&#x27;t care about any difficulties the purveyors of state-backed violence (police) may encounter as a result of this. They can spend their budgets that way instead of purchasing weapons of war. Win win win.')
