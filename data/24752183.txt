(&quot;It is very difficult to conclude a simplistic view of society&#x2F;sociological behaviours.&quot;)<p>The examples I gave were meant to show that the behaviours that one believe to be &quot;fitting&quot; for a certain worldview, is suddenly not &quot;fitting&quot; in another group.<p>This is due to the key concept that most students learn in Sociology 101, being in a group changes your behaviour.<p>Therefore to study &quot;behaviours&quot;, if you conclude a simplistic idea, you have to define its boundary. Maybe in, say, the Napolitan culture of Italia, a certain behaviour explains a certain reasoning holds true, but to generalise that to &quot;behaviour&quot; (in general) is hand-waving away many complexities.')
