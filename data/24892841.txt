Before I got in I&#x27;d say &quot;OK, your credit card reader is working, right?&quot; and they&#x27;d swear it is, and then wouldn&#x27;t you know it?  Somehow the machine broke down between the airport and my destination EVERY TIME.  The drivers would pitch a hissy fit when I refused to pay cash, and then they&#x27;d manually take a print of my card or write down the number.<p>It cost something like $60 for a 20 minute ride, and they had the audacity to expect a huge tip on top of that.  Fuck those guys.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re all lying about their income and hiding it from the government to commit tax fraud.  For a brief period before Uber took off, they&#x27;d even started using personal Square readers to charge credit cards instead of the official ones built into their cars.<p>That said, I&#x27;m willing to bet that society won&#x27;t tolerate a return to how things used to be, even if Uber and Lyft leave the state after we shoot down Prop 22.  There&#x27;s such a vast gulf in price difference between a taxi and an uber that I&#x27;m sure we can reach a comfortable middle ground where drivers make a living wage without us living under a scumbag taxi rein of terror')
