It sucks, I don&#x27;t wish it on anyone. Highly recommend taking some significant time off.  Like, <i>off</i>, off, not &quot;I&#x27;m behind at work and behind on my hobby projects and behind on home maintenance and behind on my personal exercise goals, gonna take 24 personal hours Mon-Weds next week, I should be able to renovate my guest bath in that time, it&#x27;s needed work for 3 years&quot;.<p>During that time, stop trying to be productive because you feel like you ought to. Wait until you feel like you want to. Read, take a walk, do some cooking, hang out with friends or family.<p>Gauge for yourself whether media consumption, especially during that time, is helping you relax or whether it&#x27;s substituting both the motivation and reward for actually doing the thing you don&#x27;t have the energy to do yourself. That was a big problem for me: We train our brains to reward us for accomplishing a cool thing with a boost of dopamine. Later, it optimizes the process to reward you earlier for just planning to do the thing - sketching, architecting, dreaming, writing task lists.  Eventually, it gives you the same &quot;I&#x27;m really proud of that accomplishment&quot; reward for just watching someone on Youtube do it (you don&#x27;t even have to look at all the off-camera drudge work).<p>Also, given the time of year, depending on your latitude, check for seasonal affective disorder as a potential antagonist of depression. Talk to a counselor, get some bright lights, bundle up and get outside if the sun is out, take some vitamin D supplements.')
