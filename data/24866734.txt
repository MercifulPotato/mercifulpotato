Over the years I went from hating math to really enjoying it, especially calculus, but there&#x27;s still one thing that keeps bugging me, and that&#x27;s my command of its language. I have no problem solving most of algebra or calculus problems, but if you asked me to explain what I&#x27;m doing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you, at least not using mathematical constructs&#x2F;words. It doesn&#x27;t help that I can&#x27;t find any resources like you could for any natural language.<p>When I asked my teacher she said to practice over and over, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been doing these years and it didn&#x27;t do much to improve my oral presentation. So, I&#x27;m asking here in the hope that someone who went through the same struggle or understands the mental process very well and knows what it takes to &quot;fix the computation-presentation  bridge&quot;, could help me or guide me in the right direction, to overcome this obstacle.<p>Thank y&#x27;all for your time.')
