Why is it necessary?  It&#x27;s just something we have grown accustomed to in Europe, because of our big government way of doing things, where group A wants wealth transfers from group B, and if group A is a majority, they get their way.<p>There are a lot of things where that makes sense:<p>Group A, healthy and rich individuals, pay for health care for group B, sick individuals who can&#x27;t afford health care.  I&#x27;m on board because it would feel cruel and heartless to me to let them suffer.<p>Group A, rich people regardless of whether they have children, pay for the education of children from group B, poor people with children, so that all children regardless of their background get to have a good education.  I&#x27;m on board because I think that everyone should have access to the opportunities that come with a good education.<p>Group A, everybody regardless of whether they use public roads, pay for road maintenance so that they can be used by group B, people who make a lot of use of public roads.  I&#x27;m on board, because I think it would be bad for the country if it had regions that are only poorly accessible.<p>...in each of those cases, you can make counter-arguments.  Those are just my opinions.<p>Group A, everybody regardless of whether they like football, pay for group B, people who do like football, so that they can watch football.  Hold on a sec...  What the...  What did I just say?  ...that makes no sense!  Why would I be on board with that?  Now, as a taxpayer-licensepayer I&#x27;m just paying so that other people can get the things they like.  That&#x27;s clearly going too far.  I just don&#x27;t understand how so many people in Europe are no longer even weirded out by this stuff.')
