I would be totally for discharging student debt if it worked like, say, car loans — that is, if it was backed by private companies who can refuse extending credit to people whom they judge are unlikely to pay it back, and if upon bankruptcy, the degree is “repossessed”, i.e. records of attendance are scrubbed, and the bankrupt debtor is not allowed to claim they had held that degree under criminal penalties. Then sure, discharge student debt, I don’t care.<p>However, in the current arrangement of federally backed student loans, the incentives are completely misaligned. The taxpayers are shelling out tens of thousands of dollars to fund ever-more-expensive universities, which can keep jacking up the prices because there will always be feds who’ll write the check with few questions asked. Then, if you could just discharge it in bankruptcy, why wouldn’t just everyone do it first thing after graduation? Sure, you’ll have mangled up credit score for a few years, but for most people it’s worth the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars saved, and if everyone does it, credit score  companies will have to account for it to keep the scores informative, so it likely wouldn’t even cause any problems for you at all.')
