But the reality is that provisions like this aren&#x27;t going to make it into the final bill, and there&#x27;s no indication that this is some kind of red line - just a negotiating position. Similarly the republicans are also setting their demands up in a way they know democrats will never accept: a low relief figure, excessive corporate protection from liability towards employees.<p>I don&#x27;t like it one bit (and I&#x27;ve always favored targeted bills), but there&#x27;s also no real indication that this provision is what is holding things up - right now, all the talk is about the dollar amount. Senate republicans can&#x27;t even pass the 1T amount for the HEALS act right now, and are facing severe internal division over the proposed amount.')
