I&#x27;m thinking that for the most part people generally have&#x2F;keep &lt;5 email addresses (that they use often enough to log in with) so they should be able to just iterate through the list of emails that they&#x27;ve used over their lifetime and figure it out?<p>I do wonder though -- if the hash secret gets out then I think we&#x27;re right back to where we started... it would be easy to cross-reference leaded email DBs with the dumped DB and work backwards. I&#x27;m now a bit less sure this does much for use privacy against an even slightly motivated opponent (one who would almost certainly have access to at least one dump of previously-exposed emails)...')
