Lights are not just about making you visible, but making you too obvious for a car to miss. Ideally you want a bright blinking light (depending on your local laws).<p>Cars are dangerous, and the people who are driving them are probably tired from a long day of work, thinking about what they&#x27;ll cook for dinner, or even worse distracted by their phone. I agree that drivers should be giving full attention to the road and checking carefully before every movement, but that&#x27;s not reality - do what you can to make it easier for them to see you.<p>If you are coming from behind a car at night without a light, the car won&#x27;t see you. If it needs to turn across your path, the high vis alone will not make you visible. Same if cars are coming towards you. My city has a lot of streets that are bus lanes in one direction. If you are cycling along here at 20km&#x2F;h a car turning left probably won&#x27;t see you without lights, given you are much smaller than what they would expect to see there (a bus).<p>The only case where I can see high vis being useful, where a light would not, is if a car is coming at you from the side.')
