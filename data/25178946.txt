And the reminders app is not on the top of my importance to open on a daily basis. \nWhat I do prioritize on a daily basis is my text messages app before all else on my phone.<p>Text Me That simple purpose is to send reminders via text message.<p>The reminders can sit in my unopened inbox until I’m ready to review it.<p>I created the basic needs within this app.<p>- location based reminders.\n- Frequency reminders.\n- group reminders\n- quick reminders.<p>Remember, be gentle! I would love to know what you all think. I’ve enjoyed lurking on this community for over a year now, and have learned so much.<p>There is a second reason I am posting this application. I am interested in collaborating with another developer for version 4.0. I’ve currently started it. Building in Swift UI.<p>My end goal is to make it cross-patible with Mac OS. I’m also exploring the new widgets from apple.<p>I think working with another developer would be awesome. Definitely during this time that most developers WFH. Community is necessary and needed!<p>You can personally email me at ethanbonin@gmail.com<p>Anyway,<p>Love you all! If anything, don’t be afraid to check it out and leave me feedback. I’m all ears!')
