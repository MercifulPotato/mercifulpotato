I two tracks from MM...FOOD in my top 20 (the other was Guinnesses (feat. Angelika &amp; 4ize) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5MW4d-Cp19E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5MW4d-Cp19E</a>), and some collaborations (J Dilla, Avalanches&#x2F;Danny Brown) farther down the list.<p>This is sad. I didn&#x27;t even know his real name (Daniel Dumile), nor that he was actually British (mostly raised in NY). Weird to mourn the passing of someone you&#x27;ve never met and barely knew anything about, but he was only 49. Like a friend of mine once said in response to another artist&#x27;s death: &quot;something that brought me joy has disappeared from this world.&quot; He will be missed.')
