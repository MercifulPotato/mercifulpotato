Every time she visits, she is astonished that grocery shopping at discounters in Germany ends up being healthier that when she tries to get &quot;healthy&quot; groceries in the US. No idea if this holds true, but I had the same impression vacationing in New York (obviously not representative). I do see quality differences between German and French supermarkets as well, with quality in France being better.<p>I largely prefer not enriched food, including salt. It just tastes better, IMHO.')
