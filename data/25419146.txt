It turns out that it was a production cert that was being used to secure a whole state&#x27;s worth of computers.<p>In my defence, the cert was not labeled properly, nor was it used properly, and there was no documentation.  It took us 2 days to create a new cert and apply it to our software and deliver it to the customer.  Those were 2 days I&#x27;ll never get back.  However, when I was finished the process was documented and the cert was labeled, so I guess its a win.')
