(I&#x27;ll update or delete my comment if it&#x27;s fixed.)<p>[Update: it was changed. It used to read &quot;Stripe is now charging 0.5% more for recurring charges.&quot;]<p>You can happily make recurring charges <i>yourself</i> and no additional fees are incurred. Lots of Stripe customers do this and we don&#x27;t charge anything extra for it.<p>If you decide to use Stripe Billing, which is a separate product, we charge for that. Stripe Billing&#x27;s pricing hasn&#x27;t changed in a few years. What&#x27;s changing is that we&#x27;re ending the several-year grace period where we didn&#x27;t charge anything for Stripe Billing for businesses who started to use this functionality before 2018.<p>Charging for Billing helps us fund a lot more investment in it -- we&#x27;ve gone from very basic cron-like functionality to a pretty full-featured subscriptions management tool. (You can read more at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;billing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;billing</a>.) Billing is now sophisticated enough that companies like Slack and Atlassian are using and paying for it. We&#x27;ve built things like &quot;Smart Dunning&quot; (which improves revenue recovery for failed charges by about 14%), better analytics, international payment method and invoicing support, and a whole host of other features. There are now more than 30 people working on improving Billing.<p>Importantly, Stripe Billing is (and will remain) significantly cheaper than most of the other competitors in the space.')
