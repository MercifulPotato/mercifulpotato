For me, the Lisp is a bit more welcoming than VimScript for me. It&#x27;s much easier to test out a small snippet of something in-buffer which might grow into something else.<p>But, putting Lisp aside, going through the growing pains was worth it for me because of org-mode. I&#x27;m certain Vim might have something similar but the proper `org` package is definitely on my list of benefits. I have an org-file that tracks my time and generates invoices with a click of a button. Another one documents all the API calls in another project with interactive areas, thanks to org-babel. I think being able to craft documents like this is invaluable but again, it&#x27;s gonna come down to how you do work and what makes you happy&#x2F;efficient.')
