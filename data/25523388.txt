I&#x27;m getting a sense that the author&#x27;s grasp of authentication and authorization protocols is incomplete.  I don&#x27;t mean in the sense that the author left out some popular protocols, which is true, but in the sense that there&#x27;s details wrong. For example, oauth and OpenID are mentioned only in the context of social login, and the differences between oauth, oauth2, OpenID and OIDC aren&#x27;t covered (and OIDC is almost entirely unrelated to the original OpenID). Also, the author has a section at the end &quot;GitHub social auth&quot; as if it were somehow different from regular oauth used all over the internet.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;List_of_OAuth_providers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;List_of_OAuth_providers</a>')
