Item(by='arnoooooo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604996707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042749, text='&gt; Who here can visualize an apple in their mind, literally seeing it as if existed and was being perceived by the eye (a sense organ)?<p>Anybody who dreams when sleeping. Is that not everybody ? Ability to do it when awake (lucid dreaming) is a different thing.<p>&gt; lack of awareness equals lack of consciousness<p>No it does not. I&#x27;d argue that even deep sleep or getting knocked out does not equal loss of consciousness. We can&#x27;t tell, as consciousness is only perceived through it&#x27;s contents, so we can&#x27;t distinguish between absence of contents or absence of container.<p>&gt; Leave them closed long enough and you will lose what we are seeking to define here.<p>Consciousness is not the model. It&#x27;s where the model is built. You only mention perceptions, what about thoughts ?')
