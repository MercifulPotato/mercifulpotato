Doubly baffling that it now launches on Enterprise only with no guidance on if or when it will be generally available. Never an explanation why this couldn&#x27;t have been there all along. You have it with the repos already. It almost seems like you would have to go out of your way <i>not</i> to have this baked in from day one. I&#x27;m a long term fan, but c&#x27;mon github, you&#x27;re better than this.')
