Being poor is the other extreme of the system - just like good luck and smart decisions can make you rich, bad luck and stupid moves can make you poor. I don&#x27;t think that anyone argued that society shouldn&#x27;t reduce the risks and provide a safety net for poor people. Also IMHO for social stability it&#x27;s important that system slowdowns both of these tendencies, not let people get extremely poor, but also not extremely rich over the night.')
