I.e., you have to undertake political activism towards something for the topic to be political.<p>It&#x27;s like religion as a topic of conversation, vs religious conversion. Two people can be talking about religion, but if neither is trying to &quot;convert&quot; the other, then this is not a religious conversion.<p>But if one party is talking with the intent to convert the other party to said religion, then it&#x27;s a religious conversion. And the argument is that this should not happen in the workplace.')
