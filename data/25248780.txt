We&#x27;ve got &#x27;open phones&#x27; already. But they&#x27;re all still using qualcomm blobs. I think that is a huge vuln in our communications system. It&#x27;s like if one company controlled the entire internet... Every piece of data being passed in and out of the same chip right down to the way radio channels are chosen, ciphers used, transports checked, and control messages processed... all hidden. Using so much insecure crap. How many people use phones for sensitive info? this stuff is swiss-cheese, nightmare material')
