Thought using private browsing was enough (I always do even for trivial stuff).<p>Now, somehow FB tracked me, found a similar item in FB Marketplace and shows me it in the main app menu as a suggestion next to Marketplace option. Like in this image, but the white Marketplace panel also has a thumbnail: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brayve.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;echo&#x2F;fb_menu_revamp2.png [1]<p>I deleted all the stuff from ad preferences, &quot;activity outside FB&quot;, turned it off completely. I long-pressed the thumbnail and asked FB not to show it anymore, but it persists.<p>Does the HN crowd know how to disable this crap if asking FB not to show it doesn&#x27;t cut it? Now I can&#x27;t open FB in the public... :&#x2F;<p>[1] Won&#x27;t post my own screenshot, because image censorship is easy to screw up, I couldn&#x27;t find a screenshot with such thumbnail on the web.')
