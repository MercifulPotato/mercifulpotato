It&#x27;s not a fundamentally bad idea to look for root causes (plural). It&#x27;s essential to not stop at immediate causes. More or less, you start at immediate causes and then recursively go deeper until you get to things that cannot be changed and&#x2F;or are not within your control.<p>One real danger is believing in <i>a</i> root cause or <i>the</i> root cause (singular) as if there is only one. The desire to only have to change (or understand) one thing is dangerous because it leads you to stop investigating&#x2F;analyzing as soon as you have found something to blame it on.<p>As you go deeper through the chain(s) of causes, you also should not focus exclusively on the last (root) because that means you aren&#x27;t thinking about defense in depth.<p>TLDR, follow the chain of causes all the way to its ends, realize it may have multiple ends, and don&#x27;t focus only on the surface stuff or only on the root stuff.')
