For example the Swiss 50 year bond is currently priced at -0.36%, and this is &quot;high&quot; given recent yields history. Switzerland is already buying nearly every financial asset it can with printed money, including US stocks, but the credit markets don&#x27;t give a damn. Swiss mortgages have theoretically infinite duration (you never pay it back by design). Austria has some extremely low yielding 100 year bonds despite not having existed yet for 100 years (in the current form). The deflation is just too strong.')
