You sound more of a bear than a bull.<p>Well played, I upvoted you in no small part because of your wordplay there :)<p>I see no point in building anything backed by proof of waste, it’s simply not a reasonable value proposition. It’s like trying to build coal fired cars. Yes you’ll build a car, but it’ll be wildly less efficient and strictly worse than all alternatives. That eliminates a good 90% of crypto currencies by market cap. Setting aside for a second that the market cap of a currency is a nonsensical metric, currencies are what you measure market cap <i>in</i> not <i>of</i>.<p>Permissionless and irreversible are not things humans want or benefit from. Permissionless is what has allowed North Korea to fund its nuclear program with billions of dollars of cryptocurrency. It’s what allows ransomware authors to get paid and shut down schools and hospitals. It’s what allows laundering the proceeds of crime. It’s what allows rampant market manipulation.<p>Decentralized prevents the currency from responding to externalities like births, and deaths, and pandemics.<p>And that really knocks out the rest.<p>The reality is trust is a huge optimization.<p>Beyond that most solutions are cheaper, faster, simpler and map better onto human fallibility if implemented as a MySQL table in RDS. Then you can secure it with a Merkel tree and call it a day.<p>No, I’m not bullish on crypto because it has yet to, in 12 years, do anything better than what’s out there today except separate suckers from their money. It’s great at that. And this is in spite of some of the smartest minds in the world working day and night to do so. If a single crypto product shows even a 1% improvement over a classical implementation along any axis I’ll eat my ... er, hat (yes, that’s a John McAffee reference) and buy your bitcoins at what I’m confident will be a dramatically higher price.<p>&gt; You may not care about your freedom and self-reliance, but it ABSOLUTELY makes a difference.<p>There’s no such thing, we live in a society.<p>So, I guess, I respectfully disagree but always appreciate hearing the other side.')
