Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25194870], score=None, time=1606184873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25193796, text='This is an interesting study, but there are so many influences that the article can&#x27;t cover (probably due to its length) that it is a struggle to even draw questions from it.<p>Everyone dies of something. The fact that US people die from things at a different ratio from other countries is interesting, relevant and uninformative on the topic of life expectancy. Picking out obesity - the fact that US obesity rate deaths are higher than the comparison countries doesn&#x27;t tell us <i>anything</i> about life expectancy. Are they old fat people, or young fat people?<p>The article also can&#x27;t rule out Simpson&#x27;s paradox style effects. Hypothetically, say the US is just much better at bringing sickly babies into the world and nursing them on into their 70s it would have better care and worse life expectancy. I doubt that theory could even begin to explain what is going on here, but when comparing average statistics of huge and diverse populations effects like that can creep in very subtly. Statistics can be completely misleading if the treatment is short and only deals with part of the picture.<p>I&#x27;m feeling good about reading an article with lots of data, but this didn&#x27;t do a good job of addressing the title matter.')
