I can only assume this is because you can&#x27;t actually do what I&#x27;ve asked you to do <i>seven</i> times now, and find someone actually openly advocating for and requesting that people engage in violence against the police.<p>I want to be absolutely crystal clear about one thing: I have never, not in this comment thread, nor anywhere else, advocated for people to engage in violence against the police. It is frankly insulting for you to insinuate that I would do so, or to state that there is essentially no difference between me and people who planned and executed an attack on congress.')
