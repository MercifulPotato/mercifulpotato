Huge difference. I blame the chinese directly. They never had the intention of hiring American workers. They know American workers are capable but inferior and they screwed them over on purpose.<p>&gt;Every single thing in this lengthy article comes together to make one clear point: they had no plan at any step of the way and just tried to BS it all, and they&#x27;ve done it several times around the world.<p>And I&#x27;m saying there&#x27;s a reason for this. It&#x27;s not an accident. It&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t give a shit about American workers. They think American workers are inferior. They don&#x27;t want to put any real money into the project they bought it up for some ulterior motive.<p>Not only American factory workers. But many places in the world. It&#x27;s hard to beat the industriousness of Chinese workers.<p>I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I don&#x27;t have hard evidence. I&#x27;m just guessing the situation but it&#x27;s also somewhat obvious. You seriously think if China (taiwan technically) was serious about investing in blue collar workers in America they would let it just slide like this? We&#x27;re talking about the fastest growing economy humanity has ever seen that has transformed from a backwards 3rd world country to a super power within your lifetime. They will eat up and devour any opportunity or deal in front of them. Why would the Chinese miss out on the American Factory Worker???? Probably because they don&#x27;t give a shit.<p>The following isn&#x27;t evidence but if you read my post and watch the linked video... it is an actual short snippet of a real life example of a serious chinese investor who tried employing American factory workers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24834199" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24834199</a><p>American factory workers can&#x27;t hold a candle to chinese industriousness. You think those Asian dad memes don&#x27;t have an actual origin?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinterest.com&#x2F;lindaschloss&#x2F;asian-father-memes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinterest.com&#x2F;lindaschloss&#x2F;asian-father-memes&#x2F;</a><p>Those memes aren&#x27;t that far from the truth.<p>watch the movie if you&#x27;re interested.')
