If I recalled correctly it&#x27;s under &quot;Income received abroad\n-&gt; Salary and other remuneration&quot;.<p>I also run a donation based site (which also has ads) and I declare both of these on the form and pay my share of taxes from it. But it is then fully legal money and I can do whatever I like with it from government perspective.<p>I don&#x27;t speak any Finnish at all, but if the wording is so important, wouldn&#x27;t it work if you ask the money to pay for the services cost instead? Not as a donation to yourself. Servers cost, your time costs etc. Could all be counted as an upkeep of the project.')
