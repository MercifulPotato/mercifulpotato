It is simply that my life&#x27;s decisions are not going to be in any way influenced by whether or not God or Gods exist, whatever the right word for that is.</i><p>And yet here you are, spending your time and energy making the decision to post on an internet forum about whether you believe God does or does not exist.  Seems like you <i>have</i> been influenced and you <i>do</i> care.<p>If you truly <i>didn&#x27;t</i> care (roughly the same level of care someone puts into their thoughts on unicorns and leprechauns), you&#x27;d spend exactly zero energy talking about the subject.  Keep searching and testing for the truth my friend, it is out there.')
