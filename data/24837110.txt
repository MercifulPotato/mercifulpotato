However, having been a co-founder and CTO of a startup, let me tell you the real story:<p>- Most startups are not like snapchat, they are not once-in-a-generation unicorns.<p>- Most startups have huge burn, especially consumer-entertainment type startups (imagine how much network bandwidth YouTube was burning before Google purchased them.)<p>- Startups are at the mercy of funding rounds and sometimes the market itsself can get away from you, through no fault of your own startup<p>- FAANG provide a put option -- &quot;whats the worse that can happen? we get acquired by X&quot; which allows people to take on more risk while trying to swing for the fences.<p>- It is arguable how long darling consumer apps could survive as independent when consumers often dont want to pay money. It is a catch 22 -- the startup is told the product has to be free but they are also not allowed to seek bigger coffers to actually subsidize it<p>So in the end -- sure, I agree with you, but <i>who pays?</i> Esp if this is something massive with network effects. Perhaps I can pay for WhatsApp, but can my grandma pay for it with her meager overseas salary? And if she cannot, how is the network sustainable?<p>I&#x27;m not saying I disagree with you, but I dont know what the solution is other than the current one.')
