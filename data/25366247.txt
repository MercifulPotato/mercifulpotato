In the absence of neutral and objective information, people will be unable to dissent with the government or political party in charge. The term also extends to the systematic suppression of views that are contrary to those of the government in power.<p>I&#x27;m against political censorship most of all. I don&#x27;t enjoy the current state of things in which private organizations are being utilized to spread misinformation that originated from a prominent voice of the government, and are faced with the difficult choice of adopting organizational censorship in order to combat political censorship.')
