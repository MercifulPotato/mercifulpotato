I have the AirPods Pro with a 2019 13&quot; MBP and run into similar issues: if I&#x27;m just listening to music, everything is fine. As soon as the microphones come on to do a call, the audio quality goes down the tube and there is a loud crackling noise in the right AirPod that never goes away (and I know this isn&#x27;t the crackling problem with AirPods Pro in general, because I already had mine replaced to fix that issue, and they work fine on all other devices). I end up having to take the right one out, which defeats the entire purpose of having ANC headphones.')
