Freelancing and consulting is a relationship business. It&#x27;s hard enough to get a reply from cold emails (0.5â€“1.0% reply rates are typical), it&#x27;s even harder to form a relationship that will result in high-value contracts.<p>If you absolutely need to do it, make the emails highly targeted and personalized. For example:<p>1. Find 10 companies that are very similar to your last client.<p>2. For each of those companies, find the person with authority and budget to hire developer contractors.<p>3. Study them and their company and make educated guesses about their current needs or problems. For instance, if they just launched a new product, maybe it needs an API. Or if their product only integrates with X and Y, maybe they could use an integration with Z.<p>4. Write a <i>very short and direct</i> email explaining that you can help them do [need&#x2F;problem from step 3], what you did for [past client who resembles them], and what was the business outcome of that project.<p>5. Follow up once at most. Don&#x27;t be annoying.')
