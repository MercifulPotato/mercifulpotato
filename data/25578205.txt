If your boss is mean and stupid all the time, you&#x27;ll learn so little from them, the net work experience you got from the job become a negative.<p>In my opinion, a good boss can be loud, but must also smart and willing to hear, learn and teach, which are essential if you want to increase productivity and get your team full of smart and idea generating people together.<p>If you work for a mean and stupid boss, not only you&#x27;ll work in hell, if the business failed due to their mistake, they&#x27;ll probably put failure on their employees. Which is really bad if their false words got into the ears of your next recruiter.<p>Life is short, if something is obviously bad, don&#x27;t try it.')
