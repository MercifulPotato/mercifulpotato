Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605803758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25150443, text='&gt; That just comes off as entitled. Youtube is providing free bandwidth, hosting, and advertising for his patreon.<p>Youtube has been promoting that you can do that since 2008 -  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;youtube-the-platform&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;youtube-the-platform&#x2F;</a> - so maybe &quot;entitled&quot; isn&#x27;t the word. It&#x27;s expected because the capability has been promoted.<p>However, in the same article you&#x27;ll note this little tidbit:<p><i>In general if a video is uploaded to YouTube, in some cases we serve ads into that on YouTube.com. When people embed those we reserve rights to serve ads in the future.</i>')
