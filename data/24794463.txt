I use Untappd to score beers. But it turns out there is a pretty wide variety of beer that I like so most of them end up as 4 +&#x2F;- 0.5 our of 5.<p>But I&#x27;m not the only one.

Where 4.5 becomes &quot;oh my god, these brewers are doing incredible things with this beer&quot; and 3.5 becomes &quot;ugh, this tastes worse than bud light&quot;')
