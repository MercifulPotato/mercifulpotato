Facebook wants to be able to tie your off Facebook activity to your Facebook account.<p>Also, there are some incredibly private things which happen on people&#x27;s phones. If I went to the courthouse or a DUI lawyer in town, I don&#x27;t want Facebook to know this. If I have to install an app due to parole restrictions, this shouldn&#x27;t be a thing Facebook finds out about.<p>There are piles of other private activities which people keep in the apps they use.')
