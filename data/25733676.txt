This isn&#x27;t new - it&#x27;s what Iran tried under Mosaddegh, and it&#x27;s a story oft repeated in South America, and each case there is suddenly a CIA backed coup who fights against nationalization.<p>I don&#x27;t think China would see any blowback from this - the idea that it would prevent future investment in China is like saying Europe would stop investing in the US after the American revolution; as long as there is some alpha to be made in an economy as large as China&#x27;s, I&#x27;d expect them to still see foreign capital.<p>I think what it more interesting is the concentration of power in the CCP elite and how that power is wielded. On one side you have the &quot;communist&quot; dream where the nationalization of Alibaba is felt by all Chinese citizens who are given more through socialization - one can imagine what China would look like in another 15 years if they focused on further educating and strengthing their citizenry; its the progressive left&#x27;s &quot;dream&quot; for America. On the other hand, it&#x27;s also likely you end up in a situation where power corrupts and nationalization is just an excuse to enrich Xi and his inner circle.')
