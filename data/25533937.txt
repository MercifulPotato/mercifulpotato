You go to the “eastern” EU countries in that case.<p>As for the cancer patient survival, in the US, 42% of patients lose their life savings within 2 years and the amount was typically around $92,000. That alone screws American cancer patients over long term, and it can cause them to die.<p>EDIT forgot to add link for further information: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.truthorfiction.com&#x2F;do-four-in-ten-cancer-patients-really-lose-their-life-savings&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.truthorfiction.com&#x2F;do-four-in-ten-cancer-patient...</a><p>You can cherry pick data, but your logic does not add up.<p>Spend some time on HealthData.org examining the US versus other developed countries.<p>We may have better cancer survival rates, but when you look at deaths attributed to amenable and non-amenable medical errors (believed to be the US #3 leading cause of death by multiple studies), the average American life expectancy, and anticipated life expectancies in the future (in addition to disability free years of life), it is 100% clear that we fail as a system.<p>A lot of these patients probably had missed or late cancer diagnoses too, due to the lack of preventative care and also just the lack of public health regulations in the US.<p>Pretty much every developed country has a better healthcare system than the US.<p>We do not have a normal system, and many like to think of it as normal, but it is far from that.<p>You can cherry pick data all day, but you are not seeing the big picture here, and you do not realize how easy it is to become a statistic.<p>I nearly died from medical errors in the US healthcare system myself, and from sepsis at age 23.<p>I am a dual US|EU citizen (culturally American) living in the EU, and I never plan on working in the US or living there long term.')
