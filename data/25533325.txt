I&#x27;ve never used two monitors; I prefer one large monitor with the top edge of the screen as close to eye level as possible. Lots of people seem to jack up their monitors on a stack of O&#x27;Reilly books or whatever, but that makes my eyes tired from tilting my head up. I have enough screen real estate to do a typical engineering workflow and I&#x27;ve never missed not having a second monitor.')
