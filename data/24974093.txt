Item(by='RobertoGonzalez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604355154, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974092, text='I got tinnitus a couple years ago and, after some digging around for a proper specialist I found out that the main valid treatments are Tinnitus Retraining Therapy to help people habituate to their Tinnitus, and Windowed White Noise, which has shown promising results in reducing its volume.<p>I turned all of that into a pretty simple web app that helps create a custom treatment and guide people through the diagnostic process. And more importantly, all the relevant scientific papers are linked so you can actually validate that it&#x27;s not snake oil (or at least not intended to be). It&#x27;s GPL, of course.<p>The main downside is that it has to be used 3 hours a day (at least based on most studies), which sounds like a bit much but is pretty doable if you use the app while sleeping or doing random busywork during the day.<p>At least in my particular case the results were pretty impressive (and given the timeframe I don&#x27;t believe it was merely a placebo), and seemed in line with the papers cited in the site, so I&#x27;m hoping this can help other patients deal with this condition.')
