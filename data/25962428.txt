She was concerned. &quot;Can you hear those children screaming?&quot; Stepping outside with her I found I could, just, maybe a few hundred metres away. &quot;We better call the cops&quot; I said. The cops arrived within minutes. It turned out that the local school had invited a farmer to bring some lambs to the school and we could hear the kids squealing in delight. The cops, my neighbor and I had a good laugh about it. This is one of many times I&#x27;ve talked to cops in my life and I&#x27;ve invariably had pleasant and good natured conversations. Perhaps I should mention I don&#x27;t live in the USA.')
