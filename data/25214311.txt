Most people today peg me on the conservative spectrum, which is not true both parties have been in lock step on the real issues and squabbling it out on &quot;emotional&quot; issues. This is the reason that Clinton doubled down on Regan&#x27;s&#x2F;Big Bush&#x27;s foreign policy and Little bush -&gt; Obama progressed similar domestic controls. They honestly don&#x27;t fight about anything they care about, just trigger issues, like sectional rights, the second amendment, abortion. I call them trigger issues, as they serve to divide people but honestly they could care less which way the chips fall on those issues which is why they never get resolved, but just keep getting stoked by the politicians.<p>To be honest even classic liberalism is dead, both are progressives when it comes to free trade, and unification of regulations across the globe.')
