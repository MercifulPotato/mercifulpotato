I think most securities settle T+2, which means that you are not the owner (and cash hasn&#x27;t gone out of the door) until 2 business days after the transaction. But the broker will show your account debited immediately and will add the stock to your portfolio in the UI too. It&#x27;s well intended but misleading.')
