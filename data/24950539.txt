Item(by='nabla9', descendants=None, kids=[24950828], score=None, time=1604143379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950400, text='I agree with you, Rogan is smart and long format allows more.<p>The problem is not one Rogan and one show, it&#x27;s that his style is spreading.<p>Rogan is smart but lacks general knowledge. Good hosts are very knowledgeable and pretend to know less for the sake of the audience. Rogan can&#x27;t do that.<p>Rogan projects sentiments like awe and wonder, but they are not genuine. They are just part of the  brand and character.<p>The end result is that his non-PC stance and alternative viewpoint falls  prey to hype, hustlers and pseudointellectuals. He ends up repeating phrases and platitudes and never analyzing them.')
