On Android, the DND (Do Not Disturb) app could get permissions to the call log and SMS, but this wasn’t possible on iOS. Apple pushed back on that requirement for privacy reasons and instead developed a way for the reporting to be done by the user and the information passed to the DND app to compose (not send) an SMS. No compromises were made to grant any permissions. To this day, the SMS permissions doesn’t exist on iOS.')
