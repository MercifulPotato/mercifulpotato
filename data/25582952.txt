Humans driving on these snow covered roads form emergent lanes having little to do with absolute positioning or even relative positioning of the curb. They form lanes based on what other humans do.<p>Self-driving cars that depend on knowing absolutely where they are and relatively where they are simply don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t function. We need self-driving cars that can behave as a human will for that. And that is a <i>long</i> way off.<p>No autonomous car has shown it can handle these common situations. Until then self-driving cars should not be approved nationally and probably be restricted to the arid and warm states that do not have winter.')
