Item(by='EdSchouten', descendants=None, kids=[25033787, 25036408], score=None, time=1604922020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25032956, text='I think it&#x27;s awesome that people are doing research in the area of version control systems. Even though Git is already pretty great in my opinion, there&#x27;s always stuff that can be done better. I would love to see what the future holds!<p>Anyway, what I find weird about the Pijul project is that they place the barrier to entry so damn high, that it&#x27;s absolutely not motivating to even give it a try:<p>- The Pijul front page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org</a>) has a prominent link in the middle that points to their source code hosting service, Nest. That page has always been dog slow. It takes multiple seconds for that page to open, and then it shows me &quot;Not found&quot;. Maybe I should log in to view the code? There is a &quot;Sign in&quot; form at the top right of the page, so maybe I should do that. Where&#x27;s the registration button?<p>- The project got renamed to Anu. A couple of days ago I tried to visit that page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anu.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anu.dev</a>), and I wasn&#x27;t able to find any source code there. I just tried to go there again and the page is offline.<p>- As BlackFingolfin pointed out, the blog post has a &quot;Warning about licenses&quot; at the top. Even though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how the GNU GPL works, it&#x27;s already a big motivator for me to simply close that tab. I do work in the area of data storage myself. Would I want to put myself at legal risk, just because I want to try an experimental VCS?<p>- Why isn&#x27;t there an official Git mirror of Pijul&#x2F;Any? Sure, it&#x27;s awesome if those tools can host themselves, but what about being able to set it up quickly? Pijul&#x2F;Any is written in Rust. Doesn&#x27;t Cargo depend on being able to &#x27;git clone&#x27; software for it to be installable?<p>I slowly get the feeling that the goal of the Pijul project was never to become popular in any way. To me it seems little more than a hobby project of someone with an interest in version control systems. That&#x27;s fine I suppose, but my fear is that this current approach is that the existence of this project simply acts as an impediment for truly motivated people to work on the next generation VCS.')
