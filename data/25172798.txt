Those are symptoms of a software development culture stuck in the past.<p>It would be pretty frustrating to go home from my day job, where we have a much better development workflow, and try to make a contribution to the Debian project using Debian&#x27;s tools and processes. And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only software engineer who would feel that way. That can become a real problem for the future of Debian if it&#x27;s not addressed.')
