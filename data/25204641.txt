There is this system wide bug on iOS where the animations actually BLOCK user input &#x2F; state changes. You can see this if you type in your pass code fast enough on the lock screen, such that you are interrupting the animated fade in of the dot for the previous digit. You’ll often lose a digit and have to start again from scratch. Infuriating! It’s the most fundamental relationship to betray, the relationship between touch and input. It registered my touch, but decided to ignore it because it wasn’t done with its pointless animation that some manager thought would look neat. Same thing happened with calculator and they fixed <i>that one case</i>, whereas it’s clearly a fundamental issue with UIKit.')
