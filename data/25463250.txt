Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25463417], score=None, time=1608259744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463074, text='&gt; Very curious why people are so strongly resisting the idea that russia is a prime suspect in this.<p>It&#x27;s really the other way around, there are a lot of people claiming that it was Russia without any apparent evidence:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339560149799854081" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339560149799854081</a><p>But there is a political subtext here. The red team is rooting for it to be China because it plays into a &quot;Trump was right that China is a problem&quot; narrative and coincides with the Hunter Biden thing and also the recent scandal about Congressman Swalwell (D-CA) having a relationship with a Chinese spy. The blue team correspondingly wants it to be not-China and thereby benefits from preemptively asserting that it was Russia.<p>This unfortunately makes it less likely that we&#x27;ll ever know because it&#x27;s hard enough to figure it out when there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a political motive for both sides to fudge the answer.')
