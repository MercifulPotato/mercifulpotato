Isn&#x27;t the shuffle button on or off based on the last time you changed it? If the shuffle is on, and you play an album, then you&#x27;ll play it shuffled. I&#x27;d much rather that than Spotify trying to predict whether I want to play something shuffled or not, and auto-changing the button status.')
