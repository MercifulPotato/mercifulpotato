So, on such note, I <i>have not</i> examined the output of the Flutter Web compiler to see if it is ridiculously obfuscated... have you? Again, it isn&#x27;t at all the case that the way it renders matters: it only matters how easy the behavior is to automatically and safely edit. (Frankly, the end game on ads is AI that does its thing on the resulting view: nothing else makes any sense, as it involves people who are incentivized to not help you to <i>choose</i> to help you.)')
