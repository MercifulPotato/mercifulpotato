Why should ride share companies be excluded from worker protections that apply to other companies?\nCould Amazon convert to a gig-economy for warehouse workers where you sign up via an app?<p>There are certainly some folks who drive just a few hours a week and the companies like to highlight that by releasing stats like “% of drivers drive less then 5 hours”.
