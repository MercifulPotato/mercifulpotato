That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they <i>had</i> merit, but arbitrarily many procedural dismissals don&#x27;t show that one way or the other.<p>I feel like this is the problem with the discourse right now. It&#x27;s understandable why you&#x27;re making that argument, because the media has been saying that for months now. Because in fact a large number of cases were dismissed (so it&#x27;s not technically a lie), but it&#x27;s only rhetorically effective if you don&#x27;t look at the details.<p>So then we end up with this massive polarization because one side keeps relying on an argument that sounds very convincing to their base who never hear the counterargument, but will never convince the other side who have, and then there is never reconciliation. Or even a motive to find more convincing arguments that there wasn&#x27;t fraud, because they&#x27;re only talking to their base and not even <i>trying</i> to convince the other side.')
