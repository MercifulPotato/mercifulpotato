The original premise wasn&#x27;t that sometimes everyone is a bit more alert or tired than others. It was someone who knew very well that they had a history of falling asleep at the wheel and wanted to continue driving apparently knowing it was likely to happen again.<p><i>We&#x27;re human and can&#x27;t say for certain that falling asleep is impossible (or some other medical event won&#x27;t happen).</i><p>Of course not. But normal people with a healthy lifestyle don&#x27;t just randomly fall asleep at the wheel in the absence of a serious (but perhaps undiagnosed) medical condition. The way a lot of the comments in this thread are defending driving while tired, you&#x27;d think millions of people could all just doze off without any warning or awareness that they were at unusually high risk.<p><i>You know they let some people drive who have extremely bad eyesight--bad enough that that they can&#x27;t read road signs?</i><p>In my country, such poor vision would (if not properly corrected) immediately disqualify you from holding a driving licence. This is a policy that I entirely agree with, so we apparently come from very different perspectives here.')
