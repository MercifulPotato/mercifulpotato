The 6502 instructions are faster but you need more of them to do the same task.<p>In the end, a 1 MHz 6502 was almost equivalent to a 3 MHz Z80. The Z80 was available up to 4 MHz but often ran at 3.58 MHz) and the 6502 was mostly 1 MHz (eg. Apple II, Commodore 64) but in a few systems (eg. BBC Micro, Commodore 128) it was 2 MHz.')
