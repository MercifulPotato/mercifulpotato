The doctor basically thought I was there to score narcotics but he wasn&#x27;t going to get me any (I wasn&#x27;t looking for them either but was told to eat Turmeric pills believe it or not - I did and don&#x27;t have any way to know if it helped.)<p>Does gout come and go - I have not had trouble since then.
