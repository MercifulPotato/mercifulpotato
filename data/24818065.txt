Combine that with grey market HK phones being smuggled onto the mainland to avoid tax, and it&#x27;s a pretty good bet that any phone destined for HK will makes its way across the border at some point.<p>If you roam on the mainland with a HK SIM you actually hop the GFW automatically, but most people swap SIMs at the border so that isn&#x27;t reliable.')
