I&#x27;ve had a handful of grants accepted and the vast majority not -- some schemes have a &lt;2% success rate (with applications coming from the best people on the planet) and the thing that just kills me is how the &#x27;peer review&#x27; of grants tends to be &quot;do I like you or not&quot;. I&#x27;ve been outright told that unless x- or y- is on the grant, it won&#x27;t get funded. And, irritatingly, those complaints are right. I&#x27;m faced with the daunting -- but exciting -- prospect of trying to somehow be one of those academics who people do not hate. I very much think that the pressures are there on both sides; they&#x27;re different, but being a postdoc does just <i>suck</i> for everything aside from the work – I think I was on my 13th short term contract (three of them 3 months or less!) before getting a permanent post. Naturally, this post is in a different country from my friends, family, and partner. I signed the paperwork last week. It&#x27;s been three days and I desperately miss my partner -- who is also an academic -- and the cat.<p>One (tenured) professor I knew left to go and work for his spin-out full time in industry. He told me that his belief was that academia was so bloody awful because it was a luxury: society wants you to continue to justify your existence sitting around and thinking every few years, whereas in a company, the $&#x2F;€&#x2F;£ is all the justification needed. I&#x27;m not sure to what extent I agree with that, but it&#x27;s definitely plausible.')
