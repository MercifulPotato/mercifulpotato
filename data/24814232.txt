Item(by='znpy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602976997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813528, text='Lenovo are also way better at warranty. In my experience they just asked for the serial number of the ThinkPad, it was still covered and they accepted it (and fixed it). It was an used laptop.<p>Dell OTOH asked for the original receipt of purchase, that of course I didn&#x27;t have because that also was an used laptop.<p>Also, the latitude series is way better than the xps line. I&#x27;ve got the latitude 7390 from dell and it&#x27;s just marvelous.<p>So yeah, if you&#x27;re buying new, dell or Lenovo ThinkPad (I&#x27;d recommend a ThinkPad though).<p>If you&#x27;re buying second hand, ThinkPad is the way.')
