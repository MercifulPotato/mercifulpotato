However, this issue comes to facebook using the sensitive speech arguement to shut them down. How many other groups are just as bad if you do a simple word search on their database? If they effectively shut down everyone and every group for the offense of saying dick immediately, fine. I&#x27;m okay with that. But arbitrarily doing so, especially when the group is hurting their financial overlords, that&#x27;s where I call bullshit and stand by using that word. They got zero flak pre this short squeeze and their attitude and speech is no different. But they&#x27;re embarrassing the folks who cry for gov bail outs. Focusing on them making offensive jokes is a red herring from wall street trying to cover their ass.')
