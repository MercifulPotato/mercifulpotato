There was also an Old Norse word &quot;vig&quot; meaning &quot;battle&quot;. Is that why they&#x27;re called &quot;vikings&quot;? Nobody seems to know. Did vikings call themselves &quot;vikings&quot; at all prior to the emergence of the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;wicing&quot;? No one seems to know that either.')
