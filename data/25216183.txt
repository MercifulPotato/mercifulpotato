You’re right, performance isn’t the fundamental issue, distance from user need and user pain is. Unfortunately even where that distance is short, mitigation can be hard to achieve. Understaffed and underfunded orgs can be wildly aware and even obsessed with shortcomings in their offerings and still fail to deliver improvements. I’ve worked in such orgs, I’ve seen overworked, deeply caring and empathetic and dedicated engineers trying to move mountains to fix (and have habitually been one myself).<p>More to the point: unfortunately the software needs in the world, and the ways the world are underserved by software, are competing for resources and organizing talent with organizations that fundamentally don’t serve those needs. And both categories are competing in a limited pool, because software’s capabilities have outpaced the available talent to take advantage of those capabilities.<p>Good for my bank account, I guess. But bad for people and the world we (I) inhabit. And bad for me too, probably even more than I know.<p>Anyway this is far afield of parent comment’s point, but I felt it was a good place to add a little depth as an engineer who gives a damn but rarely sees the opportunity to apply damns.')
