I think there is fundamentally no good reason why an IDE should be provided as one gigantic tool, because <i>that&#x27;s not how software works</i>. You could say Vim and Emacs aren&#x27;t IDEs, they&#x27;re <i>platforms for composing IDEs</i>. Software engineers swear by these platforms because their very structure is exceptionally well-aligned with the sort of high-quality software they want to build.')
