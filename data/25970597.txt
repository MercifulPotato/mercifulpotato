It&#x27;s natural to have mistakes, and changing position after &#x27;only&#x27; 3 days is fine enough. I also agree that we heard some good news, but I do think that the 95% RRR is relevant - people who have a strong enough immune reaction to make the disease asymptomatic are people who have been protected.
