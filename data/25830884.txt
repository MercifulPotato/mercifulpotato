I think people are missing out on the second hand commercial market. One of our most reliable CNCs is an old pod and rail that cost $10k. It is much more than any hobby machine.<p>Please if you&#x27;re getting into this look around at second hand machines. You&#x27;ll be able to do really well if you want to setup an old 90s machine with new electronics. It&#x27;s not as complex as building one from scratch and you get much better mechanical components.')
