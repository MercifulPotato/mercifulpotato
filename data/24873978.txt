Implying that an outrageous claim has merit because a severely watered down version of it might be accurate.<p>If you think there may be some rich people who engage in with underage prostitutes, you are almost certainly correct. It&#x27;s kind of dumb to make that a salient issue in your day to day if you don&#x27;t have any specifics, but sure, it&#x27;s probably still true somewhere. But let&#x27;s say you, for whatever reason, still think its really important to make sure people ask the question, are there rich pedophiles.<p>It should be patently obvious that aligning yourself at all with stupider ideas, even if they share a similar vein, is a bad idea. It harms your credibility to defend QAnon and then qualify that you only mean your portion. If you want to have a discussion, all you need to do is say &quot;pizza parlor stuff is dumb, QAnon is dumb, but there is some merit to rich pedophiles somewhere.<p>The weakness of conspiracy theorists is that they align themselves with other conspiracy theorists who offer some form of affirmation to their beliefs because they think a larger force is telling them lies. And maybe they are being told some lies.  Because that&#x27;s really all it is. You can adjust your level of craziness but the entire point of a conspiracy theory in-group is getting affirmation from others. If you had a genuine interest in an issue that you wanted to raise in public awareness or do something to combat it, the route of the conspiracy theorist is an awfully dumb way to do it. The spectrum is, at worst, dumb as rocks, and at best, unwise and lacking in self awareness.')
