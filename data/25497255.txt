Every single thing I watch, it suggests The Queen’s Gambit and two other random Netflix productions.<p>Even if I watch the first of a trilogy (LotR, for example). How can they be so terrible at this?<p>The categories in the main browsing view are also hysterically arbitrary. It kind of looks like a topic model with back-constructed titles for the topics.<p>Finally, they replaced the ratings with “% matching”. I guess so they can recommend their subpar productions even if they get low ratings.')
