There&#x27;s no way the NY Times would have published that fact free piece. All legitimate journalistic outlets passed on it, including the Wall Street Journal (like the New York Post, the WSJ is owned by Fox News&#x27; parent). Even the author of the NY Post article refused to put his name on it and much of the editorial staff at the Post was against releasing it. In short, it was fake propaganda delivered to them by Rudy Giuliani.')
