Universal basic income: in the longer term, this is more or less unavoidable if we don&#x27;t want total chaos and social unrest; also see below.<p>2. Bigger objectives: As automation grows in terms of its prevalence and the efficiencies it produces, we need to divert more resources on bigger projects that are focused towards long term goals for humanity like scientific exploration&#x2F;space&#x2F;energy&#x2F;medicine etc BUT instead of relying fully on automation to achieve them, we should have a balance of both human and automated labor to ensure that people who want to stay engaged, have the avenue to do so. If that makes things less than fully-efficient, so be it because i) the gains from automation elsewhere offsets that ii) the aim isn&#x27;t to increase shareholder value.<p>This probably produces following groups (and there likely will be overlaps&#x2F;grey areas):<p>a. Those who are driven by monetary goals: they can continue to pursue their ambitions in profit driven ventures that relies on automation (though automation itself might eat their jobs so this will be a constantly moving target)<p>b. Those who are driven by humanitarian goals&#x2F;recognition etc: this is an area that is underfunded and more investment of effort and resources will both help humanity and bring satisfaction to people in it. These problems are so big that even with more and more automation, we can practically throw the entire humanity behind them and still be short of the goals.<p>c. Those who are unable&#x2F;unwilling to participate in either corporate or humanitarian projects: I&#x27;m sure there will be a significant lot of people in this group but they should&#x2F;will still have a reasonable standard of living because of #1. People in groups a. and b. shouldn&#x27;t complain about them because they can join this group too (though based on human needs, I don&#x27;t think suddenly everyone will jump to this even if they are able to). Similarly someone who is in this group can get inspired and move to a. or b.')
