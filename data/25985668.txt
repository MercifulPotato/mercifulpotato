Being able to get money back after a failed transaction punishes bad actors and improves the trust factor for buyers.<p>The ability to build it into the base layer of the currency is an interesting breakthrough.  We say &quot;cash or gold is not reversible&quot;, but it&#x27;s less because it&#x27;s a desirable feature, and more that there&#x27;s no way to implement it.<p>The thing I&#x27;d be interested in would be if the right model is &quot;reactive&quot; reversal of disputed transactions, or some sort of &quot;proactive&quot; escrow model-- paying people with money that doesn&#x27;t activate until the customer has confirmed they got the promised goods&#x2F;services, or at least until a window for refund has passed.')
