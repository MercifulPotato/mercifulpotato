In fact, the comment that &#x27;SV trends left&#x27; kind of belies that fact. The power brokers and people in actual control of SV are libertarian, not left.<p>And antifa is an idea, not a singular, cohesive group. So if you weren&#x27;t talking about antifa as an idea (which isn&#x27;t uniquely American), what are you talking about? The made-up-by-right-wing-news organized leftist group that doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>Further, if you were an informed American, I&#x27;d hope that you would understand that those who tend to identify with antifa weren&#x27;t (and by and large aren&#x27;t) happy with the selection of Biden and Harris. Both are seen as defenders of the prison industrial complex.')
