You always, always needs to taste, poke, look. If your flour is of a different type of grain or not as fine, if you use different varieties of vegetables, or if your kitchen is a few degrees warmer or cooler, you WILL get different results.<p>So go ahead and use any mystical cup you want. Ingredient proportions are what matters. If you fail, write down what went wrong so you know better next time.')
