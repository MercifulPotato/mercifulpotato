Admittedly there were some genuine problems with how it was executed, i.e. blocking sidewalks and they even offered to move them but were rejected. There was a clip of some city official claiming that this man building shelters for homeless people did nothing to help them, yet his own plan to &quot;end homelessness&quot; somehow would. This video was rather old, probably early 2010s. I wonder how that politicians plan to end homelessness is doing.')
