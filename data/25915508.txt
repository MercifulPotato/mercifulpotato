Do you have any idea how complex it is to set up an inter-bank payment scheme? Vocalink are not even remotely easy to supplant, banks will just pass the extra costs onto merchants and wash their hands of it. There’s no profit in providing free financial services.<p>&gt; For example card not present transactions are going to have their fees jacked up<p>No doubt. MasterCard and Visa are both looking to make sure profits stay healthy. But if there’s something I know for sure, it’s that both companies know how to extract their pound of flesh. They’re masters of creating new fees, if they want to increase fees on card not present, then they will. If they can’t do it directly, they’ll find a way to do it indirectly.<p>&gt; For instance topping up your brokerage account with chargebacks possible would be very problematic.<p>Chargebacks are not a simple one-size-fits-all thing. There are hundreds of pages of rules outline when you can and can’t raise chargebacks. There are also ways to allow merchants to immunise themselves against chargebacks.<p>It’s already possible to top up brokerage accounts using a Credit&#x2F;Debit card. That’s because carve outs already exist in the chargeback rules which make it very difficult for a customer to raise a valid chargeback in those scenarios.')
