About 4-5 active users.  Extremely light (under 80MB RAM usage) as long as you don&#x27;t federate.  Attempted enabling federation once - maxed out all cores, all mem&#x2F;swap, and basically blew up the entire machine.  Had to wipe away the database and start without federation.<p>Encryption UI is a mess.  I have actively tried and failed to set up E2E encryption with at least one other technical user.  Recommend disabling encryption unless you want non-technical users to abandon ship immediately.')
