Electricity and chemicals are expended and recycled to pass the information on to your brain. The less light your eyes receive, the less work they have to do.<p>Similarily, the screen blasting the light with LEDs consumes more energy the brighter the light is. White is literally the most expensive color to both produce and process.<p>Additionally, excess light at times of the day when the Sun don&#x27;t shine messes up our evolutionary psycho-biology, causing issues with sleep.<p>So yes, light is literally bad for you, in this context. Natural sunlight is different because your skin needs it to produce essential vitamins.')
