A few times I have had multiple of them occur in the same reservation (the third garage we were sent to had a functioning car with check engine alerts).<p>I have tried rental cars, but then what if you want to go away for a week at a time? What if the car doesn&#x27;t have an EZ-Pass? How do you get to your final destination from the car rental place? A few months ago I waited one hour for a Lyft driver to pick me up (in a jalopy van on a toll-less route with no AC) to take me to the car rental place.<p>There is something to be said of having a functioning car waiting for you near your place of residence, even if it is only for 5% of the time. I imagine the same applies to other things in life.')
