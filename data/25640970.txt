You aren&#x27;t really contradicting the other person&#x27;s point.</i><p>And yet, I am. The weasel phrasing &quot;we don&#x27;t care&quot; implies:<p>(a) we should care<p>(b) everybody should care<p>(c) we&#x27;re doing the wrong thing by not caring<p>In other words, it takes the parent&#x27;s prioritization as some absolute correct one everybody should agree on (this is also evident from the rest of the comment).<p>As opposed to merely &quot;we have different priorities, and we don&#x27;t believe yours are important&quot;.<p>If the parent changed the &quot;they don&#x27;t care&quot; accusation to a neutral &quot;they don&#x27;t care about the things I care&quot;, I&#x27;d undersign it.')
