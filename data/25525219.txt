NBA stars do, and rightfully so! I don&#x27;t understand why many engineers feel like collective bargaining for more money is somehow dirty or an appropriation of a tool that is reserved for extremely oppressed workers. Engineers are extremely valuable to their employers, and are still probably under-compensated relative to the value they bring in.<p>Tech companies have no problem working together, illegally, to keep wages down. Workers should work together, legally, to push wages up. This does not mean that compensation needs to be based on seniority or anything like that, and union contracts do not necessarily mean an end to worker flexibility. Engineers can propose whatever rules they think are fair.<p>However, I do agree that ethical concerns are a strong reason to organize, and a proper subject for union negotiations.')
