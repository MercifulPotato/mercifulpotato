I don&#x27;t think twice about ordering an item on Amazon for $2 that a hardware store downstairs sells for $5. I understand why the store&#x27;s margins need to be that high but I also need to make sound financial decisions and don&#x27;t make enough to subsidize anyone else. At the end of the day I&#x27;m still contributing to Amazon&#x27;s growth at the expense of a more fragmented market of small businesses.')
