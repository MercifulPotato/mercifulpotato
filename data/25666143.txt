At normal times he does stuff and worsen things.<p>For example, on the whole China trade war. The USâ€™s net imports from China are higher than they have been since the mid 2000s. Chinas economic strength relative to the US is higher than its ever been. Instead of the US being trading and strengthening relationships with Pacific nations until Trump ripped the TPP its now China that has those trading relationships. The EU is reducing interactions with the US and just signed a deal with China, something that may have been unthinkable for them even ( years ago. The US is absolutely non existent in Africa while China continues to build relationships ans trade links there. Thanks to the US trade war China has drastically increased trade with Brazil (to procure soybeans instead of from the US) while US relationships with South America continue to weaken.<p>Trump has presided over worsening relationships with literally every other continent barring Antarctica, and as a direct consequence of his actions China has greatly improved relationships in all those continents.')
