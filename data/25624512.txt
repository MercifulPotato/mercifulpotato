B trees and their variants like B+ trees are pretty straightforward conceptually but there seems to be scarce resources on the nitty gritty details past find&#x2F;insert&#x2F;delete.<p>For example I&#x27;m interested in redistribution algorithms, duplicate key semantics, and merging. The relative naivety of their implementation can have a large impact on performance&#x2F;storage depending on how the store is used.')
