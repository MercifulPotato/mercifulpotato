Hollywood, Westwood, Downtown, &amp; various valley locations. With the exception of San Monica, one can park without consideration on the block of their destination, and non-franchise eateries of many ethnicities outside the fashionable expensive vortex are still common. As far as &quot;crime bad&quot;, LA&#x27;s reputation is a product of Hollywood and nothing like its dangerous reputation - people here are generally <i>nice</i> to strangers because everyone is a stranger. And who knows, if a stranger are dangerous, be nice as a default and you won&#x27;t find out. Most other cities trying to &quot;live up to LA&quot; over do it and are much more unfriendly towards strangers.')
