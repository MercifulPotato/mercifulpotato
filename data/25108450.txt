Item(by='skykooler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605505160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102358, text='This reminds me of various videos I&#x27;ve seen where people strap the guts of a quadcopter to various lightweight things to make them fly (the most recent being the Corridor Crew video on making a flying Nerf gun), and they just...work. (With much shorter battery life.) Of course, that&#x27;s almost entirely thanks to the control electronics - that sort of active stabilization enables almost anything to fly. You couldn&#x27;t do the same thing with a passively-stable R&#x2F;C airplane, for example (speaking from experience).')
