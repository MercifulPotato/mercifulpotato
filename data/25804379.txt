Even if most people never travelled more than a couple miles from their birthplace, the information those people knew, like how to draw animals, is able to rapidly jump from person to person in order to cross continents. This isn&#x27;t just the domain of lyric poetry. Modern electronics works the same way. When you press the return key on your keyboard, there are unlikely to be any physical electrons that travel from your keyboard to the CPU or even from one side of the CPU to another. It&#x27;s surprising how fast these information transmission processes can happen even with comparatively immobile and lossy information carriers.')
