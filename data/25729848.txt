The promises of jobs from domestic production of panels also never quite panned out due to competition from Europe and installation&#x2F;maintenance related jobs are likely offset by reduced competitiveness from electrical costs not to mention increased strategic dependence on China for components.<p>Wind has been quite a bit better but locals are starting to push back from what I&#x27;ve been reading.')
