Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608902041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535815, text='&gt; I see you use multiple monitors, does Sizer play well with them?<p>It supports them well.<p>It has a drop down box where you can define the monitor you want for a specific entry and then window positions will be relative to that monitor.<p>Alternatively you can also set a window&#x27;s position to any X &#x2F; Y coordinate. So if you had let&#x27;s say 2x 2560x14440 monitors and you wanted to position a window to the 2nd monitor you can tell Sizer to move it to X coordinate 3050 and it would be +500 pixels into the 2nd monitor. You just need to enable the checkbox &quot;allow move outside screen bounds&quot;. That could be useful I guess if you wanted a window to span more than 1 monitor and you have super thin bezels.')
