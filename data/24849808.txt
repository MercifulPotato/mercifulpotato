Item(by='atleta', descendants=None, kids=[24849883], score=None, time=1603299925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849544, text='Yes, that&#x27;s what it means. They do scan when&#x2F;if you visit them. I&#x27;m not a native, but &quot;is scanning&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound right here because it means that it&#x27;s happening right now. However, the title says &quot;the browser&quot; (i.e. the browser of whoever visits) and that is not happening right now, only when that browser does visit. So, I&#x27;d say that &quot;is scanning&quot; should go with &quot;browsers&quot; (i.e. they are scanning the browsers in general, not a specific browser).<p>But anyway, the sentence means what you think it should :).')
