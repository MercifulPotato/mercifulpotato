Bingo, you can now use all of them.<p>The rest of the network doesn&#x27;t care what they look like at certain scopes.  Those devices just know to route it to the next hop, and when that next-hop is your box with a bunch of interfaces&#x2F;aliases&#x2F;whatever configured, it&#x27;ll just handle it.<p>Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.<p>(Edit: IPv4 here, hence &#x2F;32.
