(well, other than McCarthy and Lisp)<p>A Church boolean is either:<p><pre><code>  true = 位t.位f.t\n  false = 位t.位f.f\n</code></pre>\nSo instead of writing an expression with keywords like<p><pre><code>  if bool then yep else nope\n</code></pre>\nJust use the boolean as a function and apply it to the then and else clauses like<p><pre><code>  bool yep nope\n</code></pre>\nSo the shape is very similar to modern languages, but with less syntactic scaffolding.')
