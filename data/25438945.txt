May I ask how you&#x27;ve promoted the service? I just started my own side project (see my profile) and this is the one aspect that I find challenging.<p>My feedback: I like the site. The video is helpful. The design of the page could be a little slicker, although I kind of like how it isn&#x27;t super slick. It makes feel more like a small business I might want to support. A couple minor things:<p>- The text for the 3 steps is super dense. I honestly didn&#x27;t even bother to read it. I&#x27;d try to reduce the copy a bit to one short sentence each.<p>- The artwork for the 33Mail logo and the icons for the 3 steps look a bit blurry. Higher res images here would make the page feel even more professional.')
