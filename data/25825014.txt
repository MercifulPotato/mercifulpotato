GCC will even optimize away the XOR operations when this is used for simple things like ints on amd64. I did a simple compile test, and with -O1 and higher I got identical machine code for the XOR algorithm and the naive swapping version. Without optimization I did get the XOR instructions, but the number of machine instructions was longer than for the naive case, and the number of CPU registers used was the same.')
