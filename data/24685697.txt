Creeper explosions don&#x27;t drop all destroyed blocks so you will never have enough material to fill the holes even if you wanted to. Finally, because they very rarely destroy my own structures and I don&#x27;t want that.<p>It&#x27;s not like there is any point in killing creepers in modded minecraft. The vast majority of monster loot in minecraft is worthless.<p>If it is annoying then turn it off. It&#x27;s just pointless busywork. I&#x27;ve played a lot of games where adding a few tweaks here and there would have made it ten times more enjoyable.')
