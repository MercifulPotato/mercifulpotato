Here in Australia, our federal &quot;Bureau of Meteorology&quot; (BoM) was <i>hacked</i> by a state-sponsored attacker, and used as a stepping stone to get into the networks of other government agencies that had private links to BoM.<p>Not the only time they got hacked: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewdaily.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;national&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;bureau-meteorology-scam-advertisement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewdaily.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;national&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;bureau-m...</a><p>This was called out a while ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itnews.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-government-websites-that-still-arent-secure-531301" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itnews.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-government-websites-that-...</a><p>The money shot is: &quot;As part of this, BoM is planning to upgrade its web presence over the next two years as part of a <i>$31 million digital channels platform deal</i> with Accenture.&quot;<p>Two years later, they <i>still</i> don&#x27;t have HTTPS on their main page. What kills me is that the main site URL <i>is actually reachable</i> over HTTPS.<p>Check this out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bom.gov.au&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bom.gov.au&#x2F;</a><p>You get an error message -- using HTTPS and a valid certificate -- saying: <i>&quot;The Bureau of Meteorology website does not currently support connections via HTTPS.&quot;</i> and then you&#x27;re redirected to HTTP!<p>Apparently $31 million and a year of effort is sufficient to buy a $50 SSL certificate, but doesn&#x27;t stretch far enough to actually deploy it...<p>PS: In case you&#x27;re wondering if this is some sort of infrastructure issue: Their site is served via Akamai CDN.')
