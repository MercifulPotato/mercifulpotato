I guess a lot depends on wording, but when one person is predicting the dollar will be worthless, and the person in the role of judge claims that given global economic uncertainty, it&#x27;s a &quot;close&quot; question, I wonder if they&#x27;re just saying that to be diplomatic.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty, but one way to think about it, is that it can get so much worse than it currently is. And it seems like the predictions being wagered over were pointing to the &quot;so much worse&quot;. I think the same holds for the environment, and for the proposed war between rich and poor.<p>I get the temptation to treat those as close, because there&#x27;s tensions that you could imagine leading to some worst case scenarios. And so one might want to acknowledge the tension, and you want to put that acknowledgment into some sort of partial credit. But I think that way of thinking gets all confused and hair splitty, and comes from a place of thinking everything&#x27;s a trick question, and not wanting to be perceived as overlooking nuances.<p>Anyhow, credit to all parties involved for formalizing their discussion and getting a bet out of it. I think those kinds of conversations are valuable, and I think it helps to get people thinking about what it takes for beliefs to be true over the long run.')
