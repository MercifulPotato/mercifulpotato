Wall Street money corrupts absolutely.<p>In a sane market, there would be no advantage to making an investment and then selling it a few milliseconds later. It introduces unnecessary volatility and incentivizes insider trading and other illegal activity[1]. It defeats the original purpose of the market: to make long term investments. It also leads to some unbelievable waste:<p><i>Tradersâ€™ need for speed has grown so voracious that two companies are currently building underwater cables (price tag: around $300 million each) across the Atlantic, in an attempt to join Wall Street and the London Stock Exchange by the shortest, fastest route possible. When completed in 2014, one of the cables is expected to shave five to six milliseconds off trans-Atlantic trades.</i>[2]<p>The problem is that our 20% of our economy is &quot;financial services&quot;. It&#x27;s doubled in the last hundred years or so[3]. Technology isn&#x27;t shrinking this sector because the people who own it also own lobbyists who own Congress. They write the rules so they can play stupid financial games, and then force the government to bail them out when the latest ponzi scheme hits maturity.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;first-hft-casualty-finra-fines-trillium-1-million-quote-stuffing-and-general-market-manipula" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;first-hft-casualty-finra-f...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;high-frequency-trading-danger-risk-wall-street&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;high-frequency-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;monkey-cage&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;how-wall-street-became-a-big-chunk-of-the-u-s-economy-and-when-the-democrats-signed-on&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;monkey-cage&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;2...</a>')
