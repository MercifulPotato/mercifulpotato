Virtually all unnatural colored leather is made this way too (though most brown leather is dyed too).<p>Not that it really changes much for you, but it seems unlikely that it&#x27;s specifically mammalian skin to blame (I would assume exotic leathers from non-mammal sources probably have the same effect for you) and you might actually be sensitive to the tanning chemicals or any of the other leather conditioners or dyes that the leather has absorbed.')
