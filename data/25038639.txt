I had committed them to the development branch before starting to write the post. There&#x27;s a second post describing the concrete improvements that were committed:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcommunity.microsoft.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;azure-database-for-postgresql&#x2F;improving-postgres-connection-scalability-snapshots&#x2F;ba-p&#x2F;1806462" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcommunity.microsoft.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;azure-database-for-po...</a><p>There&#x27;s more to do, of course, but in my opinion this addresses the biggest issues.<p>&gt; What is the MS policy&#x2F;plans for enhancing Postgresql? On one hand MS sells competitor (Sql Server), on the other profits from Postgresql managed instances. How does it work out for Postgresql?<p>A few colleagues and I, all with a pre-MS history of contributing to Postgres, spend the majority of our time developing &#x2F; maintaining open source Postgres. There&#x27;s resulting features &#x2F; patches in PG13 (released) and PG14 (in development). Committed work includes, spilling hash-joins, collation versioning, faster recovery &#x2F; replication, connection scalability improvements among others.')
