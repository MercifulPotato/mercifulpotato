For example, if you criticize BLM for looting, you will be labeled racists.<p>Looting small shop owners makes no sense. Many shop owners are even black. This happened in Seattle where many shop owners support BLM.<p>You might say, well, that was an exception. But Noah Trevor (an influential person) also justified looting because police breaks social contract first. Now why would you loot random shops because of that? The fact that Noah hasn&#x27;t been canceled makes me think a lot of BLM supporters see looting as positive.<p>To sum up, you basically can&#x27;t say anything bad about BLM. Otherwise, you would be labeled as racists and canceled.<p>This is a trend in the far-left politics. They would force you to <i>personally</i> sacrifice to better society. Another example is homeless people camping in front of your shop. If you try to make them go away, you will also be canceled. This far-left politics is just evil, IMO.')
