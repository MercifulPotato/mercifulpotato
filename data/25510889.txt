The narrow depth of field of a good camera+lens combo looks <i>vastly</i> different from a consumer webcam, and survives compression (easily, in fact, since the low frequency data in the background gets quantized less brutally than the high-frequency data of your face). In fact, I think that’s the primary visual cue for the “pro” look. Your GX8 is MFT, so you&#x27;d need a pretty wide lens (at least f&#x2F;2, ideally f&#x2F;1.4) to appreciate this.')
