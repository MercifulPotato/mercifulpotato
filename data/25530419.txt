The article is about a BMW campaign in which BMW will pay a lot of money to shame BMW customers and send a very very strong message to anyone who sees these billboards: DON&#x27;T BUY BMW.<p>Somebody inside BMW has an axe to grind and has decided their coworkers are a bunch of idiots. Rather than quit, they&#x27;ve decided to use their coworkers&#x27; stupidity against the company. In a too impossible to be be true storyline, they keep pitching obviously self-destructive strategies to their coworkers who lap them up and implement them.')
