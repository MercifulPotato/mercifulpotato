Your making an assumption and straight up saying it&#x27;s an assumption, but not providing any evidence that this assumption is true.  You make another analogy which may or may not apply. I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, and I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re right.  I&#x27;m saying there is no possible way any of us can know at this point.')
