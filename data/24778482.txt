Prior to Netflix streaming offering, people searched and chose movies to watch in the mail based off recommendations from their social circles. When there is no discovery option, Netflix is forced to &quot;guess&quot; what it&#x27;s customers want rather than know. They&#x27;ve completely removed the social aspect of enjoying shows to the point where people say &quot;have you seen x?&quot; &quot;yes&quot; and that&#x27;s the end of the conversation.')
