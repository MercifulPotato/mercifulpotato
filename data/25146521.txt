Sure people go to Starbucks for one off coffees and sure some do that exclusively. But almost every startup to enterprise company has an expresso machine in the kitchen.<p>So in most cases, if I want a coffee I don&#x27;t go to Starbucks. They I go to the kitchen, it&#x27;s faster, cheaper, and more convenient than going to Starbucks.<p>However, if I&#x27;m out and about it doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to invest in temporary coffee infrastructure. In those cases it&#x27;s easier to go to a cafe like Starbucks.<p>This matches the idea of the article. If you have consistent demand it makes sense to buy infrastructure to meet that demand.  But if the project is temporary or extremely bursty it may make sense to have someone else do it for you.')
