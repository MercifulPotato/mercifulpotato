Yup, it is a bit confusing, I&#x27;m taking all the feedback here and making UI&#x2F;structure changes. And I&#x27;ll definitely write more in the about page. I&#x27;m aware of the broken links too...<p>I&#x27;m guessing you made an anonymous account? Those can only post on communities which allow anonymous posts.
