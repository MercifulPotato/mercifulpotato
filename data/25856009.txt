Even relatively high powered transmitters aren&#x27;t detectable for an Arecibo-class antenna more than a few AU from Earth. If you want a signal detected light years away you need it to be highly directional. An isotropic radiator emitting enough power to be detected light years away is called a star.<p>So any SETI signals we might detect would almost certainly need to be intentional. That doesn&#x27;t mean they would need to be responses to something we&#x27;ve broadcast just the sender was aiming their transmitter towards the solar system and sent a signal.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140719094337&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computing.edu.au&#x2F;~bvk&#x2F;astronomy&#x2F;HET608&#x2F;essay&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140719094337&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.comput...</a>')
