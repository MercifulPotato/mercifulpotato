I tried switching from Dex to Methylphenidate, but after one day I quit because of how it made me feel (paranoia++).<p>Fluctuated on-and-off the Dex for a while (i.e. taking it a few days a week), but the whip-saws in dopamine levels really hit me hard, anxiety++.<p>Recently switched over to Atomoxetine (brand name Strattera) which has an off-script application to treating ADHD. It has a much more subtle effect than Dex, and has to be taken daily it to be effective. After about ~30 days of Atomoxetine I feel MUCH better, anxiety and stress is only at background levels.<p>Atomoxetine is nowhere near Dex in terms of focus and energy, but it does certainly address many ADHD symptoms + doesn&#x27;t create the residual anxiety (at least for me). Libido isn&#x27;t 100% of unmedicated, but nowhere near as bad as amphetamines.')
