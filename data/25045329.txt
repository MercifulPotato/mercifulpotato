This is a feature and we cannot complain when a candidate uses this legal right.<p>Likewise, if a candidate alleges fraud there is a legal process and the relevant courts will assess the evidence.<p>Of course we can argue that Trump may be making unfounded allegations and that he is obstructing but we need to let the process plays out before judging if there is a problem with the American democratic process. So far it seems quite robust in dealing with disagreements.<p>We are not in a post-truth world on this matter. Evidence and facts, not allegations, will be used.')
