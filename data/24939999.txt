Maybe they plan a WASM implementation?<p>Vega schemas are JSON and JSON is quite portable, despite its JS origins.<p>Vega has actually become fairly popular in the Clojure ecosystem (see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metasoarous&#x2F;oz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metasoarous&#x2F;oz</a>) due to how well the data-orientation fits the Clojure philosophy. I also think Altair for Python is quite popular (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;altair-viz&#x2F;altair" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;altair-viz&#x2F;altair</a>) and that is a Vega-lite library.')
