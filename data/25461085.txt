(and I lost significant weight in the last 3 years, so I&#x27;m medically &quot;normal&quot;, which is 20-30% percentile -- i.e. most people are heavier than me)<p>Ditto for butter -- natural, whole fats were &quot;out of fashion&quot; 20 years ago because of incorrect nutritional knowledge foisted upon you by interested parties.  Again, there are many mainstream books that cover these topics, like Pollan&#x27;s.<p>---<p>And as much as these comparisons make sense, I would say that lard is also healthier than a cereal with the following ingredients:<p><i>Whole Oat Flour, Wheat Starch, Sorghum Berry Bran, Modified Corn Starch, Brown Sugar, Salt, Tricalcium Phosphate, Tripotassium Phosphate, Mixed Tocopherols (Vitamin E) added to maintain freshness.</i><p>The sugar, salt, and preservatives gives me pause.  I believe that unprocessed sugars like honey, maple syrup, and dried fruit are easier for the body to metabolize, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very controversial these days.<p>So I eat granola without preservatives or much added sugar instead (although you can be tricked by concentrated apple or pear juice, etc. which is basically sugar).  You have to pay about double, and it rules out about 50% of what&#x27;s on the shelves at Whole Foods, and maybe 80% at Safeway.  But I think it&#x27;s cheaper in the long term.')
