All we seem to do is shift the blame to someone with more moral flexibility while also losing power in the process. And our representatives are now selling our power to the highest bidder. At the same time, representative democracies at least help protect minorities against lynch mobs and group think a bit but that&#x27;s far from guaranteed.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced which system is better or not, personally, or if a better system can exist.')
