Item(by='Jaxkr', descendants=None, kids=[25774530], score=None, time=1610617321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771285, text='$1 per user&#x2F;year sounds about right. I use Telegram more than any other chat app. People send lots of media (and even large files) and Telegram archives them forever. One group Telegram I’m in is 6 years old and has 500+ VIDEOS (and 10,000s of images) permanently archived in it.<p>I’d estimate I cost over $10&#x2F;yr to telegram.')
