What would have happened if people stopped Hitler from standing in beer halls blaming Jews for everything. He wouldn&#x27;t have been able to gather a following and influencer so many people and so many lives would have been spared. I use the Hitler example, because what we&#x27;re seeing is Trump trying to grasp power not via a vote but undermining the vote and is stirring up tensions pretty much like Hitler.<p>I get everyone thinks free speech is essential, but we live in a world where free speech is not a thing for very valid reasons. Germany only promises freedom of opinion; they don&#x27;t actually promise you can tell anyone that opinion, try denying the holocaust. And in Germany, you&#x27;re not legally allowed to insult someone (civil matter, but still not legal), in Berlin, and someone got convicted (eventually overturned but the fact it happened is massive) for farting on a police officer. The US, which claims to be the centre of freedom, has one of the lowest press freedoms and a multitude of laws to keep things secret. There are things that we know people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to say. Freedom of speech is a myth and should not be used to enable the destruction of democracy or to spread propaganda (in any sense).<p>I&#x27;m sure the majority of people here would agree terrorism propaganda videos shouldn&#x27;t be hosted on twitter or youtube, and people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to promote terrorism. Well, this is basically the same, in many of the Trump supporter stuff, I&#x27;ve seen calls for domestic terrorism.<p>Also, I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realise why we&#x27;re seeing an increase in companies stepping up here. Biden has offically won, now. All states have certified who won. The election is over. All that can be done now is stirring up hate and starting a civil war.')
