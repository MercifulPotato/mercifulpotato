I guess that functions as a sort of equivalent to building tier-2 factories in TA, although there&#x27;s max 1-2 of those in each factory.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to describe is rather the feeling of being quite lost still after 20 games or so, because I can&#x27;t remember for the life of me which unit from which factory does what, even less what it works well with, and almost nothing about what mid-game units I can expect from the enemy given the observed factory they have.<p>Yes, the chassis, costs, and speeds give them different edges, but a more perfect game IMO would turn &quot;Some factories even have low tier units with specific features&quot; into &quot;there&#x27;s few enough units that each feels like it has a specific feature&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure which way this would be best achieved: by combining some factories where units overlap most? By splitting factory groups into factions? After all, the original TA had a good faction&#x2F;factory overlap: kbots+vehicles * arm+core gives 4 sets of overlaps, with some unique units in between them.<p>I do like the different experiments: cloaks? shields? jump? meelee? mines? disruption? All are awesome riffs on the concept, but too much all at once. Alpha Centauri dealt with it by letting the player piece units together and save as presets, instead of letting them blend in player&#x27;s mind.<p>In all seriousness, I get the point of having 3 AA towers: one that can shoot ground, one that is somewhat powerful, and one for mid-late game. What you say about adjusting to swarms etc is not something that I expected (and my AA defenses have been historically useless for some reason), so maybe I&#x27;m just playing a game I&#x27;m not able to enjoy :P')
