That quickly adds up to almost 8 hours per week in the bus&#x2F;metro.<p>Why not move closer to the city? Well for one I don&#x27;t like living in high density urban areas. The noise level, construction work and high price makes it uninteresting to me.<p>So I would love the hybrid 2 days in the office, 3 days remote to have real meetings without having to go back wasting ~10% of my waking time in public transports, but I absolutely understand that some (especially with children!) might want a clean separation between home and work.')
