I didn&#x27;t really interact with what they were doing that much so I just assumed they were experts in the area and I just didn&#x27;t understand. Overtime I ended up working with them more and more and I started looking at what problems they were solving and how they were approaching it. The more I looked the more I didn&#x27;t understand their approach, and slowly it dawned on me. They&#x27;re not geniuses doing things at an incredibly advanced level that goes over my head. They were actually doing really stupid stuff and I didn&#x27;t understand it, because it was insane. What they were really doing - in my opinion - was cargo cult software development practices. They&#x27;d worked with complex well designed systems that they hadn&#x27;t really understood and were reproducing a weird facsimile of it.<p>That&#x27;s very much how I feel about Bitcoin. The more I see and the more I understand the less I believe any of the peoples explanations. Not least because if you ask 5 different Bitcoin proponents, you&#x27;ll get 5 completely different answer about why it&#x27;s valuable - from the unlikely (USD is going to inflate like we&#x27;re living in Venezuela), to the untrue (BTC is decentralized), to the unprovable (BTC is digital gold).<p>Sometimes the reason the explanations don&#x27;t make sense is because they&#x27;re not right - and the alternative that BTC is a bubble or manipulated, atleast needs to be considered.')
