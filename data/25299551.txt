It&#x27;s quite time efficient when building and installing to not have to attempt to resolve dependencies.<p>It&#x27;s going to burn disk space like crazy, isn&#x27;t it? If I install packages foo-1.0 and bar-1.0 and foo-1.0 uses glibc-2.31 and bar-1.0 uses glibc-2.30 then I now have 2 versions of glibc... but that scales to every package I install and every library every one of them uses. Of course, this can be fixed... by automatically building new versions of every package any time any of their dependencies changes, in which case we&#x27;re probably not wasting much disk because we traded and are now burning CPU time like there&#x27;s no tomorrow (and network, and disk I&#x2F;O, and memory, and anything else used in package builds). Basically, this sounds like reinventing static binaries, with all the downsides thereof.')
