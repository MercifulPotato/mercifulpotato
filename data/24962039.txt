Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604260841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957459, text='&gt; I think it&#x27;s good to point out once in a while that there is no right to drive a car, but there is a right to walk in public spaces. The responses in these threads always devolve to &quot;But I have to drive my car, and if I can&#x27;t do it safely, then people are just going to have to die.&quot;<p>from a formal legal perspective, sure, but this kind of ignores the &quot;facts on the ground&quot; in the US. it&#x27;s unfortunate, but most people in this country really do need access to a car to complete basic life tasks. outside of uncharacteristically dense places like NYC, it&#x27;s a privileged minority that is able to get by without owning a car or having a reliable friend &#x2F; family member that owns one. I live in one of the few truly walkable areas of my city, but I can only afford this because I have a good software job 25 miles out in the suburbs.<p>&gt; If you really can&#x27;t drive slowly enough, then avoid streets like that, ride a bike, walk, bus, cab, etc. In these kinds of crowded, pedestrian-filled areas, I&#x27;ll drive 10 mph. I don&#x27;t care. That&#x27;s the speed I feel is right and safe for me and my neighbors. Speed limits really are limits. I _can_ drive slow enough.<p>even 10 mph isn&#x27;t slow enough to avoid hitting a pedestrian in every possible situation. it takes around 0.7-3 seconds for a driver to notice a hazard in the road and start applying the brakes. if you are an exceptionally alert driver and hit the 0.7 s figure, you have already traveled 10 feet towards the pedestrian before you&#x27;ve even started to slow down. if the pavement is dry and your brakes and tires are in good condition, you will come to a complete stop in another five feet. if, as in my example, someone darts out from between two parked cars, you <i>will</i> hit them if you do not have at least 15 feet in which to stop (although you probably won&#x27;t injure them severely at this speed). again, this is assuming absolutely ideal conditions for you and your vehicle.<p>keep in mind, people routinely bump into each other <i>while they&#x27;re both walking</i>. no amount of caution is sufficient to prevent a mishap when one party is totally oblivious. this is what I&#x27;m responding to here. I totally agree that the driver of a 1.5+ ton vehicle has a greater responsibility than someone moving under the power of their own two feet. what I don&#x27;t agree with is that a pedestrian can step into oncoming traffic at any time and expect the whole world to stop for them or for it to automatically be someone else&#x27;s fault if they get hit. as individuals, we can&#x27;t reorganize america&#x27;s entire transportation infrastructure overnight to eliminate the need for cars. we absolutely can accept a few minor inconveniences to make transit much safer for drivers and pedestrians both.<p>also, random aside: why do so many people suggest a bus or a cab as an alternative to driving in these threads? a bus or cab driver does not typically drive any more carefully than I do. all that accomplishes is to shift the liability onto someone else. the liability is not really a problem for me in the first place. I already drive more carefully than is needed to avoid legal fault in these situations.')
