Imported all my google mail, so I did not loose anything. What I love about fastmail is their pure focus on mailing. It’s a beautiful product with many useful features. For instance you can create as many alias names as you like (although I heard there is a limit, but I haven’t hit that yet). I create an alias for any new website I sign up. I also have aliasses that serve as a base-name (for instance mypurchases@fastmail.com) and can be used multiple times like so for instance: amazon@mypurchases.fastmail.com.<p>Edit:<p>I am also using my personal domain instead of @fastmail.com You never know when &#x2F; if you need to leave a service provider again, and you don‘t want to change your email address again.')
