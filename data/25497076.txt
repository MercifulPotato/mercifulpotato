It would only need to release a pro body like Red, Black Magic, etc, supporting different mounts (Nikon F, etc) and an integrated workflow with Final Cut.<p>It has already done that for the consumer market and part of the enthusiast market...<p>My guess as to why Apple hasn&#x27;t done it yet is because the the pro market is peanuts (for them). It also wouldn&#x27;t look too good. It&#x27;s one thing to compete with Samsung, and another too put many beloved brands (Arri, etc) out of business with the snap of a finger.')
