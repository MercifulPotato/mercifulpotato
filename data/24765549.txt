Item(by='mannykannot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602597298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765051, text='&gt; &quot;Intelligence&quot; is a word that, etymologically and semantically, is related to human or human-like capabilities. You wouldn&#x27;t say that a leaf floating on a lake is swimming.<p>The definition of words changes in response to increasing knowledge - just take &#x27;energy&#x27; for example. One cannot  establish truths about the world by arguments from usage. (On the other hand, to be clear, I do not think that the current state of AI merits being called &quot;intelligence&quot;. What happens in the future is speculation.)<p>&gt; What&#x27;s happening in my brain is something we don&#x27;t have full scientific knowledge of, but we know it&#x27;s not x86 machine code.<p>The introduction of x86 machine code at this point seems to be moving away from your original claims about &quot;AI&quot; being &quot;just&quot; relatively simple (though not simply linear) mathematical models, which are not &quot;just&quot; machine code either. The interesting (and very much open) question is how much of intelligence can be modeled in this way, and what else, if anything, is necessary.<p>The more you stress the simplicity of these models, the more intriguing their achievements seem.')
