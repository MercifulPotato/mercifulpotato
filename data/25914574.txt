So as I understand it, a dating app would not need your explicit consent to share a profile photo with others on the platform since that is the whole point of the app.<p>But if the service decides to provide your personal data to advertisers, explicit consent is required, since that is not essential for providing the service. The service could just as well show anonymous ads, or target ads without tracking the user.')
