Slaving was practiced across the world, and is generally regarded as &quot;barbaric&quot; because, well, it is.  BUT the &quot;West&quot; did NOT make African Slavery.. Its incomplete to say that, and points fingers at modern people in the USA.  I cannot start to give examples without a complete treatment due to the seriously toxic nature of this subject. But since I personally am descended from people in the USA that opposed slavery for the last 300 years AT LEAST, in EVERY FORM, I am sensitive, and strongly opposed, to a &quot;guilt by association&quot; on this topic.')
