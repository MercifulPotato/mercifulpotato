We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings. This includes helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our Services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities. Facebook and the other companies in the Facebook family also may use information from us to improve your experiences within their services such as making product suggestions (for example, of friends or connections, or of interesting content) and showing relevant offers and ads. However, your WhatsApp messages will not be shared onto Facebook for others to see. In fact, Facebook will not use your WhatsApp messages for any purpose other than to assist us in operating and providing our Services.&quot;<p>Definition of Services: &quot;all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.&quot;<p>Ads are the bulk of Facebook&#x27;s &quot;Services&quot; but it&#x27;s remarkable how they avoid saying it.')
