Firefox’s founders are all long, long gone. Brendan and Mitchell are Mozilla’s founders.<p>Well then, you should have thought about that before you forcibly kicked out founder Brendan Eich because you disliked his unrelated politics.<p>You can be a woke company that belittles everyone who doesn&#x27;t share your narrow ideology or a company that makes a good web browser with a sound business model. You can&#x27;t be both.<p>Firefox has been a shitty web browser for many years now. I&#x27;ve largely abandoned it for Brave (interestingly created by Eich) and Chrome. Good riddance.')
