Shall we talk about Vietnam or Korea? Or how about the use of &quot;Strategic Bombing&quot; in WWII, which was specifically designed to crumble cities by terrifying their citizens into leaving. That&#x27;s not even to mention the use of nuclear weapons, which under this definition would probably make the US the worst terrorist organization in the world.<p>Perhaps an even closer corollary would be our embargo of Cuba, which effectively cut them off from having viable trading routes. We did it to destabilize their economy, so they would get rid of Communism because we don&#x27;t like Communists. How many people have died of starvation because we&#x27;re artificially dampening their economy?')
