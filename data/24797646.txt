I&#x27;m damn glad I did. It was a three bucket rinse, the first with lime juice in hot water, then hot water, then cold water. I thought it was some hippy bullshit, but I had little to loose.<p>The first bucket was just pitch black by the end of the washing. I dumped out the water straight into the toilet and soot dripped out at the end. Then I gagged when I saw probably two dozen drowned caterpillars by the end of all the washing.<p>Who knows how much ash, pollution, and insect I&#x27;ve been smoking all these years.')
