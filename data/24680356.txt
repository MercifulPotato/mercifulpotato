The State doesn&#x27;t exist separate from the Market, nor does the Market exist separate from the State. Both underpin the others existence. To see it any other way is folly, or at least the least conceivably useful way of trying to forecast probable outcomes on any scale appreciably large.<p>You see a market failure, I reject your perception of a particular vein of economic activity remaining worthwhile in perpetuity as an accurate understanding of a Market to fail, and instead accept that all economic activity is fluid and necessarily reactive to physical and political constraints.<p>Just look at Turnips or Onions to break yourself of a mistaken belief that Markets don&#x27;t inherently rely on the State to price in what&#x27;s practical; and hell, half the point of a State is to make the effective price of something so high, people don&#x27;t do it.')
