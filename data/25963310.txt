So what ashift value you want to use depends very much on what kind of tradeoffs you&#x27;re okay with in terms of different aspects of performance and write endurance&#x2F;write amplification. But for most flash-based SSDs, there&#x27;s no reason to set ashift to anything less than 12 (corresponding to 4kB blocks).')
