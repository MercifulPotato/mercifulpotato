The effect of taxation in this thinking is that it applies brakes upon the accumulation of wealth and causes existing wealth to be worth more (via deflation). This is counteracted by the inflation from created wealth via govt spending.<p>A weird alternative to taxation could be to print more and more money without taxing any of it. This would be functionally a flat tax on all existing wealth in that fiat currency via inflation.')
