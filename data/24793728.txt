Since I usually just want to make something that works reasonably well, I usually reach for MicroPython, unless I need a library that isn&#x27;t available (and I can&#x27;t write it quickly).<p>Having something higher-level but performant, like Nim (or Rust) will make my life much easier.<p>What&#x27;s also very important to me, though, is documentation&#x2F;examples, etc. I usually use the Arduino framework, so I&#x27;m not very familiar with ESP-IDF (or Nim), which makes good documentation important to me.')
