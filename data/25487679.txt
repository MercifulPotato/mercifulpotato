Whilst not hitting real-time OS levels, it would be a nice middle ground in some area&#x27;s as well.<p>Also for cores, the OS and user software don&#x27;t need the same OS when the OS is just API calls passing parameters, so would be viable to have the OS upon one core type and the user-space cores a totally different architecture.  That again would add another level of security.')
