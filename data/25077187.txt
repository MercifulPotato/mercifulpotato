I don&#x27;t care that much about cutting edge features, and I&#x27;m more interested in a mature product that I don&#x27;t have to tinker much with. My experience with Kimchi made me more cautious about taking a chance on smaller projects.<p>I keep wanting to like ESXi and not really enjoying it. I had a hard time scripting things with ESXi, and certain things seemed to require performing actions in the GUI. I can&#x27;t remember at this point where the gap was, but I wasn&#x27;t ever able to figure out how to clone a template and boot it up via CLI, whereas I found it easy to do that with Proxmox.<p>&gt;<i>How do you end up managing using the same VMs? Do you have a template and you clone the template? Or do you have a way of just running both a template VM and an application VM, and have the app VM use the template VM for most of it&#x27;s OS level needs.</i><p>Yeah, I just have one pre-configured Ubuntu 20.04 template VM, and I clone that whenever I need a new VM. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll boot up the template just to update its packages and tweak anything. I do all my VM management with Ansible, so there&#x27;s a standard set of scripts that update and configure the machine whenever I clone a new one.<p>&gt;<i>If you end up having 10 VMs, how do you properly update?</i><p>I sometimes use Ansible to update everything, but honestly I get behind on updates. I wouldn&#x27;t do that with an Internet-facing server, but none of these VMs are accessible outside my local network, so there&#x27;s not really much attack surface.')
