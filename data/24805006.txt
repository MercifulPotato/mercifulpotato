If you&#x27;ve ever played one of the many IO games, it might seem familiar to you. Basically I have used Nim to create a multiplayer game that can be played in the browser[1].<p>I&#x27;m planning to write up a more detailed post outlining the architecture of this. But suffice it to say, Stardust is written 100% in Nim. Both the servers and the client running in your browser is written in Nim. The client uses Nim&#x27;s JS backend and the server Nim&#x27;s C backend. The two share code to ensure the game simulation is the same across both. Communication happens over websockets.<p>It&#x27;s been a lot of fun working on this and I cannot imagine another language being as flexible as Nim to make something like this possible. I already have an Android client up and running too, it also is built from the same code and I plan to release it soon.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardust.dev&#x2F;play" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardust.dev&#x2F;play</a>')
