I try my best to make it simple to understand.\nBut most of the time, I get this kind of comment: &quot;That sounds great, but which kind of middleware&#x2F;broker&#x2F;framework did you use?&quot;\nI answer: none, we crafted everything from scratch.\nAnd then come the &quot;oh, no Angular then&quot;?\n&quot;Angular? What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;\nAnd then I go into autistic mode: get lost, you buzzword seeker.\nSo my piece of advice to everyone: algorithms don&#x27;t get you hired.')
