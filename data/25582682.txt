Aren&#x27;t ANN just some kind of brute forcing, just that this time brute forcing happens at training time.<p>True intelligence could reason and adapt, the AI should be able to play any chess variant I invent without new training  or if it is that smart should be able to defeat a human at any new task for both of them.<p>But yeah, many things that are not intelligent were called AI, like expert systems where the human had to define all the rules, or genetic algorithms where the hard part was made by humans by defining the encoding and the fitting functions, same for the ANN , the humans need to dot he hard part, collect good data , define the ANN parameters,  then train and evaluate the results.<p>AI is so pathetic that the big software developers could not integrate it with coding, so you could do something like &quot;Hey AI I need you to implement an integration with this API, find an SDK&#x2F;library or implement it from the documentation and when my user uploads a photo use the xxx function of this API&quot;.')
