Plenty of important measurements have been made confirming theories we see as true today (or true enough) that turn out to have been irreproducible, plagued by experimenter bias, or even outright fraudulent. But it&#x27;s a particular research programme, embedded in a social context, that generates knowledge, not a single reproducible experiment.')
