For once in my life, I saw the mate and I won.<p>The dude was FURIOUS. He immediately asked for a rematch and I said I had to go. Then the insults came (&quot;chicken shit&quot;, etc.).<p>He even messaged me a few times over the course of a few months (same kind of name calling) and challenged me a few times.<p>Eventually, I thought, &quot;You know what will really upset him? If I accept a rematch and win again.&quot;<p>So, I accepted one of his challenges and I used a computer. Obviously, he lost and he was FURIOUS again.<p>Not my proudest moment, but I enjoyed it while it was happening.<p>But yeah, regular cheating just kind of takes the joy out of the competition.')
