I was building something that was effectively a messaging app for my startup. I was doing it in Flutter so progress was good and things generally behaved pretty well. But so many little things needed to be done to get e.g. the input box to behave intuitively (e.g. hide &#x27;attach image&#x27; button when writing text). I was basically copying the standard approach from FB Messenger and WhatsApp. Apps at that level of polish have raise out expectation. That changes thing for developers - when it was &quot;just add a button&quot; everyone could pitch in, but now it can be full time work for several people.')
