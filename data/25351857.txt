Some people value those a lot, and others less so.<p>I don&#x27;t think Apple treats their customers like garbage though; quite the opposite. I&#x27;ve always had a no-bullshit customer experience - fast and easy returns &amp; replacements, generous policies &amp; even being able to return outside the window, no haggling about issues. E.g. a few months ago my iPad stopped charging, a replacement arrived 2 days later. Most tech companies are absolutely terrible at customer service like this.<p>Tech isn&#x27;t perfect and will break. And by buying Apple you DO have to go through Apple when this happens, but the actual customer experience is top notch. To characterize it as being about shiny buttons is ridiculous, it&#x27;s about buying peace of mind and having one less thing in your life be bullshit.')
