At college I learned about both digital and analog circuit design and fabrication. Had my fair share of FPGA and Assembly programming. Built some microcontrolled printed circuit boards. In summary, I believe I have a reasonable understanding of how computers work underneath, and I&#x27;m not interested in using anything other than a high level programming language for consumer application development as well ;)')
