Say there are 1000 doors, and you pick door 429. On his way to open door 429, Monty stumbles, falls, and accidentally knocks open every door except door 128. If by some coincidence all opened doors happened to contain goats, you will have nothing to gain from switching. Very counter-intuitive, but just as true as the original problem.<p>A possible intuition here is that Universes where your first pick was the door with the car, which initially were just 1 in a 1000 compared to Universes in which you picked a goat, will suddenly become massively overrepresented. After all, in these types of Universe Monty&#x27;s Fall couldn&#x27;t possibly have shown a car, whereas most of the other Universes will not survive to the next &quot;round&quot;.<p>Of course, if this happened in real life, Bayesian thinking would increase the likelihood of hypotheses such as, for example, &quot;The door containing the car has a better lock&quot; to such an extent that I would switch.')
