Item(by='reissbaker', descendants=None, kids=[25817019], score=None, time=1610922788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814532, text='It felt a bit like doublespeak when the author claimed ETH was more vulnerable to a 51% attack because it (intentionally) aims to make ASIC mining difficult — the whole point of making ASIC mining difficult is that Bitcoin is centralized and vulnerable to 51% attacks because there are very few miners (because capital expenditure to become a miner is high). If the few miners collaborate to cheat you, they can get away with it.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s not even true anymore that ETH is GPU-only; despite attempting ASIC-resistance, there are now ASIC miners for ETH too, although unlike with Bitcoin, Ethereum is still able to be mined with GPUs.<p>The complaints that ETH has little real-world utility and is mostly speculation-driven felt similarly nonsensical compared to Bitcoin. What real-world utility does Bitcoin have? The whole thing is HODL-driven speculation on an inherently-useless deflationary asset.<p>(Unlike the author, who claims to have no stake in the debate a breath before admitting he&#x27;s long BTC and doesn&#x27;t own ETH — by definition, a stake — I truly have no stake in this debate, and currently own neither BTC nor ETH.)')
