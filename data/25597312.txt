The issue here is if your parents are abusive, You&#x27;re simply screwed. I would never judge someone for having a nasty attitude towards life, towards everything if trapped in that type of situation.<p>At the same time my biggest red flag when it comes to dating is if the person has a stable living situation. If someone&#x27;s 28 and fights their parents every morning, I don&#x27;t judge them but I know their mind won&#x27;t be right for a relationship. Once upon a time, I was going through an eviction and the girl I was dating broke it off for the same exact reason. My mind wasn&#x27;t in a good place.')
