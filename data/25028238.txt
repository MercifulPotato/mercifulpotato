An artist (say lady Gaga) made a song that can be played on repeat in bars and not annoy customers, keep them entertained. Why is it implied that her music is of lower quality that niche artists?<p>&quot;other than because their music is so great.&quot; There are multiple ways to measure music. One of them is how touched you are by it, to each his own - and this is why niche artists are &quot;niche&quot; - because there are so many unique ways to make special music.<p>There is value in music that appeases to everyone equally. You will never be able to play niche music in  a bar for prolonged periods (unless it&#x27;s a special bar).<p>This is kindof like the difference between a ferrari and an F150. The truck does it all for everyone. A single ferrari is more special and more expensive than a ford, but in the end, you cannot argue that Ford the company sells more cars than Ferrari, which is why they deserve a larger stock value.')
