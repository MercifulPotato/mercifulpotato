Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606131645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185420, text='<i>If</i> the association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy is because it caused narcolepsy (as with Guillain-Barré it&#x27;s also plausible the problem is that this is an auto-immune problem and so the vaccine wasn&#x27;t actually the problem it just highlighted a problem you already had) then the incidence rate was estimated at like 18k patients per case.<p>So if you give the <i>entire</i> US population a vaccine like that, less than twenty thousand of them develop narcolepsy. As a reminder a quarter million of them already <i>died</i> from COVID-19 and more are dying every day - not to mention the tens of thousands whose cause of death isn&#x27;t listed as COVID-19 but would not be dead if not for an ongoing pandemic.<p>Cutter screwed up. No amount of prior safety testing can fix that. Their Polio vaccine had Polio virus in it (to be clear: The traditional <i>Oral</i> Polio Vaccine is supposed to have a &quot;live&quot; virus in it, but the injected vaccine Cutter were selling is not). Obviously nobody is going to test &quot;What happens if we inject children with the Polio virus&quot; because the answer is &quot;Some of them get Polio. Duh&quot; and so no test could have prevented Cutter from screwing up.<p>I have no idea what you meant by &quot;Gullah barre&quot; the Google results I get are all about Guillain-Barré syndrome, which I mentioned above. Guillain-Barré is not a vaccine, it&#x27;s a weird auto-immune disorder, and arguably even where it&#x27;s listed as very rare side effect of a vaccine, that&#x27;s misleading because it&#x27;s <i>also</i> a side effect from getting viral infection, so if you avoid vaccination but do get the virus you may get GBS as a result anyway. The human immune system is pretty inscrutable.')
