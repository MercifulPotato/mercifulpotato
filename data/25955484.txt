That would solve many problems. I would apply this rule to all large internet companies - Google&#x27;s UX and ranking, Twitter&#x27;s UX and ranking, etc. They all sin by tricking users (UX), hiding stuff (filtering) and selectively showing stuff in &quot;the one true way&quot; (ranking).<p>Why are they doing this? To milk the web for user data, ad money and extract more money from customers directly. Our eyeballs are their most prized product. But the end result is this mono-culture &#x2F; single take on UX and ranking for all.<p>Practically it would mean to force them to open up their backends to competitors, or be split into front and back, with open competition. I would also spin off the user data part of backend to allow portability of user pods.<p>There should be more rights to users on the internet. Deplatforming, manipulation and exploitation can&#x27;t continue like this.')
