We can now map x_1 to y_1 f(x_1)=y_1. And then change this same function by mapping x_1 to y_2: f(x_1)=y_2<p>They would be different functions, the first being the identity function: x =&gt; x, the second being: x =&gt; x + 1<p>&gt; Moreover, we do it constantly when we modify object fields in OOP<p>This isn&#x27;t the case.  A field with a different value in it just means the object is a different value.  If the object is passed to a static function, then the domain is the full set of possible values that the object can hold (this is known as a product-type, you multiply the total possible values of each of its component parts to find out the size of the domain).<p>If it&#x27;s passed to a method then there&#x27;s an implicit addition argument: `this`, which is the same as a static function with an additional argument that takes the object.  The function is the same.<p>Global (or even free variables) should be considered part of the domain: i.e. implicit arguments are being passed to the function.')
