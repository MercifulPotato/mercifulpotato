Just yesterday there was the article &quot;Back to the &#x27;70s with Serverless&quot; which compared smalltalk and its fast feedback loops to the complexity of cloud and serverless computing and argued it was about good marketing.<p>So I will keep commenting that it isn&#x27;t just about technical issues and it isn&#x27;t just about organizational ones, and you must look at both to really understand what is going on.<p>But I probably did get a little too excited that a technical post acknowledged and made it an important point in their article.')
