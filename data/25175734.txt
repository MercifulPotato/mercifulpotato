Item(by='linguae', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606030679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159931, text='My favorite magazine is Software Design (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gihyo.jp&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;SD" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gihyo.jp&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;SD</a>), a Japanese magazine that specializes in software engineering and IT topics.  It reminds me of Dr. Dobbs&#x27; Journal.  The articles are well-written and have code samples.  I started reading this magazine in 2010 when I was living in Japan doing an internship at a major Japanese tech company, and I always purchase a physical copy whenever I visit Japan.')
