The two biggest pros are I have an extra 90 minutes that I used to use commuting that I can now spend on myself or with my family.  Additionally I do not miss the open office at all. My home office is quiet and calm. I can focus for a lot longer than I could at the office.<p>The biggest downsides are a lack of human interaction with my coworkers. I&#x27;ve gotten used to Zoom meetings but they just aren&#x27;t the same. I also miss the organic hallway conversations. Instead of running into someone while grabbing coffee or water I now have to go out of my way to book time with people. Its totally changed how I interact with people beyond my immediate group.<p>I suspect I&#x27;ll WFH for as long as possible while going in a few times a month to socialize.')
