Firstly, there&#x27;s no waking up to find your server is unresponsive. It&#x27;s part of the deal when you sign up. Secondly, public IPs are always an option. Thirdly, the ISPs I have used have always had relevant FAQ&#x2F;help articles.<p>If any of those points do not apply to your ISP, that&#x27;s not because of CGNAT, it&#x27;s just a shit company. I&#x27;ve used four different ISPs in the past four years and getting rid of CGNAT has not been a problem once. IIRC only one of them used public addresses by default, two offered free dynamic IPs upon request and my current ISP offers paid static IPs for $3.<p>Tons of my friends and family have had CGNAT and never known. It&#x27;s just not a big deal for most content consumers.')
