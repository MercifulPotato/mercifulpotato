Item(by='TheOperator', descendants=None, kids=[25595523, 25591893], score=None, time=1609410233, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590880, text='My first mistake as a green &quot;jack of all trades&quot; admin was getting scared and feeling like I had to apply a &quot;Hardening guide&quot;.  Wasted so much time and energy because I didn&#x27;t know how to determine what was a priority, both when it came to business needs and security.  Guides like this presume you have generous amounts of time to put into a \nLinux hardening project with a questionable ROI when the person looking at it might be a solo overwhelmed admin in a security insensitive line of work.<p>Fact of the matter is that you can&#x27;t take a broad checklist approach to security because you can&#x27;t secure everything, you have to have an idea of where your biggest risks are and focus on those.  If the computers in question aren&#x27;t dealing with PII which one has some moral duty to protect, security risks can be outweighed by other business risks, and going on a security crusade can INCREASE business risk.  Sometimes things that might be security risks are mitigated by other aspects of IT security or non-IT controls making them very low priority.  Sometimes hardening certain things will have an especially adverse not worth it effect on certain users&#x2F;applications (which is why these hardening settings aren&#x27;t defaults).<p>Maybe worry about phishing attacks, that your authentication strategy makes sense, that your firewall is intact before worrying about arcane aspects of Linux Hardening.  A guide like this is fairly useless in the real world without some discussion of the risk&#x2F;benefits of hardening something and some mechanism to prioritize.  To me this guide serves as an interesting starting point to constructing a practical hardening strategy, but I would advise against following it blindly.  If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing I would trust that Linux has fairly sane defaults and focus elsewhere to start with.  Configuring your systems in non-standard ways is a Pandora&#x27;s box of headaches.')
