Financial institutions offering Internet-based products and\nservices to their customers should use effective methods to authenticate the identity of\ncustomers using those products and services. The authentication techniques employed by the\nfinancial institution should be appropriate to the risks associated with those products and\nservices. Account fraud and identity theft are frequently the result of single-factor (e.g.,\nID&#x2F;password) authentication exploitation. Where risk assessments indicate that the use of\nsingle-factor authentication is inadequate, financial institutions should implement multifactor\nauthentication, layered security, or other controls reasonably calculated to mitigate those risks.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ffiec.gov&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;authentication_guidance.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ffiec.gov&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;authentication_guidance.pdf</a>')
