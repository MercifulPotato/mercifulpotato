From what I see, it is quite universal and more common than link-based unsubscription.  Newsletter providers prefer not to use the url based unsubscription because some email providers will crawl the URLs in emails and automatically unsubscribe people without them knowing.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that you&#x27;re talking about a &#x27;link&#x27; (a href) in the email body that goes to the newsletter provider&#x27;s site and ask them a bunch of questions (why are you unsubscribing etc.).  That&#x27;s a different concept entirely.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, the email-based way is the primary unsubscription method in use today.  Even when you use the gmail feature &quot;Mark this as spam&quot;, depending on what you click, it will just send an email on your behalf to the to whatever is specified in the List-Unsubscribe: mailto: header.')
