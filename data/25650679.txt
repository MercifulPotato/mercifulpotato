(Contrast this to an employee using company resources, in secret, to commit a crime that only benefits the employee.)<p>And no consequences for the people involved means there&#x27;s no deterrence.  In the future, employees with unethical management will realize that they can do this sort of thing with little risk to their own livelihood, so why not give it a try?')
