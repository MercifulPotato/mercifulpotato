NTSC has low color resolution and much higher luma resolution.  Large shifts around the color wheel, at higher resolutions, smaller pixel sizes, generated undesirable artifacts.<p>Luma changes generally didn&#x27;t.<p>This kind of thing drove art direction toward more broad swaths of color, luma and gentle hue changes to imply texture and detail, rather than actually forcing detail.<p>Frankly, these subtle limits in display tech are all over the place.<p>4k HDMI does not have 4k pixel perfect color, or didn&#x27;t last time I looked.<p>Discussing art in these contexts makes great sense!<p>For that matter, one might also say to avoid high saturation colors...  many displays cannot even render them.  CRT displays can, plasma TV can, and some new OLED apparently can.<p>LCD, generally can&#x27;t.<p>Nature does present these colors to us, so... yeah.<p>I much prefer to talk about these things in terms of display capability, potential artifacts and such myself.  It is a far more useful discussion.')
