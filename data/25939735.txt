What I mean to convey with that comment is that clearly you believe there are acceptable uses of the word.  In other words, you don&#x27;t think that every use of the word should be prohibited.<p>Once we&#x27;ve reached that point it seems like a negotiation.  Why would it be wrong to say sometimes and not wrong other times?  My intuition here is that this is tied to whether the word is used with intent to offend or harass someone.  In your case, you weren&#x27;t using the word that way, and I would argue that the same applies largely to uses of the term on wallstreetbets.')
