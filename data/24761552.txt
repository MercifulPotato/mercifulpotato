Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[24762276], score=None, time=1602554600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755614, text='I agree wholeheartedly with this, but I think this probably only applies to people with particular mindsets, and depends on what people value.<p>If it&#x27;d be financially difficult for you to live in a city center with enough room for a guest bedroom and a garage for your car, and you really really really value living in the city center, then you&#x27;ll probably sacrifice that car and guest room.<p>But nothing beats the convenience of walking out&#x2F;down to your garage, hopping in the car, and driving off.  Being able to host friends in your home is arguably more hospitable than putting them up in a hotel (though the hotel is an awesome gesture if you don&#x27;t have the space).  Having a (fenced, perhaps) backyard means allowing appropriately-aged kids to play outside mostly unsupervised.<p>If you can afford the extra expense without reducing your quality of life in other ways, then I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it, but... it <i>is</i> expensive, though, in money and time.  I have a car, but I could probably make more than $4k&#x2F;year renting out my garage space, and the cost of insurance, registration, maintenance, and depreciation adds at least another thousand or two to that.  Given how little I drove pre-pandemic, I&#x27;m pretty sure a ZipCar membership, or using something like Turo, would be more cost-effective.  But I know people who drive a lot more than I do, and I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;d save all that much (if anything) ditching the car and switching to rentals.<p>There&#x27;s also the right-tool-for-the-job argument.  My car is fine for the city and nearby.  When I want to go to Tahoe in the winter, I rent a car with 4WD&#x2F;AWD and snow tires.  So it&#x27;s not like owning a car eliminates the need for rentals, and frankly I just don&#x27;t want a big bulky snow-weather car for city&#x2F;local driving.<p>From an environmental and community perspective, yeah, using shared things is way better.  Fewer cars produced and shared among more people is a good thing.  Higher housing density (within limits) is a good thing, and having a guest room that sits unused 95% of the time probably isn&#x27;t a great use of space.  Going to a park and interacting with your neighbors is great.  Riding public transit and reducing traffic and emissions is great.  Those things do have a cost, though, and I think Americans especially are raised to be more individually-minded than community-minded.')
