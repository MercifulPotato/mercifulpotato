Any attempt at removing more vertices would yield in having to cut more edges, so the strategy removes the least amount of edges while partitioning the graph.<p>In a tree with equally weighted edges, this problem seems easy too: just remove a leaf. Every tree has leaves.<p>I can&#x27;t think about graphs &quot;between&quot; the two creating a property that makes the the &quot;I just take the vertex with the fewest adjacencies and remove it&quot; strategy moot. Is it trivial with equally weighted edges? Is the problem only interesting when edges have differing weights?')
