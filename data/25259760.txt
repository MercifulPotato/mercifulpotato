I just unloaded a five year old MBP for a lot more than I&#x27;d ever have gotten for a five year old PC laptop.  Ordered myself a fancy new M1 laptop, and if M1X&#x2F;M2&#x2F;whatever-it-is-called is substantially better, then I&#x27;ll just trade it in on a new model.  There&#x27;s <i>always</i> a new hotness coming next year.')
