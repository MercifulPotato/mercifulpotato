I can deduct any work or business related expenses. If the expense was also for personal purposes, I can still claim the portion used for work. For example, if I buy a Macbook and use it for working 40 hours a week, and then 10 hours of personal use, I can deduct 80% of the cost from my income.<p>As I&#x27;m working from home, all my office furniture is tax deductible, as well as my power and internet bills.<p>Then because I&#x27;m a software developer, any software or hardware that I use while I&#x27;m working is also deductible; keyboards, monitors, cables, etc. I can even deduct the cost of a new backpack if I use it to carry my laptop!')
