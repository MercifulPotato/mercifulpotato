It&#x27;s a shame that it has to be done in real-time. I don&#x27;t see why (from a technical standpoint) the process couldn&#x27;t be done at a faster speed. It&#x27;s just that the hardware isn&#x27;t made for it and there&#x27;s not market. The analog-to-digital processing could be done by a faster chip or even software at this point. Something akin to the high-speed dubbing of analogue audio cassettes.<p>And it leads to that other challenge worth mentioning: Even though DV is technically a lossy format, it results in really large files.')
