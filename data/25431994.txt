I miss the nature and seasons, I remember fall being beautiful. I miss the history that could be found and the unique architecture of the old buildings you could find downtown.<p>But I would not move back, the cost of living is expensive, and the state has not been doing well financially. I think if I were to move again it would be to Washington, I love rainy weather.')
