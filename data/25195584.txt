Like you, I use vim for lighter text editing tasks and JetBrains stuff for times I need to get serious. Your comments make me think that maybe you haven&#x27;t spent enough time with vscode to appreciate it though. I think for a lot of folks its a really good middle ground and I am pretty sure MS&#x27;s long game on it is as a replacement for Visual Studio (that might be projection though. I&#x27;ve always hated that IDE...).<p>I guess I am saying that its a perfectly valid choice as a ones primary editor. I used it for a couple years and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I just happen to prefer vim + Intellij (with vim keybindings of course!!) :)')
