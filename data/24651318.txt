You may pass some responsibility for your journey (literally or metaphorically) off to something&#x2F;someone else (the decision maker), but you absolutely can still get lost.<p>For the GPS example, it&#x27;s completely possible depending on the system to drift into an area without data access or precached maps. Your device you&#x27;re reliant on could break. Addresses could be correct or mapping could be incorrect. Your device could lose power. You followed the directions from the decision and its &quot;not your fault&quot; but you are none-the-less, lost. Often in our society, when the decision maker is at fault, its those executing the decision who still takes responsibility and ultimately have to fix or deal with the decision, regardless of the quality of the decision.<p>I conclude, it&#x27;s far better to be part of the decision making process, even if you&#x27;re just executing the result. Not only do you often have more context to better inform the decision making process, as the one executing the decision, you also have some say in the direction of your future.')
