Internet trading forums like &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets receive hundreds of thousands of comments every <i>week</i> and while many of these comments revolve around popular memes and figures, other comments offer new perspectives on how to value companies that experience explosive growth or scandal.<p>While some people may consider these internet sources as amateurish, otherwise &quot;traditional&quot; investors are beginning to appreciate the unique perspectives offered by these internet communities, as noted in Bloomberg:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-02-26&#x2F;reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-02-26&#x2F;reddit-s-...</a><p>It has become clear that people are paying attention to the conversation; however, without applying some structure to the comments it can feel like a tornado of emotion, and the overall sentiment is unclear. I realized there needed to be a better way to keep track of the changes in coversation, and that&#x27;s why I decided to build marketstream.io.<p>Marketstream.io applies NLP to social media streams to categorize the all of the many ways people talk about the stocks that they are trading right now--whether people are talking about buying stock, or making bets with option plays. On top of the NLP platform is a responsive user interface that allows you to spot the trends that are happening in different areas of the market, and watch as trends change in real-time in reaction to today&#x27;s turbulent news cycle.<p>Marketstream.io was released in early November of 2020 and is still in alpha, but I am already enjoying the bird&#x27;s eye view it offers. I am now focused on getting feeback from users and adding more features that can help people make better decisions about how they&#x27;d like to trade.')
