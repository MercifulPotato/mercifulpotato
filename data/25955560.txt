The order has to get best execution (there are legal requirements on it).<p>Without knowing the internal details of RH all of this is speculation. I think that what folk are saying is that Citadel pay for the information on order flow (they don&#x27;t provide any liquidity?). it sounds like that pays RH bills who have to pay execution and exchange fees. If that&#x27;s true then isn&#x27;t the choice to pay the information cost to Citadel or pay some fees to another broker?<p>I suspect that your casino analogy would be more accurate if the gambler was borrowing money from another casino (i.e. leverage or buying options) and they said &#x27;You&#x27;ve hit your limits in borrowing&#x27; or the main casino you&#x27;re in said &#x27;We don&#x27;t take bets higher than X&#x27;.')
