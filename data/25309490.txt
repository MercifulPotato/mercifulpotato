This really is a concept that you need to keep in mind when you write your code &quot;testability&quot;. And i find that when you get this you also get a Buch of other properties for &quot;free&quot;. Orthogonality and reusability for example. And really it&#x27;s a force multiplier and kicks productivity into high gear when you know that your lower level components work as expected and you don&#x27;t have to go ok a wilf goose hunt when something would be constantly broken. To summarize I find that writing tests early on reduce product velocity but the compound effect of good quality and regression prevention give you higher velocity later on.')
