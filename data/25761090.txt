Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610540255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760830, text='&gt; Because calling for violence, or at least encouraging protests that often end in violence is something that the American left has been doing since June.<p>Accounts that were calling for violence were closed regularly, especially during protests. Both twitter and on youtube. I am not aware of left wing equivalent of Parler that would emerge as results, the mainstream left seemed to be ok with those missing, through some grumbled a bit and called it unfair.<p>Note that encouraging protests was not censored, but the fact is it is not censored for right wing either.')
