For 2019, GM had R&amp;D costs of $6.8B. They sold 2,887,888 cars in the US and 7,710,000 worldwide. Per car, that would be either $2,355 or $882 depending on whether the R&amp;D number is a worldwide roll up (I&#x27;d think yes?).<p>Either way, adding the $6.8B to their gross margin number for 2019 would have increased automotive gross margins from about 10% to about 15%. Tesla&#x27;s 2019 automotive gross margin was 21%. MRQ was 24%.')
