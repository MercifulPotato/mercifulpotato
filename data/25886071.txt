And the latter failed anyway, which is why I was looking to glue it back on.<p>I was also suspicious of the special rearview mirror glue being special. For example, I have a VHS head cleaner tape that comes with magic head cleaner fluid, refills cost $$$$. One sniff told me what it was - alcohol. I use alcohol with it, and it works just great.<p>I also remember years ago you could buy special vinyl record cleaning fluid for $$$$. It&#x27;s just vinyl. I use liquid dish detergent, which does a superb job. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the vinyl one bit, and all the grease, dirt, hair, and who-knows-what-that-is is all gone. (I buy old records at the thrift store because I like the easy listening style from the 60s and 70s.)')
