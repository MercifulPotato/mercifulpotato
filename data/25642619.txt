He does not try to go the route of having an expert personally review every category (which is a great, high credibility approach). Instead he seems to just do the math finding the best rated items&#x2F;average price. I find this more useful than another inferior wirecutter clone because it adds a data point.<p>It&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ll keep in my toolbox.')
