With it you get access to a lot of open source packages and tools out of the box (simulation via Gazebo, native process communication using pub&#x2F;subs, autonomous navigation, joint transformation, etc.). There is a lot of dependence handling to make a robot work (component drivers, real time comm, planners, SLAM, the list goes on), if you are able to abstract something of the pipeline, it&#x27;s worth it.<p>The whole thing might not seem very concise, but looking back, it was released aiming to facilitate research development, all these packages are maintained indepently. ROS2 is an attempt to tackle some architecture and scope issues brought up by the industry.')
