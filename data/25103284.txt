I think it is the right thing to do to at least acknowledge it and say &quot;Thank you for your contribution! I will review it when I have time&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with you or others on ignoring low-quality, low-effort contributions. I get that people have finite energy and time. Taking 5 seconds to say &quot;thank you&quot; when someone has clearly put in the effort, though, is a no-brainer.')
