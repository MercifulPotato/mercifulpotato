Item(by='est31', descendants=None, kids=[25205575], score=None, time=1606268104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204124, text='Starlink has a constant density they can&#x27;t vary, so likely they&#x27;ll have lots of unused capacity in the rural areas while having lots of used capacity in the urban areas. Thus, they&#x27;ll likely want to increase the price in urban areas to reduce the number of customers while keeping it cheap in rural areas. Otherwise they have to come up with some other system that keeps customer usage low.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll offer &quot;mobile internet&quot; at a price point somewhere between rural and urban pricing that you can e.g. use in your car. Maybe folks will then hack their parked car and use it as a home uplink, while driving around to keep the &quot;mobile&quot; pricing level.<p>As for the price in the urban area where density is too big for them to serve everyone, likely it&#x27;ll be modelled after the price the incumbent ISP has, and be a bit cheaper, but not too cheap as they can&#x27;t serve everyone in that area. TLDR: nothing much will change.<p>So in urban areas they likely won&#x27;t cause any change, but in lightly populated places there will be a big revolution, and people there will be very happy :). At least if Starlink choses to make internet cheap. Maybe they don&#x27;t want to, and instead want to orient themselves after the local ISP, being significantly cheaper so that almost everyone switches to them, but not being as cheap as they can be. Entirely possible, brings them more money, but is obviously not very nice for customers :).<p>We&#x27;ll see a <i>real</i> revolution when we have multiple competing companies in space that try to outbid each other in a fight for market share.')
