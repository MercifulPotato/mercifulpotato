It&#x27;s dramatically faster to write than Python, Go or Rust, largely because it&#x27;s got more convenient Unix interop than anything since Perl.<p>One example is, I&#x27;ve written a script that I can pass a domain name and an email address to. It will then set up basic nginx blocks, install certbo and add a cron job if needed, run certbot, get an https certificate and reconfigure the nginx blocks to reverse proxy incoming requests and force https.<p>I have no idea what language would have let me write this faster than Ruby did. Maybe Perl if I knew it well. Definitely not Go or Rust.')
