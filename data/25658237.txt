The issue tracker had a multi-year-old bug report about it, but the developers insisted that the driver was bad despite the OpenGL specifications stating quite clearly that one cannot assume a buffer hasn&#x27;t been modified when using SwapBuffers and must clear it.<p>So it really comes as no surprise to me that there are actually many DOSBox forks.')
