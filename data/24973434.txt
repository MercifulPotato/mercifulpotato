According to the article:<p>* Streamline the environmental and approval processes.<p>* Establish an equitable risk sharing mechanism between the owner and contractor and properly implement it.<p>* Establish unified contractual terms and conditions for underground work similar to the FIDIC Emerald Book.<p>* Be fair and equitable in dealing with changes, disputes and claims.<p>* Reevaluate the need of all soft costs: Owner, PM&#x2F;CM, EIS&#x2F;EA, Engineering, etc., lower bonding limits, less litigation, lower insurance cost, etc.<p>* Revisit labor laws, rates, and union regulations and establish equitable Project Labor Agreements.<p>* Pay for public amenities and community and stakeholders’ provisions through other funds rather than transit funds. There is no doubt that community improvements and services are needed, but infrastructure projects should not be the vehicles to fund such services or improvements.<p>* Transportation Alternative Program is essential for sustainability and environmental benefits, but their costs should not be funded through transit project costs.<p>* Better management of stakeholders’ approvals, public expectation, ROWs, and utilities owners.<p>* Remove politics from infrastructure projects.<p>Where have I heard these before?')
