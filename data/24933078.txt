Most of the time you just end up moving all the schema checking and integrity checking (foreign key enforcement) to the application level and then you&#x27;re squarely worse off.<p>Plus MongoDB, which is the poster child of the revolution, has been a technical pile of shit for a decade. It&#x27;s slower than JSONB on Postgres, and loses data in the default configuration, was insecure in the default configuration, failed Aphyr&#x27;s Jepsen distributed system consistency tests every time - in other words promised things about consistency that were lies in their documentation.<p>They have improved a lot, but I feel so sorry for people who jumped on that bandwagon early.<p>My interest lies in databases and database internals, and I spent 8 years building databases in my spare time. I always advise everyone that they should use a relational database unless they are very, very sure their requirements don&#x27;t require it and won&#x27;t ever require it. It&#x27;s much easier to start with Postgres and switch to NoSQL later if you really need to go that way than to do it the other way around. Most times you find you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to switch to NoSQL. The imagined hordes of users never materialized to overwhelm your trusty relational database.')
