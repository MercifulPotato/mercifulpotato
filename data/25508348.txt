Typically to avoid that sort of confusion the &quot;chapeau&quot; would say something like &quot;it shall be unlawful for a person to do one or more of the following&quot; or &quot;it shall be unlawful for a person to do (all of) the following&quot;.<p>You can see an example of drafting for (1 and 2) or 3 in paragraph 4 of the definitions section to give you a better idea of how the language and structure would differ in this section if it were intended to be read as (1 and 2) or (1 and 3).')
