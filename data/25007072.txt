Aligning with the Nazi&#x27;s was a matter of realpolitik.<p>And I agree that their involvement in the Siege of Leningrad amounted to a blocking force, but mother of god, that blocking force contributed to an absolutely horrific existence for the civilians inside the city.<p>One could maybe argue that if the Finns didn&#x27;t help the Nazi&#x27;s the Nazi&#x27;s would have been enable to lay siege to Leningrad anyways, but the Finns are definitely tainted by their involvement.')
