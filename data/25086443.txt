At a high level, the virtual DOM exists to arbitrate the non-simultaneity of updates to all of these moving parts.  It lets react model its system as a &quot;single source of truth&quot; with a functional &quot;prop-drilling system&quot;.  It gives react components gravity to a data source it can consider authoritative (separate from the actual DOM which attracts the browser&#x27;s own sets of sub-applications) which is also separate from the applications sitting on top of your data in the server, etc. etc. etc.')
