It didn&#x27;t matter that quad-copter enthusiasts kept trying to educate the public that DJI toys should not be called &quot;drones&quot;.  That battle has been lost and the the term &quot;drone&quot; has won over alternatives such as &quot;remote quadcopter&quot; or &quot;UAV&quot;.  It&#x27;s like shouting into a hurricane.<p>Even very well-educated people mis-use terms.  Alex Stepanov inadvertently misused &quot;vector&quot; when creating STL.  C++ std::vector should have been called &quot;vararray&quot; and std::array should have been called &quot;vector&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;581426&#x2F;why-is-a-c-vector-called-a-vector#:~:text=It&#x27;s%20called%20a%20vector%20because,fixed%2Dlength%20sequence%20of%20numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;581426&#x2F;why-is-a-c-vector...</a>.')
