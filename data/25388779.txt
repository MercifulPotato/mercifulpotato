Capitalism isn&#x27;t the problem, lack of boundaries is.<p>My best friend lived upstairs from her parents for years. It was her own apartment but the arrangement was hell on earth. Multiple times a day every day her mom would come barging in (and I do mean barging) to insert herself into whatever was going on in my friend&#x27;s apartment, make nasty comments, or borrow&#x2F;take something. Her mom eventually just stopped buying her own stuff because she just would take whatever my friend had if she needed it, plus it gave her more reason to bother my friend more often, which seemed to be her favorite activity in the world. Her mom even stopped driving her own car and just took my friend&#x27;s whenever she wanted to go somewhere. The constant stress of the situation was so bad for my friend, it legitimately was ruining her health.')
