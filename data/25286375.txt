If you try to write code that burns bandwidth or CPU cycles without even attempting to optimize it, it&#x27;s gonna cost you an eye at the end of the year.<p>Software optimized for the slowest hardware possible actually <i>does</i> saves money, which helps also to reach the goal of doing more money, since more hardware is being supported, not only the cutting-edge one.<p>I&#x27;ve seeing now this infamous trend also on Android Phones boosting 90-120 Hz screens. If applications get optimized to run on these phones, whose CPU is also strong, obviously older phones are suffering and become sluggish.<p>Seriously, try to write code as your target platform is a Raspberry Pi 1 model. If works on it fast, it&#x27;s going to be fast everywhere')
