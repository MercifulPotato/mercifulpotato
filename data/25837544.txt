FB is huge, so they have a lot to lose in that scenario.<p>2) They <i>literally</i> profit from the circulation of the very stuff that some would have them sensor.<p>I don&#x27;t see what is even slightly surprising about they way they&#x27;ve handled this.<p>Edit: side note - I personally think #1 is likely at some point in the future. People have already gone a fair way towards segregating themselves into various social&#x2F;political bubbles; why not even more self-segregation? If enough people want that, then either FB will enable it or a competitor will emerge to enable it.')
