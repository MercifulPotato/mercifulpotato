Introduce him to one of many free online UI&#x2F;UX courses and figure out if he&#x27;s actually into it. If he isn&#x27;t, try some other tech thing.<p>2. Once you&#x27;ve figured out what he&#x27;s into, make him do one or two online courses in it, preferable from a good university (see: edx.org).<p>3. Work on a portfolio.
