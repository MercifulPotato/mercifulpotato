Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25785920, 25786757], score=None, time=1610674561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25785767, text='I don&#x27;t think that argument applies here because HN is not a general-purpose discussion site. It has a specific mandate which explicitly doesn&#x27;t cover everything [1], and that&#x27;s the most important fact about it. Plenty of things are off-topic here, and that&#x27;s not &quot;robbing the human race&quot; any more than, say, not letting people walk their dogs in the library.<p>To argue otherwise is basically to say that all sites have to be the same. That can&#x27;t be right. I think there&#x27;s a place for a website (at least one?) dedicated to intellectual curiosity. We can&#x27;t have both that and uninhibited political battle, so if HN is to exist at all, it needs a moderation strategy similar to the one I&#x27;ve outlined at the links above.<p>If anybody has a better idea, I&#x27;d love to know what it is, but please make sure you&#x27;ve familiarized yourself with those past explanations first. If it&#x27;s something simple like &quot;just ban politics&quot; or &quot;just allow everything&quot;, I&#x27;ve already explained many times why it won&#x27;t work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
