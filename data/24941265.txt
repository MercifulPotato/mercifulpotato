Why would I want to solve puzzles with known answers that thousands of people have already solved? The puzzles may look cool or have interesting mechanics, but the answers are already set in stone. Nothing novel or emergent can happen. I already solve problems all day long for work. I don&#x27;t want to solve arbitrary ones in my free time. Just my personal mindset. I do enjoy most other types of games.')
