But overall it&#x27;s true that the age of the average covid death is as high, or in some countries even higher than the average lifespan, meaning it&#x27;s likely the person would have died of some other cause.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that not comparing deaths, but comparing &#x27;number of high quality life years&#x27; lost or something similar would make more sense, even if it is somewhat more abstract.')
