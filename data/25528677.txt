I can&#x27;t read very well, and if I had to play Bach correctly (or, I&#x27;d really struggle even reading student etudes), but when I&#x27;ve played in big bands I&#x27;ve gotten by okay.<p>It&#x27;s possible to learn the way I did, which was to first learn guitar and bass, and get an idea of how chord progressions work...<p>At that point, you can approach the piano like guitar, and play a bass line with your left hand and whatever chords you want on the right, and slowly move into reading and playing melodies from fakebooks.<p>That isn&#x27;t, I think, a very hard approach to the instrument, and it gives you a lot of latitude on what you get from it.  The first song I played on piano was Grateful Dead&#x27;s tune Ripple... it&#x27;s 3 chords and I just alternated the bass notes and sang the melody.<p>You&#x27;re not going to find a method book that does that, because there&#x27;s not a lot of method to it.')
