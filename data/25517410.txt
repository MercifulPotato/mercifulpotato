And there&#x27;s no easy way to validate the price is &quot;fair,&quot; since share prices are so fluid.<p>It&#x27;s also a fairly victimless crime, as the article notes (although it downplays this); in practice, it seems users typically saved more money thanks to Robinhood&#x27;s zero-fee trading than they lost in less optimal pricing for their trades. The problem here wasn&#x27;t that payment-for-order-flow is bad — even Schwab does it for their zero-fee trading platform, and in practice it&#x27;s often a good tradeoff — the problem is Robinhood lied about it.')
