Item(by='ericbarrett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606589530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236103, text='We bought a chest freezer and started canning stuff because, seeing the general disregard for masks and germ-courtesy among Americans, we&#x27;ve limited our grocery store trips even more and buy in bulk.  This means we inevitably end up with some extra fruit, juice, stock, etc. that&#x27;s too old to comfortably eat unprocessed but not old enough to be spoiled.  Maybe it&#x27;s not necessary for survival now, but I find it difficult to throw away good food anymore without thoughts of how much regret I&#x27;d feel in the future if the worst happened and we ran out.<p>The real shortage is the canning lids, since you can reuse the jars with sterilization but the lids must be replaced.')
