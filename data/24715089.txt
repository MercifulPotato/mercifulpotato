You and most unionists here have a view of a utopian union that is above criticism and does not need examination.<p>Which supports my view that this is about feelings and not  about the problems people proclaim to want to solve.<p>What problem of unorganized workers? Healthcare? Retraining? Okay lets campaign for healthcare and lower college fees. Lets pick up the debt jubilee ticket some economists are calling for. Lets make government pay for code bootcamps and have corporations underwrite months of health insurance out of work.<p>No none of that will work because it does not give totalitarian control of workers to unions. Nor will it allay feelings of jealousy.')
