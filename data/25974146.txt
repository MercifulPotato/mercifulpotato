XML in general seems to want to simplify something by making it more complex in other areas. IMHO the frontend should have adopted game development techniques&#x2F;styles to address all architectural concerns. React&#x2F;Redux does approach this slightly, by consolidating the update loop, and keeping track of what needs to render. It would be cool to see a new paradigm of frontend apps that stems from graphics rendering (i.e. Vulkan) such that there is a simple markup language on top of that for building dynamic websites. Performance we would be awesome, and networking would be easily handled as there would be something akin to game state moving forward, with players being the logged in users. Of course this would require new kinds of browsers built from the ground up, plus new scripting languages.')
