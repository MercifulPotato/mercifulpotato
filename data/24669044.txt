Even when that information just doesn&#x27;t exist in the perfect a priori knowledge<p>Obviously the <i>special molecule</i> is a thought experiment to illustrate an idea under certain simplifying assumptions and extreme parameters, to understand the consequences.  Nobody expects to make one.<p>And you are doing a proper job of arguing why it cannot work, as you are supposed to with a thought experiment.<p>But... it&#x27;s not correct to reason that &quot;it can&#x27;t predict&quot; when the &quot;information just doesn&#x27;t exist [...] a priori&quot;.<p>If the <i>special molecule</i> senses, computes and reacts entirely in the quantum realm itself, then its processing will be entangled with those other molecules.<p>Despite the absence of a priori final states, the <i>special molecule</i> is, in principle, able to select an <i>entangled reaction</i> to those final states anyway.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know if particle X will move to A or B later (and particle X hasn&#x27;t decided either), but I can prepare myself into a state where <i>if</i> X moves to A then I will already be at A&#x27;, and <i>if</i> X moves to B then I will already be at B&#x27;&quot;.<p>And if being at A&#x27; when X moves to A, or B&#x27; when X moves to B, means that X can&#x27;t actually move to A or B, that entangled reaction will affect X so the question of A or B doesn&#x27;t even arise in the first place.')
