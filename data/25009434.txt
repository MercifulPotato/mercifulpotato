Item(by='exmadscientist', descendants=None, kids=[25009712], score=None, time=1604684383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009042, text='Yes, this is Charlie&#x27;s house style and has been for ages. He&#x27;s always hyperbolic and his tone always favors some companies over others. Everything&#x27;s either the best or the worst (usually the worst), and so on. It&#x27;s pretty much exactly like reading a tabloid.<p>The counterbalance is that he&#x27;s got one of the absolute best networks of moles in Silicon Valley and always seems to know things, often big things, before anyone else. Sometimes even before it&#x27;s on anyone else&#x27;s radar.<p>So if you&#x27;re familiar enough with him to back out his style to see the underlying (likely) facts, which isn&#x27;t too hard, you can learn a <i>lot</i> about the big chip industry. And that&#x27;s not just interesting to people like us, but very very valuable to a lot of people.<p>(Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t read SemiAccurate much since he paywalled it ~10 years ago, a move that I don&#x27;t like at all but completely understand from the perspective of his business.)')
