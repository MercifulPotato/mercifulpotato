There&#x27;s a really cool demo at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distill.pub&#x2F;2020&#x2F;growing-ca&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distill.pub&#x2F;2020&#x2F;growing-ca&#x2F;</a> where it will grow a gecko and you can blast parts of it and it will grow back. It&#x27;s fairly resilient to single blasts just about anywhere, tail, head, body and seems to be ok with two blasts in succession but you get a little more aggressive with the damage and you reach a point where it can&#x27;t recover and if you get it just right it withers away and dies.<p>I feel like societies are like this. They&#x27;re resilient. They can take damage to even seemingly vital places and recover but given enough blows to just the right places and they will die.')
