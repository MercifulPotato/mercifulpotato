They were just talking amongst themselves, showing each other what they wanted to hear, and validating their own beliefs in a downwards spiral towards eventual extremism. This is enabled by the internet more than any specific social network. It&#x27;s like sending someone to prison and expecting them to turn into a law abiding citizen: hard when all your peers are also criminals. Now the internet has essentially allowed such criminals to gather virtually and fester in their toxic ideas much in the same way a high school outcast may find they aren&#x27;t alone when they get out of high school.<p>One of the logical fallacies from pro-free-speech defenders of these people is the assumption that these ideas were organically developed. But I can assure you there is propaganda and foreign and domestic special interests that are intentionally shaping the thoughts and ideas from these people. I know in the Chinese community that interests like Falun Gong (an organization that believes extra-terrestrial Aliens are manipulating humans to intermix racially in order to subjugate us as well as other less-than-progressive beliefs like homophobia) have been heavily pro-Trump because of his anti-China policies, and they&#x27;ve been putting out a lot of toxic content aimed at Chinese-Americans [1] [2]. This is a disinformation war and taking actions like this is a part of war, otherwise services like Twitter are just complicit in aiding misinformation campaigns by one side.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;trump-qanon-stop-the-steal-japan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;trump-qanon-...</a> - Falun Gong organized &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; protests in Taiwan<p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asahi.com&#x2F;ajw&#x2F;articles&#x2F;14013938" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asahi.com&#x2F;ajw&#x2F;articles&#x2F;14013938</a> - Same Falun Gong protests in Japan')
