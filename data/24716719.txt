But swift just doesn&#x27;t feel mature enough for barely anything outside of iOS&#x2F;macOS. I had a great time using it for that purpose. The community outside of that ecosystem is barely there.<p>I&#x27;ve picked rust instead, it feels like the exact opposite of the single large actor supporting swift, instead it&#x27;s a huge community effort with lots of use cases already being seen in many spaces. AND rust just got AVR support which I suppose swift could get pretty quickly with llvm as well')
