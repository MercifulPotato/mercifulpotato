Sales success funds the pool for our team, and the pool is distributed among the team based on performance.<p>We have a breakdown of how management intends to quantify performance, by categorizing different performance measures and giving them different weights (ex: sales impact is 40%, leadership is 20%, etc.)<p>This system makes a trade-off- it isn&#x27;t as objective as a percentage commission structure, but it does allow opportunity to be rewarded for work on re-usable assets, troubleshooting with your peers, and spending time on knowledge acquisition&#x2F;sharing.<p>I&#x27;m really interested in how this looks at other companies')
