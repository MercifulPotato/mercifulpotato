It was the number 1 place I went to every time when I back from school (that every half month).<p>For Americans, if you visit NASA.gov in around 2005 (I maybe misremembered the exact time), their intro page was a Flash animation featuring rocket launch and other stuff. And that animation was really cool and moving.<p>All of that is no more in today&#x27;s web. Today&#x27;s web only gives you few pictures or maybe a video in the background, and a big highlighted &quot;Sign Up&quot;||&quot;Get Started&quot; button. They are less and less &quot;Look me, I&#x27;m so cool&quot;, and the resonance is mostly gone.<p>It&#x27;s sad that Adobe was unable to address the security and stability issue in the Flash Player. Bye Flash, it was really fun.')
