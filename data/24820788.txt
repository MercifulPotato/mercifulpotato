I had one of their mid-range ball uprights, my mother in law has a handheld one. They&#x27;re not lightweight, but not built solidly. They lose suction over time and need taking apart beyond what the manufacturer intended to clean them properly to attempt to restore their original power, worrying me every time that their various tiny crappy plastic clips will snap off and render the whole device useless. I got fed up of mine and bought a Miele, and it is better in absolutely every way.')
