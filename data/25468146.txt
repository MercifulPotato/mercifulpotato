To this day (though I haven&#x27;t kept up as much in recent years), it&#x27;s far and away the most powerful CI system I&#x27;ve ever used. Rock solid stability, to boot. And it&#x27;s only become better and better over the years.<p>Does that mean it&#x27;s right for every job? Not at all. Sometimes you just need simple and accessible. Things like CircleCI or Travis or Heroku&#x27;s CI. But not Jenkins. I put Jenkins into the same category as TeamCity, and it falls far short.<p>If you&#x27;ve outgrown some of the other options and need really powerful CI, I can&#x27;t recommend TeamCity enough.')
