You couldn&#x27;t say this stuff in real life on a street corner, why should it be protected online?<p>Because the platform was not 100% about violence.<p>Do you think it would be impossible to find threats of violence on twitter? How many twitter accounts say &quot;kill trump&quot; as their name? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kill_trump_rn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kill_trump_rn</a><p>Finding examples of threats of violence is not difficult regardless of platform.<p>If deplatforming only requires finding say 100 cases of inciting violence. Which is all Amazon ever found. Then to silence your political opponents requires nothing more than getting on their platform together to threaten violence. Your political opponents become silenced and must find a new platform. Rinse repeat.')
