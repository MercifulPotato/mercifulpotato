I&#x27;d love to see this broken down further, all the way down to the municipal level in the US.<p>My last governmental interactions were at the county and municipal level, involving permits and reporting a car accident, respectively. In both cases, the officials I interacted with were polite and professional. I&#x27;d be rather curious to know whether the bad interactions with other cities &amp; counties in this state I&#x27;ve had were because of a systemic dickishness or apathy, or I just had the bad luck to get someone having a bad day.')
