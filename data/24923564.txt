But still, some problems that affect games to have to be solved in the X11&#x2F;Wayland level. Some are solved by the graphics companies (Intel, AMD, etc), some others are either left or picked by companies with a different kind of interest in the graphics world, like Valve.<p>If only we had more real world money-making products actually relying on the desktop graphics stack to make money, then we&#x27;d have a better graphics situation.')
