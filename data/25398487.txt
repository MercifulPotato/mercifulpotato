Android is the other 50%, 7% of Android global, 5% of the global market. So Apple is 3 times more reliant on US market than Android.<p>3 - Apple makes 41% of their revenues in USA<p><i>International sales accounted for 59 percent of the quarter&#x27;s revenue.Oct 29, 2020</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-reports-fourth-...</a><p>So more or less we can say that every iPhone sold in USA is worth 3 times an iPhone sold internationally, out of $100 of revenue 1 iPhone in USA is worth $41 one sold internationally is worth 59&#x2F;4=~$14.5.<p>That&#x27;s not in absolute numbers, there are other factors contributing to Apple revenues but it&#x27;s a good proxy. An iPhone sold in USA generates more revenues overall, being it Apple Store, accessories, laptops, cloud services, music, ...<p>Android market is harder to analyse being more fragmented, but there are a few key points that can be extracted.<p>Only 7% of the global Android market is in USA.<p>Google doesn&#x27;t make much money from Android, Apple is absolute king of profits here, they are able to extract much more.<p>Largest Android manufacturers are not in USA and that&#x27;s a reason why in Asia people are switching to locally manufactured devices that can rival with iPhones in term of perceived usefulness at half the price.<p>Apple has a minimal penetration in emerging markets, like for example Africa.<p>We can conclude that  what Apple does is still much more relevant in USA and USA is much more relevant for Apple than any other smartphone manufacturer.<p>Ask yourself this question: what would have happened to the market if the M1 was made by Microsoft or Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;Lenovo?<p>How many more companies would have considered it if it could run Windows out of the box.<p>That&#x27;s how relevant Apple is in the global market, it&#x27;s king of profits, it&#x27;s king of market capitalisation, it makes very good high end devices but as far as the general population is concerned, the M1 won&#x27;t change much outside of the US.')
