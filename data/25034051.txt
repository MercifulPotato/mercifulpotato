I believe Pfizer are working on a special transport box that can, unpowered, stay at the right temperature for a week as long as the box is only opened for something like 1 minute a day.<p>That&#x27;s a good thing, but with a capacity of I believe 10k vaccine doses, anywhere with fewer than 10k people to vaccinate, or anywhere that can&#x27;t keep the demand level for the vaccine at the right level each hour&#x2F;day as they progress through their vaccine stock, will have a hard time. This is going to disproportionately affect small communities and developing countries.<p>We&#x27;ve got hard logistical challenges ahead regardless of these details, but they make this even harder. Given this it&#x27;s probably important that we continue to develop more vaccines and diversify our strategy for immunity.')
