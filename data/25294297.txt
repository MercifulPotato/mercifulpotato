They switched to using Zithromax -- which stays in the system about two weeks -- and sitting them down and giving them the entire dose in sitting while a nurse watched them swallow it. Their cure rate skyrocketed and incidence of STDs plummeted.<p>Similarly, some study found that treating kids in school in less developed countries for common parasitic infections was the best way to improve school performance for students. Surprisingly, with treating all the children at the local school, they saw knock-on effects in the entire neighborhood served by the school. Not only did school attendance improve, so did work attendance for adults in the neighborhood.<p>If you can improve compliance for even half the women, you can begin to contain what is an epidemic in some African countries. Some African countries have very high rates of HIV positive people.<p>This has really huge societal implications where you see high numbers of orphans because both parents have died and children born HIV positive because their mother had it. It is tearing apart the fabric of society.<p>So this may be a much more significant innovation for some parts of Africa than most people hanging on Hacker News would ever guess. HIV is crippling some parts of Africa and adding something that is more convenient and effective to the tool bag for addressing the problem could be a major watershed moment for fairly large swaths of the African continent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avert.org&#x2F;professionals&#x2F;hiv-around-world&#x2F;sub-saharan-africa&#x2F;overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avert.org&#x2F;professionals&#x2F;hiv-around-world&#x2F;sub-sah...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4893541&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4893541&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csis.org&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;worlds-largest-hiv-epidemic-crisis-hiv-south-africa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csis.org&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;worlds-largest-hiv-epidemic-cr...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unaids.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;resources&#x2F;fact-sheet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unaids.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;resources&#x2F;fact-sheet</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugs.com&#x2F;medical-answers&#x2F;how-long-does-zithromax-stay-in-your-system-138738&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugs.com&#x2F;medical-answers&#x2F;how-long-does-zithroma...</a>')
