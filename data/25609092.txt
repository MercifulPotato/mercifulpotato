There is obviously a large universe of software out there so broadly speaking a lot of innovation has happened since and continues.<p>However, there is a general crappiness around software innovation (or the lack thereof) these days that hides behind &quot;sexy&quot; CLI tools with a few &quot;sexy&quot; options. Some of these tools are very popular and can be difficult to assail but the smell of mediocrity (or lack of ambition) around them is hard to shake off.<p>A comment left on the post does in fact hit on one of the reasons: the lack of interest in creating user empowerment technology. The obsession with CLI tools for instance is framed as simply facilitating better integration, while this is true, it is also a convenient excuse to avoid the difficult task of building user interfacing software.')
