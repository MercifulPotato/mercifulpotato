Obviously &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot; isn&#x27;t an appealing idea to anywhere near 100% of Republican voters, and I would wager it&#x27;s appealing to just about 0% of non-Republican voters.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing is that the amount of yelling is roughly equally balanced, but you can&#x27;t extrapolate from that to what all people actually believe. Obviously you won&#x27;t find common ground for every single person, but there is common ground for 80-90% of them.<p>A few more bits of information:<p>- There&#x27;s Mike Pence himself, the actual vice president of the United States, and his unwillingness to go along with the worldviews of those who have by now concluded he needs to be hanged.<p>- Mitt Romney, the actual Republican presidential candidate in 2012 (who won 47% of the popular vote), has been pretty strongly opposed to the idea that Trump secretly won &#x2F; would have won, to the coup, etc. Previously he marched in Black Lives Matter protests and voted to convict the President in the impeachment trial last year. (Romney also created Romneycare, the model for Obamacare, even though if you listen to how loudly people yell, it seems like half the country opposes it.)<p>- Georgia elected two Democratic Senators. More generally, the Voting Rights Act was gutted in 2013 and several states are actively engaged in gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts. The fact that you see Republicans roughly tied with Democrats doesn&#x27;t indicate that Republican policies are equally popular.<p>And, again, the &quot;side&quot; that advocates for &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot; is hardly the totality of the Republican Party.<p>So what can be done?<p>I think the highest-impact thing is to help out efforts to re-enfranchise Americans and end gerrymandering. The work coordinated by Stacey Abrams in Georgia is a good place to start, for instance. <i>Regardless of what party or policies you support</i>, if you believe in democracy, getting elections to be more representative can only be a good thing. And in particular, if you&#x27;re right-leaning but worry that the Republican Party is going too far, making it so that the party has to compete by convincing centrists instead of being able to rely on extremists will be good for the party.')
