But that doesn&#x27;t get over the law of diminishing returns. It might not be 4K that, but would you buy 8K or 16K because &quot;it&#x27;s the monitor I&#x27;m looking at&quot;, when the only thing it does is waste CPU&#x2F;GPU, resources, and battery -- for angular resolution lost to the human eye anyway?')
