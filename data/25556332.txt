I can see how such articles will be generated by GPT with a prompt like &quot;voyager crossed the heliosphere boundary and found weirdly turbulent space there&quot;. I feel like that most journalists are glorified GPT models: they expand a short prompt into a word salad so the news agency could stuff it with ads.<p>The really interesting question is &quot;what is [solar] magnetism?&quot; Wikipedia gives a thought terminating answer: magnetism is a vector field, as if vector field a real thing that can press back the sea of turbulence like the sun does.')
