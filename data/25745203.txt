Item(by='maeln', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610449378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745096, text='&gt; One, the part that says you don&#x27;t always get the 30 days.\n&gt; Two, the part that says contract disputes are resolved via arbitration, not litigation.<p>And honestly, this type of terms in a contract shouldn&#x27;t be legal. Has far as i know, the second part is not even legal in most country outside of the US.\nI don&#x27;t really care for Parler but having big company abusing their position to have terms heavily in disadvantage of their client shouldn&#x27;t be something we support. Because I guess most cloud-provider have the same type of clause.<p>Arbitration over litigation should be just plainly illegal.')
