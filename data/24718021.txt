Is this really worth a post on HN and more than a hundred comments? Personally, I can&#x27;t understand the statements of the person concerned; what bothers me more are those posts that don&#x27;t contribute anything relevant to technological development. Basically, I find HN very helpful and both a good source of information and inspiration. The discussions are also generally quite good. And we should be able to trust adults to have a little bit of a culture of debate.')
