Or do you mean rightwing? (curious, I assume the former...)<p>In either case pretty much all humans are profoundly small-c conservative, &quot;big change projects&quot; on society-scale do often end in war&#x2F;death&#x2F;etc. At least, it&#x27;s probably 50&#x2F;50 whether its a &quot;National Health Service&quot; or a &quot;World War&quot;.<p>However the reason is deeper than that: evolution does not care if you&#x27;re thriving, it cares that you are breeding. So you&#x27;re optimized for &quot;minimum safety&quot; not &quot;maximum flourishing&quot;.<p>So if things are stable then you will prefer to stay in them for as long as possible. It is why people need to &quot;hit rock bottom&quot; before they can be helped, often, ie., their local-minimum needs to become unstable so they will prefer the uncertainty of change.')
