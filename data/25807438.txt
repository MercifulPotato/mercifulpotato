Item(by='rootusrootus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610849702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806349, text='Sure!<p>- Lighter, more nimble -- super tight turning radius, tossable, easy to put anywhere you want in a tight parking lot, etc.  Visibility in the Model 3 is great, but it&#x27;s still a heavier, bigger car.<p>- The Bolt has CarPlay.  I can&#x27;t get my Model 3 to reliably read me text messages, stream music (even getting it to recognize my playlists in Spotify was a huge chore).  CarPlay is just so much easier to use.  Love the big map screen on the Tesla screen, but I really wish they&#x27;d implement CarPlay.  They definitely have the screen real estate to do it.<p>- The Bolt distinguishes between forward regen and reverse.  So when I back down my driveway, it works just like you expect a normal car to do it.  In the Tesla I have to push the accelerator to get it to move downhill in reverse.  Or else I use creep mode and then have to use the brake at every stoplight.  The Bolt gives me both.  And since you decide every time you put it in Drive, you can skip regen altogether, which is what my wife does.  No going into a menu every time and changing it.<p>- Cost.  This is situational, of course.  My Model 3 runs me close to a grand a month in depreciation alone.  I paid 6 grand for a 36 month lease on the Bolt.<p>- Wipers, of course.  The Bolt has normal wiper controls.  On the Model 3 I have to get used to them running at the highest speed for no reason, or turn them off and resign myself to holding down the stalk button when I need them.<p>My model 3 is a performance model, so it&#x27;s silly fast, but the Bolt isn&#x27;t unpleasantly slow.  The Bolt seats suck, but I feel the same about the Model 3 seats (my butt has grown accustomed to Recaros, I got spoiled).  The OTA updates are more frequent on the Model 3, definitely, but at least the Bolt can get OTA updates as well.  Hell, my F250 can at this point, but Tesla is much more frequently tweaking things.')
