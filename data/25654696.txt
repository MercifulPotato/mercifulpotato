Even if the person is going to drive no matter what, and only wants to improve their own experience for least cost, the dollar for transit improves their road experience more than a dollar for more road infrastructure. And even those roads are mostly funded by general funds, not through gas taxes. Gas taxes and user fares fund roughly equivalent amounts of roads and public transit, respectively. And 80% of federal transportation money goes to roads.<p>The only explanation that&#x27;s possible is extremely short-sighted and self-defeating selfishness: seeing something that&#x27;s not for them and instinctively opposing it, without thinking of the bigger picture. It&#x27;s just childish.')
