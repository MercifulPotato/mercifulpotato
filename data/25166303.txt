Since indexing the cache is done in parallel with the TLB lookup, at that point it doesn&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s going to be a base page or a huge page. And worse, nothing prevents the operating system from having the same physical memory address as part of a small page and a huge page at the same time (and AFAIK this is a common situation on Linux, which has kernel-only huge page mappings of the whole memory), so unless you index only by the bits which are not translated at the smallest page size, you risk cache aliases; and once you have cache aliases, you have the same aliasing complications as a VIVT cache.')
