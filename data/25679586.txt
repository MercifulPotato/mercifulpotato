Electric vehicles are becoming mainstream, and I think regular customers will find the various providers confusing.  For example, I planned to do some shopping at a place where I knew they had free charging.  I figured I would be in the store for about 2 hours, which for a 22kW charger should have fully charged the car.  Despite being relatively tech-savvy, I wasn&#x27;t aware that my 120kW limit applied only to DC charging, and not AC charging, so it was reduced to 11kW.  Which it only did for 5 minutes because apparently I needed to navigate to a website and &#x27;ok&#x27; it online for it to continue.<p>Until a non-tech savvy person can simply drive up and pay for the electricity like at any other petrol station, EVs are going to run into some serious issues and disappointed customers.  At the moment it works for those who are willing to put the effort in.')
