I never met him as I didn&#x27;t want to go bother the guy.<p>For those that don&#x27;t know, he was a massive baseball and Dodger fan and would sit right behind home plate. He could often be seen on TV.<p>He would often go to games and just sit at the bar watching from inside. Crazy but I guess he felt more comfortable there at the stadium instead of at home.<p>RIP Larry')
