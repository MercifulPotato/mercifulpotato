Item(by='SI_Rob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608154343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447957, text='Sure, I mean it is increasingly apparent that Bitcoin has, as they say these days, &quot;said the quiet part out loud&quot; with respect to what kinds of motives really drive the stock market, and what signals its participants actually respond to. &quot;Gainz&quot; are swallowing &quot;value&quot; everywhere.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt that the crypto casino is open 24&#x2F;7 as well.<p>The difference with stocks, however, is that stocks don&#x27;t make a big show of pretending to be decentralized. Everyone knows and acknowledges that a relative handful of well-connected actors have enough leverage to wash everyone else out of TSLA if they so chose, but for the Bitcoin cultists it&#x27;s anathema to even suggest the same inexorably centralizing forces are at work. A lot of collective effort is spent on propping up the &quot;decentralization&quot; meme (and its accomplice, the &quot;anonymity&quot; meme), effort which ironically makes the proponents value their Bitcoin all the more; they want to realize a return on that work.')
