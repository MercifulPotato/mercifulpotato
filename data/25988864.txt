Your mind will likely try to distract you as uncomfortable emotions come to the surface, so you may be tempted to text people etc.<p>That said, going into it with intention goes a long way. For the days&#x2F;weeks prior to a session I usually keep a document going and add things that come up. For example, an interaction w&#x2F; my wife or a colleague or friend may be difficult and bring up some tension that I&#x27;d like to work through, so I&#x27;ll note that down. When the session comes I&#x27;ll have a general idea of the areas in life where I&#x27;m feeling stuck, so I&#x27;ll go into it with the intention of working through those.<p>During one session, the first time I mixed LSD, at one point I was thinking to myself about how the combination was clearly not a good idea since it wasn&#x27;t working, and reciting in my head how I would describe this to people afterwords. Then, it occurred to me that it&#x27;s not working because instead of being present with the feelings that are coming up I am distracting myself by thinking of how I&#x27;ll describe how it didn&#x27;t work. Once I realized this I was able to go deeper and there was release :)<p>I&#x27;d strongly recommend reading the book as well before you try it, there is a lot of good advice in there for how to prepare and structure a session. As several folks have pointed out, the language is super intense at times, but try to get past that (it&#x27;s mostly in the beginning chapters anyways) and it&#x27;s well worth the read.')
