It&#x27;s the typical physicist arrogance towards biology. ;)<p>For example, evolution through natural selection would not have been understood if Darwin and Wallace hadn&#x27;t put great effort into cataloguing and classifying species. You might say they obviously were thinking about mechanisms at the same time, but the cataloguing was the precondition to their later insights. They built on the foundations set by, amongst others, Linnaeus, who&#x27;s main contribution to the field was a classification of living things.')
