Maybe it&#x27;s because:<p>- The body needs fats for more than just the krebs cycle (building hormones and cell walls, namely)<p>- In low fat diets, the body is starved of this critical macronutrient, so it uses its own stored fat to perform critical functions<p>Or they&#x27;re pooping it out for all I know. Chopping off a leg will help you lose weight without &quot;burning&quot; calories.<p>Either way, the hypothesis that carbohydrates raise blood glucose which raises insulin which tells your endothelial cells to pull in fat for storage and fat cells, and that ketosis puts your body in fat storage release mode, is clearly not the whole picture.')
