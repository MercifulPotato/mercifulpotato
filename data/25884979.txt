The knights of Gondor riding against the evil horde of Sauron meme becomes parody. Good and evil is more subtle, cuts through the heart of every human being... regularly. The fantasy element is just about scale. It might be a choice between being kinda jerky and nice. Most people can be both. Novels get into a character&#x27;s head. Stories where good and evil is a conflict within that head feel more real, because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like inside our heads.')
