We&#x27;re talking about designing robust systems. You don&#x27;t design a robust system by assuming nobody will screw up!<p>Re: the RFC, note it says &quot;should not&quot;, not &quot;must not&quot;. That seems to suggest they acknowledge repeating might actually make sense in some cases. And honestly the practicalities of this situation and the risk-reward tradeoff seriously tilts toward repeating the request later regardless of what the RFC says. The world isn&#x27;t going to end.')
