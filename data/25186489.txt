I can live at any moment.<p>Most apps are cross platform (Adobe CS, Cubase, Resolve), others are web based (Gmail, Basecamp, etc), my music is on Spotify, and my peripherals all work.<p>&gt;<i>Because you can&#x27;t just leave Apples ecosystem unless willing to switch devices+ecosystem of course.</i><p>Well, I buy new laptop every 4-5 years or so. So if I want to move, I can always do so. If in a rush, I can always sell the old laptop in the first or second year too - with the added benefit that Macs keep their resale value better.')
