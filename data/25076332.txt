The source tends to be a cluster of tabs (say 10) associated to a single subject, full of articles and tools I am using related to it. Frankly an obvious solution is to have a &quot;rough-assortment ephemeral bookmark-group&quot; where I can shift-select say 7 tabs at once and keep them for later, with an easy deletion cycle at will. And it would be good for this method to keep track of my local data of the tabs (scroll position, typed entries, ect.). Bookmarks (in Firefox at least) suck for this in contrast to just working directly with tabs, since you need to bookmark each tab individually + name it + sort them, meanwhile the tabs are grouped together nicely alongside interest-groups I hold for them, and can scroll for what I want or type in the address-bar.')
