Long history of &quot;euroscepticism&quot; if maybe you&#x27;re in very certain crowds I&#x27;d guess.  Or maybe if you&#x27;re a native to the UK.<p>Personally, I wasn&#x27;t even aware it was a thing.  As for &quot;democratic decisions&quot;... just wow.  I&#x27;d be on board with that if the info that had been given to the public for the referendum was above board.<p>However, it was just pure marketing bullshit.  Also, the idiot government <i>literally</i> told people it was only an advisory thing.  Which was (frankly) sensible.  So, I didn&#x27;t really pay much attention to it.  You know, with actually getting a start up off the ground taking up most of my time.<p>Only to find out that somewhere along the line the gov backflipped and told people it <i>would</i> honour the result.  Like... WTF?  With with no guidelines about it needing to be a clear majority. eg 2&#x2F;3 or 3&#x2F;4 of population voting for it.  Instead, they&#x27;ve just pulled the completely incompetent crap we&#x27;ve seen over the last several years. _sigh_<p>Personally, I&#x27;d even volunteered a lot of my time years prior, helping the UK gov (behind the scenes) with policy decisions  re: OSS.  That&#x27;s probably why I feel &quot;betrayed&quot;.  eg you help out a group, and get shafted later on. :&#x2F;')
