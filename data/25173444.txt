I have no idea whether anyone has seriously tried to address this.<p>Reading the comments, it seems glade is not a core part of Gtk&#x2F;gnome (news to me, as an outsider) and that there&#x27;s no alternative besides hand-editing xml files.  wow.<p>(My experience: I wrote and maintained for about 18 years a Tcl&#x2F;Tk-based UI builder program which was used to maintain 100s of dialogs within a large engineering application.  This is not fun, there were many things it had trouble representing, but for me a core consideration was always to generate small diffs, and that reloading and saving a file was always idempotent, as long as the tool wrote it in the first place.  Others will have different considerations in their tooling.)')
