Aspiring to be a pop&#x2F;rock star, pro athlete, famous actor&#x2F;actress, etc.?<p>All of which require time and dedication to the craft to get good at. Being a internet celebrity (in the sense of being Instagram famous), while something that needs to be worked on to get there, does not in most cases involve as much work and creativity. That is what I am getting at.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I am not talking about the scores of people that create on the internet and become famous for it (art, engineering, interesting youtube vids etc). \nOnly the &quot;hey look at me posing on a private beach while sipping this Champagne and oh look a sponsor&quot; types.<p>Those are sadly the ones my sibling&#x27;s kids are looking at and hoping to mirror.')
