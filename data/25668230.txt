I think it is a natural question to compare the two similar acts in terms of violent&#x2F;destructive rioting. Especially so since they are individually representative of both ends of the growing political distance between left&#x2F;right in our country.<p>My logic is not perfect by any means but I see a key difference between;\n1) BLM was a group of citizens protesting against what is essentially abuse of power&#x2F;government and they want change. They want legislative action that holds cops accountable. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you agree with it, but this cause and their right to protest is the most American thing I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. Sure, there are people that took it too far and protesting turned to rioting. But protesting for action and change are patriotic acts.<p>2) On the other hand, today&#x27;s events are almost opposite. It&#x27;s been driven&#x2F;lead by senior members of government. Using lies and propaganda, conditioning a group of citizen sympathizers over a long period of time to distrust media, distrust opposing &quot;facts&quot; or anyone that disagrees with Trumps agenda. Weaponize this group of people to seize power and considerably fracture our democracy. It&#x27;s the least patriotic and perhaps treasonous thing I could ever imagine. But they think they are the patriots. It&#x27;s just so backwards to me.')
