Or do we want a model that acts like a person who has just been through 2020?<p>You&#x27;re free to use the model you believe is best for your goals.<p>I you use real world data from the last 20 years to generate the model then your model will reflect an amalgamation of the real world data collected in the last 20 years.<p>If you prefer to focus on last month then go ahead. You&#x27;ll have less real world data and seasonal patterns will have a deeper impact and the model will be less robust, but go right ahead.<p>If, instead, you want a model that is not generated from real world data and instead just uses your own artificial data that is blatantly and openly manipulated to reflect your personal biases and political preferences then just call the spade a spade.')
