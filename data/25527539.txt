Adding it as metadata isn’t a good enough solution. Shared medium&#x2F;long lived branches such as version maintenance branches or shared dev branches invariably get merges “both ways” meaning the information of what’s merged where is sprinkled everywhere.<p>But I’d go even further and say: svn isn’t even a good choice for a basic feature branch workflow. Not that it’s impossible, but the added “convenience” of svn is much smaller than the gains of git.<p>I don’t think the “D” in dvcs is important. As you point out, most people use git with a blessed central repo because that’s what we want.')
