Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604821403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021831, text='&gt; It&#x27;s pretty obvious that the democrats failed to demonstrate that their goals were rather close to the center of the spectrum<p>tldr; Republicans did not even attempted to demonstrate that their goals were rather close to the center of the spectrum. Why is that the democrats are supposed to reach to center both when they won and loose?<p>I don&#x27;t think so. When you are closed in right wing bubble, Biden is hardcore socialist, nearly progressive communist about to destroy American capitalism. Literally. He is also sleepy Joe in clear early stage of dementia. This has zero to do with what democrats demonstrated. This is made up, because making it up is good for &quot;our side&quot;. It does not matter what Biden is or demonstrates.<p>Frankly, it is like relationship with narcissist. Dont let him&#x2F;her gaslight you into thinking you are at fault for whatever was done to you. It is overall unfair and biased toward right wing. You dont fix relationship with narcissist by going out of your way further and further trying to prove made up accusations are false. It does not work, the middle just shifts constantly and abuse just escalates.<p>Republicans did not demonstrated the Trump along people he appointed, proud boys are not what the party is. You want left to stop pursuing their own policy goals, with threat that right wing will go crazy if they dont. But that is abusive logic, right wing is responsible for right wing does. And left wing is responsible for left wing does.')
