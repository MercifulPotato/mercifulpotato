SmartScreen is way worse - from the grumblings I&#x27;ve heard it basically doesn&#x27;t care all that much about code signing. Even if it did, code signing on Windows is more expensive than it is on macOS. There&#x27;s constant reports of Free Software developers of niche software packages getting their new releases stopped by SmartScreen and then Microsoft manually approving it. It runs on some fuzzy logic&#x2F;ML nonsense so even Microsoft themselves doesn&#x27;t entirely know why SmartScreen is constantly flagging Free Software developers.')
