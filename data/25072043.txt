Item(by='jesterpm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605201595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071676, text='&gt; Control participants chose to perform more of their physical activity as HIIT than the physical activity undertaken by participants in the MICT group.<p>The implications of allowing the control group to self-select their activities from the guidelines.<p>I wonder if they would have biased toward the HIIT activities (perceiving them to be better) simply because they were participating in the study. Would the outcome have been different if they were asked to maintain their existing activity levels or somehow replicate the normal activity mix of people following the guidance. Otherwise, it seems more useful to focus on the difference between the HIIT and MICT groups.')
