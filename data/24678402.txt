Do you think movies of child abuse are &quot;free speech&quot;, or recruitment&#x2F;instruction videos tot terrorist organizations, or inciting violence and hate? What about Assange, he published some stuff, could that be free speech? Or violations of copyright?<p>To me free speech is like free markets. The word does not adequately cover the implementation as boundaries do apply. There are little to non truly free markets (no tax, no imp&#x2F;ex restrictions, etc). And there is not truly free speech.<p>And to limit freedom to speech to prevent hate&#x2F;violence inciting crowds to get a platform may --according to me-- be necessary in some cases and is allowed by many of the worlds constitutions.<p>On top of that Reddit is a private platform, so they are free to set their standard, just like you may prohibit some speech in your own household (under the thread of being expelled or &quot;no longer welcome).')
