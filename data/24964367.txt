It’s basically a very small patch to wine to allow wine to handle multiple exe architectures at once, and a method of compiling both a native arch and Intel wine into the same prefix and picking between them when an exe is executed.<p>For performance I have a method for thunking alsa and OpenGL to native libraries at the Linux layer, as well as an ABI compatible desktop OpenGL implementation using ES as the backend.')
