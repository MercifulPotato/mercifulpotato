For those of us who didn&#x27;t know who he is.<p>The top graphs has your drawing continuous lines between discrete points. You should pobably show the points on the top graph. (the lines are trend lines) its clear the like ratio stays pretty constant no matter what.  You could put the podcast guest on the x axis too.\nIf you can gray the area in the bottom graph you are expanding in the above view that would be cool.    Its moving forward in time automatically, but at some point it seems to run off the end (I&quot;m not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to be able to manually set it)<p>In the topics&#x2F;time the vertical scroll bar is a little strange but I&#x27;m not sure what could be better.<p>Despite these very minor points, I like the page.')
