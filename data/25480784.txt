And of course, said decision makers aren&#x27;t exactly known for their backbone when handling conflict, so we get situations like this. Administrators often don&#x27;t even know who in the hospitals spends the most time around sick patients. Entire front-line departments are forgotten, primarily because they don&#x27;t have any political power or representation.<p>To see such a highly regarded institution fail this very simple test is another example of how the human creature needs more time to evolve. It&#x27;s not just a mistake, this is a pattern playing out all over. Anyone who spends time in these environs would not be much surprised, but when the best hospitals still can&#x27;t take care of their most vulnerable staff because of pernicious political maneuvering, the contrast between perception and reality is all the more stark.')
