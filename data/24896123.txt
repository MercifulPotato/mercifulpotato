However, engine efficiency usually comes at the expense of thrust; there are few theoretical designs even that could provide 1.5 G for the amount of time needed to get to Mars.<p>For this engine, for example, the specific impulse is twice that of a chemical rocket - so around 800. At an acceleration of 1.5 G, this engine could only run for around forty minutes before exhausting all the fuel in the vessel.<p>So we are not yet at the technology level necessary for Brachistochrone trajectories (accelerate halfway there, flip over, decelerate the rest of the way); this would merely allow for a shorter Newtonian transfer orbit.')
