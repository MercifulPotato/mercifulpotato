Brown is a very libertarian school with regard to the student body. Sure this example sucks but how many people at brown were involved with this decision making process? This feels like a situation where technical administrators who are not in charge of normal student life made a decision which is both highly unusual and clearly controversial. I would say the main people I came into contact with at brown for instance RAs in dorms and my professors and course staff were absolutely understanding, kind, and liberal in a way that I did not experience in other schools.')
