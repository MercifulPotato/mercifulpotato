There are options for viable future anti-cheats on Linux, between recreating what&#x27;s been done for Windows, simple reputation systems, community moderation and actual event audits. The reason they&#x27;ll be contemplated is the continued failure of trusted clients. And the significance of the 13 [of top 100] games that currently don&#x27;t work is entirely down to player preferences.<p>Dramatics: you seem to be a person that understands the problem, understands individuality, but refuses to paint as more than a binary outcome. There are already a million gamers playing games on Linux, there&#x27;s clearly room in the middle, and positive road to the future.<p>E-sports: the elite will continue to happen at real venues, but I think there&#x27;s going to be significant growth in the every-day teams. Think five-a-side pub teams. They&#x27;re not going to rent a Â£15k&#x2F;d venue like Multiplay can, they&#x27;re going to play online and <i>need</i> a way to ensure that all players are playing with the same tools. A cloud-rendered system does that and it&#x27;ll only become more feasible in time. Yes, there&#x27;s higher latency, but it&#x27;s a known latency.')
