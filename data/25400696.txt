Children are children and so their earnestness is cute and endearing (in most instances)--adults are far less charming and far more petty, self-indulgent, spineless, fickle, fearful.<p>Social media is a cesspool largely due to all this earnestness. Fear of retribution and shame is helpful in mitigating the self-absorption embedded in most people. We&#x27;d all like to think there&#x27;s something special in all of us and that the world will benefit from the light of our creativity if it was set free. Truth be told, very few people are capable of much past mimicking and repeating what already exists.<p>People should appreciate the template of conformity that allows them to find a place in the world and not let advertising, that often leverages the idea of uniqueness to sell things, diminish the value of their  mediocrity. No, given the proper &quot;freedom&quot; to be &quot;earnest&quot; you wouldn&#x27;t be the next Picasso or Steve Jobs. We know because if that&#x27;s who you were, that&#x27;s who you&#x27;d be. Some people seem to find success in art and innovation operating in the same repressive environment, so maybe the environment is not the problem. Maybe earnestness just isn&#x27;t your thing and fear&#x2F;conformity is the better strategy.<p>*grammar edits')
