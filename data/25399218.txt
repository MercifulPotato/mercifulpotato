You might want to reread my comment.<p>I can say from experience for every language above, save C++ (with which I have never worked), that they will fail to compile if you change a function signature in a backwards-incompatible way and fail to update all call sites.<p>The purpose of static typing as a method of program verification is to enforce type constraints at compile-time for all possible executions of that program. A function signature is, you guessed it, a type constraint.')
