Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25991526], score=None, time=1612201333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988711, text='&gt; In middle school it would go like “I’m not saying hn_throwaway is a slut, but I did see her watching Harry Potter and also saw three other boys who say they like her at the theater that weekend.”<p>&gt; Both statements are true, but without some other fact they don’t matter so the only reason to mention them is to make a claim without evidence. Especially since I explicitly said I’m not calling you a slut.<p>Except that&#x27;s not even remotely like what the Newsweek article said. Sticking with the middle school comparison, what the article said is that hn_throwaway threw a large graduation party that was open to the public, and some religious cultists came to try to recruit from among the partygoers.<p>There is no attempt to imply that hn_throwaway is a one of the cultists, or approves of the cultists. It is just reporting that the cultists tried to use hn_throwaway&#x27;s party to find recruits.')
