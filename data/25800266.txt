It&#x27;s going to multiple _firms_, likely with multiple lawyers, paralegals and other staff all involved in the case.<p>And the rest of the settlement is still 540 million, so 5 times more than what the firms are making.  If you divide the remaining 110 million between all the plaintiffs, it&#x27;s an additional 68 dollars per plaintiff...and that leaves nothing left for the people that actually did the work.<p>It&#x27;s the same bad argument that the McDonald&#x27;s CEO makes 20 million dollars - but he can&#x27;t pay staff 15$ minimum wage, even though that 20 million split up between the tens of thousands of employees is a one time payment of pocket change.')
