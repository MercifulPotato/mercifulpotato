However I strongly disagree. Having Down syndrome isn&#x27;t just being &quot;outside the conventional parameters of of normality&quot;, it&#x27;s a serious disease with life-altering implications. You will never surpass the cognitive capacity of a young child, you will have impaired vision and hearing, if you ever manage to speak at all, you will probably lose that ability at around 30 years of age. You will have a myriad other chronic and painful health problems, and then you will finally die at around age 40 (maybe more with enough high-quality support). This is not a life worth living, if I ever were in such a situation I would pray to be euthanised.')
