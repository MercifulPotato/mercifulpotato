One of us got into SublimText quite fast (with modal editing too, using vintage), while another went into vim scripting and python, and another with neovim.<p>It was our first year, i don&#x27;t think we even finished our Posix shell project at that time, so our knowledge of vim&#x27;s binding was very limited, as we spent less than 6 month on it. But this was really comfortable, and even the two people of our group that learnt to code prior with the Java IDE got hooked with modal editing, vim or not. Because once you&#x27;ve learned how to use it, it is just more comfortable. I still know how to use ctrE and ctrlA and basic shortcuts present with every IDEs, but the `find &quot;, move one right, delete all util next &quot;` i don&#x27;t, and i&#x27;m pretty sure is not the same on Atom or Netbeans, and since i&#x27;ve already learned the superior `ri&quot;` (replace inside &quot;&quot;), i don&#x27;t understand why i should learn more complex shortcuts.<p>I mean, even `delete from this word until the end of the line` i&#x27;m pretty sure won&#x27;t be the same within two editor (you&#x27;ll have to find the word with control f, place a mark wich differ depending on the editor, CtrlE, then either place a second mark or delete from the first mark? i guess?). I like consistency and not having to place mark and think on &quot;how will i do that&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying modal editing is better, i think it&#x27;s just like learning to use a new tool. Let&#x27;s say you want to add floorboard in your house. You know how to use a circular saw (everyone does), so you use that, and that&#x27;s okay and probably enough. I&#x27;ve learned how to safely and correctly use a radial saw however, and will rather use one if i have the choice. It&#x27;s not better inherently, i&#x27;m just lazy and i find using a radil more comfortable (as long as i have earplugs available).')
