Only downside for me is mixing the natural stuff, it can be quite a workout. What I discovered recently is storing your next jar upside-down for a week or so on the shelf will make it much easier when doing the initial mixing since the oil will try to float up through the whole jar, so it kind of softens the stuff on the bottom. Once mixed, put it in the fridge and it will stay mixed.')
