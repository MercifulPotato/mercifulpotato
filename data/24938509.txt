We&#x27;re non-profit so we don&#x27;t exactly fit the mold, but understaffing isn&#x27;t something that we are aiming for. We&#x27;re offering incredible hiring bonuses, reaching out on every single avenue. Our problem is retention - we can get a few people hired, but maybe 1&#x2F;5 CNAs stay, and 1&#x2F;4 of the nurses. The long term care center probably has slightly better ratios, but most people don&#x27;t have the ability to compartmentalize or the resiliency to last in the chronically understaffed units. You end up doing the work of 3 people with people who at best are demanding and at worst are physically attacking you and others.<p>Additionally, even for a CNA, training takes months and months. We get them out on the floor as soon as possible now, which isn&#x27;t helping with out retention, but reflects the reality that our residents need care. Most of us are pulling 80+ hour weeks just to meet the federally mandated minimum staffing for how many residents we have at a given moment.')
