Most everyone knows that X calories in and X calories is the end target. Knowing how you can reach that balance is the hard part.<p>Every time I see some kind of forum about weight loss there are a million people popping in talking about &quot;Putting the fork down&quot; or &quot;Calories In &lt; Calories Out&quot;. But this is worthless because in the end, having a solution that a person is capable of doing is far more important than theory.')
