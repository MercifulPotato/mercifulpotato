Because of that, and because I&#x27;d worked in some similar technical areas at my previous job, I was absolutely delighted to find that my (not yet) father-in-law had copies of some of those documents, with <i>handwritten notes</i> by the authors. Seeing this reminded me that I need to do something to make sure those get scanned and not lost. It truly was an under-appreciated precursor of many things we now take for granted.')
