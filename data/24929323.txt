Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[24929455], score=None, time=1603970705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929209, text='&gt; My experience is that LiveView is fine for all but the last use case.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to impose a 50-500ms+ delay on someone to show a menu drop down or a tooltip or most of the other things listed out.<p>With LV everything involves a server round trip. That&#x27;s great for when you need to make a round trip no matter what (which is often the case, such as updating your database based on a user interaction), but it creates for very unnaturally sluggish feeling UIs when you use LV for things that you expect to be instant.<p>Even a 100ms delay on a menu feels off and with a good internet connection if you have a server in NY, you&#x27;ll get 80-100ms ping times to the west coast of the US or the west coast of Europe.<p>LV feels amazing on localhost but the internet is global. I still think it&#x27;s worth minimizing round trips to the server when you can, not because Phoenix and LV can&#x27;t handle it but because I want my users to have a good experience using the sites I develop.')
