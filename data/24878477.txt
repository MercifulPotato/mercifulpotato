No one is going to hire expensive lawyers to enforce copyright on something not generating revenue, although legally they can.<p>&gt; If that&#x27;s the case, we should ban all Pi-holes, too<p>If Pi-hole is anywhere saying or implying &quot;use us to watch $vendor&#x27;s content without watching their ads&quot; then yes pi-hole is waving a red flag at $vendor who is now motivated to try to ban pi-holes.  If there is a legal action they can afford to take they will.<p>&gt; What if I have YouTube Premium, then I don&#x27;t see ads, so am I allowed to download via youtube-dl?<p>No, downloading is a separate &quot;right&quot; from the right to watching without ads.  (Downloading is the first step before uploading elsewhere and literally stealing the ad revenue.)  But I think there&#x27;s a legal grey area if you&#x27;re watching (streaming) with youtube-dl, without saving the file.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s against Youtube&#x27;s TOS though.')
