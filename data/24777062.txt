In the Marine Corps, I went through quite a bit of training in dealing with cold conditions. There are specific training requirements for cold exposure, and a tried and true methodology for increasing a person&#x27;s capacity for dealing with the cold.<p>Biologically, your body will naturally adjust to a climate over time. This occurs when living in warmer or cooler conditions for a period of time. The main controls are metabolism speed, sweat threshold, and activity level.<p>One of the key ways to quickly adjust to a new climate is by a forced activity level in it. When we&#x27;d train in a new climate, we&#x27;d always start by doing forced marches during the peak condition (hottest or coldest time of day, depending on which condition we were unused to) for a day or two, then move on to runs, then to actual mission based training. On the first day or two, we&#x27;d all be shivering, miserable, joints swollen, etc... By day 3 or 4, that would all go away. You&#x27;re still uncomfortable, but your body has adjusted.<p>Once you leave that climate, your resistance to the extreme temperature slowly fades (as you&#x27;re adjusting to a new climate), but it seems to me that I still carry a bit of resistance to the extreme.<p>We&#x27;d do refreshers whenever we got the chance, taking people on &quot;polar bear runs&quot; in the middle of the night in the desert, in shorts and t-shirts, and that would help sustain the resistance to the cold.')
