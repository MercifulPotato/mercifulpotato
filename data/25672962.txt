Item(by='yanderekko', descendants=None, kids=[25673722], score=None, time=1610036582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672342, text='&gt;Unless you&#x27;re directly attacking others or posting really hateful stuff, getting banned will first involve some kind of escalation and very often also one or more moderators asking to tone it down or disengage.<p>Sometimes it will and oftentimes it won&#x27;t. Again, this is my actual experience, and the experience of many others. If it comforts you to believe that I probably deserved it somehow, that I have to affirm my lived experience over your baseline skepticism, then it&#x27;s not worth my time to try to shake you from that sort of complacency.<p>For example, as I relayed elsewhere on this thread, I was recently banned on a travel forum when a discussion of traveling during COVID arose and I took the position that it wasn&#x27;t obviously selfish&#x2F;ignorant to travel if officials in all the relevant jurisdictions approved of it. For this I was simply permanently banned, and my modmail inquiries were ignored. Now if you want to assume that I must&#x27;ve laced my posts with racial slurs or whatever I&#x27;ll tell you that that&#x27;s wrong but I&#x27;m not going to be able to prove it to you. But this is just how things work on many parts of Reddit.')
