Essentially you&#x27;re an AI who&#x27;s mission is to mine every resource from a planet. To keep things efficient you start out small and have limited processing power. You&#x27;re only able to run an assembly like language that we&#x27;ve developed. As you get more resources you can research new things like functions, variables, type arguments, whatever. We plan for there to be a tech tree so you can choose to build out a language that&#x27;s not strict similar to JS or you can go the try hard route and build something like Haskell. You build bots that mine, explore, hunt, etc and each bot is a computer running their own script. We plan on there being battles you have to script around and even things like setting up your own network so you can have robots call home when they&#x27;re out in the field.<p>I still need to think of a good name for it though.')
