Which grounds are actually valid, though not the actual motive in play.<p>A world where chargers aren&#x27;t included is better than one where every manufacturer feels bound to bundle one in to every single phone purchase.  So I think Apple is doing a good thing here, just like when they were the first to stop including floppy drives.')
