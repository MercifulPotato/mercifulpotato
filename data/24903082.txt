These venues initially maintain freedom of speech. Once they become effective monopolies, they start arbitrarily cracking down on speech they dislike.<p>The vast majority of people are on these monopolistic platforms. Yes, dissenters can still publish on some obscure platforms that nobody is consuming.<p>If you ban a story on Twitter and Facebook, you are effectively ensuring the vast majority of readers will never get a chance to see it.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s a Murdoch rag, with the usual Murdoch standard for quality and ethics.</i><p>So convenient that you can know everything about The Post without apparently reading it at all.<p>Also, seems we no longer need to bother looking at facts or evidence. If a news story is vaguely associated with someone we dislike, we can just declare it wrongthink and dismiss it completely without further discussion.<p>In fact, you strongly advocate that it should be blocked from being published at all. If a piece of information is associated with a group or person we dislike for any reason, we should consign it to the memory hole. We shouldn&#x27;t let people make up their own mind, we should make it for them.')
