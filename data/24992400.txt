Key rotating makes sense for your password or tls keys, because they&#x27;re used on a regular basis on networked computers that can possibly be compromised. But if the private key is stored on an airgapped computer (or paper wallet) there would be no advantage. If anything pulling the computer out to do the signing presents more danger because there&#x27;s opportunity for your house to be raided (by police or rival criminals) while you&#x27;re doing the signing.')
