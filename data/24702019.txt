Endless ink has been spilled about how the public does not understand statistics but very little effort has been made to communicate effectively.<p>The whole thing seems like a navelgazing sideshow where the pollsters want to have it both ways. They want to claim their predictions are infallible but then when the public says they failed they want to backpedal with holier than thou &quot;well, actually...&quot; excuses.')
