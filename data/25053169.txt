I don&#x27;t have a well-formed opinion on this type of policy but there is a balance between prioritizing justice for victims and rights of victimizers. Behind every single strike are innocent people who have been hurt by the individual and at some point, you have to take steps to protect them from someone who just doesn&#x27;t want to stop.<p>You also can&#x27;t take away all agency from that individual. Those strikes are collected through many years and multiple prison sentences - at that point, it&#x27;s a decision to continue.')
