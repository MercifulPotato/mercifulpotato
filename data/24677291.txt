In this case you wouldn&#x27;t need to do anything to make your app use it.<p>If instead you want a networking stack written in Python,\nfor WSGI based frameworks like Flask it is enough to write a WSGI server that instead of using the `socket` module uses your custom stack. It will be compatible with the vast majority of Python web apps thanks to WSGI.<p>That being said it&#x27;s very unlikely that you will notice any performance improvement. In the case of a networking stack written in Python it would even be way worse than the kernel implementation.')
