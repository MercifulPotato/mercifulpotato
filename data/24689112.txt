Item(by='thegagne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601914725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24688414, text='+1.<p>I recently did PT for lower back stuff mostly related to sitting for long periods.<p>I went from constant “3-4” level pain to “0-1” pain. I’m still working on strengthening, and re-injured my back moving something heavy, but PT was a game changer.<p>A lot of stretching like the above video shows, as well as working on posture, sleeping position, as well as just overall education on how my muscles work and what to do when I feel them tighten up or feel an area swelling up.<p>It’s mostly simple stuff but requires habit changes and can be time consuming so you have to fit it into regular routines. Stretching before&#x2F;after bed, while you brush teeth, etc.<p>You look weird randomly stretching on a stair while you stir your tea, but it can make a big difference.')
