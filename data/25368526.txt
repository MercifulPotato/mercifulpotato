(And they will, and Google will find out if the juice is worth the squeeze on that.)<p>Because of COVID-19 and the huge increase of mail in ballots, there is good reason to believe that fraud was higher than other years.  Biden&#x27;s margin of victory in key swing states is smaller than Trump&#x27;s in 2016.  These are not unreasonable things to discuss and I find unfathomable that this policy would be something Google would apply to say, Iran, or any other country where there was speech skeptical of government.<p>Acting as if speech discussing this on their platform is beyond the pale is ludicrous.  It shows a sheltered, fragile group of people who think their views are more common than they are.')
