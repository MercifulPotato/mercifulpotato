All of these will require some kind of transaction time to do things with the files (we&#x27;re talking milliseconds to a couple of seconds).<p>If you need on-line storage, such as for a database, then consider AWS with a big EBS volume or Digital Ocean&#x27;s Volume Block Store.<p>All of these can be used with the smallest&#x2F;cheapest VPS instance types... so you can pay $2&#x2F;month for a micro-sized EC2 reserved instance and attach a lot of storage. A downside to this is that most providers top out at 16TB, which might be a scaling problem depending on what your business is. Even small image hosts are in the multi-petabyte range.')
