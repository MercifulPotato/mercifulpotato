It feels like acknowledging a serious character defect, worthy of ostracism, being fired, and possibly having a mob show up at your house.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not a prescriptivist. I acknowledge that language evolves, but it does not evolve the same way in every place at the same time. It tends to evolve in a particular place and spread out from there. The particular definition you&#x27;re using has not spread to the entirety of society yet. Your pitch could really benefit from some localization to the various sub-dialects of the english language if you&#x27;d like less push back in the future.')
