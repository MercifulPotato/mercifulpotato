Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607941150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410026, text='I propose a very new unconventional type of asset. It is effectively equivalent to a UBI but since it is also an asset the central bank can easily control it.<p>The central bank does an IPO and sells UBI tokens at a fixed price. Say $100. If you own at least one token then you will gain a dividend of 1 UBI token per month. To prevent abuse there is a government run exchange where this token can be bought on that verifies your identity. This means you are heavily incentivized to sell your tokens to other people for less than $100 yourself. It&#x27;s basically an &quot;anti&quot; asset. It&#x27;s relative utility shrinks the more you own. The central bank then can buy tokens back at any price it desires. The beauty of this system is that the wealthy are a minority so any money that the central bank distributes by buying UBI tokens will primarily go the less wealthy because they are the majority. Since you get one token per month and the central bank can set the minimum value of the token it is effectively a UBI. If consumer inflation heats up the central bank can always stop buying tokens because it isn&#x27;t a true UBI that people depend on.')
