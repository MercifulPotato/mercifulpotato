With a few exceptions, most Apple frameworks and application software are proprietary. If Apple&#x27;s internal source code is deemed to be central to their business, outside developers will probably never get to see it. And if they can&#x27;t see it, they can&#x27;t fix and improve it.<p>If you write application software for Apple devices, you have made a Faustian bargain. You are at the mercy of the whims of Apple Software Engineering; Apple has you by the proverbial balls. If your own code is also proprietary then your customers are in the same vulnerable position, so stop complaining.')
