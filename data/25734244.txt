In near real-time, anytime.  And that they could do so in a way that meant often they did not have to accept any consequence for the wider-ranging effects of their words.<p>Separately I also have to wonder if the knowledge acquired  as a result of that would have affected their framing. In particular the advances in  psychology and group psychology, and in understanding how it&#x27;s possible to use this instant mass communication to manipulate even people who are on guard against manipulation.')
