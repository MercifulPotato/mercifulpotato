That is why it is significantly easier for someone to copy data from one web UI to another than it is to write the rules for copying backend-to-backend automatically (up to some amount of data). This is a problem much more fundamental than the economic incentives for app creation. It&#x27;s similar to the observation that, for small amounts of data, it is easier to run a select * from table and visually search, rather than go though the trouble of mentioning which columns and rows you want to see.')
