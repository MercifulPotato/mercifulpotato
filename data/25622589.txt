Especially in kernel mode where there&#x27;s little memory protection and basically any driver could be writing anywhere at any time.<p>I can understand Linus&#x27;s frustration from that point of view: without ECC RAM when you get some super weird crash report where some pointer got corrupted for no apparent reason you can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s was just a random bitflip or if it&#x27;s actually hiding a bigger problem.')
