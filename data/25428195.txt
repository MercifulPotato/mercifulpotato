At say, ten million USD per kilometre (a low estimate compared to actual costs borne by France for building the TGV [0]), and a bird&#x27;s eye distance of 3966 kilometres between LA and NYC [1], that&#x27;s almost 400 billion dollars, or about 60% of the non-defense discretionary budget of the US for a single year. Keep in mind that&#x27;s a very generous cost per kilometre; California&#x27;s HSR projected costs are north of 60 million USD per kilometre.<p>And that&#x27;s for a single pair of cities, with no cost overruns, no tunnels, straight line distance. It also excludes things like stations, rolling stock, and maintenance.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to build, but having high speed rail throughout the US is an investment that would be a multiple of the costs of building the entire interstate highway system.<p>Mind you, I&#x27;d love it if that were to happen, riding high speed rail is much more pleasant than flying. Speaking as someone who has gone across the continent a few times on Amtrak and enjoyed riding high speed trains in Asia and Europe, it&#x27;s just hard to see it happening. Recent US infrastructure projects have had massive cost overruns, and there is a seemingly low political appetite for building large infrastructure compared to the 20th century.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;764486&#x2F;cost-construction-lines-lgv-by-kilometer-la-france&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;764486&#x2F;cost-construction...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=distance+between+los+angeles+and+new+york+city+in+kilometres" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=distance+between+los+a...</a>')
