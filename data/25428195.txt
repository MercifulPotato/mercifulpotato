At say, ten million USD per kilometre (a low estimate compared to actual costs borne by France for building the TGV [0]), and a bird&#x27;s eye distance of 3966 kilometres between LA and NYC [1], that&#x27;s almost 400 billion dollars, or about 60% of the non-defense discretionary budget of the US for a single year.<p>That&#x27;s for a single pair of cities, with no cost overruns, no tunnels, straight line distance. It also excludes things like stations, rolling stock, and maintenance.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to build, but having high speed rail throughout the US is an investment that would be greater than the costs of building the entire interstate highway system.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;764486&#x2F;cost-construction-lines-lgv-by-kilometer-la-france&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;764486&#x2F;cost-construction...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=distance+between+los+angeles+and+new+york+city+in+kilometres" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=distance+between+los+a...</a>')
