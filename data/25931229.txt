Even with more shorts than shares driving up the price, eventually when all shorts are covered, there will still be folks holding the original shares, and the demand will vanish. So not only will the short positions lose a lot of money, but everyone left holding shares will lose a ton of money as well. And if the float is 140% (or whatever) then isn&#x27;t that like 2&#x2F;5 of the total shares which is about to crash hard? So if you are holding $GME and get out randomly, you have a 2&#x2F;5 chance of losing it all (by getting out after the shorts close)?')
