Even with the hardware of 2011 it wasn&#x27;t implausible to keep up with PayPal with optimised software, and with multiple-machine nodes you could even keep up with the bigger credit card processors. That was in 2011. Since then we have things like AMD Rome and 128 core machines, NVRAM that&#x27;s only 10x slower than DRAM and so on. Satoshi bet on hardware improvements and his bets were solid.<p>Meanwhile, there is no requirement in the architecture to never truncate the on-disk copy of the block chain. Some people should keep it for historical reasons and to preserve the low-trust nature of the system, but there&#x27;s no requirement for every full node to keep it, and no requirement that everyone use a full node.<p>Bitcoin and scaling is unfortunately a topic that became horribly corrupted around 2015 by ideology, full blown information warfare and an overtly political manipulation of the community. As a consequence there are a lot of people who think, incorrectly, that they understand the design of Bitcoin better than Satoshi did, and who think it needed to be completely replaced with the &quot;Lightning network&quot;. The reason this accompanied massive levels of censorship, DDoS attacks, intimidation and outright extortion is because the arguments were bad and the proposed alternatives, even worse. The original Bitcoin design was fine for what it needed and represented some pragmatic engineering that balanced complexity against scaling and decentralization. What Blockstream forced on the community was in contrast, significantly worse.')
