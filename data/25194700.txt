The flip side of this is that employees are stealing from their employer whenever their attention wavers from the job, for example talking with co-workers or texting or web browsing or whatever.<p>The reality is that hourly pay is almost always a poor approximation for the expectations between employer and employee. Calling any deviation from strictly kept time for an employee in 100% service to their employer &quot;theft&quot; is just silly, whether it&#x27;s an employee chatting about their weekend, or an employer asking for some extra minutes. Each should (and outside of artificial constructs like this article does) weigh total compensation against benefit &#x2F; effort and decide if the relationship is worth continuing.')
