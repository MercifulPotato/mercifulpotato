Then you can build a general purpose rig, that can be reprogrammed to solve different quantum functions.<p>Then you can build clones of this rig. And stack them up in racks. And have thousands of racks. Now you have a super quantum computer system.<p>Then you can begin to miniaturizing the system.<p>The Chinese quantum supremacy solution only solved one problem. But I would gather that the beam splitters can be modified to solve other quantum functions.')
