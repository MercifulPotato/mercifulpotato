The abilities of single systems have far outstripped our ability to manage all those resources. It takes a lot of work to drive a system like this to the rails, and very few people even bother trying. The closest most people come to exploiting a machine this large is by carving it up into normal-sized virtual machines with independent operating systems. This makes the utilization look acceptable but in reality much of the resources are just being squandered.')
