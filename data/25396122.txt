In this situation it seems half and half, which may be why the difference between the terms doesn&#x27;t matter to much to me.<p>Using your definition, yes, it seems clear this was a firing, but again, so what? Does a disagreement on terms really necessitate the drama (news articles, petition, protests)? If she was being denied money somehow because of the distinction then I could see it being a legal case, but I haven&#x27;t heard anything like that. Google said she resigned, she said she didn&#x27;t, okay.<p>If anything, saying she resigned sounds a bit nicer to me than saying she was fired. Probably best if Google had not commented on it at all.')
