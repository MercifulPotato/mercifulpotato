Clearly it does not, and cannot.<p>Talking about the rain forest is shifting the goalposts.<p>Note that North America has <i>more</i> forest land than it did a hundred years ago, largely because modern mechanized agriculture has dramatically increased the crop yield per acre, leading to marginal agricultural land being returned to forest cover.<p>The &quot;slash-and-burn&quot; agricultural methods that destroy the rain forest are largely a feature of the &quot;low tech&quot; &quot;traditional&quot; &quot;organic&quot; farming techniques that are beloved by environmentalists.')
