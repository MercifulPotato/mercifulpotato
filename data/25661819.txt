As far as I can see, the rest of the article consistently refers to &#x27;both papers&#x27;. So I do not think it reasonable to claim that the Childs preprint &#x27;is only mentioned in passing&#x27;.<p>Second, you missed a key quote: &quot;So by imagining a pseudo Bose-Einstein condensate tailor made for each nonlinear problem, this algorithm deduces a useful linear approximation.&quot; From this I conclude that the MIT paper does reduce the computation to a linear system after all, as OP suggested.<p>Third, let me offer some unsolicited feedback on the tone of your comment: the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that you read it carefully&quot; came across as needlessly off-putting to me.')
