I have the hope the frame itself may be used as antenna.<p>Contrary to what the other commenter said, this is not attractive for carbon frame owners as I wasn&#x27;t thinking GPS tracking, but low power, snitching networks (like Apple&#x27;s stuff, where the stolen iPhone only needs to be seen by another iPhone; or like corona tracking).
