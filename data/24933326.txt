If the editor concludes that it&#x27;s a garbage story dropped a few days before the election in an attempt to influence the election, you don&#x27;t run it and then &quot;let the readers decide who is right&quot;. As he well knows, all that matters is that the story runs, not whether it&#x27;s shown to be false months after the election is over. Strange that he thinks his readers are that gullible.<p>I want to be clear that I&#x27;m not claiming to know the truth as it relates to this story, only that this is the position of the editors, and that his argument is nonsense.')
