Item(by='crusso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608125959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440089, text='<i>There&#x27;s a lot of truth in that, but it&#x27;s not strictly true.</i><p>And yet, rayiner&#x27;s comment appeared faded-out from down-voting when I came upon it.<p>And that&#x27;s the real problem.  He had truth and thoughtfulness in his comment (yeah, you can quibble about federal attempts to override local policy), yet even a smart group of people like regular HN users tribalistically downvoted it.  Rayiner sinned by making a coherent argument against throwing Republicans under the bus for metro-area problems.<p>We are a tribalistic society and it&#x27;s only getting worse.  Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and his supporters would defend him.  He was probably right.  When evidence of Biden&#x27;s family corruption surfaced before the election, the media and tech giants actively suppressed and subverted the information.<p>Ending no-knock warrants or shuffling around police roles just eats away at the edges of the problem.  If as a society, we can&#x27;t find ways to get at truth and logic that cuts through the dynamics that push tribalism, we&#x27;re doomed to a never-ending race toward the drain.')
