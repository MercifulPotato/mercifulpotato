I&#x27;ve had fantastic employees have horrible weeks &#x2F; months because they refused to take a few days off to deal with personal items.<p>As an employer, I would definitely say it is in my best long term interest to have an employee who is happy and doesn&#x27;t have problems at home. If that means someone I&#x27;m paying 6 figures needs every Friday off for a few months then so be it. Or in this case, taking a nap whenever they need to, provided it&#x27;s not a 4 hour nap everyday at 1 PM.')
