TCP and UDP will never get another sibling.<p>&gt; Nope, this is absolutely false; I even have a concrete counterexample: IPv6. Standardised in 1995–1998, supported by DNS since 2008, supported by all major OSes by 2011, but still unavailable to a very large fraction of internet users.<p>&gt; You’re seriously overestimating the ability to get people to change.<p>I think it&#x27;s just the opposite: everyone else in the world is just giving up.<p>Actually changing these things is not some insurmountable, inscruitable task. It&#x27;s just a protocol! It&#x27;s ones and zeroes! It&#x27;s not rocket science, or nuclear fission (<i>which now seems possible?</i>). It&#x27;s a crappy little specification for a communications protocol. All we have to do is <i>do the work.</i> It&#x27;s not easy, and it&#x27;s not fast, but it&#x27;s also not some unknown, unseen force in the universe that we can&#x27;t comprehend. It&#x27;s a damn network protocol (and a simple one at that).<p>We know how to change it, and we know that the only thing stopping us is the <i>will to do it</i> and <i>cooperation</i>. Giving up on this change is defeatism and laziness. Can you imagine if in any other category of science or technology, researchers refused to make progress because &quot;it&#x27;s too hard to work with other people&quot; ?')
