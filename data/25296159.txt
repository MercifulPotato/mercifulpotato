If you can&#x27;t address what is important to me, then I can&#x27;t work here anymore&quot;<p>Google: &quot;OK, thanks for your resignation&quot;.<p>This is not okay. Google is &quot;technically correct&quot; - but it is appalling behavior that should make every Googler shake with discomfort.<p>Employees are people. People can get dissatisfied. Frustrated. Angry. Sure, you can say companies don&#x27;t owe anything to anyone because there is at-will employment.<p>But the reality is unless we want to live in a dystopia, people should be allowed to voice concerns and anger and frustrations, and not be fired for making things uncomfortable or inconvenient.')
