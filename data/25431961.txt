Just did a test with fast.com, and I had 370Mbps with VPN, 410Mbps without. Perfectly OK for me.<p>But as I alluded in my original post, since it seems like my ISP doesn&#x27;t do any monkey business, I mostly leave it off. I have specific services running in my network that use it, but my vanilla traffic is unencrypted from my router.<p>That said, even with no VPN I have a pihole backed by DNS-over-HTTPS, and almost all traffic (above 95%) goes over HTTPS or SSH anyway.')
