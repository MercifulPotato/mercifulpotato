Exploring, which includes backtracking, is the core of the web browsing experience so I&#x27;m not surprised people are doing that far more than, say, searching for a substring.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out there isn&#x27;t a great opportunity to learn the keyboard shortcuts Firefox provides.  Traditionally you&#x27;d learn shortcuts by seeing them next to menu items, but the menus are hidden behind the Alt key, and many actions simply aren&#x27;t listed there.  For example,  &quot;Find Again&quot; &#x2F; F3 is omitted.')
