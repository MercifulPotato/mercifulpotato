Lurked around and discovered and followed several accounts from various interesting communities. After a few months&#x2F;year you can pretty much know the feel of the community by following enough people from it.<p>Recently I was invited into one of those communities and I just used the migration feature in mastodon. Went pretty smoothly. I guess it went easier for me as I didn&#x27;t mind &quot;losing&quot; my toots in this new era. For those who need&#x2F;want to keep everything it maybe problematic.<p>My motto on modern web is: don&#x27;t get too attached to things you don&#x27;t own. You can&#x27;t own a community so you shouldn&#x27;t worry about losing it.')
