In fact, the scarce evidence suggests Covid might be a subject to Antibody Enhancement; that would mean that every next infection will get worse and worse. In any case, Coronaviruses have long be known to cause very short term immunity. Even more importantly, constant reinfection may debilitate the organism so much, that even a healthy person will eventually fall into the risk group.')
