It does not help that we are bombarded daily with variations of &#x27;our side is awesome and the other side is the devil&#x27;. With sufficient indoctrination, it becomes less about discussion, but about spreading the belief further. It practically becomes a religion.<p>The other day, we talked with family members and all I heard was slogans (the &#x27;energy independent&#x27;,&#x27;damn socialists&#x27; type ). And it is hard to talk about it, because you have to start by dispelling the slogans and that alone is an hour of deprogramming ( assuming you have receptive audience ). I gave up on that challenge.<p>And I feel like I failed there, because we DO need to discuss things. We will most assuredly not agree, but need to stop taking our news from one source. Diverse diet is probably the only way to go.')
