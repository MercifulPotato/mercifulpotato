There isn&#x27;t really a broad &quot;incitement&quot; exception to freedom of speech &#x2F; 1A.<p>It&#x27;s an out of context&#x2F;misunderstood quote from an old case. (And I want to say it wasn&#x27;t even in a majority opinion, or something similar, that made it mostly irrelevant anyway.)<p>Part of the reason being, no one can agree on what &quot;incite&quot; legally means. Which makes it a political question, in itself.<p>People hear what they want to hear. I personally don&#x27;t understand how anyone thinks that speech was inciting violence, unless they presume to think he meant something other than what he said.<p>That&#x27;s trying to mind read, not a legal standard.<p>Basically, I disagree: it is a matter of political diversity.<p>Even <i>discussing</i> the merits of executing someone, be it deathrow inmates or politicians. But the standards of trying to judge what&#x27;s a dog whistle is a criminal matter, not a censorship one.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying all speech, no matter what, should be left up in all circumstances.<p>I am saying there needs to be a presumption of good intention, and lacking some form of legal process (a la evictions), platforms should not be able to take pre-emptive actions without meaningful consequences.')
