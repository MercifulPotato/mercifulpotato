All the ones I can think of are arbitrary, unfair, or unworkable (raising interesting and difficult questions too, eg, a fun example would be should highly contentious politicians be first in line for the best healthcare due to their mass popularity or last in line due to mass condemnation?).<p>I think that people are happy to call me ridiculous but not actually able to say how we should be deciding who gets time from a doctor. I&#x27;m very doubtful of the alternatives, I suspect that many of them involve magical thinking that wealthy people are somehow hiding hundreds of doctors in their cellars that will suddenly appear and literally cure everyone&#x27;s ills if only the government mandates it.<p>There are a lot of problems with US healthcare. It costs too much, and there are too many restrictions that stop one person trying to help another. But the fundamental &quot;pay money, get service&quot; aspect isn&#x27;t something that is as easy to improve on as people try to believe. It is reasonable for wealthy people to get a much better standard.')
