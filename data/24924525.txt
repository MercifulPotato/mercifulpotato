Record Zoom calls with my mother&#x27;s closest friends? Edit that together with some punchy music? Match to a slideshow? Share on any service I want?<p>All that is both pretty straightforward and fun. If I hire Artifact to do this for several hundred dollars, I&#x27;ve essentially paid someone else to have the fun.<p>I may be an outlier but this inspires me to do something, not to buy something.')
