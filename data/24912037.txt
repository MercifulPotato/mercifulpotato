Item(by='evmar', descendants=None, kids=[24912569], score=None, time=1603833487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909878, text='Re a new version of inkscape: Ninja does not force fully-correct builds, so it&#x27;s on the author of the build.ninja file to either model this or not.  (This is part of Ninja&#x27;s objective of not mandating policy.)<p>To get this fully correct, note that you would need to model all inputs that Inkscape might read, which includes not only binaries but also configuration files or dynamically-loaded plugins.  Some systems (I think tup?) track this by tracing executed binaries to see which file system operations they do.<p>Even with tracing it can be really subtle: for example if a C file has an #include &quot;foo.h&quot;, creating a new file named foo.h earlier in the include search path is a meaningful change, which means a file-access-tracing build system also needs to track file-not-found results from previous executions.<p>(For C programs, also note that getting header dependencies correct includes similarly tracking all the headers in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;include that your program transitively includes.  See the -MD vs -MMD flags to gcc.)')
