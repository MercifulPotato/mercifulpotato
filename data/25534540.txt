More specifically, everyone is a WTO member and the WTO sets rules on how countries are allowed to control imports. You are required to grant all WTO members the same level of market access, absent a comprehensive free-trade agreement. This is known as the &quot;most favored nation&quot; rule.<p>So, the UK can&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t want to import German cheese. Once they allow any foreign cheese into their market, the MFN rule means they have to allow <i>all</i> foreign cheese into the market. Likewise, if they wanted to ban German cheese, they&#x27;d also have to ban cheeses from everywhere else. The only situation in which they&#x27;d be able to allow one country&#x27;s cheese and not the other is if they had a comprehensive free-trade agreement or a customs union... you know, the exact sort of thing that they just left.')
