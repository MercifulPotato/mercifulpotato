It is not the obligation of the accused to prove their innocence, it is the obligation of other parties to prove guilt.<p>So you&#x27;re looking at it the wrong way. The election, with all its established safeguards, is assumed &quot;innocent&quot; unless accusations of guilt (fraud) are proven. No significant accusations have stood up under scrutiny. The presumption of innocence stands.')
