Assuming the line is 1&#x2F;4 mile wide, it would have the same area as a city with a 5 mile diameter, so slightly smaller than SF.<p>I would like to hear the proposed advantages of the design. \nOne advantage that comes to mind is that the entire city could run off of a single transportation corridor. \nAlso a line has the maximum perimeter to surface area. Maybe this is relevant for expansion?')
