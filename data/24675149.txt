Writing your own stack will cost you a lot of time and is only advantageous if there is a big improvement in performance and that improvement is really needed. A bit like a software libraries and frameworks. If you write your application without frameworks you can probably speed up your application quite a bit. But it will cost you a lot of extra development time.')
