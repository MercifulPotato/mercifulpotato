It&#x27;s with writing to defend against the wrong audience.<p>Perhaps you haven&#x27;t been in academia, and haven&#x27;t experienced it yourself, but the author&#x27;s problem is very real.  Your intended audience will understand a point, and want you to go further.  But the referees are often <i>not</i> the intended audience.<p>Imagine trying to explain the value of a new type of N95 mask to an anti-masker.  You&#x27;ll be spending your time writing defensively to try to argue for the most basic aspects of wearing a mask, when you would really just like to go into details on what&#x27;s cool about the new type of mask, for people who actually care about better masks.')
