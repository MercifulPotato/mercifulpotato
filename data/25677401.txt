I am sure it is not too difficult to make a choice given the options.<p>And in addition to all of this, why in God&#x27;s name, if I did support your belief in a private corporation&#x27;s obligaiton to run a private enterprise as a public institution, would I try to protect the President when he has done everything he can to cause __the exact__ incidents that Twitter and Facebook are explicitly denouncing his statements for inciting &amp; supporting?')
