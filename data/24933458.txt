I get about 10 days off in a year, and rarely get interviews with enough frequency to schedule two on one day. In an ideal world, I&#x27;d let my current employer know I&#x27;m planning to leave, take that as an opportunity to let them wind down my responsibilities and prepare for a handover, and have a good reference for a full-time job search after leaving, but I&#x27;ll never be able to do that due to employer-tied insurance')
