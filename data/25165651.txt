Your comment roundly criticizes Symbolics for someone else&#x27;s work.  Only in the words it contains does it have anything to do with Symbolics documentation!<p>Unable to discover the affiliation of its authors (not stated in the document itself), I can&#x27;t tell where it did come from -- although it is hosted by several sites around the world, not just MIT.  It shows internal evidence of font character code corruption, typical in the 2001 era of moving a document from one kind of system to another, or even just trying to change font-set.  Note the prevalence of capital U&#x27;s where an apostrophe belongs, and the clipped text in the second &quot;competitive wheel&quot; diagram.  In fact, the diagrams show all the signs of being pasted in from an incompatible system: that wheel diagram is no longer circular, and the egregious box-and-pointer diagrams show the character misplacement typically exacerbated by PDF encoding.<p>None of that would have issued from Symbolics Press.<p>I may be a little defensive on the issue of paying attention to docs -- why else would I make a thoughtful response to a down-voted comment from someone with a history of them?  At Symbolics, I was pleased that my technical writer colleagues shared the same title of MTS as us developers.  I led the small team which developed Symbolics&#x27; document development system Concordia, and its document formatter -- which btw was contemporary with TeX and drew upon Knuth&#x27;s published paragraph and equation layout algorithms.  Also I personally inspected every pixel of every character (and all the pixels between) in every font used in Symbolics documentation.  In a side-by-side comparison, Symbolics docs would look superior to something from 1986 TeX.  One might see how even Prof. Knuth himself wished that Computer Modern had had the attentions of a professional font designer.<p>Finally, the paper itself explained that such in-house efforts were all of a piece with the rest of the company&#x27;s engineering ethos.')
