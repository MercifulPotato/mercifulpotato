Stories of &quot;security having relationships with those in quarantine&quot; make for titillating clickbait articles, but so far little more than rumour has been reported. We&#x27;ll see what the inquiry report says, but any poor practices in quarantine would have been sufficient to seed the outbreak, whether or not there was any intimate contact. But then it was also poor contact tracing&#x2F;outbreak management and aged care management that exacerbated things after that. So these things are always multi-faceted.<p>I&#x27;ve been paying close attention to the weather factor since the epidemic spread beyond China in Feb&#x2F;March. It was notable that the places that had the biggest outbreaks then (Milan, Qom, NYC, London, Madrid, as well as Wuhan itself) had similar weather in those months to what Melbourne has in winter - cool but not freezing, and not too rainy or humid. When I saw that, I immediately felt Melbourne could be more at risk of a serious outbreak than other Australian cities - all of which have either warmer winters and&#x2F;or lower population density (EDIT: and also more sunlight in some cases, influencing Vitamin D). Of course, if quarantine was better managed it could have been prevented. But I also find it hard to believe that there was not a single serious lapse in any of the hotels in any of the other cities that were running quarantine.<p>When weather is raised, people are quick to point out the warmer regions that have had major outbreaks, like India and Brazil. What these places also have his highly dense populations with many people living&#x2F;working in close quarters, which obviously also facilitates spread. Nutrition&#x2F;health may also be a major contributor.<p>As another commenter has pointed out, research has found Victorians to have higher rates of Vitamin D deficiency in winter compared to other states, so weather can play a role in different ways.<p>Clearly this is a highly complex illness with multiple factors that combine in different ways to influence the outcome.')
