On one hand I can understand the need to shrink code, focus on the core functionality etc..., but on the other hand X has e.g. &quot;xset&quot; and &quot;xbindkeys&quot; which can be used for all X-desktops (or &quot;Window Managers&quot; or however they&#x27;re called). With wayland each single desktop environment has to re-implement all that functionality =&gt; looks like wasted effort to me - the modularity (from the point of view of functionality) of X is lost in Wayland.')
