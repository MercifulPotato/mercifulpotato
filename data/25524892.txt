Otherwise horizontals would be substantially brighter than verticals, which looked awful.<p>We never knew why the VT100 looked better than other terminals; this is the first I have heard of the pixel stretching. Elegant design, for its day.<p>A more common trick was to have a 9-dot character cell with an 8-bit font ROM, and double the rightmost bit of each cell, mainly so that underscores would connect. Thus, most characters occupied 7 pixels, with 2 blank pixels between.')
