Item(by='_iyig', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606989773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25287197, text='Last I checked (circa 2017), bioplastics like PLA had poor heat resistance. This made them unsuitable for certain applications like bushings or gasket seals. IIRC &quot;heat resistant&quot; varieties of PLA are rated up to 120 Celsius, which is good for many applications but not all e.g. automotive seals, washers, and bearings.<p>Footnote: I was going to compare the properties of heat-resistant PLA to those of PTFE aka Teflon, since the latter is commonly used in heat-resistant applications, but after some Googling I&#x27;ve learned PTFE is not petroleum-based.')
