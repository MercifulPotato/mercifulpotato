Parents&#x27; time is bound to the school&#x27;s schedule. Many jobs inherently don&#x27;t cover this flexibility. Think construction, health care, public transit, education. It&#x27;s really a very large percentage of the population, but one that&#x27;s underrepresented on HN.<p>I have none of these constraints and in fact shifted my schedule by 2 hours without any problem. So it can be hard to see the very different reality and guard rails others have to deal with.')
