Like, I am fully convinced many marriages are not healthy and the appropriate thing for the partners is to end it.  But I&#x27;ve seen people end marriages that were probably perfectly salvageable, without even trying to really save it.  One bump in the road and they&#x27;re calling for a separation.<p>We&#x27;ve entered a transactional phase where your partner is supposed to show up perfect, well-adjusted and no work on your part for a healthy relationship is required.  Not working?  Ditch &#x27;em and try again.
