The very problem with the clinics you described - that&#x27;s the free market in action.<p>The problem here is that there is no way for society at large to send corrective feedback, &quot;holy shit you&#x27;re totally abusing the rules and what you do is immoral&quot;, and have it actually impact said clinics&#x27; behavior. This mechanism exists naturally in small groups, but money and scale destroys it.')
