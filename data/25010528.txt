Item(by='TuringNYC', descendants=None, kids=[25010688], score=None, time=1604692153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010281, text='&gt;&gt; Turnover in tech is extremely high and it&#x27;s not because devs are constantly being mismanaged, it&#x27;s because they are egotistical and capable of working independently and often just do without any real penalty. &quot;Oh you fired me, well 9 times out of 10 I&#x27;ll just be earning more money across the street, good luck recruiting anyone with a bad Glassdoor review!&quot; What incentives does the manager have to get invested with the devs in this situation when employees good and bad can just leave easily.<p>Let me provide a flip side to this from the dev&#x27;s perspective: Salaries stagnate for developers in the same company as valuable options in il-liquid private stock serve as golden handcuffs. Companies abuse this position by further underpaying developers as compared to the market. If they can &quot;make more money across the street&quot; that is proof of the situation. <i>Dont you expect developers to have some resentment to this situation</i>?')
