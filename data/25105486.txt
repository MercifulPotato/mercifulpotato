It&#x27;s not to everyone&#x27;s taste but openapi&#x2F;swagger solves that problem. The hypothetical conversation around the missing property is resolved simply by specifying what the API returns - if it&#x27;s not in the spec then it&#x27;s not going to come back.<p>Alternatively, it speaks of a dysfunctional dynamic between front-end and back-end developers, but no amount of technical solution fixes that.')
