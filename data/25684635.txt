Too many people here clearly bought tesla stock and don&#x27;t have the good decency to put their vested interest asside to evaluate this critically.<p>Yes it&#x27;s more expensive but that never mattered when it was about a tesla vs cheaper EV cars of similar relative markup, but more importantly it couldn&#x27;t use tesla&#x27;s charging network meaning it went faster, longer, which when that was applies to a tesla over say a leaf, was an acceptable markup, here for some reason it&#x27;s not...<p>How many more threads do we have to have pointing out the inherant and blatent stock price inflation of tesla before this bubble pops and people are shocked to find that it&#x27;s worth about what it makes which are as of now, niche cars with some very questionable dark patterns and an obtuse and irratic pricing&#x2F;valuation model. Lots of ifs and maybes but so far that&#x27;s it...just the cars and of questionable value at that.<p>If your first instinct was to poke holes in this when you were fine to defend tesla without reading the article you should evaluate why you are here to begin with because it&#x27;s clearly not to learn, improve, or help anyone else do the same. You might as well spend all day in &#x2F;r&#x2F;amd talking about how bad intel is or vice versa if you need a community to validate you blindly.')
