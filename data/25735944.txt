The ONLY reason &quot;insurrection&quot; was even close to being on the table is because of the delusional rantings of the President for the last two months (and everything leading up to that.. but that&#x27;s a different  discussion).<p>This entire election fraud thing is absolute insanity, and anyone who was paying attention saw this coming months before the election with how he was setting everything up to look like if Trump didn&#x27;t win- it had to be fraud.<p>So my point is, no one is trying to &quot;stop the possibility of insurrection&quot;.  They are trying to actively say: &#x27;I am not supporting giving you a platform to spout insane lies anymore, because it has and could cause real <i>measurable</i> harm&quot;.')
