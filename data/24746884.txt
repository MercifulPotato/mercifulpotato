Item(by='happytoexplain', descendants=None, kids=[24747939], score=None, time=1602433470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745996, text='&gt;This 24-year old mother was killed for arguing with BLM supporters<p>That&#x27;s a very biased description of this altercation. Regardless, it&#x27;s clear from the sparse and strained examples given in replies to the parent question (ELF, Weather Underground, BLM, antifa) that the difference is stark. The closest thing to contrary evidence is the individual you mentioned retaliating against the police, and yet even that most extreme example still illustrates the difference. The groups the president encourages are much more exclusively motivated by simpler, more irrational, ideologically-rooted hatred, and, critically, are <i>organized</i> around that tenet. They aren&#x27;t just angry protestors lashing out unproductively in response to an enormous injustice - they want to beat&#x2F;kill&#x2F;expel people for being liberal or minorities or immigrants or Muslim. They&#x27;re an explicit threat to society itself.')
