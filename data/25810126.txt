They are still crap<p>Hold on, are you claiming that the new scissor switch keyboards have similar reliability issues to the older butterfly keyboards?<p>If not, then this is really just a matter of taste. You can&#x27;t please everyone with keyboards. People do genuinely have different preferences regarding feel and key travel. It honestly seems hyperbolic to describe a keyboard that most people find completely functional as &quot;utter crap&quot;.<p>I personally love the feel of the older butterfly keyboards. I also think that Apple fixed the reliability issues with them in their last generation. At least, I&#x27;ve not had a single keyboard issue with my 2019 MacBook Pro or MacBook Air.')
