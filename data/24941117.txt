If you&#x27;re building a CRUD app I don&#x27;t think language performance is going to be the bottleneck. I think Rust looks awesome but as someone who uses multiple programming languages daily I feel like we&#x27;re too often looking for one language that can do everything rather than just picking up the one that fits the problem area.')
