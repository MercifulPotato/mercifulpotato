It’s on topic, and obviously not inflammatory. So you’re left with worthy of discussion... and you obviously are discussing it.<p>Put it this way: if this is worthy of a flag, why are you here giving soft opinion as to why you personally would ignore it, as opposed to arguing why it shouldn’t be allowed period?')
