An example I read (of which I am not sure if it is entirely accurate) was: &quot;if steaks become too expensive, its weight in the basket will be reduced because people are expected to buy more chicken instead. this results in lower inflation estimates&quot;.<p>If true, why do you feel a fixed basket should not be used to determine inflation even though it is probably what most people would expect in such a measure?')
