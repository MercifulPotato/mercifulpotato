Modern processors are extremely fast.<p>So other metrics like power draw get more prominence. Apple managed to get both with a chip design, but I don&#x27;t see it as a trend yet. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it innovative in itself, it is just a very good iteration of CPU tech. I think that is awesome because it challenges other companies again.<p>For performance intensive applications like gaming or CAD, GPUs have become more relevant.<p>There is a lot of special software for physical calculations (lenses, materials, etc.) that require raw CPU power for n-th degree numerical solutions, but these are niches that cannot sustain an industry.<p>My main device I use in private for a lot of development has a standard intel CPU and I only looked at power usage because I knew it would be fast enough. I wanted it to be as silent as possible. Turns out it was indeed fast enough for anything I wanted to do. Maybe I buy a new one in a few years, but it didn&#x27;t yet fail me in any way.')
