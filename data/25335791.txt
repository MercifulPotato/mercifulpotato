If you select a compatible Proton runtime, then you are able to launch the Windows game on Linux and it usually works.<p>I don&#x27;t have modern hardware but I&#x27;m easily able to play things like Mass Effect with Proton with no serious issues on an older graphics card (Radeon 7790). I&#x27;m not so confident that brand new titles would just work (even if I had a modern gfx card), but people tend to have good success overall. It&#x27;s really good.<p>In case it&#x27;s not clear, Proton is a Valve fork of the Wine project. The one problem I&#x27;ve run into is if I don&#x27;t have the right dependencies installed. I didn&#x27;t play any games for a long time, then went back and started playing some again, and through several `apt update` runs something had gotten out of whack; Proton is Wine, so you can still get into difficult &quot;what does this error even mean&quot; situations.')
