They aren&#x27;t anti-science per se. Education as it is currently done won&#x27;t really help much because it is not focused on what are actually persuasive arguments to these people.\nThe fundamental problem is that &quot;science&quot; in practice means trusting in scientific institutions. \nTo tackle anti-science you need to make the argument for why trust in universities and other scientific institutions is justified.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how such big heads cannot understand such a simply basic human situation, and instead they produce videos talking about the scientific method, as if Mr. average Joe is going to go download some papers and datasets and spend thousands of hours reproducing the results.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like free software. Why use it? Do you personally go through every source code of every application you use or do you just trust in the community? Now what if I spread a conspiracy theory that actually some big maintainer is injecting malware and other free software developers are in cahoots with him? You might think such a conspiracy theory is ridiculous but others might find it compelling.')
