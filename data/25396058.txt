Having said that, we currently have extremely effective vaccines (far more effective than our flu vaccines), so we have an excellent chance of nipping this thing in the bud before it becomes endemic if we act swiftly.<p>It&#x27;ll probably be at least a year before enough vaccine is produced that low-risk groups like children become eligible, so modified education in one form or another will have to continue till that point. This doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t go to school, but things like pods, wearing of PPE, social distancing, and other such things will need to continue till herd immunity can be achieved through vaccination.')
