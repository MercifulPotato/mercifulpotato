The statistical change from day to day would be less than 1% so it&#x27;s hard for humans to grasp a significant increase in cases.  If the daily cases were to go up by 10x (2000 daily cases), it would still show 881,000 negative cases.  If it went from 881,000 negative to 879,000 negative, should we panic?<p>On your site, El Paso is still at around 98% negative tests, which makes it appear like everything is under control when in reality the hospitals were mostly overrun and had to send patients outside of the county.')
