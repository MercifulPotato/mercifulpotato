You&#x27;re punished not for speaking what&#x27;s on your mind, but for planning to commit a crime.  (And I specified aggressive violence because self-defense is not a crime, and I think that stating &quot;I intend to defend myself with violence to the extent permitted by law&quot; isn&#x27;t a crime either.)<p>A scam is also a statement of intent to carry out a crime—fraud, specifically.<p>With spambots, and also with what I&#x27;m guessing &quot;abuse&quot; refers to, it&#x27;s more like harassment or stalking.  You want to be able to say &quot;I should be able to walk through this space without being constantly followed by people who are deliberately doing so and ignoring my requests to stop.&quot;  That depends on exactly what &quot;this space&quot; is—if you own the space, then of course it&#x27;s up to you, if your harassers own the space, then of course it&#x27;s up to them, and if it&#x27;s some &quot;public&quot; space, then it&#x27;s not totally clear if it&#x27;s owned by no one or by everyone or by the government, but at least in the latter two cases, it seems reasonable for &quot;everyone&quot; or the government to have rules against harassment and stalking (and I&#x27;m saying spam is low-level harassment).  Facebook seems to be attempting to act like a &quot;public space&quot; in this regard, though not in all regards.')
