When these systems go offline, they’re nearly useless.  One WiFi glitch and the system gives me the audio equivalent of a blank stare.  This directly reduces the chance I’ll casually use voice and instead prefer my more-reliable phone.<p>2. Most systems haven’t figured out reasonable responses and are basically chatty and full of sounds.  Make it Unix-like (silence on success = golden)!!!  If I say “turn on the light” and you turn it on, I CAN SEE THE LIGHT ON so I don’t <i>also</i> need to hear a loud chime and some voice confirmation like “sure, no problem”!  The fact that I can <i>silently</i> do things quickly in other ways (e.g. phone) is another strike against voice.  Yet this is something they could easily fix.<p>3. Voice systems are not 100% perfect at comprehension <i>yet</i> they tend to babble out long responses.  This puts me in the situation of trying to shut them up for long enough to listen for my <i>intended</i> query.  Maybe they can improve this by erring on the side of fewer words in replies, with more pauses?  Not sure.')
