I wonder the same thing.<p>So far I assume (not in order): A) the &quot;American dream&quot; and doing better economically than your parents ain&#x27;t all it used to be, B) non-hispanic whites are loosing their majority status, C) mass media and the internet are more disrupting than the printing press was, D) greed, corruption, and other political inefficiencies, and E) the scale and pace of change are unprecedented.<p>Everyone agrees that lots of stuff is broke. Politicians don&#x27;t seem to be helping. We (the people) don&#x27;t agree on next steps. Some want to turn back the clock. Others want to try something new. Too many want to impose their view on others who disagree.<p>I assume we&#x27;ll figure it out eventually. Some cultures&#x2F;societies will have it easier than others.')
