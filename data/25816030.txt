Whether it be todos, links for later, notes, ideas or you name it, I&#x27;m always stuck with a cluttered inbox.<p>So I&#x27;m building Hitsnag, email shortcuts so I can just send the info where it will eventually end up ahead of time. Saving myself from future despair is something that makes Hitsnag so appealing for me to keep building!<p>I&#x27;ve always loved building ways to make things much faster than used to be, and this is no exception.\nWould love any feedback or ideas, and you&#x27;d make my day if you could sign up to the waitlist (you&#x27;ll get a discount).<p>Cheers!')
