Streaming, snippets (Vine and now TikTok style), vlogging, sports, episodic TV, movies, miniseries (Netflix), etc. EVERYONE is paying for OC video. It&#x27;s a strategic differentiator.<p>Most don&#x27;t. You need to have a nontrivial following on youtube to make <i>any</i> money, and a relatively significant one to make nontrivial amounts of money. Unless you get millions of views per day (YT, or tens of millions on tiktok), your only path to good income is external brand deals.<p>You can look into the tiktok creator fund controversies recently for this. Tiktok created a &quot;community fund&quot; that paid creators. Creators who joined found that their viewership dropped when they joined the fund, and they made less money than expected. Most mid sized creators left, and the going theory is that the largest tik tok&#x27;ers (your Damelios and Derulos) make the majority of their income from special deals that aren&#x27;t available to the average creator.<p>All of which is to say that funding for high quality content directly through the platform is usually not sustainable (see also: music streaming platforms paying pittances), so high quality OC is funded via specialized deals or other processes, like subscriptions or external advertising deals. So journalists are way ahead of the game there.')
