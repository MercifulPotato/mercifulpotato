When you breath in, a decently fitted mask sticks to your face, directing airflow through the filter. When you breath out, it&#x27;s very easy for air to get out gaps on the sides.<p>Frankly, I think it&#x27;s been a huge mistake to discourage valved masks: they&#x27;re much easier to breath in and more comfortable. Better to encourage the vulnerable to wear high quality, valved N95 masks and protect themselves, than worry about those same people infecting others.<p>My risk from COVID is something like 1&#x2F;50th that of my parents.')
