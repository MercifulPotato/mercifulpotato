The toolchains that I&#x27;ve seen so far all generate code for a static set of RISC-V extensions and that set of extensions become the target platform&#x27;s identity.  Sort of like we&#x27;ve seen variations like &#x27;armhf+gnueabi&#x27; before, except with RISC-V several of these &#x27;extensions&#x27; are pretty much mandatory to get performance parity.  The resolution of these ISA extensions is much higher than other architectures.  That&#x27;s part of the appeal, for sure.  You can design a Just Right RISC-V without wasting any power or area supporting features you don&#x27;t need.<p>But until or unless the extensions stabilize to a canonical popular set (maybe this has already happened, or is happening soon), I wonder if the extension soup will cause some to be hesitant to adopt.<p>Whatever hesitancy I am imagining is not holding back some super swift progress on all kinds of awesome RISC-V stuff.')
