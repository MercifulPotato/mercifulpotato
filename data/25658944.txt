Surprisingly simple now that I look at it.<p>Heck... I was going ask you to write it, but now I&#x27;m thinking this could be a fun weekend project.<p>I can see one function in that library:<p><pre><code>    bool convert(const char *from, const char *to, double input, double *output);\n</code></pre>\nNo need to make it more complex for starters. If you want to make an .hxx Boost-like class around it, that&#x27;s outta my league!<p>EDIT: markdown help<p>EDIT: added a status return instead of val return to check for conversion correctness (bool is newer C)')
