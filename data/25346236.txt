The rolling distro will be tagged at a certain point in time for a RHEL release, and you can still choose to use that state as your production base, and be locked at that tag. Presumably there will be a CentOS Stream 9 tag that you can use for production. The difference will be that CentOS will lead rather than follow the RHEL release.<p>I think the doom and gloom is a misunderstanding.')
