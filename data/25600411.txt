The issue is that keeping your money off exchange is far less convenient, which is exactly why most people keep their money on exchanges despite the risks. If the Bitcoin community in general wants people to stop getting hacked on exchanges, they need to provide more convenient alternatives rather than just continuing to say “keep your coins off the exchange” and blaming users who get hacked for not following this advice.<p>It’s a bit like recommending that everyone not drive to avoid dying in car crashes. This advice is strictly speaking true; the less you drive the less likely you are to die in a car crash. But it completely ignores why people drive and therefore most people won’t listen. As a society we’ve decided that rather than asking people to not drive, it makes more sense to focus on making driving safer per mile travelled. This is a much more effective strategy at reducing driver deaths.')
