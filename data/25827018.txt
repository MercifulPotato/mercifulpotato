Indeed, number theory has been exquisitely useless for a couple of millennia, give or take.<p>I feel you are one of those people that just hate category theory because they consider it too abstract and useless for any purpose. We get that a lot, from a lot of people. Still, since Grothendieck, categorical methods are absolutely central in modern algebraic geometry and topology, and this centrality is only destined to grow, because CT is the best theory we have to manage emerging complexity in describing systems. In my opinion, the approach of &quot;if it&#x27;s not immediately useful then it&#x27;s useless&quot; really will lead you farther and farther away to understand modern developments in applied mathematics.')
