Maybe I&#x27;m just getting this wrong, because I can honestly not quite wrap my head around this. This is such a big no-go, from a systems design point of view.<p>The answer is pretty simple: these problems are extremely rare, they don&#x27;t last very long, and they tend to have fairly simple workarounds. You seem to have a <i>principle</i> that any non-zero chance of being affected by a problem of a certain type is a complete deal-breaker, but most people when buying a computer probably just subconsciously estimate the likelihood and impact of this type (and all other types) of problems and weigh that against other unrelated factors like price.')
