But it assumes that you can perfectly distinguish the two, and gives you no tools for helping - indeed I&#x27;d argue that it makes those judgements harder by discouraging you from trusting your emotions. So either it&#x27;s no help at all (because judging whether your actions were virtuous is a morality-complete problem) or it makes you dangerously unable to detect any mistakes in your moral judgement.')
