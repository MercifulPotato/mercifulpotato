The project is C99 POSIX and MISRA compliant, which promotes portability, security and safety of the source.<p>I would say the target audience are those that spend most of their time staring at a single terminal and periodically need to jump into a GUI based application (e.g. web browser). There are many projects like this, but I am hoping to improve on previous ones by reducing the overall complexity (per the KISS principle) and improve upon documentation.<p>I am still developing my C programming skills, so all feedback is welcomed. =)<p>Enjoy!')
