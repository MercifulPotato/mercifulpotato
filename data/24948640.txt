Large amount of people with TOS also having frozen shoulder as a down the chain issue.<p>Have you been seen by a good TOS doc yet&#x2F;considered surgery? I have bilateral NTOS + left sided VTOS. I&#x27;ll soon be having a first rib resection (FRRS) and scalenectomy, possibly a pec minor resection down the line, with Dr. Dean Donahue at Boston Massachusetts General Hospital. Donahue is arguably the <i>best</i> surgeon in the US, taking in a large amount of cases that have already had a botched surgery and being able to give them nearly total&#x2F;total recovery.<p>There&#x27;s around 5-10 great surgeons within the US though, and this unfortunately seems to be a condition it which surgery is mostly the best option. As much as I absolutely despise Facebook, here&#x27;s two really great groups for TOS info&#x2F;resources&#x2F;top surgeons if you&#x27;re not yet aware.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;15231937182" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;15231937182</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;205345126171314" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;205345126171314</a>')
