Many people were not happy with this, because it would mean that trivial (and also not so trivial) fixes to make some demos, trackers or business software run were never applied. In particular they refuse any patches for the latter (probably scared of possible liablity).<p>Edit: Vanilla DOSBox is also unlikely to add support for more hardware (e.g. MMX or early 3D accelerators) because they don&#x27;t want to maintain it and it won&#x27;t be needed by most games.')
