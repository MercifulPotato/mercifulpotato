Maybe there are maybe there aren&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s tangential to my point.  But it&#x27;s clear that there are many racists in many societies.<p>But, again, that doesn&#x27;t mean that &quot;everybody&#x27;s racist&quot;.  They&#x27;re just not.<p>Neither does my point imply that <i>&quot;racism is a white invention or has anything to do with being white&quot;</i>.  You picked that out of thin air, not out of anything I said, because I never so much as implied it.')
