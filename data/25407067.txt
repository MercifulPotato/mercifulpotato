If there is no mask, you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>The TIs instead work on the basis of functions like from a programming library. Their equivalent might be a BASH shell with pipes. That is cumbersome on the first glance but incomparably more powerful. You can chain an arbitrary amount of functions.<p>I once finished a 3-hour exam in 20 min since most of the questions could be translated to a like 5-lines long function-chain that took like a minute to calculate on 10 MHz but were correct in the end.')
