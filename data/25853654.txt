Item(by='tshaddox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611187973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25853286, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re correct, why doesn&#x27;t anyone point at a famous portrait painting by a renowned artist, or a photorealistic pencil sketch of a fruit bowl and say, &quot;anyone could do that&quot;? These works might have very little creative effort, but people recognize they wouldn&#x27;t be able to reproduce such a piece, so they don&#x27;t make that statement.<p>The reason that people <i>won&#x27;t</i> say &quot;anyone could do that&quot; about something that is indeed incredibly difficult is simply because it would be a clearly false claim. I didn&#x27;t try to list all cases where people would <i>not</i> say that. I only explained what I think people generally mean when they <i>do</i> say that. Of course most people cannot do these supposedly &quot;uncreative&quot; yet difficult tasks like running really fast or lifting very heavy weights [0].<p>People say &quot;anyone could do that&quot; about things which they think are fairly simple to physically reproduce <i>and</i> which they think required very little creative effort. Physically reproducing a famous novel on a typewriter is relatively simple, but the creative effort required is clearly immense. Thus people do not say &quot;anyone could do that.&quot; Physically reproducing hundreds of pages of seemingly random text like &quot;asdfasdfasdf&quot; is roughly as easy as reproducing the famous novel, but certainly appears to require much less creative effort. If someone was shown a book with hundreds of pages of that seemingly random text, they very well might say &quot;anyone can do that.&quot;<p>[0] I actually reject this part entirely, because I suspect world-class excellence in all of these things actually do require a great deal of creativity and original problem-solving in honing one&#x27;s mental and physical states. Photorealistic pencil sketches, for example, presumably require no less creativity than photography, and photography is widely recognized as a creative art form.')
