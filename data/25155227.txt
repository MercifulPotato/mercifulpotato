It&#x27;s the same typing, whether you create styles in CSS or just class names in the HTML. Designing the first time vs changing it later is the action.<p>The rest of your comment seems to be ranting other issues. CSS can&#x27;t be split, that&#x27;s the point. It&#x27;s been tried often but it just doesnt work in reality and is part of HTML which also covers presentation concerns.<p>I don&#x27;t see what JSON APIs have to do with this. It&#x27;s not the most common case but it does actually mean you have an API to use without the presentation if you really want it, so isn&#x27;t that exactly what you&#x27;re asking for?')
