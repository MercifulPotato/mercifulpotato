Voronoy noise is used to put a landscape on top of it. The result is quite convincing. even if you use a bit crazy values for noise parameters, you can get arches and &quot;floating islands&quot; that remind of fantasy landscapes.<p>Any sufficiently complex process looks like randomness (that&#x27;s what we colloquially call &quot;luck&quot;). Therefore randomness (PRNG, coherent noises) can look like a complex process with enough trickery.')
