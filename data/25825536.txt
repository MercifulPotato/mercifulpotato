Many of the prices reported are &quot;all in&quot; service packages, but several also wouldn&#x27;t include these ancillary charges. Forthcoming price transparency legislation puts more pressure on hospitals&#x2F;insurance cos to quote these &quot;all-in&quot; bundles. On the Turquoise site, we&#x27;ll be representing all inclusive bundles with a checkmark + explanation that the provider has verified with us the rate is inclusive of all professional&#x2F;ancillary charges.')
