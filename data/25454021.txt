Any moderately complex piece of software is guaranteed to have bugs.<p>Yes, but if there is a known defect in your software, do you release or not?<p>To me, there is a difference between knowingly releasing faulty software or only after release discovering faults in the software. Unless there is no reasonable quality check in the software development and release procedures, because then you are not doing much better than knowingly releasing faulty software.')
