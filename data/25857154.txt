He is unsure what the best strategy is so he unwisely calls the local university, who send an engineer, a physicist and a mathematician.<p>The engineer makes a circle with the fence, declaring it to have the greatest area for any given perimeter length.<p>The physicist makes a straight line as far as the eye can see in either direction, and says that, to all intents and purposes, it goes all the way around the world and he has fenced in half the world.<p>The mathematician fences off a tiny one metre area around himself, and says &quot;I declare myself to be on the outside&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;fun&#x2F;humor.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;fun&#x2F;humor.en.html</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;dylanhat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;dylanhat</a>')
