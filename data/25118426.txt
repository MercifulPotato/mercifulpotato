Not everyone understands legalese. Not everyone makes rational choices all the time.<p>&gt; Does that mean everybody should suffer the consequences of an arguably unintentional side effect of the technical implementation of law?<p>Thankfully this is not law, but people should understand the things that can get them in serious trouble.
