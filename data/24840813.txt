This would have erased the distinction between the drives made at the HGST factories, vs. the drives made at other factories, since both would have just been &quot;UltraStar.&quot; It would have been a big detective job with every new WD UltraStar model to figure out whether it was &quot;one of the good ones.&quot;<p>Whereas, if some WD drives explicitly say HGST and some don&#x27;t, you can just buy the HGST ones.<p>(Very closely analogous to smartphones that have the same exact model name, but which vary between Snapdragon and Exynos SoCs depending on the precise model <i>number</i> that only appears in fine print in a few places. When buying one of these phones used, you often have to google the precise model number to figure out whether you&#x27;re getting a fast phone or a slow one!)')
