And it makes you log in with a Skype&#x2F;Outlook&#x2F;Windows account to install Windows 10 (maybe you can bypass it by avoiding wifi during installation?

In fact, that it does this at the operating system level is worse to me than it being done when I use applications that work by talking to remote servers because you simply can&#x27;t escape it. Meanwhile I can simply avoid Google products.<p>The HN discourse around Microsoft these days really just shows that Microsoft&#x27;s attempts to buy back goodwill with things like VS Code must be working.
