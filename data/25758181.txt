Problem happens when I have a discussion on a game account and want to reference something that I know because of activity in the other sphere. By linking to my real identify, the pseudonymous one has been identified. So, now I am careful what I say on those accounts, too, and I save my controversial opinions for in-person, offline discussions.')
