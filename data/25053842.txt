You dismissing the concerns as absurd was what I was taking umbrage with.<p>&gt; Life is full of quasi-moral choices like this.<p>Yes understand this.<p>&gt; You can choose to support hardware that supports your platform. You can choose to buy local rather than carrots flown in from South Africa; wtf Waitrose! You can donate your time to helping people hoping it makes the world slightly better.<p>I don&#x27;t wish to be rude but you are being so overly dramatic.<p>&gt; Not playing games that go out of their way to force me to run Windows is my moral stand here. I get that it&#x27;s not for you, and it&#x27;s not for a lot of other Windows gamers, and it might even be stopping the Year of the Linux Desktop...<p>The dramatic language aside. Yes that is your choice. However a lot of games at the moment require this, so proton as good as it is won&#x27;t run these games and that is a deal breaker for many people. Whether or not you continue with your moral crusade will make no difference to the current reality.<p>As for the year of the Linux desktop. It is never going to happen. I&#x27;ve been using alternative Operating systems such as Lnux for about 17 years. I&#x27;ve tried 21 XFCE, Gnome, KDE, Cinnamon, mucked about with windows managers and there is always some really irritating bugs that never get resolved and have been there for years on end. That combined with almost every Linux distribution kinda breaking itself as time goes on and requiring you to drop to the terminal to fix it (I have used many distros over the years).<p>&gt; But my view is this too shall pass. Trusted Clients are bound to fail, as they have again and again and again. They&#x27;re running out of options. Engines with action integrity checks are the future. And e-sports will move to the cloud because that just makes sense for everybody involved.<p>I doubt it. It is a good enough solution. These cloud based services have bunch of input latency which is just unacceptable. Many of the large games before covid happened over lan in stadiums, once covid is over we will go back to this.<p>I suspect with esports I think cheating will be discovered by observing replays at the higher levels. (this already happens in the speed running community).')
