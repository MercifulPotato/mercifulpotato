But I am a fulltime employee so it didn&#x27;t take long to realize of my mistake.<p>For very long chunks of time it could still make sense to me if I was to pick up a sidegig, like if I could save 10h&#x2F;week somehow. But saving 1-2h&#x2F;week, if you don&#x27;t make money that time, is not worth it (economically!). You might still hate the task or it has a high risk so you decide to hire someone to do it for you, that&#x27;s fine. But no more &quot;it&#x27;s less than my rate&quot;, if I&#x27;m not freelancing I don&#x27;t have a rate, period.')
