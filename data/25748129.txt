So it&#x27;s no loss that it&#x27;s gone, and it took far too long to deal with it. And just like I wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye for AWS taking down an ISIS recruitment site, I don&#x27;t really see any loss here.<p>On the other hand, do we really want a handful of unelected billionaires deciding what is acceptable speech - whether or not we agree with them? We talk about net neutrality, but shouldn&#x27;t we apply the same standard to hosts like AWS?<p>Overall it feels like a legislative failure - in an ideal world, we have laws applied even handedly to deal with this. But in the absence of political will for these laws, what should be done? I think we are better off without Parler, but how can we do that in an even handed and consistent way?')
