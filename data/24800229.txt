He went off to college on the West coast nearly twenty years ago.  He tried some LSD, which may have either activated and&#x2F;or exacerbated schizophrenia in his brain.  He never made it through college, is unable to hold a stable job, and still lives in his parents&#x27; basement.  Granted nobody knows for certain whether LSD did this to my friend, but every story I read about psychedelics suggest that their use should be guided and supervised.')
