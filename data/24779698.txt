For storage of power plant production they are not interesting, as their energy density is order of magnitude lower than those of batteries. They are too heavy and too big. This problem does not go away just by having room temp superconductor. It would have to have incredibly high critical magnetic field strength and be very cheap.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snf.ieeecsc.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;ieeecsc.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;CR5_Final3_012008.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snf.ieeecsc.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;ieeecsc.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;CR5_Final3_0...</a>')
