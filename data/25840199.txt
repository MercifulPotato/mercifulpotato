IPFS is a distributed CAS, so the address is the hash of the content (this can be verified by the client). Whereas the web focuses on &quot;I&#x27;m talking to who I think I&#x27;m talking to&quot;, IPFS focuses on &quot;I&#x27;m getting the content I asked for&quot;.  So, to answer your question, I think authorship is an orthogonal concern to IPFS&#x27;s focus, which is verifiably delivering the requested bytes.<p>All that said, IPNS likely bridges the content&#x2F;authorship gap you&#x27;re asking about.<p>&gt; A name in IPNS is the hash of a public key. It is associated with a record containing information about the hash it links to that is signed by the corresponding private key. New records can be signed and published at any time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ipfs.io&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;ipns&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ipfs.io&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;ipns&#x2F;</a><p>In this context, that key would be held by the author, allowing the author to publish different content by signing it with the key.')
