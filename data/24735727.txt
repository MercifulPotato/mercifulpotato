Item(by='jahaja', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602289389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735523, text='&gt;  Sure people can work less hours, but right now people choose to want more things - better healthcare, larger houses, more entertainment and choose to work more hours.<p>That has not been proven. If anything the opposite. I&#x27;m sure that a significant portion of the population would choose less time at work over non-essential consumption given the choice. There&#x27;s a reason that full-time working hours are always changed universally - having the leverage and the economic base to individually request part-time is a privilege. Furthermore there&#x27;s usually a disproportional economic punishment when one&#x27;s working hours doesn&#x27;t reach some &quot;full-time&quot; threshold, not to mention the likely social punishment like having a harder time to get promoted and similar.<p>People like to assume that people choose non-essential goods over leisure but for some reason they are never very keen on trying to prove it by giving workers the choice without undue punishment.<p>A good experiment could be to allow people to choose to whether they&#x27;d like to get their raise (or if lucky, convert the yearly bonus) in time or money, or perhaps some split.<p>&gt; but that&#x27;s largely due to government interference.<p>Only in the US it seems.')
