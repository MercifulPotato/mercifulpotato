But, words change in meaning over time, and I have only ever heard &quot;accoutrements&quot; being used metaphorically in this way, and so &quot;accompaniments&quot; didn&#x27;t seem to match the linguistic milieu present today.‡<p>‡ I don&#x27;t know if there is a term that means what I am intending by &quot;linguistic milieu present today&quot;, and that&#x27;s the best guess I came up with that sounded good and somewhat conveyed the concept. To precisely describe what term I&#x27;m thinking of, I need to lay a baseline.<p>Language change is something that has happened, will happen, and is happening now. [0] Given that that is the case, there exists a relationship between time and language change, and thus, specific languages and time. The language <i>as being used</i> (&quot;sending&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; both happening), not the language as described by teachers&#x2F;books on that language.<p>The concept I mean above, that I tried to describe as &quot;linguistic milieu present today&quot; is, &quot;the current state of The English Language As Actually Used By Speakers&#x2F;Writers, and Not Necessarily The English Language As Taught&#x2F;Described In Books&#x2F;Schools&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Language_change" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Language_change</a>')
