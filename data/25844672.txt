Realise you&#x27;re lucky to be in this position to work from home, as opposed to medical staff and being depressed is a luxury.<p>2. You are not a code machine, amount of code written is not a good measure of how productive you are. Better think of how much you contributed overall or learnt something new that year.<p>3. Your work is not your life, so focus and even obsess over other things such as hobbies and spend more mental energy on that rather than worry about your job. Your job just pays the bills nothing more.<p>4. Find online ways to socialise such as playing online games. If you&#x27;re introverted that should be enough to satisfy your social needs.')
