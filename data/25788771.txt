You simply have a choice. I&#x27;m not sure you have as much choice in Amish society, and I think the lack of choice is cruel.<p>If my elbow is broken, I can&#x27;t cook efficiently. If it doesn&#x27;t work correctly, same. If walking to the toilet saps my energy, I shouldn&#x27;t be expected to do the same.<p>I should also now mention that elderly doesn&#x27;t mean you are sick. Loads of folks are busy throughout old age. &quot;sick&quot; doesn&#x27;t always mean you can&#x27;t do anything, either, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the Amish communities take care of folks that can&#x27;t.')
