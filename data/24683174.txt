As this paper indicates, there may be more cases in HPC that can efficiently leverage small matrix multiplication instructions. This might be particularly so as NVIDIA ampere claims to have extended support to single precision, instead of just precisions of interest to the machine learning community.<p>[1] Tensor cores is a poor name, likely from marketing, as the units really only compute fixed, small matrix sizes.')
