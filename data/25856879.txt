I&#x27;m sure I could have made a more secure choice overall, but at what cost?<p>Also, how relevant are articles like this if they&#x27;re not kept up to date?  Most people will just see the summary, and say &quot;it&#x27;s not worth changing to Firefox because it&#x27;s only slightly ahead of Chrome, and I&#x27;ll lose feature X, Y and Z&quot;.  This seems damaging to the overall idea of privacy, to me.')
