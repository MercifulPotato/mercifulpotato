With that said, I&#x27;ve picked up enough just by growing up with Commodore, DOS, Linux, etc. to at least have the basic understanding needed to research or just figure out solutions to most common problems.<p>I work in media production and IT in an educational setting, and while I&#x27;m far enough along the Dunning-Kruger graph to know just how little I know, the sort of things I see from students (grad and post-doc at that) definitely give me pause sometimes.  Often, the mention of basic things like how to change a setting or search for a file in MacOS or Windows is met with glazed eyes or signs of discomfort.  Apologies for how &quot;I&#x27;m not really tech savvy&quot; follow talk of anything more complex than pointing at pictures on a screen or doing something outside of the web browser.<p>And yes, I do understand that the very nature of these students&#x27; specialization in other fields can mean they haven&#x27;t had the need or opportunity to learn much about computing.  I just feel like I only picked it up because it was how you got things done or because it was there for poking and prodding when I got bored or curious.<p>I think in the end it&#x27;s not just that I have a personal connection to computing and think everyone should share my interests.  It&#x27;s more akin to a basic competency that opens a lot of doors and prevents you from being taken advantage of.<p>My analogy is usually along these lines:  if your job requires you to drive a car, you don&#x27;t need to be a mechanic or be able to build a car...but you should at least know the basics of how to operate and maintain a vehicle beyond just gas pedal, brake pedal, and wheel.')
