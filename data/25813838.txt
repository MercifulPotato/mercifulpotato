I&#x27;m asking the question below sincerely, not to start an argument.<p>Is there a plugin in VSCode to:<p>1. Read, write and send emails?<p>2. Have an org mode like system where I can do TODOs, as well as link to things in other aspects of VSCode (e.g. link to an email - something I do routinely)?<p>2b In general, how easy is it to interconnect the different plugins? If I have a plugin to handle email, and another to do TODOs, can I quickly write something that will read an email, and then go and add a TODO in the appropriate section of some document based on the contents of that email?<p>3. Use it as a window manager<p>4. Use it as a file manager')
