The &quot;overton window&quot; is a <i>description</i> of a consensus, not a model; ie., there is nothing <i>of</i> the consensus which is like a dial to be moved.<p>The reason that people view X as possible is the latent preferences around X, incentives and institutional practices, and their (essentially rational) judgement about the practicalities and possibilities of X.<p>Eg., Marxism isn&#x27;t &quot;outside the overton window&quot; by some weird dialogue exclusion. Ironically, it is only in the conversation because of &quot;overton thinking&quot; ie., hype.<p>It is outside the window because peoples preferences, incentives, and institutional practices are <i>overwhelmingly</i> oriented away from Marxism; which has no practical or evidentiary basis. No social mechanism of implementation. No group of people have the incentives, <i></i>reasons<i></i> and power to implement Marxism.<p>Activism cannot &quot;move the overton window&quot;. It provides no reasons, incentives, or power. It changes no institutional practices; it offers no evidence.<p>&quot;Hype activism&quot; frequently does more harm than good, by reinforcing the status quo.')
