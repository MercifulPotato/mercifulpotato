It&#x27;s not clear to me what the differences are, maybe someone else in this thread will know. :)<p>&gt; Why not hide it a bit by letting the implicit copy to happen to simpler structures ?<p>This is the Copy trait.<p>&gt; Why no love for inheritance<p>There are a variety of reasons, but one interesting one is that inheritance and strong type inference have issues, and we have very strong type inference. Beyond that, there are various other reasons, but what it really comes down to is that there&#x27;s just not a ton of pressure to actually implement it; it&#x27;s not enough of an impediment for Rust users to justify adding it. Most requests come from people who do not write Rust, and once people get into Rust and how it works, they don&#x27;t seem to need it much anymore.<p>This is of course very general and there are some people who love it and want it badly anyway, but &quot;some people exist who want this feature&quot; is not enough to make it happen. Rust already has a lot of features, and some people say too many. We have to be careful here.<p>&gt;  Why no love for global&#x2F;static variables ?<p>What does &quot;love&quot; mean? Rust absolutely supports these.')
