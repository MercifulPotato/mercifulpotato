That&#x27;s 16k Gbps.<p>Typically when you mention a frame rate in the context of a processor performance, you care about throughput, not input data transfer bandwidth. Max data transfer bandwidth can limit max throughput, but usually not in the first layer. For example, a standard benchmark is Resnet-50 Imagenet frame rate.')
