But the BBC Micro used a lot in education is probably what you should really be comparing the Apple ][ to. It was better than the Apple ][ in many ways. It had most of the features, but it had some really innovative stuff. Not least the Tube - that allowed a co processor - but could be anything. The BBC Micro was 6502, but the Tube allowed Z80 so you could run CPM. It was also the tool that Acorn apparently used developed the ARM processor prototypes.<p>The main issue with the Apple ][ was that it stayed more or less the same for its entire life, and the way is was got dated. The difference between the PET and the C64 is that the design evolved (but the basic fabric was pretty similar.) I know there was the Apple 2 GS later, but that was a lot later and probably a little too late.<p>IMO the European computer scene was very different from the US, and in many ways more advanced. Because there was constant innovation and competition. That drove things forward, and affected the US computer manufacturers indirectly as they wanted to sell in to this market. So we had all the US computers (Commodore, RadioShack, Atari, TI etc), but also (at least in the UK) Sinclair ZX80&#x2F;ZX81&#x2F;ZX Spectrum (TS1000 and most other Timex machines were based on this range), Tangerine Oric 1&#x2F;Atmos, Amstrad CPC&#x2F;PCW&#x2F;NC, Camputers Lynx, Dragon 32&#x2F;64, Enterprise 64&#x2F;128, Grundy Newbrain, Jupiter ACE, Memotech MTX range, Acorn Atom&#x2F;BBC&#x2F;Electron&#x2F;Archimedes (latter, for which they invented and used the ARM processor). Our 80&#x27;s 8bit journey was rich and varied.')
