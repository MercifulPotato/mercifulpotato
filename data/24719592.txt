There seems to be plenty of &quot;Heterogeneity in contact structure&quot; studies done on many other things out there, so it looks like this is something that&#x27;s already understood. If I understand it correctly, it means that most people have limited contacts, and while we all might be &quot;6 degrees&quot; from everyone else, we&#x27;re not directly contacting all those people, and so that could help with herd immunity. So that maybe reduces the number from 74% to this 34-47% number, which better.<p>Does that mean &quot;Heterogeneity in contact structure&quot; is different for people based on things like how often we go out, where we go, how we travel and where we live? e.g. a subway&#x2F;bus trip in Manhattan, NY is different than driving alone in Manhattan, KS.')
