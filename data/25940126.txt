Interesting listening to their snippet of the recording and Fuller is talking about problems getting enough houses for people.<p>I’d be very interested to listen to more of these recordings. But this:<p>“The Fuller wire recordings can now be streamed in the Special Collections reading room at Green Library.”<p>You mean to tell me I’ve got to physically go to a library at Stanford to listen to this? Even the sample audio is an unlisted video. That YouTube channel doesn’t have the rest of the recordings. Disappointing. Perhaps I am misunderstanding but it seems the preservation was funded by a donor yet Stanford is keeping the recordings for those with the privilege to listen on site. Is that correct?')
