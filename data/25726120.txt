There will be even more emphasis on decoupling code from the hardware it runs on. A shift toward functional programming could be a good fit for this. There will also be more virtualization in general and hopefully better interoperability. As the cost of developing custom ASICs continues to drop, there will be more malicious hardware to contend with, rather than just malicious software running on commodity hardware.')
