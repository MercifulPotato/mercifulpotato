The one thing that has dissuaded me from applying is the &quot;tours&quot; aspect whereby the position is temporary. I&#x27;m not as into the Silicon Valley constant job-hopping thing. I&#x27;m more into gaining a depth of knowledge in each project I work on rather than skipping around and not feeling ownership.')
