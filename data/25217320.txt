I&#x27;ve always imagined or believed that science was founded on testability? If it &quot;fits&quot; the model but it isn&#x27;t directly testable, that passes the sniff test?<p>4+x=9 -- there are a lot of options for x, some much more convoluted than others, and a lot more impractical, and I guess all mathematically &quot;viable&quot; (?) But when it comes to physics, shouldn&#x27;t it be more connected to reality than that?')
