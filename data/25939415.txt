Would be awesome to hear how they are doing the scaling. Our IT only offers jitsi only for max 10 ppl in a room which keeps us from using it at least in 50% of the cases. Also some users are reporting problems, so it would really be great to see a supported desktop app for all relevant platforms for those that struggle to get the  browser  setup right. Also native performance background effects has become something that at least could support bits of privacy in this crazy home office world ( it is not always e2ee that makes the difference).')
