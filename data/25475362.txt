It is clearly a compromise, as it does not attempt to reform &#x27;sale of rights&#x27; nor does it place works into the public domain until fifty years after they&#x27;re created, but it explicitly neutralizes the ability to perpetuate and renew copyright through inheritance, transfer, or inclusion wrapping, while protecting against hacks such as modifying the law (as Disney likes to do), since those modifications could only affect future works, per the immunity clause.<p>&quot;When this law takes effect, the following terms are irreversibly assigned to all past and future copyrights, and in case of contradictions, these terms have ultimate precedence over all past and future declarations: Copyrighted works enter the public domain in the sooner of ten years after the death of all persons identified as creators of the work, fifty years after the creation of the work, and fifty years after the registration of the work; those works where no persons are registered as the creators shall enter the public domain in the sooner of ten years after the dissolution of non-person entities registered as the creator, thirty years after the creation of the work, and thirty years after the registration of the work.&quot;')
