What&#x27;s the top 10% in Big Finance? I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s far lower number compared to that. So it&#x27;s not apples to apples comparison. If you compare what top 10,000 FAANG engineers make 10 years into their careers vs what top 10,000 finance folks make 10 years into theirs, I&#x27;m pretty sure FAANG will come out ahead.')
