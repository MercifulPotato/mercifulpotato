It is my home and my network.  I can choose to protect my guests and they can choose to get a VPN.  I would not subject them to my ISP&#x27;s DNS, nor would I subject them to centralized DNS.  Both are equally dangerous in my view.  I would always disclose to my guests what they are using, how to use it and what choices they have.  The people implementing DoH in the browser are taking that choice away, so now my only option is to play the never ending game of whack-a-mole with the centralized DoH servers.')
