Model United Nations is one thing, &#x27;give a two minute speech on a topic of your choice, and we&#x27;re going to grade your slide deck&#x27; is another. Extra-curricular things like toastmasters and Model UN and things like apprenticeships, internships and co-op are ways of acquiring more real experience earlier, not a replacement for real experience.  Sadly, programs that provide that sort of experience are among the first casualties of budget or other pressures.')
