From what I could tell, it was very successful (often sold-out, and anecdotally the workers told me that it was the most popular new thing they&#x27;d seen in a long time). For my family, we went from not having eaten McD&#x27;s for years to getting it occasionally.<p>However, they stopped it suddenly. So the fam now goes to A&amp;W since they have Beyond.<p>Anecdotal evidence that doing meatless right in fast food can be a driver of growth, higher margins, and bring back a key demographic that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t dream of setting foot in there.')
