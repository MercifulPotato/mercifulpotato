A stock market is just a highly organized kind of secondary market. How many VC investors there would be if they could never sell, or if they could only sell at prices which were random? Without a secondary market all investments would be permanent and that would make investing much less attractive.<p>Secondary markets also provide important capital allocation benefits. They make it easier for good companies to raise additional capital (e.g. via a rights issue) or buy other businesses (using their shares). They also provide an important benchmarking role allowing non-listed companies to price transactions on the basis of listed company valuations.')
