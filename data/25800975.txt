I am of the opinion that we should have a democratic government that is able to spend some of their citizens money on projects deemed worthwile.<p>This is how public schools are funded in my country and I like that we fund them like this instead of private schools with fees that would exclude some families.\nThis model of funding works for a lot of public infrastructure and I doubt individual donations would make up for that.\nI think it is critical for this public funding to be under democratic control. Otherwise it is definitely unjust.\nIn the end I think public funding &#x2F; taxes is a way to bypass the tragedy of the commons (not sure if that is the right term here).')
