After purged the CSS file is really, really small.<p>2. Hopping into all of my projects and not having to remember new class names.<p>3. Not having to come up with new class names.<p>4. Not worrying about making a change in a class and having unintended consequences.<p>5. Not skipping back and forth between HTML or CSS files.<p>That said, if you don&#x27;t dig it, there are plenty of other great frameworks, naming conventions and approaches that people use. Or start from scratch and roll your own.<p>For frameworks I flirted with InuitCSS for a bit. It&#x27;s pretty nice and after digging through the code I realized it&#x27;s not as complex as it first appears.<p>I also like Andy Bell&#x27;s approach with Cube CSS.')
