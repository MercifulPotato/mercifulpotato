It had two purposes, the first was an introduction to the basics of the more specific modules available from your chosen modules in senior cycle (Accounting, Economics and Business). The second was to cover personal financial details, so it covered household budgeting, pensions (at a shallow level, e.g. defined benefit vs defined contribution and employer contributions never came up, because most students were not going to be in a job where they had much choice), how taxes are calculated (but not how to file returns, thats mostly only a concern for self employed people) and consumer rights. There was also a brief sole trader vs coop vs limited company overview, but my understanding is the senior cycle business module covered this in more detail.<p>If you then went on to do economics for senior cycle, bonds, equity and futures were covered.<p>IRA was more a discussion for the history classes however (the different meaning in the US leads to bemusing alternative reading of US ads for Irish people)')
