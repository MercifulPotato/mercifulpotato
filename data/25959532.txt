Do you believe the market is entirely rational and depends on the underlying fundamentals of a company? Or do you believe that the stock market is ultimately irrational and trades solely on hope and fear?<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t see how anyone can disagree that the market is entirely irrational and solely emotionally based, and the reason is because humans are irrational and emotionally based. We rationalize our positions <i>after</i> we&#x27;ve taken them, not before, I&#x27;m totally convinced of this, mostly thanks to Sam Harris, and to a lesser degree, Richard Dawkins.<p>We want to believe that we logically poured over the facts and figures and we arrived at the only inescapable conclusion possible. Were that true, <i>everyone</i> would arrive at similar conclusions. Despite what some people have said the past several years, there are no such thing as &quot;alternative facts&quot;. A thing is either true, false, or unknown.<p>Smarter people than I have made cases on both sides of this argument, but for me, I see it happen every day, all the time, all around me. I watch it happen in finance. I watch it happen in book publishing. I watch it happen in development. I, for one, am a believe in what I call the &quot;emotional market hypothesis&quot;. Hell, Tesla is a perfect example. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason for a stock to be trading at 1660 times its earnings, but Tesla is. That&#x27;s its Price-To-Earnings ratio right now. The stock is fueled by hope. Elon is the personification of that hope, for better or worse.')
