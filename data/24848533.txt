If you&#x27;re talking about spinning rust, this is precisely the job of some particularly niche sysadmins (the kind that manage storage clusters) to know. I&#x27;m not one of them, but a quick search produces this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverfault.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;13839&#x2F;does-orientation-affect-hard-drive-lifespan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverfault.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;13839&#x2F;does-orientation-aff...</a><p>The easier answer I&#x27;m comfortable giving (despite me not being a sysadmin by trade) is that good storage software&#x2F;setups should abstract over and protect you from something like this, because SSD&#x2F;HDD bit-rot is absolutely a thing regardless of orientation -- if you&#x27;re not using a WAL-ing (ex. zfs) or checksuming (ex. ceph&#x27;s Bluestore) file system you&#x27;re exposing yourself to data corruption. Only thing left is whether you&#x27;ll actually have your drives long enough for them to exhibit complete failure from orientation, can&#x27;t know that except to test like Backblaze&#x2F;other providers do.')
