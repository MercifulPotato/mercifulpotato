I knew only 26 letters and maybe one hundred words. I had to bring up my language skill up to high school level within few years so I can graduate high school and kept my grade good enough in order to enter college. Retain vocabulary through reading is what works for me. It is difficult to remember words without context. Back then, I started with toddler&#x27;s book then progressed to young adult science fictions. I enjoyed the fastest progress with young adult fictions. I think what you created is very helpful for kid. I will try it out with my son. I am back to Asia now and try to teach my son English.')
