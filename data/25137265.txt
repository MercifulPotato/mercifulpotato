There is no reason to ever frequency-shift music&#x2F;audio <i>by an offset</i> (i.e. the same thing modulation does in radio, or multiplying by a carrier in the IQ time domain). The only frequency shifting we do in audio is by <i>multiplying</i> the frequencies (that&#x27;s resampling in the time domain), which is a different story.<p>100,200,400Hz is a consonant tone, while\n110,210,410Hz is a dissonant mess<p>AM doesn&#x27;t have this problem because it has symmetric sidebands and a carrier (so a tuning offset does not result in audio frequency shift), but SSB does. If you listen to an SSB transmission without your tuning being perfect, it sounds horrible. Voice sounds distorted, and music is hideous. I&#x27;m having trouble finding an example of the latter, probably because nobody dares put music through SSB :-) (but you can do this easily enough in gnuradio by upconverting a song with a 10Hz offset, for example)')
