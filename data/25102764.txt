Works out as over 1000gwh, you&#x27;d have say 10 hours to charge them so you could bring that down to 100gw. Average electrical consumption in the UK is about 30gw. I appreciate it&#x27;s a gross over estimate as most cars won&#x27;t do nearly that many miles every day.<p>Average mileage in the UK is typically around 10k miles. A 40kw battery nets somewhere around 200 miles, so needs to be fully charged perhaps once per week on average. That cuts the above significantly but it&#x27;s still of the order of the UK&#x27;s current average consumption.')
