There is not one in your description...slowing down productivity because the code base is &quot;ugly&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it. A future where it is hard to change the code only happens if the busines survives and grows to the point where that&#x27;s a problem...and if the company really grows well, then even a pretty code base will probably get chucked when the new problems that only come with scale dominate. Good luck.')
