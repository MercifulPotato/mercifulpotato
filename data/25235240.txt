I mean, it&#x27;s not a copyright violation if those copies of Stuffit were licensed and not pirated. Is it some kind of shrinkwrap license violation to put it on a VM that accepts jobs from the public online? I dunno. Probably not? Does it seem likely that a company that no longer makes software for this format is going to come after someone for providing a translation service online for a pretty niche hobbyist audience, that they are charging no money for? Doesn&#x27;t seem very likely to me, I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d do that.')
