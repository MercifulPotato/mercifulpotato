I learned to navigate e-bay&#x2F;amazon and find reasonably priced official batteries, but even those may come degraded, because they loose capacity even while stored at warehouse. I would love to find a reliable custom Li battery shop which would make a battery to fit dimensions and maybe even move controller board from old pack to new one -- for laptop batteries, for tablet and phone batteries too.')
