Item(by='Legion', descendants=None, kids=[25156268], score=None, time=1605829343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135470, text='I&#x27;m all for archival, but &quot;help us access these files in the future even though people aren&#x27;t bothering with accessing them now&quot; is an odd request.<p>The time to access those files and migrate them into more durable and supported formats is right now. Or 5-10 years ago for that matter.<p>&gt; In a perfect world, someone would write a Mac emulator that lets you emulate a High Sierra Mac on Apple Silicon hardware, just like SheepShaver lets you emulate a PowerPC Mac on Intel hardware.<p>OR... or... there are computers other than Apple&#x27;s. Computers which could be used to emulate an x86-64 Mac without having to deal with ARM translation because they&#x27;re x86-64 based themselves.<p>The author&#x27;s viewpoint is so Apple-centric that the idea of this digital archaeology happening on something besides Apple hardware didn&#x27;t even enter the picture.')
