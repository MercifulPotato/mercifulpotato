In the past I have spent years mostly developing and implementing new algorithms, where appropriate using graph representations.  I&#x27;ve also spent months at a stretch on low level performance tuning.<p>I don&#x27;t find python beautiful; it&#x27;s a functional glue language and I don&#x27;t hate it.  It has an ok REPL and some quirky design choices.  It has a decent C interop which makes it practical.  What makes it useful for data analysis is the large number of packages and staggering number of person-years that have been put into them.   The greater python community is great. The language is ok. Together that&#x27;s pretty useful.')
