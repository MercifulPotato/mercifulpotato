Randomly charging your bank account instead of credit card.  Holding money for 3 weeks for no apparent reason.  Most amusingly, I had some small amount of foreign currency in my account somehow I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  It was too little to convert to USD according to their system.  In the end I had to delete my account and agree to forfeit all my fractions of a dollar of money.  Their service is objectively terrible.')
