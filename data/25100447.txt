Fatigue, agitation, loneliness. It&#x27;s not entirely clear to me why you get these fits of agitation, loneliness etc. A lot of depressed people feel down about themselves - they feel like they&#x27;re worthless, no good, a failure etc. You don&#x27;t see yourself that way - which is good, but it also calls for more exploration into your predicament.\nThe fact you&#x27;re kinda already doing everything right (sports, relationships etc) is a sign you may do need external help as you yourself said.\nAn obvious thing that may be lacking by your account is a signifcant other, but in itself is not gonna be a cure for depression.')
