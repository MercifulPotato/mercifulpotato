Content creators can&#x27;t move off of youtube since it&#x27;s more of a discovery service than a hosting service and it has locked viewers into its platform - it doesn&#x27;t offer any way for dailymotion, vimeo, nebula, acorn, amazon, netflix, twitch or dlive to promote videos on their home page and due to their enormous market share content creators can&#x27;t survive on any of the other platforms.<p>And, again with respect to video hosting there are plenty of very valid competitors technologically - with respect to search if you secretly rebranded google to bing I doubt anyone except the most techie would notice a difference - they win in search because everyone &quot;googles it&quot; - they used to win because alta vista, ask jeeves, lycos and yahoo were all trash, but now there is legitimate competition.')
