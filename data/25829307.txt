Usually that’s more than 20 seconds but not more than a couple minutes for you to open the door.<p>If you refuse to open the door after a reasonable amount of time, the police are allowed to make a “forced entry”.<p>At that point, having to force entry into a house is itself an escalation and a violent act, and they would reasonably want to be prepared for any response they might encounter since the people inside have already indicated they will not come easily. Meaning it’s more likely they will draw their guns in a forced entry situation.')
