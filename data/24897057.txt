Actually, I still use this method, but do it a bit differently. I have a ZeroTier network setup to connect a VM and RPI for internal communication, then I use nginx with the stream module [1] in order to do SNI proxying down to the RPI from the VM over the internal ZT network.<p>Why use the stream module vs the normal proxy module you might ask? You can forward TLS connections down to an edge device without needing to have the TLS certs on the cloud server. This is especially useful so I can easily share the VM with other people without having to worry about if they can intercept my network traffic, while still being able to host other things on the machine. This also has the added benefit of allowing me to forward full wildcard subdomains down to the edge device without having to create a new config entry for it each time.<p>Now, I use (shameless self plug) sish [2] to set this up. It uses SSH, so I get the added benefit of all of the above, but I don&#x27;t really worry about using an internal network for ingress communication. It&#x27;s also very easy to share the service with friends&#x2F;coworkers so they can get the added benefit of it too. I also make use of the loadbalancing feature for test pi clusters when doing distributed testing which is a breeze now.<p>There are a bunch of these popping up now which I&#x27;m happy to see (serveo, remotemoe, even ngrok has a SSH gateway!) so there&#x27;s a ton of competition here. I definitely recommend checking at least one of them out since they&#x27;re pretty easy to setup and can be used in a variety of ways!<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stream&#x2F;ngx_stream_core_module.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stream&#x2F;ngx_stream_core_module.html</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;antoniomika&#x2F;sish" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;antoniomika&#x2F;sish</a>')
