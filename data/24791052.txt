After starting at one company however I realized the problem with this.<p>Regularly in meetings the head of HR (which they called &quot;People&quot;) would encourage us to go leave 5 star reviews on Glass door to help with recruiting efforts.  It was really spun as a way to help the company.<p>The problem though is that this company had some problems, things I would normally expect to see on glassdoor.  Because of the way they encouraged it, glassdoor was flooded with 5 star reviews that made it impossible to find any negative ones.<p>I no longer even check Glass door.')
