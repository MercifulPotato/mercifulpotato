Either they close this weakness by switching to one of the superior algorithms or they get exploited and become much less useable than their competitors. In either case, you soon have 9 search algorithms. Repeat this process a few times and you&#x27;re back to a monoculture. Best case scenario, you reach a stable equilibrium where a few different search engines are all plagued by different but roughly equivalent issues, such that none is good enough to beat out the others.')
