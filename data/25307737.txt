A common refrain against unlimited&#x2F;untracked sick time is that employees will abuse it to be lazy, and the only way to fix that is to either closely monitor&#x2F;track sick days used, or have a pool.<p>My point was that if performance is an issue there are ways to address that. And if enough work is getting completed, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many sick days were taken (so no need to track&#x2F;have a pool).')
