In humans, we often give life to new individuals. While the parents die and wither, those individuals give life to newer speciments on their own, and so on. So this relationship of the parent dying and making room for the child is nothing new. If an uncontainable superintelligence kills all humans to create paperclips, it&#x27;s sad but it&#x27;s our child&#x27;s doing. You, one of the parents, can of course blame one of the other parents, the programmer of that superintelligence for fucking up the goal routines, but that&#x27;s not a technical problem but a social one :).')
