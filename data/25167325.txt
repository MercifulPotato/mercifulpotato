A quick dictionary lookup in the moment will help me understand it then and there, but the time gap until I encounter the word a second time is large, and I&#x27;ll likely forget it before then.<p>A good approach is to use Anki to memorize words but only add words that you&#x27;ve actually encountered in the wild.')
