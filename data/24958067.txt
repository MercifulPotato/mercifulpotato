That&#x27;s how you would describe a construction that allows to do one full rotation and then stop. For example, tarsiers or owls can rotate their heads about 360 degrees.<p>But a windsock needs to be able to rotate over and over and over without bound. That&#x27;s distinctly different from 360 degrees.')
