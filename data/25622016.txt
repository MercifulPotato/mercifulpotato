I was very frustrated in the first weeks trying to correct my posture because I wasn&#x27;t seeing much results, but it just takes time.<p>Like you&#x27;re trying to undo years of bad posture in few days it&#x27;s impossible, your muscles need to gain strength, they also need to rest, and you will need to learn to do proper movements with the new acquired strength and muscle activation.<p>So I don&#x27;t think posture corrector doesn&#x27;t cut it, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re very useful in specific situations, but for the majority of people you just need strength and stretching.')
