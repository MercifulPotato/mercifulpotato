It would have required a public referendum to do so.  Now, it merely requires a legislative ultra-majority - improbable but more realistic than another public vote.<p>Also, please bear in mind that CA legislature has already exempted wide and arbitrary swathes of industry from AB5, seemingly based on each industry&#x27;s political clout.  While I wish for better worker protections than prop 22 provides, AB5 was bad legislature and implemented in a less-than-above-board way.<p>disclosure: I do work for a gig company, opinions are my own, etc.  personally I want all the workers unionized, everywhere.')
