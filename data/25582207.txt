If the vaccine produces anti-bodies for this protein, it could also lead to infertility in women.<p>I think the answer to this questions would be nice to have.<p>&quot;Several vaccine candidates are expected to induce the formation of humoral antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Syncytin-1 (see Gallaher, B., “Response to nCoV2019 Against Backdrop of Endogenous Retroviruses” - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;response-to-ncov2019-" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;response-to-ncov2019-</a> against-backdrop-of-endogenous-retroviruses&#x2F;396), which is derived from human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) and is responsible for the development of a placenta in mammals and humans and is therefore an essential prerequisite for a successful pregnancy, is also found in homologous form in the spike proteins of SARS viruses. There is no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS viruses would also act like anti-Syncytin-1 antibodies. However, if this were to be the case this would then also prevent the formation of a placenta which would result in vaccinated women essentially becoming infertile. To my knowledge, Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech has yet to release any samples of written materials provided to patients, so it is unclear what, if any, information regarding (potential) fertility-specific risks caused by antibodies is included.&quot;')
