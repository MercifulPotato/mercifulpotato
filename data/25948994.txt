Item(by='bityard', descendants=None, kids=[25950638], score=None, time=1611867032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25944757, text='&gt; Honest question: isn&#x27;t this a fundamental contradiction?<p>I&#x27;m glad someone brought this up. When a developer (or artist, or musician, or other creative person) gives away their work for free, that is fine by me. But when they later hold out their hat and say, &quot;by the way, I worked really hard on that and I&#x27;m a nice person, would you mind paying for it now?&quot; that&#x27;s when I feel like I&#x27;m being manipulated. If you wanted money for it, you should have just said up front instead of tossing the guilt trip in at the end.<p>I do appreciate Jeff&#x27;s enthusiasm for technology and he&#x27;s done some cool stuff. I would totally hire him for a consulting gig if I were in a position to do so. But he&#x27;s part of this &quot;give stuff away for free and beg for money later&quot; culture that rubs me the wrong way.')
