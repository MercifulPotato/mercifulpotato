OK fine - but doesn&#x27;t that just result in a meal costing what it does now + tip? How is that any different?<p>Actually, it would cost more than just standard price + tip as you funnel the money into the business first before it hits the employee&#x27;s bank account.<p>&gt; Right now I understand that we need to do our part to help small businesses, so I&#x27;m making an effort and tricking my brain into eating out by not tipping<p>This logic is absurd. Both small businesses and employees of small businesses are being crushed right now. Support them both or don&#x27;t use their services.<p>You deciding to eat out is consuming time from the wait staff (who often tips out bussers and kitchen staff too). That time could have been spent serving another table that decides to tip.<p>You are literally taking money away from small business employees by continuing this behavior. You are punishing them for serving you a meal. How is that appropriate?')
