I have 2 at home (mine and wife&#x27;s), but we almost never use them.<p>To me the tablet combines the worst properties from phone and laptop. A smartphone is great because it&#x27;s always with me no matter where I go. A laptop is ergonomic, powerful and easy to use. The tablet is neither of these things. When I&#x27;m at home I always prefer to use the laptop, when I&#x27;m out I don&#x27;t see a reason to lug around another device that&#x27;s almost the same as a phone, just a bit bigger.')
