But Lisps like Clojure address this formidably by integrating deeply with the JVM and actually also Python.<p>Im not sure his code is idiomatic SBCL but it could be written more succintly and functionally by most LISPers.<p>To the point on static&#x2F;dynamic typing, I disagree. But its a discussion thats been going on for so long that Ive concluded its mostly a matter of taste. For Clojurians who like static typing, Spec packs a big punch without removing flexibility.<p>Still, Haskell is pretty great but Im more efficient in Clojure, Your mileage will vary.')
