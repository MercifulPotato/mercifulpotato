Right now, whatever systems we have are all mostly boringly simple and probably won&#x27;t scale.<p>You acknowledge here that the systems you have may not scale. I assume you&#x27;re still trying to find market fit, and may end up heavily augmenting or redesigning these systems when you do. With that said, why did you prioritize spending your limited resources solving for multi-cloud?<p>I&#x27;m curious if the cost savings of optimizing cross clouds was worthwhile vs. the engineering effort &#x2F; constraints you introduced into your systems at your scale.')
