Item(by='Gehinnn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602711027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777640, text='Shouldn&#x27;t the process of hiring be more like an interactive proof system?<p>Prover (the applicant) and verifier (the hiring manager) are both interested in proving the applicant to be a suited candidate.\nIt should be in the hiring manager&#x27;s interest that suited candidates can act as valid prover that can convince the verifier!<p>With this thought, this book should be financed by both the hiring manager and the applicant. The hiring manager should help applicants to write good resumes. And the applicant should help the hiring manager to accept their proof of suitability.<p>Also, do you think this book will get more people a job (which would effectively create jobs and reduce unemployment) or just improve the candidate selection?<p>If it just improves the candidate selection, the rejection rate and thus the average happiness of applicants would stay the same (or even drop, as they paid money for this book) and the only beneficent would be the employer, as better candidates are hired.')
