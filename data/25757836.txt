There is zero chance that the military will stage a coup. None. If you don&#x27;t believe me, I encourage you to ask members of the military themselves what their feelings are on this.<p>The military is under the command of the civilian government. There&#x27;s no protocol for them to act alone. I don&#x27;t understand why we insist on telling each other these ghost stories about a potential takeover.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t matter if there were a few ex-military people in the march on the capitol, either. They&#x27;re not military leaders.')
