I had a really big problem with acid reflux a while back after I stopped drinking alcohol.  I visited many gastrologists and most of them offered little to no help, most only prescribed me drugs which was in my opinion not a solution.  I finally meet with a gastrologist that did an endoscopy and basically sat me down and said that if I wanted to get over my acid reflux I needed to eat really light over the next four months, no fruits, no tomatoes, no pork or beef only poultry, no fried food, no greasy food, and the list went on.  I did the diet, had a few cheat days because it was hard, and my stomach recovered.  After the four months I reintroduced certain foods and started learning about how my body reacted to them.  I also realized that I feel a lot better with a full stomach than with an empty one.  My point is we all have slight different bodies and that while studies are great, sometimes it just good to study yourself and how you feel.  On a side note, if you’re one of those people fasting to be healthy yet haven’t cut out drugs, alcohol and tabaco out of your life then do that first, it is the first step to good health.')
