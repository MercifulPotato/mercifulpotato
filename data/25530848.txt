But I don’t think that that’s actually a difference—it’s just a slight terminology change around “type” and “class”, which I think may have been related to tidying up old-style classes. (That is: yeah, if you’re comparing <i>old-style</i> classes, it may have been a difference (I’m not certain), but I believe it’s completely superficial once you’re comparing the recommended form of classes for the last quite a few years of Python 2.)')
