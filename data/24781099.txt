It literally had a blank page.<p>It felt over-engineered and they&#x27;d crow about speed improvements or some niche new whizz-bang feature or whatever for their new releases when I was there still just trying (and failing) to get what I feel is a totally fundamental basic feature working.<p>I also found creating a custom theme from scratch in Hugo quite complicated with archetypes or whatever they were called.<p>It felt like the project was more interested in the engineering challenge of the site generator rather than making something that is usable - after all directory listings seems like a basic feature to me yet it was apparently impossible without considerable fiddling around with _index files or other custom nonsense.<p>I am sure that if I kept at it and kept trawling the support forums and posting questions and hanging out on IRC someone could have helped me ... but life is too short for that and I&#x27;ve got things to do so it just wasn&#x27;t worth fighting with.<p>Jekyll on the other hand is super-simple and I was able to port entire sites - complete with a from-scratch custom theme + CSS - in under a day, and have them look and act exactly how I wanted.<p>I only picked Hugo over Jekyll originally as at the time I was a fan of golang, so I was not really that wedded to Hugo for another reason.')
