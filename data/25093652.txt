Item(by='Klinky', descendants=None, kids=[25093839], score=None, time=1605373828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093462, text='You probably shouldn&#x27;t inject Ketamine into someone who has suffered cardiac arrest or brain death after being forcibly restrained. I am not sure how Ketamine is at all a hero here, or helped provide an alternative to save Elijah McClain from excessive force by the police. If anything it may have complicated his chances of resuscitation, or possibly further contributed to his death.<p>Forcible injection is up there with taser and pepper spray. I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to be forcibly injected with an unknown substance.<p>When Elijah said he&#x27;s different, perhaps they could have asked how he&#x27;s different? Is he autistic, does he suffer from anxiety and panic attacks? Instead you suggest the only plausible alternatives to forced Ketamine injection is him getting his bones broken or 9mm bullet in his body. That mindset is exactly the problem.')
