In Germany, students are heavily segmented into tracks from an early point in their academic career, and if you&#x27;re not in the traditional &quot;college&quot; track, tough luck: it&#x27;s very difficult to get moved.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t know whether or not that&#x27;s a better system. Whether students come out with a degree or a trade, they don&#x27;t come out with debt. It&#x27;s trading a degree of social mobility for economic gains, but in the US you can find yourself left out of either choice.<p>As for cost, $40,000 is the typical private school. Absent the top tiers, there&#x27;s no reason to pay that price over a public University, where tuition in most states hovers around $10k per year. And if you do 2 years of community college first and finish up at a 4 year school, you can cut the average cost per year down to something like $7k.<p>Part of the student debt crisis are families making poor economic choices. Choosing the massive debt of a private school, or paying and extra $12k per year to live in a dorm &quot;for the experience&quot;. That&#x27;s how you run up $100,000 in debt before you even get a job. Don&#x27;t have the money without taking out loans? Stay local, commute, find friends that live on campus and crash at their rooms every once in a while. College is expensive partly because our society treats it as a right of passage rather than an educational experience.')
