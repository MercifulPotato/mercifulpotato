I suggest you to add case studies(if any) and more free insightful content which will support your claims.if you are new find clients you may already know, and later publish your findings.<p>for real example, I have really fair understanding of tech, grocery store management, accounts and in-corporation regulations(for india),a good knowledge about construction materials, adhesives and civil work. I want to start as an advisor for tech startups and a civil construction &amp;  adhesive consultation. I have good track of cases where my advice saved 10s thousands from my advice, I can easily start here with some good testimonials from famous clients.\non other side, for tech startups I must start from scratch.')
