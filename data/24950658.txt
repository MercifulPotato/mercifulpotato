Software with a much lower release cadence than k8s works well with Debian’s distribution model, but it falls down with frequent releases and a large dependency tree.\n I guess you’d see that with NodeJS applications as well - I don’t think it’s practical for Debian to re-invent NPM and try to distribute and ship the large and changing dependency trees you find in those projects. However that doesn’t mean the software is not _stable_, for the typical definition of stable.')
