I&#x27;m enjoying the graphics, they are beautiful to watch unfold, but bear little relation to the full range that is heard in the audio examples. Not in volume, or varying pitch. This technique seems to be a way of showing an aspect of sound via graphics that mean the two are unrelated in immediately meaningful ways. The word &#x27;Periodic&#x27; is mentioned, but that isn&#x27;t seen.<p>Still, great experiment, and interesting results!')
