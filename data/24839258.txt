Another was left scrambling for any job after his startup went under as COVID layoffs settled in, unclear how he&#x27;s doing now (he needs a job for his visa, given how many years he spent trying to do the startup, he is highly unlikely to get into a good PhD program now which was something he had wanted to do).<p>These are two people that I have immense respect for and who I&#x27;m sure did everything &#x27;right&#x27;; it just doesn&#x27;t work out for everyone.\nI think your personal sample depends on the people you know. I honestly can&#x27;t think of anyone in a worse place than friend #2 above (except for one international student with a visa problem but this would have arisen whether or not they did normal things or started a company). This is likely because the only people I know here are from the university I went to though.')
