I&#x27;ve found the exact opposite - teams that used an RDBMS had to throw away their customer data under GDPR, because even though they had an entry in their database saying that the customer had agreed, they couldn&#x27;t tell you what the customer had agreed to or when. Whereas teams using Kafka in the way you describe had an event record for the original agreement, and could tell you where any given piece of data came from.<p>This is absolutely wonderful! Unfortunately, this team decided to store data subject to GDPR deletion requests in Kafka, where deletion is quite difficult. It was a problem, when trying to do deletion programmatically, across many teams using the same set of topics.<p>The real nightmare came when this team, obsessed with the power of infinite retention periods, encountered PCI-DSS. You see, the business wanted to move away from Stripe and similar to dealing with a processor directly, in order to save on transaction fees. So obviously they could just put credit card data into Kafka...')
