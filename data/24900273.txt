I remember working on similar codebases 10 years back when J2ME games were still a thing (J2ME runtimes usually had horrible GC&#x27;s and some people really went overboard in trying to avoid them) and it wasn&#x27;t that fun at all (Even if the questDB codebase that is linked elsewhere in this thread seems to be saner).<p>Also JNI for calling C&#x2F;C++ code is fairly bad and error prone (if you want to combine code), JNA is better but i think this is one of the bigger reasons that Oracle is funding GraalVM is that it promises &quot;seamless&quot; interoperability and breaking up things into Java and C&#x2F;C++ parts might be a good option in the future.')
