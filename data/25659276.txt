You could add units to any number and then conversions are done automatically when you do math:\n(1_ft + 1_in) &#x2F; 20_s + 5_mi&#x2F;h<p>if the units don&#x27;t match then the operation was an error:\n1_ft + 1_gal =&gt; error<p>As other people have mentioned I really wish spreadsheets had this built-in where units are like formats for a cell. Ii controls about how you want things displayed and will prevent you from making conversion mistakes or doing illegal operations.')
