I get weird Adobe flashbacks about it, since it seems so heavily pushed by Haivision, and it&#x27;s really made for a different use case - it&#x27;s made for big broadcasters like ESPN and TV networks, not for web startups.<p>The current motion seems to be towards hacking WebRTC to accommodate broadcast ingest. But WebRTC is <i>really</i> huge and complicated and you only want a tiny sliver of it for this use case. Pretty much all implementations are buggy because its such a gigantic kitchen-sink design.<p>There&#x27;s also RIST (for those who love working groups) and Zixi (for those who love closed source protocols?).<p>I honestly think that something like HLS could do pretty well (broadcaster slices video into 1-second TS segments and just ships em with HTTP POST), but it&#x27;s not something I ever saw anyone do. Definitely doesn&#x27;t meet the TV networks&#x27; needs, but its really easy to scale and straightforward to secure, which is maybe more important.')
