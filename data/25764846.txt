This has existed a long time, so someone has to know something better than what I&#x27;m hearing this past year from schools that suddenly and unexpectedly became remote-only overnight due to the pandemic.<p>Homeschooling has a really terrible reputation -- which I tend to forget because I didn&#x27;t homeschool for religious reasons and those who do have something of a tendency to give the practice a bad name. So the idea that homeschoolers know anything useful gets dismissed out of hand and then a lot of homeschooling parents are the moms. Homeschoolers are often middle class families with a full-time homemaker doing the teaching and the world is really bad about acting like homemakers are all idiots who don&#x27;t know nothing.<p>I am out of the loop on this and have baggage over how I&#x27;ve been treated, so I mostly just shake my head and pass on participating in such discussions on HN. I don&#x27;t need the grief. But &quot;Homeschoolers know something useful that can be borrowed upon&quot; is exactly the point of my initial comment.<p>What I&#x27;ve read about remote K-12 schooling has been truly horrifying. I think it would be difficult to do anything worse than what I&#x27;ve seen described.')
