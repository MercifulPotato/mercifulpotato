Fuck you. I&#x27;m just going to crap all over your efforts, profit from it, and there is nothing you can do about it&#x27;.<p>Thanks Zuck. I&#x27;d love to see you sit down with some people I know who have spent their entire lives contributing to RFCs and actually building the open internet for everyone. These people aren&#x27;t rich. They worked hard all their lives and lived with good values. It wasn&#x27;t all wasted but you&#x27;ve massively devalued their work. I&#x27;d love to see you defend yourself to them, one on one. No PR people. Just techie on techie.')
