I don&#x27;t know what kind of console apps you&#x27;re writing, but if they require DI and environment-specific configuration files then you&#x27;d likely be better off using GenericHost. Setting all this up by hand is a bit cumbersome, but I don&#x27;t think they were really intended to be used that way.')
