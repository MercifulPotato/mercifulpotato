Item(by='CydeWeys', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607527197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25337309, text='Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of an under-appreciated fact that the good majority of the total potential and actual power draw of a home is composed of dedicated circuits for kitchen and laundry appliances and the HVAC stack, most of them 240V.  The 120V 15 amp circuits servicing outlets in the rest of the rooms don&#x27;t add up to much, especially now in the LED era.<p>One thing that bugs me is that there aren&#x27;t counter-top 240V kitchen outlets.  If I ever build my own house I&#x27;ll put in an extra 240V circuit for the kitchen just so I can have some higher power outlets for electric kettles and such.  You can boil water for tea twice as fast with 3 kW as with 1.5 kW, as those smug Brits always like to remind us about.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d make much use out of 240V anywhere else (except obviously in the garage for EV charging), but just having a couple outlets in the kitchen would be a godsend.')
