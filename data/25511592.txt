In the example of wanting the studio to give you all their unedited footage so you can make your own cut, all of that footage was taken with the intent to produce a movie with it (obviously all of it did not make the cut, but the intent was there).<p>For this holiday video, it was taken with the intent to -- privately -- document someone&#x27;s holiday.  Incidentally, the person taking the video happened to find a two-minute segment that they thought might be interesting to others, and they were comfortable giving away (because that portion of the video didn&#x27;t intrude on their privacy).<p>The point I&#x27;m making here is that situations are different.  Situations have nuance.  You can&#x27;t just presume equivalence and throw an argument in someone&#x27;s face along the lines of &quot;if you want someone to do X then you have to be comfortable with Y&quot;.  Because no, you don&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s not logically inconsistent to hold that view.<p>(For the record, I don&#x27;t think the studio should be required to give you all their unpolished, pre-cut footage.  But I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s contradictory to imagine a world where that was the norm, but it was <i>not</i> the norm to expect people to post their entire holiday video when they just want to post a short segment.)')
