Be prepared to pay $$$ as you start adding zones, especially at a “per room” level.<p>In the PNW my todo wishlist is heat pump + zoned underfloor radiant + on demand gas boiler for supplementary heat and household water supply. TBD on cooling via ceiling&#x2F;floor loops or separate wall mounted chiller&#x2F;evaporator units.<p>I had gas fired boiler + radiant heat + supplementary resistive heating in each bedroom. I’m currently living with 3 zoned mini splits. Honestly happy enough with both, but structural radiant heat is just the best for comfort.')
