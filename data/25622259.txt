Glass tends to reflect infrared radiation. For example if you view a car windscreen from the air with a thermal camera, you&#x27;ll see a reflection of the sky.<p>It&#x27;s more complicated than that, because you&#x27;ll also detect the emitted blackbody radiation from the glass (for whatever temperature).')
