Should water cost more b&#x2F;c without it you&#x27;d die? Value is roughly determined by supply&#x2F;demand, risk&#x2F;reward. Doctors&#x2F;nurses are more valuable than cleaners because they are harder to train, give function to the hospital in the first place (who cares to clean a hospital without any staff that no-one goes to), and you can consult with a doctor just as well in a dirty room.')
