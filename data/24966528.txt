The post makes this quite clear and the author and others have pointed out this distinction to you multiple times here. Just because you made an inference and argued against it doesn&#x27;t mean the article was making such an implication.<p>The author is still carefully avoiding describing any newtype-based approach as &quot;type safety&quot;, to the point that they would mislead anyone who wasn&#x27;t already familiar with the subject.<p>&gt; Your last parenthetical doesn&#x27;t seem like a reasonable response of someone who has read and understood this post. The post specifically encourages the use of newtype with abstraction boundaries where practical and works through an example.<p>It works through an example and follows that with a long list of (IMO exaggerated) weaknesses of that example, which seems more designed to dismiss it. It does not &quot;specifically encourage&quot; using newtypes at all (indeed it says &quot;if you are fond of newtypes&quot; as though one would only ever use newtypes for private emotional reasons). It concludes with &quot;correctness by construction should be preferred whenever practical&quot;.')
