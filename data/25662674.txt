The thing is, developers often code things they never needed to. Or they code things off spec. Or they code things outside of the convention of what&#x27;s appropriate for their immediate team or long-term needs of the product. The list goes on. Output could seem good for a long time before it becomes problematic, then the pure coder simply codes more to solve those problems. This is very circular and makes up a lot of work done by software developers in my experience.<p>I agree with what you&#x27;re saying in part. Pure coding skills are essential, especially in critical situations like that. Soft skills won&#x27;t fix broken things, for example. Salespeople can&#x27;t deliver the features they promise without someone to develop them.<p>However, soft skills can help someone with excellent coding skills to know what to apply their skills to and when, and how to integrate their skills within a broad team of different disciplines.<p>This is arguably true in any field; I think it&#x27;s often missed in software development because people have such a difficult time distinguishing boundaries of things. The problems you&#x27;re solving, when you&#x27;re passively or actively solving problems, when output is applicable to a specific problem, etc. Even software engineers themselves struggle with this.<p>Your ability to save your company&#x27;s ass is an excellent skill to have, but it isn&#x27;t directly related or exclusive to what the original comment was saying.')
