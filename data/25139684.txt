This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of functionality being restricted to MAS apps (and prohibited from signed&#x2F;notarized apps that are downloaded outside of MAS).<p>I was told this by the WireGuard team when I inquired why the WireGuard macOS VPN app is only available via MAS and not direct download (such as the Windows wg client).<p>I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s true, though, and am testing now.  ProtonVPN claims to be working, with packet filtering for non-VPN traffic (kill switch) on 11.x, and they&#x27;ve a direct download, so it&#x27;s possible that the wg devs are mistaken.<p>Apple leadership is answering in the implied context of &quot;someone with an Apple ID&quot;.  I&#x27;m never using my Apple ID again on a mac for any reason.')
