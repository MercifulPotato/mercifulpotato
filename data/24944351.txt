That&#x27;s entirely my point. All political power is zero-sum (the more I have the less you have), it doesn&#x27;t matter what voting system you implement.<p>So my broader point is that, given that plenty of other countries don&#x27;t have ranked voting of any kind and plenty of viable 3rd parties, Americans really have no valid policy argument to make as to why they don&#x27;t have viable 3rd parties. The only arguments that hold any water are cultural.')
