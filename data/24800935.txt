There&#x27;s too much lag in any such MIDI system for it to truly correct your timing and PianoMarvel doesn&#x27;t even attempt to judge your volume or the duration of notes, if I remember correctly. But it gives you a reasonable progression of pieces from easy to harder and forces you to actually play them. Also some scores were poorly typeset, particularly things like trills. Overall, it helped me improve my ability to read sheet music fluently, which is what I primarily wanted out of it. I learned more with a teacher, of course.')
