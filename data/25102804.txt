If it gets shot down, the big speech is replaced with a neutral one; if obvious gotchas are pointed out, the speech is tweaked to pre-empt them; otherwise, the speech happens, friendly reporters are happy, and the policy basically is set out to get on the books as a non-event - which is a big win for a government.')
