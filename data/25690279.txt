(And no, you can&#x27;t avoid this danger by having all the forces working together everywhere; far too many command-and-control issues arise.)  If you don&#x27;t invite the military to assist in the first place... well, then you&#x27;re not relying on them to guard your back.<p>There&#x27;s also a fundamental democratic issue at stake: It&#x27;s not by coincidence that the United States Capitol Police answers to the <i>legislature</i> and not to the <i>executive</i> -- indeed, this is seen around the world (e.g. Canada&#x27;s Parliamentary Protective Service answers to the Speakers of the House and Senate) and arguably the principle that military forces should not be brought to the seat of legislative power dates back to the Roman Republic... which swiftly became the Roman Empire after Caesar crossed the Rubicon with an army at his back.')
