Women generally outperform men in school but not on the job market (albeit that&#x27;s mainly due to the fact they used to work less hours overall because of pregnancy and older people - who had less female competition - get higher salaries).<p>Men are generally more assertive and better at negotiating. Anti-bias training is teaching interviewers to ignore assertiveness and communication&#x2F;persuasion skills, to look beyond that and hire shy individuals (which may be fine, unless you&#x27;re hiring for a leadership &#x2F; sales role). Interviews reward more people who did their homework over actual job experience, which again favour an academic mindset.\n&quot;Fair pay scale&quot; are getting more popular, which means your negotiating skills are less important in order to make money.\nThe HR field and the sociology field are dominated by women who of course can push and convince companies about the best way to move forward in order to be &quot;inclusive&quot; and look good with the general public (oh and women control 80% of consumer spending).<p>With hiring conditions levelling the playing fields and women natural better performance in school &#x2F; academic tasks, it&#x27;s easy for more women to do better.\nDo you remember the pay gap? Well, of course none of those numbers can be trusted because there are tons of variables and skills differences in skills - but if you look at women and men in their 20s, women already outperform men. Older men who faced less competition are still ahead.<p>But it&#x27;s not all about money.<p>Men thrive when they get responsibility. The worsening economy, the crisis doesn&#x27;t help with that. Women historically had a husband to shield them from this worries; even though that is changing there is still a prevalence of non working women relying on men.<p>The demonisation of men and masculinity, the repression of men definitely played a role in the increasing number of suicides, which are mainly committed by men.\nI guess there is a case to be make that men depression could be the cause of mass shooting and &#x2F; or radicalisation of young men in terrorist organisations (eg. ISIS, Antifa, etc).<p>Soldiers dying in wars are primarily men.\nMen tend to pursue dangerous jobs, increasing their likelihood of dying.<p>Divorces affect negatively primarily men.<p>Tribunals believe women more (see Heard vs Depp for a mainstream recent case and listen to the last phone call they exchanged before divorcing in which Heard admit hitting Depp and doesn&#x27;t mention any violence in her regards) when things go wrong or when someone decide to cry wolf.<p>Hope this helps spread awareness.')
