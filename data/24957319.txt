But it hasn&#x27;t yet been overruled, and it was a SCOTUS majority ruling and not dicta, so it&#x27;s likely to be followed by lower courts unless and until it&#x27;s overruled by SCOTUS.<p>Questions of being inappropriate are, of course, a personal opinion-based judgment call and not a question of legality.')
