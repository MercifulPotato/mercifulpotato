If the IT transformation really is that important than a lack of success should be an existential threat to the business and everyone doing it. Maybe this means that big projects never happen, and maybe that&#x27;d be a good thing. But where I work, we just did 7 years to have the last 2 be a death march where everything delivered was under cooked.<p>I feel like the lack of a real embrace of a burning deck is what did it.<p>I&#x27;d try and win success with a &#x27;too good to pass on&#x27; bonus that&#x27;s paid 2 years after delivery. But I know in this Agile world, getting a set of agreed on requirements is just impossible.<p>So I&#x27;m back to championing roadmaps and small projects with small teams.')
