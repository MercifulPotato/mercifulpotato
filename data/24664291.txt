We&#x27;ve been doing this for the last 10 years and since have become one of the industry leaders. Our artwork collection consists 4000+ artworks including works from artists like Tracey Emin, Shepard Fairey, Yoko Ono and many other well renowned names. Every sold artwork is a limited edition and collectors have the right to resell their collected artworks. Our goal is to create a platform for art collecting in digital space.<p>This year we&#x27;ve gained some exciting traction and looking for new people to help improve the product. We&#x27;re a small team based in Europe, originally in London but since February we ditched our last office and became fully remote.<p>As a front-end developer you will be working on improving our website (React &#x2F; TypeScript) and apps (React Native). Occasionally we would ask you to help with back-end (Ruby on Rails) and possibly other things Tizen OS (Samsung), WebOS (LG), Chromecast.')
