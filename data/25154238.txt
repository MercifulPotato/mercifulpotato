Item(by='at-fates-hands', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605819294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25152895, text='&gt; Any company that wants to survive long-term doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>I have a list of at least 6 large corporations who do just that. When I worked at Polaris, they re-developed all of their sites on a six month rotating basis so if some new fangled tech came up, it was easy to take advantage of it. They were one of the first companies I knew who were running full-stack JS apps in prod before most people were even considering it.<p>Even where I work now, its all about speed to market. Get it working, release it, and then all the execs and upper management types pat themselves on the back about how awesome they are because they got a janky ReactJs app for users to use in less than 6 months. Several months later of fixing all the problems, they start talking about just scrapping the whole thing and starting over.<p>Its maddening to think these people believe what they are doing is somehow groundbreaking in software development. When in reality, they&#x27;re just releasing a really poor version of their software, spending more months fixing it than the time it took to get it released and then killing it or transitioning to some new shiny framework they want to use instead.<p>OP was spot on in what my experience has been the last 10 years of my working in large corporations and small agencies.')
