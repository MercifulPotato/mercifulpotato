And the paradox of that thing is that&#x27;s happening despite you being:<p>&gt; rich and comfortable<p>That&#x27;s what baffles everyone. The American social contract seems to be &quot;if 80% of the population can be 20-30% richer than the rest of the world, let&#x27;s throw the 20% at the bottom under the rhetorical bus&quot;.<p>And I should point out that these days those 20% at the bottom are about 70 million (!) people.
