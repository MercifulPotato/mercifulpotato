Also, nazism - the Nazis were huge believers in racial differences.<p>If we can agree that individual differences in IQ massively outweigh all other factors (in that there are low-IQ asians, and high-IQ white folks) then any kind of racial profiling around this is just racism. You cannot conclude anything about an individual from their race.<p>And you&#x27;re not controlling for cultural differences. I&#x27;ve spent time in Asia, and the cultural differences are <i>enormous</i>. Massively outweighing any genetic differences.')
