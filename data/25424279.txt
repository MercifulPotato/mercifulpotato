Some of them are goofy (like choosing stocks based on what r&#x2F;wallstreetsbets likes), but most of them just seek to remove the need to rebalance, check indicators constantly, or code your own human judgement into an algorithm.<p>The value here we think is mainly the transferability of others skills and strategies, and removing the grunt work.<p>By getting in and out, do you mean in a physical sense (as in large institutions front-running sell orders, beating retail), or in a technical sense (identifying the ideal time to enter or exit a position)?')
