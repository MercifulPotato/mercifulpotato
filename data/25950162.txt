Why arbitrarily lump together BLM and looters, when it could make more sense to consider them different groups that happen to be in the same area reacting in their own ways to the same circumstances?<p>&gt; 3) That&#x27;s not CHAZ cooperating with authorities, but authorities cooperating with CHAZ. Just because &quot;your people&quot; welcomed the secession, doesn&#x27;t make it any more democratic.<p>The point is it&#x27;s not a succession if you continue to recognize the government by calling on it to reform.<p>&gt; Anyway, let&#x27;s end here.
