It&#x27;s comprised of the Prison Industry, Police&#x2F;Police Unions, Judicial System&#x2F;Prosecutors&#x2F;Administrators, etc.<p>As crime has fallen and society has become less violent, Politicians have to look for ways to keep the steady flow of Meat into the Prisons since they don&#x27;t fill themselves and billions of dollars at stake, 10&#x27;s of thousands of jobs, <i>generous campaign donations</i>, etc. So these Politicians have to make the door as wide as possible to keep the game going, Marijuana, psychedelics, etc, keep that door wide.
