We can learn from what they do.<p>Australia gives around $1130 AUD &#x2F; month to anyone that is low income, or doesn&#x27;t have a job [1] (There is an additional $300&#x2F;mo right now for COVID, but lets ignore that.)<p>It is means tested, but the result is that anyone that doesn&#x27;t have a job (for any reason at all - don&#x27;t want one, quit, can&#x27;t be bothered) gets that payment. You get more if you have kids, and you might get more for rent assistance too. It&#x27;s been that way for decades, and Australia&#x27;s economy has not magically been destroyed.
