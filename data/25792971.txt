It&#x27;s a particular frustration. They lose their painted markings fairly quickly and it can be hard to tell the 1&#x2F;4c of one set from the 1&#x2F;3c of another set, or the 2&#x2F;3c from the 1c or the 1c from the 1-1&#x2F;2c. Why is there even a 1-1&#x2F;2c? Uugh! Melt a 1&#x2F;4c cup? Guess it&#x27;s time to buy a fifth set of all the cups all over again so we can have at least one 1&#x2F;4c. Don&#x27;t toss any of the old ones just in case the 1&#x2F;3c goes through the disposal.<p>We have two kitchen scales. I never get them confused. They&#x27;re interchangeable.')
