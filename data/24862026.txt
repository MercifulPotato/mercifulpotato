So 80% there I would say. But to be able to have user processes with real time guarantees makes so many applications easier to write. For instance video players, midi sequencers, real time audio processing and so on. Right now we rely on ridiculously long buffers to ensure that we never run out of data but on a real time OS you could do this with minimal latency.')
