Do not transfer Spotify Content to unauthorized third parties, including (i) directly or indirectly transferring any data (including aggregate, anonymous or derivative data) received from Spotify to, or use such data in connection with, any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other advertising or monetization-related toolset, even if a user consents to such transfer or use; or (ii) to another music service that competes with Spotify or the Spotify Service.<p>Interestingly enough it says these were last updated over 2 years ago, so they must have been not clamping down on this paragraph until now, or they added it recently and didn&#x27;t bother to update the document version to hide it. Either way, this is very disappointing.')
