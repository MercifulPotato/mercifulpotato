Why? Because the president only gets his or her powers from the law, the constitution.<p>If president would be above the law it would mean that the constitution does not apply to him or her. And if so then anything the constitution says about him or her could not apply to him or her, because s&#x2F;he would be &quot;above it&quot;.<p>So you can not claim that on one hand president has some powers because the constitution says so, and then claim that s&#x2F;he does not have to abide by the constitutional law because .. s&#x2F;he is above the law.<p>SEE ALSO: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.berkeley.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;chemerinsky-supreme-court-affirms-that-president-is-not-above-the-law&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.berkeley.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;chemerinsky-supreme-cou...</a>')
