The government just prints the money it needs for it&#x27;s budget each year and uses it.<p>Inflation is basically your tax rate and everyone can look at the government budget and plan accordingly.<p>This has the added benefit of getting rid of the entire redundant industry of tax CPAs and tax lawyers, freeing hundreds of thousands of smart people to actually produce new wealth in the economy.<p>It makes all illegal activities taxed just like legal activities.<p>It combines all the benefits people are wishing for when they promote a flat tax or wealth tax or simpler taxes into one easy system. Even a child could understand this tax code intuitively.')
