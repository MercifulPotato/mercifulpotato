They&#x27;re not buying the stock based on the fundamentals, they&#x27;re buying the stock in the hope of bankrupting any fund that is trying to short sell the stock.<p>For revenge. For shits and giggles.<p>A friend of mine posted some statistics from a Swedish broker who reported that over 15000 people had bought shares in GME in the past two days. That&#x27;s just one broker in one small country. Suddenly, that 50 million share float doesn&#x27;t look very big. It&#x27;s definitely small enough that what is essentially a global flashmob of angry people can completely disrupt the share.<p>I think if you&#x27;re shorting the stock right now, thinking it &quot;has to&quot; crash back down, you&#x27;re severely underestimating the size and irrationality of this mob.')
