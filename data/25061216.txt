It&#x27;s not uncommon for businesses to have a prohibition against using GPL software in not only their shipping products but anywhere in their toolchain. (You can argue that&#x27;s a counterproductive prohibition, but &quot;your legal department just needs to change their mind on this&quot; may not be an argument a vendor can effectively make.)')
