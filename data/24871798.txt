It&#x27;s not universal, but it&#x27;s much more common than what would be healthy. And it&#x27;s often incentivized by the professors and academic administrations (most with the best interest of the student at their hearth, but also delusional themselves).<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t that kind of a crazy assumption?<p>Yes. That&#x27;s what the discussion is all about.<p>&gt; There seems to be this assumption that it&#x27;s desirable for everyone to always be progressing upwards in the institutional hierarchy.<p>There is this generalized assumption that it&#x27;s desirable for everyone to always be progressing upwards on whatever hierarchy they find themselves. Students happen to find themselves on the academic hierarchy.<p>It&#x27;s not a healthy assumption in any circle. But the academics get the worst form of the problem for many reasons.<p>You are perfectly correct in thinking that an academic formation should primary lead into some innovation related career, or into some high complexity practical field. You are not correct in thinking that people are not delusional enough to be a problem.')
