Now, you&#x27;re supposed to use &quot;reqwest&quot;, which is a convenient wrapper around the &quot;hyper&quot; crate.<p>That&#x27;s not right. http is supposed to be a common library of types for HTTP servers and frameworks (although developers of some competing frameworks have rejected it). It was never an HTTP client like make it sound like, and it&#x27;s actually newer than hyper.<p>As for reqwest vs. hyper, the former offers synchronous wrappers over the async ones, easier TLS support and other niceties (compression, proxy support, cookies, WASM). It&#x27;s high-level and easier to use, somewhat like requests over urllib3 in the Python world.')
