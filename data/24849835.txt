Are you testing a method or function?  Mock its inputs.  If your test of a function fails because an API or a database is not available, that&#x27;s approaching an integration test.  If there&#x27;s a question of whether there are too many mocks being used, the dev may not have thought out a testing strategy well enough.  Be certain of what you&#x27;re testing.<p>That&#x27;s what I usually go by.')
