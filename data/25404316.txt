Climate deniers don&#x27;t care what science says, or how reliable peer-reviewed journals, and have no interest in the scientific method: they base their opposition in ideological grounds: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe climate change to be true, therefore anyone who does is a liar.&quot; They&#x27;ve made their decision because they have financial (or religious, or other) interests that make the truth uncomfortable for them. Why bother trying to understand the truth when you can just deny it?<p>You can&#x27;t argue rationally with someone like that. They aren&#x27;t skeptics, they&#x27;re devout believers.')
