And — sans inflation — prices of all things will decrease over time in absolute (BTC) terms. This could put a major dent in consumerism, as owning BTC will be seen as preferable to owning any other asset, particularly depreciating assets e.g. consumer goods, housing and cars.<p>The above dynamics could more than offset Bitcoin&#x27;s carbon footprint. But even if it doesn&#x27;t, humans are driven by self-interest and every single individual on this planet has the financial incentive not to be left behind. You basically just have no option but to invest in bitcoin. And the longer it takes you to figure this out, the more costly it will be for you.')
