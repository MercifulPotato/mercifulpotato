Some ISPs in the US still waive the fee if you don’t rent equipment, so that doesnt really strengthen the argument. I now have an ISP that doesn’t waive the fee but that doesn’t matter either, since it is not optional it is just part of the total sunk cost. I still use my own router.<p>Your whole argument doesn’t hold water because even with Comcast you can bring your own equipment. They don’t go out of their way to help you... but they don’t stop you either. Don’t see how that is “control”.<p>Maybe you will not call tech support when your own equipment fails but you clearly have no experience in a support role if you think other people won’t!<p>Just spend some time on GitHub issues for more popular open source projects to get an idea, and the multiply that by at least 10 for the general public.')
