I&#x27;m perfectly fine without it. sudo is maybe useful in the case where others on the system don&#x27;t need to know the a password to run as someone else (including root) but need to be able to do that anyway.\nsudo seems to have gotten a big installation bases through ubuntu and everybody thinks it&#x27;s normal now, but really for me it&#x27;s not.')
