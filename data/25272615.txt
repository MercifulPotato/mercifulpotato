Item(by='qwerty456127', descendants=None, kids=[25273289], score=None, time=1606875983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264821, text='I wish I could have something like MacBook Air (a durable stylish laptop to carry around for coding, writing and browsing the web wherever I go, full HD screen to fit more text, as much RAM as possible - to load complex editor&#x2F;IDE configs) but 100% Linux-compatible and at a fraction of the price.<p>Here is what I&#x27;m ready to sacrifice:<p>I don&#x27;t need fanless, I don&#x27;t need crazy battery time (half a day is more than enough), I don&#x27;t play games nor do I need videos to play in resolutions exceeding 720p (360p is more than enough for me unless I try to watch a video on coding where I need to read the code), I don&#x27;t need any OS but Linux. I don&#x27;t need it to be new (can be refurbished) as long as it still is easy to find in the EU (US would add import taxes).<p>I thought PineBook Pro can kind of fit this because it seems being a RaspberryPi-like in a MacBookAir-like shell and RaspberryPi4 actually feels Ok.<p>Can you suggest something that fits better than PineBook Pro and MacBook Air do?')
