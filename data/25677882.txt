That&#x27;s what happened with surveillance. After 9&#x2F;11, the electorate shifted, and Republicans leapfrogged the Democrats, leading to a lot of success.<p>Both parties fundamentally want to win first.<p>Whether that&#x27;s good or bad depends on what you compare it to. You can view it as lack of spine, or as a democratic check-and-balance.')
