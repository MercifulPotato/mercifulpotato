The piece about Buffet applies to all the people on here who have a zillion side projects. What Buffet means by saying no is- same thing Jobs meant- don&#x27;t do those things. Have a strategy and use the slow brain (Thinking Fast And Slow) to make decisions that are about going deep, not broad. Similar in part to Deep Work.<p>For annoyances, or things imposed on you, as described above, various Zen practices come to mind. Life is full of suffering, and obligation, and the most at peace simply acknowledge and fulfill them. The koan of the novice experiencing anger after the master disrupted a practice with a seemingly trivial action- with the master pointing out that he left it behind, it was the novice who carried it around, etc. Practice not thinking&#x2F;worrying about whether you will get your luggage back. Make the calls, wait on hold, but don&#x27;t <i>worry</i>. It will either happen or it won&#x27;t. Objects are so commodified now, if you truly need a lost object, you can just buy another. The psychic angst is not worth it.<p>Cheers.')
