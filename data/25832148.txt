Granted, I have not investigated if someone else holds a trademark or so that maybe still allows for something to be sold.<p>Signal not only encrypts messages (Whatsapp does as well), but also seem to make sure there is as little meta data available as possible. This should make it less interesting for eg. Facebook to buy them.')
