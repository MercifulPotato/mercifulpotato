Or are you saying that when someone does not have power, it is their fault? I am not sure you are saying either of these things, but I am finding it difficult to make any kind of charitable reading of this comment.<p>Positive thinking only gets you so far. When taken TOO FAR, positive thinking becomes a delusion. We with loving families can thoughtlessly &amp; brutishly suggest to a friend that they “should definitely reconcile with their father”, because the idea of abusive parents is outside our experience.<p>Same applies to things like companies. I can easily tell people to “obtain power and fix problems” at work, but it is not necessarily <i>possible.</i> If we pretend that conflict does not exist, or can always be solved by the right actions, we’re just hurting people.')
