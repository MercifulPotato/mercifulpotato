Get a name brand cable and verify what they are capable of. If you buy a $3 &quot;MOKiN&quot; brand USB-C cable and it won&#x27;t charge your device, you&#x27;ve basically self-owned. Likewise any number of random cables on Amazon.<p>Lots of decent brands out there who make cables that do what they say they will do: Belkin, Monoprice, Anker, etc.<p>Another tip I got which is worth it&#x27;s weight in cable in this case: If you need both USB-C and Thunderbolt cables, get different colors of cable and be consistent about it. I know a guy who buys all his cables in specific colors (even when the adaptor is different) so he can reach into his gear bag and get the right thing every time.')
