Nestled betwixt the Catskill mountains, the Adirondacks and the Berkshires. I always went for the natural beauty: ziplines, hacker crafts on Lake George, skiing etc.<p>But its actually legacy home to industrial powerhouses: GE R&amp;D, once the world&#x27;s largest corporate research lab. IBM which used to boast having hundreds of PhD&#x27;s there. And more recently a thriving indie video game scene. Vicarious Visions, recently acquired by Blizzard, employs 200+ downtown.<p>So while you may imagine your &quot;non-tech&quot; hamlet is devoid of any conspicuous tech scene. You may actually discover one. Lurking just below the surface ;)')
