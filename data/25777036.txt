Item(by='eganist', descendants=None, kids=[25777188], score=None, time=1610636374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776877, text='&gt; I am not sure what risk you mean here and I struggle to see how a rational person can infer that I mean hatred when I introduce myself as &quot;proactivesvcs&quot;, &quot;Adam&quot; or &quot;Mr Piggott&quot;. I think that yes, everyone should feel that they can offer their pronouns, unsolicited, and I believe that we should encourage that this is an acceptable behaviour, since then eventually, it&#x27;ll be something we don&#x27;t even have to discuss. But inferring hatred strikes me as a very acute form of assuming bad-faith.<p>Ah, from what I&#x27;m reading, it doesn&#x27;t seem that my message registered. Let me try conveying it another way.<p>Taylor Jones introduces herself with the pronouns she&#x2F;they to a new group of friends. The new group of friends is unaccustomed to forward declaration of pronouns, and among them, a few in the group perceive Taylor as being different from themselves as a consequence of their unfamiliarity with pronoun declaration. Thus begins the Othering of Taylor. (Othering: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;words-at-play&#x2F;other-as-a-verb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;words-at-play&#x2F;other-as-a-ver...</a>)<p>On the flip side, Taylor Jones introduces herself with the pronouns she&#x2F;they to a group of friends who all then share their own pronouns for the sake of clarity. Because this practice is ingrained in the group already, it&#x27;s less likely that some in the group would perceive Taylor as being &quot;Other&quot; to them.<p>Does this help?')
