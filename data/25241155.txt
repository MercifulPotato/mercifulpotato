Item(by='inopinatus', descendants=None, kids=[25244219], score=None, time=1606603159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240240, text='&gt; Having positive feelings towards one&#x27;s country is a pretty normal, pretty emotionally healthy thing. Their absence indicates some internal or external conflict or trauma.<p>That is pub psychology at its most patronising, its most flawed, and its most self-serving.<p>For those of us not so indoctrinated, expressing feelings for any inanimate or noncorporeal object sounds pathological and fetishistic.  Indoctrinating children into the same through repetition of a daily mantra is indistinguishable from religion.  If nations <i>were</i> an object capable of returning your affection, the routine exploitation, injustice, violence, mismanagement and desecration of trust would make it a situation to be urgently extracted from.<p>Those who haven&#x27;t experienced any of those things first-hand, including from the systems and institutions of nations that make the cosmically ironic claim to be the &quot;good guys&quot;, are astonishingly, overwhelmingly, revoltingly privileged - and only a small fraction of humanity.<p>To sum up: patriotism is an abusive relationship with a memetic virus.<p>Only a monster would promulgate it.')
