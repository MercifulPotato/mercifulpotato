You can&#x27;t really defend against many thugs if they take you by surprise. Somebody could just wait somewhere near you house and snipe you, it&#x27;s impossible to detect everything all the time if you leave your house or go near windows even once. And bad guys can use even explosives to break into your house.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, since guns are extremely useful for defense and most of the bad guys aren&#x27;t very tough. Surviving without a community in a serious scenario is just impossible.')
