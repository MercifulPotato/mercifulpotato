It&#x27;s still in its infancy. It&#x27;s my first time making mobile apps, so many features are missing. Btw, I also made another app called &quot;English Speaking&quot; for English learners.<p>English Speaking\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=english.englishspeaking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=english.englis...</a><p>One big problem I found so far is that it&#x27;s super hard for new apps to be discovered in Google Play as there tons of language learning apps. Even Say Japanese and English Speaking provide a very different set of features (focusing on the speaking aspect), it&#x27;s still difficult for them to be ranked high in search results.<p>My original goal was to build an app that can improve my English prosody (interword level), but I found it&#x27;s technically challenging.
