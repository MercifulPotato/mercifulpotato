Item(by='tannhaeuser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603969942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926417, text='Did a project for consolidating address representations across systems for large logistics a couple years ago. It was the one project where XML was a genuinely adequate representation. Ie you could have a text line address preserving sequence, newlines, and whitespace, yet markup postcode and other distinguished fields. Like<p><pre><code>    &lt;line&gt;Bla Ltd&lt;&#x2F;line&gt;\n    &lt;line&gt;&lt;houseno&gt;11&lt;&#x2F;houseno&gt;, Xyz-Street&lt;&#x2F;line&gt;\n    &lt;line&gt;&lt;postcode&gt;12345&lt;&#x2F;postcode&gt; MyCity&lt;&#x2F;line&gt;\n</code></pre>\nTaking advantage if the fact that almost all addresses can be written in a line-oriented fashion. Actual addresses were using the much more granular UPU S1 vocabulary. SGML would&#x27;ve been even better since it can treat newlines and whitespace as markup, eliminating &lt;line&gt; boilerplate and just use a regular text block representation.')
