I find it a bit confusing and had to reread to catch the point.<p>There are 3 levels defined by the EU. I use these levels everywhere because it&#x27;s not really a legal thing but increasing levels of technical requirement. The US has many conflicting laws on what signatures are valid.<p>The lowest level is what you first started out with. The marketing term for this is &quot;E-signature&quot;. It&#x27;s a subtle marketing speak to mean putting an image into a document. Theses are generally accepted for most things. California though has not allowed this in the past. A provider offers signatures at this level (with some nuance).<p>The second level is a &quot;digital signature&quot; backed up by other details. People think this means like an actual signature. In document contexts it&#x27;s very confusing. But what they really mean is signing (encrypting with your private key so the public can decrypt it). This can be a verified email, phone, the more the better. What&#x27;s important is at this level the signer is not actually the person, it&#x27;s the service. The service has a trusted cert created from the Adobe trust chain and does additional measures to verify the person. The visible signature at this point is just a mock to make people comfortable using it. The signature is really cryptographic. This level is pretty much always court admissible.<p>The last level is signing the doc with your own trusted cert. You can get these tokens from many providers to do yourself. It&#x27;s required for typically government things like stamping a document by an actual engineer (ie a PE). To get these certs you need to go to a notary to get verified. This is as legit as it gets. It&#x27;s almost bulletproof.<p>Product wise, I am pretty familiar with PKI but am still confused as to what it really does or why I should use it. If this is to get wide adoption, the person using it needs to know nothing about certs and PKI. Additionally, I&#x27;m confused if this is using PKI or a web of trust. I&#x27;d think it would have to be web of trust to be practical but it seems like the examples allude more to PKI? Best of luck, I look forward to see where it goes.')
