Obviously someone could add their name or fake name to one of the answers, and we can&#x27;t do anything about it (I think).<p>&quot;Also I&#x27;m sad to admit that some feedback requires pinpointing specific examples of things that have actually happened&quot;\n&gt; We plan to allow custom questions so that you can ask for feedback about specific situations too. Did you have another idea in mind?<p>Let me know if you can think of more ways to make it better! Thanks :)')
