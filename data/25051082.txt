I lived with that for years before it became clear I had symptoms that boiled down to me stressing myself out enough that they occurred (tremors, pain, IBD, sleep disturbances, cardiac, etc). Psychosomatic doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;imaginary&quot;--rather, it means being a disorder of both psychological and somatic (physical) nature. That&#x27;s one of the very first humps I had to get over to accept it was happening to me: the symptoms are every bit as real as in a fully somatic condition.<p>So I took the comment&#x27;s point as that there are multiple potential causes for a given manifestation, and chronic conditions in particular are confusing because they invariably end up with physical -and- mental symptoms. There&#x27;s something to be said for exploring easing the one you can do by yourself, at least to some extent. Mindfulness, slow breathing, and some of those other techniques helped me too. No matter which aspect is primary and which aspect is secondary, easing the mental stress some can still help.')
