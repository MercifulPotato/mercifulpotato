But I think there&#x27;s a big range between that kind of praise and no praise at all. Personally for me (and my guess is that for many people), if no matter how hard I work that&#x27;s never acknowledged and I always get suggestions for improvement, that would create frustration and a feeling of unreasonable expectations from the company.')
