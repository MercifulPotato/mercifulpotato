However, PRs are very rare and are mostly about bugfixes, not new features. Bugfixes are always released as part of the non-Insiders version, of course.<p>What&#x27;s probably interesting is to consider the user demographics, about which I learned more in a survey [1] I did last year. Only 8% of my user base would consider themselves Frontend engineers. Given that this is an HTML template with some rather complex CSS&#x2F;JS, it&#x27;s not surprising that there are only very few PRs that implement new features. I guess most Frontend engineers go for JavaScript-based solutions like Vuepress or Docusaurus. Material for MkDocs is Python-based.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;squidfunk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1259832077668810752" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;squidfunk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1259832077668810752</a>')
