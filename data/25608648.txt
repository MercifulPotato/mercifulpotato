If you go back and read papers from well known researchers from the early 20th century, they can be a delight to read.  We have gone down a road of increased formalism and a removal of any character in the name of &quot;objectivity&quot; and &quot;dispassionate impartiality&quot;.  This is, of course, utter bunk.  Researchers are often not objective or impartial about their work, but it&#x27;s all carefully phrased to be as dry as possible.<p>If you read some older papers, you have the author interjecting with their thoughts and opinions directly in the first person, and it can make for much more compelling reading.  So long as the data presented is objective and accurate, I can&#x27;t say I have much problem with it.  Today we use the &quot;discussion&quot; section for this, but it&#x27;s just not the same.<p>Put it this way, I&#x27;ve fallen asleep reading more papers than I care to admit.  But some of those older papers were so enjoyable and interesting to read I&#x27;d devour them and go looking for more.<p>Objectivity is of course important, but I think modern publishing has lost something which is also important: the excitement and interest of the authors in their own work.')
