It&#x27;s got insane power, but comes with a relatively steep learning curve. Remember reading regex for the first time? What? But unlike regex, the number of people using it are few in comparison.<p>IMO the learning curve of XPath is not that high though, it has a somewhat alien syntax but the only thing I remember giving me trouble is <i>axis</i>, because most tutorials just go on with the &quot;shortcut&quot; syntax so the first time you encounter axis everything goes pear-shaped.<p>&gt; There are functions in XPath 2.0 that I would love to have, but Nokogiri for Rails is stuck in 1.0 world with no plan to go to 2.0. Sad, but I&#x27;ll live.<p>Nokogiri should support function extensions[0] and most of the XPath 2.0 functions were originally extensions to 1.0[1], so even if these functions are not distributed with nokogiri you should be able to add them yourself.<p>Incidentally, Nokogiri seems to optionally depend on libexslt, which is the exslt implementation in C for libxml2&#x2F;libxslt, so exslt should be available either as an option or by building it yourself.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sparklemotion&#x2F;nokogiri&#x2F;commit&#x2F;eb56525fbcc4994cc0cdfa8c6071be22e1c8bdf3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sparklemotion&#x2F;nokogiri&#x2F;commit&#x2F;eb56525fbcc...</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exslt.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exslt.org</a>')
