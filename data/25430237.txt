I cant compete with Amazon by being an ecommerce marketplace (need something like Shopify) or even compete with a restaurant in the next street by offering everything that restaurant has to offer.<p>This article argues the exact opposite. The gist of it is, Google has an unfair advantage because it has indexed so many pages. Its true. They started early, know the game and have been playing it well. They werent the world&#x27;s first search engine though. Just that they came up with a new algo, a new approach and usurped the incumbents. Yes, the company is way to powerful but to just argue that they have better resources and reach is tangential to what makes them a candidate for antitrust.')
