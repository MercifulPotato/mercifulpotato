I&#x27;m only about half way through and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the writing but I do think it&#x27;s interesting how many parallels one can draw between a black market drug site and a commonplace Silicon Valley startup. A fun read but not as technical as I&#x27;d hoped.<p><i>The Law</i> - Frederic Bastiat: A short pamphlet first written after the French Revolution. From what I can tell it&#x27;s a good intro to libertarian thought. Reading it because I&#x27;ve found myself more interested in politics and seem to gravitate towards libertarianism more than other political philosophies.')
