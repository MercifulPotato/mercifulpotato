The problem with those is that the use of such technology can be detected, and thus the small number of users singled out. You&#x27;d need steganography for this principle to work, and AFAIK that&#x27;s already what paranoid criminals are doing. So in reality making E2E encryption inconvenient only penalizes regular honest people.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mask.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mask.io&#x2F;</a>')
