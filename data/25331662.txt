But still a much larger percentage of bugs I&#x27;ve seen was introduced by the developers. Which is why I said even now Rust would probably beat MISRA C++ in terms of total amount of bugs.  I do think Sealed Rust has a bit of a way to go, but it would be a worthy investment.<p>Seen from the point of total risk, the compiler errors are much harder to find, but the developer errors can still kill you.<p>In any case SPARK is indeed even farther ahead in terms of having a reliable toolchain paired with a language that makes safe code easier to produce.')
