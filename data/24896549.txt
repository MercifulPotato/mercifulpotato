There are many, many Asian students there. In fact, nearly one in five students at Harvard are of Asian descent. The idea that elite schools are purposely excluding Asians is absurd on its face. The people pushing the idea have an axe to grind and it usually isn’t actually in the interest of Asian-Americans.</i>&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re Asian and you&#x27;re reading this, never forget that the above is what progressives believe about how society treats Asians: transgressions against you get simply waved away.  Think twice about supporting them.<p>For the record, I am Asian and a liberal but definitely not progressive.')
