As I don&#x27;t use Docker, I was using &quot;lightweight VMs&quot; I had created (w&#x2F; Packer, converted into Vagrant boxes) with VirtualBox for all of this testing.<p>I spent I don&#x27;t know how many hours across several days learning the &quot;toolchain&quot;, getting everything setup and working properly, adding full test coverage, and so on. Not long afterwards, they released Molecule 3.0 which required using Docker.  :&#x2F;')
