This is a case of perverse incentives. American K-12 schools are set up first and foremost as holding tanks for kids while parents work. This by itself sets a low standard for education, but a high bar for control of students. This control requirement simply gets translated to software, so there’s no surprise that we get dystopian spyware disguised as educational packages. My very white child, who is stuck doing remote learning, is held under the same thumb as the 45% of kids in her class who are black. The major difference between my kid and others is that I turn off her internet access at random intervals in order to create some unstructured time for her. School teaches nothing of value anyway - why waste time on it?')
