Each statement has a potential, opaque effect on the complete state.<p>To prove anything in the OP solution would be extremely complex. To extract new knowledge and abstract the solution in the future would be nearly impossible without a complete rewrite.<p>For example: what if we need logging? Timing of the steps taken? A list of dish washing tasks generated? Parallelism in the tasks, given an extra cook? Exception control? Unit testing of the dough?<p>Adding an extra recipe is not the only possible new requirement you can have. Anticipating and preparing the right abstractions, thatâ€™s what good software engineering is about.')
