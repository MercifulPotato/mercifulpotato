That is a MASSIVE imbalance in favor of women.<p>Not sure that&#x27;s necessarily a massive imbalance. It depends on the quality of the guy sending you those messages, and maybe on the actual message that they send (but it&#x27;s more important that the guy is hot than that what he says is funny or something).<p>For example, I get a ton of emails from spammers about penis enlargement methods, and I rarely send my own emails asking if they have any penis enlargement methods available. Does that mean there&#x27;s a massive imbalance in favor of me? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m at a huge advantage because of all this email I&#x27;m getting.')
