I think those types are far from the rule though and are in fact the exception. I think most people, that have self-built the bulk of their wealth, are much more &#x27;normal&#x27; but just operate at a grander scale. Instead of paying the last 2 dollars of the single mother&#x27;s grocery bill in front of them then going home feeling good they hand someone 10,000 for tuition or a medical bill or they cut a million dollar check for a charity&#x2F;foundation&#x2F;hospital and feel better but not as good as that person that helped that person in the checkout line because they know they&#x27;ve got far more money than they need but also know they can&#x27;t just throw it at every issue because it wouldn&#x27;t be the best use of the money - if John Trillionairington the First started handing out million dollar checks, you&#x27;d have a fair number of people buying 200k dollar cars and a Rolex for each wrist and going &quot;come on John, give me more you cheap skate, this stripper needs more tips!&quot; (see: many significant cash prize lottery winners).')
