It specifically disadvantages small businesses that do not have access to private label brands. </i><p>Small retailers can <i>also</i> have private label brands. Many do. There are a great many suppliers, large and small, to service all retail market niches. Gelson&#x27;s, for example, is a CA grocery chain with 27 stores. It has its own store brand.<p>Most small stores and chains don&#x27;t have store brand products simply because it&#x27;s not worth the costs. With a store brand, the store is on the hook for all marketing spend, and that&#x27;s in addition to the money they spend on the inventory itself, which generally isn&#x27;t materially cheaper than brand name products purchased at wholesale.<p>And customers don&#x27;t go to a store for the store brand products (Costco aside), they go for the name brand products like Coke and Nabisco. Do you honestly believe companies spend billions on marketing for nothing?<p><i>Employer healthcare also creates an anti-competitive advantage for larger companies for the same reason, but that&#x27;s a separate issue. </i><p>Employer healthcare is a product of the world war ii wage controls that has survived due to favorable tax treatment. Small companies can <i>also</i> offer health care, and many do without issue.<p><i>That means diminishing chain retailers and giving more agency to individual retailers.</i><p>Do you know <i>why</i> chain stores are successful? It&#x27;s because their market power allows them to acquire products cheaper from suppliers, which lets them sell those products for cheaper than smaller stores. Lower costs = lower prices = customers benefit. It&#x27;s silly to say that we need the small store to survive if it sells product X for more than the chain store without offering any other benefit than merely providing the product.<p>Small&#x2F;indie stores have survived in the markets where factors other than pricing drive customer purchasing decisions, such as apparel, recreational outdoor equipment, restaurants, etc.')
