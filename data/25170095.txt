This is the part where the vast majority of US health care plans simply seize up and zero out.<p>From a pragmatic national economic perspective, I&#x27;d rather have someone with varying degrees of mental health challenges operating at below their productive potential, with some glimmer of hope of future recovery and&#x2F;or self-maintenance, and consuming some fraction of mental health care workers&#x27; staff time, than absolute zero productive delivery, and causing net negative drain on resources from them eventually lashing out and us cleaning up after the mess from lashing out. There are huge ramifications to this kind of posture, not all good, so it isn&#x27;t all roses, but I think developed nations are sufficiently advanced enough to shoulder this kind of burden, and I come at this from a kind of &quot;no man left behind&quot; type philosophy about it.')
