You can say it doesn&#x27;t have bugs but it has more than release editions. In my experience many more. Using a beta as a daily driver is not something to recommend.<p>Now, some distros like Debian have enough political power to get Mozilla to allow them to put Firefox branding on their altered user-freedoms-respecting repo editions of FF release. But most don&#x27;t. So the only way to use actual release FF is to go outside your repos and use the unbranded version. Possible, of course, but tedious.')
