Containers appear to be the main thing that bothers me, particularly when the container implementation requires that all injectable entities are classes and not functions. It creates this &quot;viral&quot; effect where nearly everything you implement ends up having to be wrapped up in a class, even when there&#x27;s no reason to do so other than the injection container.')
