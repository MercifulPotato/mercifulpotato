That includes the narrative that Facebook&#x2F;Twitter is the cause for social unrest and not the NYT&#x2F;CNN&#x2F;FOX.<p>The 2000s and were about manufacturing consent.  The 2020s are about manufacturing outrage. You can say it&#x27;s all about click-bait and getting eyeballs, but I&#x27;m skeptical this isn&#x27;t the same people that started the Iraq war.  They want civil unrest on purpose.  People didn&#x27;t want to live in a fascist society just because of Al Qaeda, so they needed a new enemy.  So they tried to radicalize your gun-loving neighbor, dressed him up as QAnon Shaman, and now we have to live like 1984 because of him.  It&#x27;s absurd.')
