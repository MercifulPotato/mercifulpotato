I reach the modules page with a goal in mind, &quot;I want to sign some data&quot;, &quot;I want to generate a key pair to sign some data&quot;, etc - and am left questioning where to go next. Now, that sounds lazy, but it&#x27;s more.. cautious - as i mentioned i am <i>very</i> wary of a potential footgun that would leave me using the wrong tool or the right tool in the wrong way. So without very, very explicit goal oriented documentation i&#x27;m left confused, unsure which module should be used to do what i seek.<p>Crypto puts people who know the unknowns in an awkward position. If i was fully ignorant i&#x27;d probably find more progress, as i&#x27;d be willing to just throw bytes around and see what works. Yet i&#x27;ve seen so many horror stories and tales of caution that i&#x27;m left never knowing if it&#x27;s safe to do X in Y scenario.<p>Combine that with my goal of using this code in Desktop, Mobile, WASM (maybe web, definitely mobile, etc) - and a bunch of scary new attack vectors get introduced and compound confusion.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to know where to start haha. Anyway, hopefully this answers your question :)')
