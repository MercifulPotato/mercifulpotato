Although I&#x27;m guessing large population migration will be more due to rising water (most humans live along some cost line). And if millions of people have to move, there <i>will</i> be wars with or without fascit goverments. With this scenario, the 10 year time frame seems pessimistic, I think 2050 is more likely.<p>Either way, the earth system will regulate, it would be nice if civilisation managed to survive the transition. I&#x27;m pretty sure there will still be humans around, happy humans I&#x27;m not so sure.')
