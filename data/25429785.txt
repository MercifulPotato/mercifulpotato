I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure it<p>&gt; out.&quot;<p>But they should be encouraged to at least try to find a solution (depending on the scenario). If it&#x27;s simply &quot;I do not know how to do X&quot; and I ask &quot;have you looked at Y&quot;, if the answer is no then this is something they should do. Maybe there is no solution there either, but it is something they should explore so we can have a discussion about that.<p>&gt; It is much harder to focus and succeed when you&#x27;re trying<p>&gt; to push yourself down a path you think is probably<p>&gt; fruitless.<p>Well, that is also where the maximum reward exists - when you think something is impossible and then you discover you are able to do it. If nothing else, you gain a better ability to judge what &#x27;fruitless&#x27; looks like when considering problems.<p>&gt; It is much harder to solve problems when you don&#x27;t have a<p>&gt; sounding board.<p>Sure, but it also robs you of a learning experience if you are always relying on other people to guide you through solving problems - and it can be exhausting for the person that has to guide you. So it should be something that is not used common place.<p>For example, you could ask &quot;off the top of you head, do you know how to do X? If not I&#x27;ll consult Y...&quot;. Maybe they have some pointers for solving X, but you&#x27;re also saying that you&#x27;re willing to investigate using method Y.<p>Ultimately, if you have little risk, you have little reward. You can easily setup a scenario where they try to solve their problem, but don&#x27;t get stuck for too long. For example, send them off and check up on them half hour later: &quot;any luck solving X yet?&quot;, &quot;have you considered looking at Z?&quot;.<p>Another point to consider when you agree to always help somebody solve problems they make little to no effort to solve themselves is that they are robbed of the learning experience, they have a path where they never have to become self-dependent and you are distracted from some other task.')
