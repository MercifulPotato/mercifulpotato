My Steam account password these days is cracked scarily often, and I&#x27;m afraid my Steam account is now one of my weakest links in my online security footprint. I&#x27;m not dumb enough to use the same password for my email addresses as my Steam account, but the fact that Steam seems to be allowing password spray fast enough that machines keep cracking 50+ character passwords in days is alarming.<p>(ETA: Note the reason I mention 50+ is that I specifically vary the length randomly; when I don&#x27;t the cracks drop to hours apart.)')
