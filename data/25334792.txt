Anyone mentioned in this article could buy a house in Miami&#x2F;Austin&#x2F;Denver without worrying about any transaction costs if they turn around and sell it in 6 months.<p>- SF (and California in general) are being much more aggressive with anti-COVID policies.<p>- The cities that are being focused on (Miami and Austin) are overall pretending that COVID isn&#x27;t a thing (I live in Austin, and this is my experience).<p>- Well-off individuals currently under lock-down are looking at people living &quot;freely&quot; in Florida&#x2F;Texas and are jealous, because they think that the SF-lockdown rules shouldn&#x27;t apply to them, because they are less at risk (this is a discussion for another day)<p>- They&#x27;ve now set themselves up with a plausible &quot;I moved out of California. My reason was COVID.&quot; story to try to avoid paying California state taxes in the future, even if they still end up being back in SF the majority of the time for their business.<p>tldr; the &quot;elites&quot; leaving are moving for short-term quality-of-life improvements due to COVID, and will have no issue turning around and moving back in 6-12 months when SF is &quot;open for business&quot; again.<p>Update: I have seen the shift in Austin from watching stories&#x2F;tweets&#x2F;social-media of people who have been moving from SF -&gt; Austin. I was excited at first of the prospect of Austin become a much larger tech city, but am now noticing that the overwhelming majority of this content (although I could easily be seeing a biased sample, of course) is that the vocal group of &quot;I moved from SF to Austin&quot; is the same group that is extremely excited to go out to restaurants and public events again.')
