If you catch one and recover you&#x27;re likely to be immune against infections from the same viral strain for some time.<p>For SARS-CoV2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes this means that even without the - quite likely - availability of a vaccine over time natural immunity will build up within individuals and the population as a whole, which has the potential of both making the resulting disease less severe and future waves spreading less.<p>If most individuals who contract the virus during the next few months can&#x27;t get sick anymore and can&#x27;t spread the virus anymore for the about 6 months those individuals are taken out of the equation, which leaves less individuals for the virus to spread to in the next wave.')
