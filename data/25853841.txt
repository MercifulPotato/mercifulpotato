There&#x27;s a reason that studios were going for $4k&#x2F;month until the pandemic, and it&#x27;s because the price was getting set by a tiny tiny fraction of the highest incomes, since those were the only people left.<p>So populations that had a lower home ownership base and less access to high income jobs, such as African Americans, have seen their populations completely destroyed in SF, starting exactly when SF decided to downzone.<p>Rent control is just fine for newcomers, as long as tenants don&#x27;t ally with homeowners to keep our newcomers. The tenants lose in that battle when it comes time for the next generation to find housing.')
