My machine is on Windows 10 1909 but the May 2020 as well as the Oct 2020 Win 10 updates have both been held back because of Conexant driver incompatibility causing blue screen. MS stated back in June they are working with Synaptics to roll out an updated driver but we&#x27;re nearly in Nov now and there has been no further announcement. Looks like they can&#x27;t update the driver or the number of incompatible machines are low enough for them not to bother, essentially saying &quot;upgrade your machine or just stay on 1909 till EOL, not our problem.&quot;<p>Drivers are a huge pain on both Windows as well as Linux. We&#x27;re at 2020 now and still software development hasn&#x27;t been able to separate drivers from the operating system, make them OS agnostic and easily updatable without all sorts of breakages.')
