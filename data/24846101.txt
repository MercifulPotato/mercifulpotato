Manipulating sets of tuples is a very high level kind of thinking compared to manipulating individual objects and their relationships in a procedural manner.<p>Of course sometimes the task is to write load&#x2F;edit&#x2F;store logic for individual records and their relationships. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with using an ORM for that.<p>But extending this sort of thinking to all data processing is extremely detrimental to both productivity and performance. If you&#x27;re using an RDBMS you&#x27;re well advised to apply a sets first approach to data handling.<p>That&#x27;s the danger of ORMs. They encourage people to do the wrong thing.<p>They also add considerable complexity to a project. So after having written my own ORMs many years ago and using some of the popular ones I would stay away. The cases where they are the right tool for the job are just not worth the friction they create.')
