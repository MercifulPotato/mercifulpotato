It has built-in web dashboards as well as an API.  Every day that I had to bang my head against the opacity of an org-wide Kafka or ActiveMQ setup at one job, I missed the simplicity and transparency of RabbitMQ from a previous job.  Somehow Kafka earned the &quot;trendy&quot; badge though, so everyone just uses it by default.')
