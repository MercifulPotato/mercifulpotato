[1]<p>But obviously we can&#x27;t just see the vast advertising industry and all it supports vanish overnight. However, we could nationalize them. We could pay last years ad-spend to market healthy food, low consumption &amp; social connections. Then next year we could cut spending a little, say 90%. If companies can&#x27;t survive without the economic dead weight of advertising then they shouldn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re required for product discovery in the information technology age.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2015&#x2F;feb&#x2F;17&#x2F;peter-oborne-telegraph-hsbc-coverage-fraud-readers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2015&#x2F;feb&#x2F;17&#x2F;peter-oborne-t...</a>')
