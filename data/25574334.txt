Same is true for rape victims. It may even be that weak-seeming people are more likely to be blamed as victims, because they serve as an uncomfortable reminder of danger and have already shown that they can be defeated. Think of negative feedback loops where people start to avoid someone they perceive as being unlucky, thus leading to poorer outcomes in future.')
