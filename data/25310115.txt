So the actual impact wasnt lessened by them at all!); To simply not having known about it. The correct reviewer response to this would be an &quot;accept with corrections&quot; to &quot;revise and resubmit&quot;; retraction is overboard. Moreover, that&#x27;s the role of a <i>conference</i> reviewer, not the employer. Once your employer starts interfering with what you can and can&#x27;t publish, it&#x27;s time to find a new affiliation indeed.')
