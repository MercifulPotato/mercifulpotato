The current API is still limited to 30k rules. (the dynamic rule count is ridiculously low too)<p>- Even if the rule count were unlimited, having a static list of rules handicaps more complex algorithms like those used in uBlock Origin, that aren&#x27;t limited to &quot;if URL in URL_LIST then block&quot;. For instance, a Levenshtein-distance-based algorithm can&#x27;t be implemented with declarativeNetRequest.<p>- Manifest v3 doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent extensions from examining traffic, just blocking it. So Google&#x27;s stance that its API is against data mining, not ad blockers in particular seems hypocritical.<p>- Similarly, its stance that the proposed API is more efficient is extremely dubious. Modern WebAssembly has close-to-C++ performance, meanwhile ads and analytics are one of the biggest source of slowdowns of the modern net. The idea that restricting adblockers would improve performance in the general case is absurd.<p>Overall I have the same view of adblockers as I have of pirate sites: they&#x27;re very convenient for me and I like to have them, but I don&#x27;t begrudge corporations for doing everything they can to get rid of them. In a world where most of the internet is funded by ads, I understand why Google would want to find ways to make adblockers just a little less powerful.<p>But Google&#x27;s insistence that it isn&#x27;t doing exactly that, and that its API is technically motivated, reads as corporate nonsense. They haven&#x27;t responded at all how I&#x27;d expect them to if the whole controversy was just a misunderstanding.')
