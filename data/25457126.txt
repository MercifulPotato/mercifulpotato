You have to know what&#x27;s already in the head of the absolute beginner. If it&#x27;s garbage, you need to set that straight before anything else can happen.<p>You also have to know what&#x27;s not in the head of an absolute beginner. Then you need to fill the gaps with background material. Not too much or your audience will tune out. Not too little or you&#x27;ll lose your audience in a puff of confusion. There needs to be just enough instant gratification to keep the reader with you.<p>Many concepts you&#x27;ve mastered are tangled together in your head, and you&#x27;ll realize this the minute you start trying to write about them. Before you started writing, you never noticed what a hairball of concepts you&#x27;d mastered, and if you don&#x27;t expend some serious effort and energy unpacking it all, your absolute beginner guide will read more like a dissertation. You&#x27;ll need to untangle each and every concept for the beginner audience. That means getting creative with how information is presented. With what information you reveal, and what information you simplify - but not too much. You should start thinking about ways to convey ideas graphically, which could excite you as much as it horrifies you. A good image can take as much effort as 2,000 edited words.<p>You start off thinking that it will be easy. And then you realize you&#x27;ve vastly underestimated how much material there will be to get where you wanted to be. If you haven&#x27;t given up in complete frustration at the size of the undertaking in front of you, scale back your vision for the guide and repeat. It may take a few iterations before you know what you&#x27;re doing.')
