The point of this was to test several things which they&#x27;ve never tested before and gather data to drive design improvements. They successfully tested: ascent under three engines, flap-controlled aerodynamic descent to the landing site, the landing flip maneuver - including drawing propellant from the header tanks - and final landing burn.<p>They didn&#x27;t stick the landing, but it looks like they got test data from all the planned test activities. The explosion will prevent gathering some data from post-flight inspection, but other than that I doubt it has much affect on future development.<p>To look back on SN5&#x2F;SN6 testing, they stuck the landings with those prototypes, but the prototypes themselves are now obsoleted by the new prototypes in production (up to SN16?!)')
