Usually would print at work but need a printer for infrequent docs like tax returns during quarantine WFH. The Instant Ink subscription is reasonably priced for that, and I don&#x27;t need to worry about the cartridges getting spoiled if left alone for too long because I pay for pages printed, not cartridges. The Tango gives me the bonus of printing unlimited photos. Admittedly the photo paper doesn&#x27;t cost much less than printing photos at retailers, but fun to have it at your house.')
