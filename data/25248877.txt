We prohibit, for example, job boards that are explicitly designed to favor (or be exclusive to) members of one race. Even if there are a lot of employers and employees who would appreciate such a service.<p>If you don&#x27;t think THOSE rules are wrong, then are you REALLY sure you want to criticize how Japan chooses to organize their own approach to the topic? They have chosen to license the people who do the connecting rather than introduce legal liability for those who discriminate (and are sloppy enough about it to leave enough evidence to prevail in court).<p>I&#x27;m not saying control of discrimination is the reason that Japan licenses job recruitment, but I DO think that it requires a more thoughtful and open-minded approach that asks more about the benefits gained before dismissing out of hand the approach of requiring a license.')
