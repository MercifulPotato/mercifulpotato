I have a few all using boards with 433MHz LoRa radios, most of the hardware supported is available in 433&#x2F;815&#x2F;915MHz variants. (In fact, I’m fairly sure most of the chipsets are capable of all those frequencies, and the only real difference if you buy the 433MHz version is the antenna they include.)')
