The parent poster&#x27;s view is correct with regards to my experience.<p>Yes, for some people antipsychotics, antidepressants, etc. are a godsend and the difference between living a mostly normal and productive life vs. jumping off a bridge, dying in a homeless encampment because they cannot feed themselves, or committing violent acts against others. To clarify, none of these are hyperbole or exaggeration -- those are two extremes on outcome with mental health issues and antipsychotics can be the difference between the two.<p>That being said, many, if not most, physicians I have worked with agree with the parent comment. For many patients these medications are not effective and are used as chemical restraints [0] rather than with the goal of normalizing their mental health. Eventually the logic becomes &quot;we&#x27;ll never fix them, but we can sedate them so much they won&#x27;t hurt themselves or others&quot; so dosages progressively increase until the patient becomes more sedated and somewhat zombie like. This isn&#x27;t hospital specific; I have seen it across 3-4 different hospitals in different states. Neuroscience and psychiatry is a very young field and the truth is that we do not know what causes mental health issues or how to deal with them. The chemical imbalance theory is just that, a theory, and more importantly, one with very little scientific proof and backing [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicinenet.com&#x2F;what_is_an_example_of_chemical_restraint&#x2F;article.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicinenet.com&#x2F;what_is_an_example_of_chemical_r...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;chemical-imbalance-in-the-brain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;chemical-imbalance-in-the-...</a>')
