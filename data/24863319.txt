I don&#x27;t have an issue with them reverse engineering bank APIs, I just don&#x27;t get why, how and to whom they would want to sell that.<p>Any small change in any of these APIs completely ruins it for all of their clients. Not even sure if they have a product or service either but again, also not sure who would want that.')
