So, I agree with you that I&#x27;d, on balance, prefer to see trading open in these names. I think people should do what they want with their money, even if I think it&#x27;s stupid and likely to end badly.<p>At the same time, parabolic moves like this have never once in the history of markets been sustained over a long period of time. It&#x27;s possible that this will be the first one ever, but I am indeed making a prediction that it will not be. You are correct that I might be wrong about that.<p>* - All this assumes that my clearing firm would continue clearing the orders, which is uncertain at the moment. If my clearing firm won&#x27;t book the orders, I literally can&#x27;t do anything except cajol, plead, or sue them.')
