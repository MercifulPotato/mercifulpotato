Why would anyone want to have their bookmarks managed by Google if privacy is their goal. I understand that this is about features you get when you login into browser with your Google account, which I doubt people who value privacy will do anyway. Importing bookmarks (or managing them some other way) seems almost trivial compared to other challenges of using linux, I don&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s such emphasis on this. As for spellchecker - perhaps having your text sent to Google in full is not something necessarily desirable. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something.')
