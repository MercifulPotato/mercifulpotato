I just went through the exact same thing for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Sunboxlabs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Sunboxlabs.com</a> - shareasale et al have high up-fronts or monthlies and their own integration cost. I know people are gonna tell me it’s not worth half a day of engineering&#x2F;debugging, but this is what I did for a roll-your-own affiliate mvp: write a ten line script to check the search params and set them as local storage or cookie. On checkout pass that cookie through to PayPal. Done!<p>Obviously I’m not getting the exposure of shareasale, impact, etc from being on their platform, but I can still sign up for them once I’ve validated that affiliate works for high ticket item hardware.')
