In 2013, the TRL scale was further canonized by the ISO 16290:2013 standard.[1] A comprehensive approach and discussion of TRLs has been published by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations (EARTO).[3] Extensive criticism of the adoption of TRL scale by the European Union was published in The Innovation Journal, stating that the &quot;concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs)&quot;.&quot;')
