Anyone working with ZFS implicitly cares about building physical systems (so they can abstract over them), so without being especially on topic, my question and the ensuing responses create “peer reviewed” information that is germane to the same crowd of people reading the thread. It’s like a human powered recommendation engine: “interested in this thing? Here’s a sampling of the neighborhood of nearby topics that people who are interested in this about also care about.” It lets you traverse an idea space at an organic, human level in a way that no other medium manages. A+ would ask and answer tangentially related questions.')
