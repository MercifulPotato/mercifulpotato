The important thing is to think, and to interact with others who are thinking, either orally or in writing. I&#x27;d even go so far as to say you could be a philosopher in the fullest sense without ever reading a page of philisophy, although you&#x27;d need to know some smart philosophers to get away with that, and you&#x27;d be unnecessarily holding yourself back anyway.<p>The purpose of reading in philisophy is to become aware of interesting problems, challenging arguments, to notice and comprehend tools of thought, and to avoid spending your time developing your thoughts in a direction someone has already travelled. You can get all of this by talking to smart people, it&#x27;s just that reading is much more efficient.<p>But what you can&#x27;t get away with is just reading, or even just reading and writing. You need others to read what you write, and have them respond to you. Or engage with them back-and-forth orally (although writing really helps to organize your thoughts).<p>If you want to study philisophy, then, you&#x27;ll need to find a way to interact with others who have studied philosophy, and the best place for that is a university, where you could ask to audit a class, or to join in a discussion hosted by a philosophy club.<p>If that&#x27;s not an option, there are internet communities where people discuss philosophy, just be aware that these communities usually form around groups of people who share some philosophical view, and can be insular echo chambers, and they may not be interested in discussing any old philosophical topic. Academic philosophy is filled with bad ideas and counterproductive norms of discourse, and can guide you in completely the wrong direction, but they&#x27;re still the best environment in which to learn to think.')
