Then, a clumsy bit of legislation (AB5) from a legislator with an implacably anti-Uber&#x2F;Lyft agenda outlawed what had been legal, for both Uber&#x2F;Lyft &amp; a bunch of other freelancer-centric industries, destroying lots of work for Californians.<p>Those on the warpath against Uber&#x2F;Lyft have since added exemptions for other industries that they like. The exemptions now include:<p>* (in AB5) Doctors, dentists, insurance agents, lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and hairstylists<p>* (since) Fine artists, Freelance writers, Still photographers, Photojournalists, Freelance editors, Newspaper cartoonists, Translators, Copy Editors, Producers, Cartographers, Musicians with single-engagement live performances, Musicians involved in sound recordings or musical compositions, Insurance inspectors, Real estate appraisers, Manufactured housing salespersons, Youth sports coaches, Landscape architects, Professional foresters<p>I think drivers deserve the same freedom to flexibly contract as those other dozens of professions. I wish Prop 22 were simpler, but it&#x27;s better than AB5, so I&#x27;m an enthusiastic &quot;Yes&quot;.')
