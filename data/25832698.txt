The one you described is close to sanctioned Roman Catholic view, for example.<p>Since _Humani Generis_ by Pope Pius XII, the accepted view is that evolution, indeed, goes as it does, under divine supervision, and then when bodies reached a form fitting the pinnacle of creation (human), another act of creation occurred - that of human soul. And that miracle of creation keeps happening daily for every human born (or conceived?).<p>So, definitely not a Darwinian materialist view, but certainly evolution-friendly.<p>Generally, largest blocker to marrying salvation religions and materialist worldview is with a human. Salvation only concerns humans, and that implies that humans are very special in the Universe. Paganism wasn’t that arrogant, so might be more compatible with scientific method, funnily enough.<p>I’m an atheist, so this, naturally, this is my interpretation of other interpretations I’ve read and heard here and there.')
