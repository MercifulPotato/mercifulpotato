I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a try before quitting.</i><p>A few years ago, I was looking for a new job after being laid off. I had two competing companies to choose from, and chose the one that sounded like it would be more exciting. After about five months, though, I was miserable and called the other company to see if they&#x27;d still take me; they did, and I&#x27;ve been happily working here since.<p>But after I announced my departure, a few engineers from other teams came up and told me they wished I&#x27;d let them know before quitting, since they would have been glad to have me on their team instead. They knew the reasons I was feeling frustrated, and felt confident that those issues were either not a problem on their team, or were at least being worked on. I still kind of wonder how true that was, and what would have happened if I&#x27;d made the switch internally, instead.<p>Anyway, that was kind of a long and boring story - two whole paragraphs! - but I think this was probably the one of the more valuable parts of OP&#x27;s post. An internal team change is often a lot less stressful and less risky than going to a different company.')
