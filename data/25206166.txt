I don’t run any complex strategies, partly so I can spend my time on identifying winners instead. Just buying calls or puts, sometimes spreads. I don’t have a way to automate that, it’s just reading a lot and trying to formulate and rank possibilities<p>It’s my first year and I’m only at a 10% return in my fun money portfolio (vs 50% on just buy and hold QQQ) despite a few multi baggers because of not cutting losses earlier. Hoping to do better this year and add some basic stop losses at least.<p>I may add more automation and start building my own tools now ,this past year I focused on trading manually so I know what would be useful to build in the first place. I’m building a basic Jupyter notebook to analyze previous trades and explore the API.')
