Excel is far more familiar - it looks like a normal program, has context menus, and has a conceptually simple model of execution: you say what you want a cell to be, and it just automagically becomes that value. No lisp syntax or keyboard shortcuts need to be learned, and nothing new needs to be installed.<p>I agree that Emacs is more extensible, but it doesnâ€™t make itself as available to regular computer users as something like Excel does.')
