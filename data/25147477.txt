But I’ve decided I’m out. Ryzen-based machines have caught up; Windows has caught up; and I’m willing to give the Linux desktop the benefit of the doubt again. Every new macOS release I feel more and more boiled to death, more locked in, more exploited than before. Even the eyecandy, which was what I loved OSX from the very first release, is now <i>utterly terrible</i> and getting worse release after release.<p>I was happy to pay a premium for a premium platform, but this is not what I’ve been getting in the last 5 years - what I’ve been getting is a support role to the iPhone ecosystem that is the alpha and the omega of Apple’s strategy, and more and more restrictions to satisfy this role. Obviously this is good for them, but it just isn’t for me, so I’m out.')
