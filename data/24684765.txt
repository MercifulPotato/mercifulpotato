I built something really similar about 3 years ago, a few months before my 4th child was born. Then I lost interest lol.  Super barebones POC <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justwatchwith.me&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justwatchwith.me&#x2F;</a> The idea was that you could stream videos directly from your machine and watch in sync with remote friends and family, controlling the playback with a pause button. I didn&#x27;t maintain it for a while after I built the POC because not many of my friends &#x2F; family were very interested at the time. If I only had more time to improve it..... they probably would&#x27;ve appreciated it more under current circumstances if I continued to work on it lol')
