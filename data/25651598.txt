Item(by='Crosseye_Jack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609883260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651021, text='&gt; I&#x27;d argue that it should be within our rights to have discussions about breaking laws we don&#x27;t agree with.<p>My point is they wasn&#x27;t so much discussing breaking the laws we don&#x27;t agree with but more out right telling people to disregrad the law.<p>Its differnt (at least in my eyes) to have a discussion about should cannabis be legal (in my mind it should be) than saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t bother with the law and just spark up where you like because the goverments reasoning is wrong&quot; which they were kinda doing by invisting people on and saying &quot;don&#x27;t bother wearing masks&quot;. I know thats a stretch, and not 1 to 1 with my arguement. But I think having a discussion about why you think a law shouldn&#x27;t stand and telling your listeners to just ignore the law are two differnt things.<p>As much as I fell that weed shouldn&#x27;t be illegal in the UK its a differnt thing to me to suggest that your should spark up while picking your kids up from outside a school if that makes any sense.<p>Ideally it shouldn&#x27;t matter if you spark up a joint outside of a school just like its perfect fine to spark up a cigarette outside a school (just like when I order a mcdonnalds via just eat (they have lower delivery charges) they moan about refusing to deliever to outside of schools, but its still legal). But TalkRadio wasn&#x27;t so much saying question what the goverment are saying, but outright saying &quot;just ignore what the goverment are saying&quot; (I would love to link to a clip of it as it popped up in my YT feed, but its obv been nuked).<p>But yeah I don&#x27;t think it should of been nuked (so I could of shown why I disagree with them, in order to do so now, I&#x27;m gonna have to dig into their own archives to find that clip).<p>BUT on the other hand, if something is really messing with your rights as just an ave joe, surely your should have the right to object to it how ever you feel is right to do so.<p>Which is why i&#x27;m so on the fence against it.<p>As someone who really dislikes how they (TalkRadio) expressed their objection to the rules. I feel it should of been countered with objections from the other side of the arguement instead of being nuked from orbit. So as much as it pains me to say (because I disagree with them) they should be put back on YouTube.<p>What this is making me &quot;hate&quot; more is Google (along with the other tech gaints) thinking they have the right to control what even the idoits think.<p>Why? because one day they will disagree with me, even if its about tab sizes, and I don&#x27;t want to be nuked from orbit because I&#x27;m not a fan about tabs and spaces fuck up python code :-P<p>&gt; ... I&#x27;ve suffered with depression most my life and one of the few things that helps me is being out in nature...<p>for me its been my IRL friends. Most of them are non techies, which helps me center myself. It reminds me that not everyone spends all day infront of code and I hope allows me to create easyier to use code for them.   And I miss them just talking their normal days, and the things they like so its not all just &quot;geek&quot;. (which is a reason I dislike the lock downs :-p)<p>anyways I&#x27;ll stop rambling now. I just needed to get that out of my system :-)<p>EDIT: sorry for the ramble.... But Why should my morals be &quot;law&quot;? even if I don&#x27;t argee with them. doesn&#x27;t me their point isn&#x27;t valid. (even if it drives me fucking nuts....)')
