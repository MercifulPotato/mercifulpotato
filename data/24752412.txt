I get the superficial appeal of this. But there are dozens of popular Javascript CDNs available. What are the chances that your user has visited a site which uses the exact same CDN as your site?<p>&gt; Quite high - if you&#x27;re using the Google CDN I&#x27;d imagine.<p>Quite low in reality as there&#x27;s no critical mass â€“ most sites don&#x27;t use the same versions of common resources.<p>Google fonts is one of the better candidates for shared caching working but resources just don&#x27;t live in the browser cache for very long (Facebook, Yahoo studies)')
