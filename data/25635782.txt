Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25636303], score=None, time=1609785092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635234, text='&gt; Well, Chelsea Manning was the actual whistleblower in this situation<p>Granted, Manning was the one who provided Wikileaks the files. But, lets not omit that Sara Harrison and Julian were critical in getting Edward out of Hong Kong and his gravitas made the Bitcoin community to go against Satoshi and donated to keep Wikileaks alive and made all of this possible.<p>Cypherpunks are not going to live up to people&#x27;s ideal image but they sure as hell get a lot done. And Julian is yet another reminder of that fact.<p>&gt; Reality Winner is also still in prison, due to The Intercept&#x27;s egregious mishandling of her leaks.<p>To be fair it was shared amounts of mishandling [0], which for someone who worked as an NSA contractor in cryptology related fields should have some understanding of OPSEC; but maybe she rished it and hoped they would do it on their end?<p>I&#x27;m not victim blaming, and the Intercept clearly dropped the ball and should have sat on it and taken care of this before running it. But this is why I think Defcon and the CCC should be mandatory watching for people in and especially in tech before anyone decides to do involved in &#x27;hacktivism&#x27; or anything like it.<p>In fact, in the early days of Bitcoin they wanted to create an anonymous drop for journalists and leaders that would pay bounties to gray&#x2F;white hats to do go over these kind of things, but this opened the door to so much foul play that it was dropped all together. Still, I hope Reality takes solace in knowing that Trump will be out of office when she gets out, but that her Obama bias was probably not everything she thought it was when you look at the amount of Whistleblower cases that were prosecuted.<p>Either way, I hope she is well and that the Intercept do the honourable thing make amends and give her a well paid role there.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xorl.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;opsec-fail-reality-winner-the-intercept&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xorl.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;opsec-fail-reality-win...</a>')
