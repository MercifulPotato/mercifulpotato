If your volume is high then you can amortize that cost.  If not then you probably go to an FPGA.  An FPGA has a high per part cost but no custom mask costs and you can reprogram it in a few hours &#x2F; days instead of 2 months for a new custom chip to be manufactured.<p>A high end FPGA already has hardened CPU blocks, USB and PCIE interfaces, and lots of other things built in.  Then it has a large area of generic reconfigurable logic that you can customize to do whatever you want.<p>This reconfigurable logic will not be as fast as a custom chip but it is still far faster than software and can be used to implement your own CPU (assuming you don&#x27;t want to use the hardened CPU or got an FPGA without them)')
