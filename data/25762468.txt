I&#x27;ve been keeping my eye on NeRF but it seems a long way from being useful for anything realtime.<p>Vectors and mesh representations seem somewhat neglected and this project has given me some insight into the technical problems.<p>I&#x27;ve finally got CUDA running on WSL so I intend to start having a play with things. I&#x27;ve also got beta access to GPT-3 and I&#x27;ve been curious if it can do anything interesting in terms of generating structured data. Can it manipulate symbolic scene descriptions or generate meaningful vector paths? A few experiments with SVG haven&#x27;t been terribly promising.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on the general topic and any suggestions for things to look into.')
