You’d forbid it from engaging in any advertising businesses. Then you’d free up people to build consumer-facing search interfaces and compete to sell advertising on them.</i><p>What does selling ads look like if search is not a monopoly? As an advertiser in the new world, I&#x27;d have to go around and buy ads on all the new search front-ends. I probably want to pay them proportionally to how much traffic they get (well, conversions, but let&#x27;s say traffic). If there&#x27;s a small number of large front-ends then maybe I go to each of them directly, but if there&#x27;s a long tail of front-ends then probably there&#x27;d be a search middleman who the various front-ends contract with... I guess there&#x27;s still Google Search, and Google AdSense, but now AdSense also sells ads on other front-ends, and Google Search works with other brokers besides AdSense?')
