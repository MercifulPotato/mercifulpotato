Gosh, I don&#x27;t spend much time on Facebook, but I easily scroll through 500-1000 posts every few days. I haven&#x27;t seen one I would truly call hate. Oh sure, there are a few friends who say  nasty things about the politician they dislike, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me has hate speech.<p>Now I&#x27;m not denying that they&#x27;re out there. They must be. But 1&#x2F;1000 seems like a pretty high estimate. There are sooo many pictures of cats and grandkids and that cake someone just made.')
