We occasionally had that issue, but mostly my group of friends and coworkers shared some basic rules for using the push-to-talk.  E.g. no pushing the button and then just saying something, unless you were already talking back and forth; the first chirp was always an empty chirp.  If the other party was available, then they could respond.  Stuff like that.  I can see that with some raunchy high school friends it could get pretty awkward.')
