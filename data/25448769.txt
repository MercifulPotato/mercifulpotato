You can&#x27;t just use modern Gtk on those platforms partly because it doesn&#x27;t compile and partly because carrying the whole &quot;G stack²&quot; on those distros for a 3 dialog wizard would be a nightmare.<p>¹ 2007 and 2010 respectively, not sure off the top of my head what versions of Gtk those have, but old.<p>² It&#x27;s not just Gtk, but glib and dozens of other libraries.')
