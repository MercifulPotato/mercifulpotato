Apparently it can only be run through a user gesture (DOM event), but I have to run it from the background script in order to be persistent at all times, no matter if the popup is closed or the user closes or navigates away from certain tabs. It explains the lack of screen recorders for Firefox, the few I found have the workaround of opening a separate tab with a button to start recording, but it is extremely counter-intuitive, plus if the user closes that tab at any time, the recording would automatically stop. Here&#x27;s the discussion in the repo if you&#x27;d like to share your thoughts, I could do that same workaround myself but I&#x27;m not fond of releasing an unintuitive product: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alyssaxuu&#x2F;screenity&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3#issuecomment-731720859" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alyssaxuu&#x2F;screenity&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3#issuecomment...</a>')
