This isn&#x27;t my field of expertise and it certainly isn&#x27;t yours.  No offense, but the 45 minutes you spent between my post and this one is not a &quot;literature review.&quot;  I am a professional scientist and for my most recent publication it took me three weeks to cover the literature on my one narrow finding.  That was already after spending the last five years in a PhD becoming an expert in my field!  The three weeks was spent deeply reading almost every significant paper on the topic I was publishing on.  That is what literature review means and you don&#x27;t really understand the nuances of applying Benford&#x27;s law to election fraud by spending 45 minutes browsing wikipedia and skimming abstracts.<p>If the political science experts who have spent decades studying the facts surrounding Benford&#x27;s law disagree that it is a reliable indicator of fraud then what are we doing running sketchy analyses and then making huge leaps to claim it as &quot;mathematical proof that the democrats stole the election.&quot;  And yes, that is a conspiracy theory with all of the hallmarks of one.  It is to the point that state election officials are having to waste their time to go on television and debunk literal lies and disinformation that are being broadcast by certain political figures.  Judges are already tossing Trump&#x27;s lawsuits because even his lawyers have to tell the judges that they have no evidence of fraud.  The continued assertion that Democrats are &quot;stealing the election&quot; is the conspiracy theory here and it is literally dangerous.  A bomb threat was called into a Philadelphia counting center.  Vote counters are being escorted to and from counting locations by the police for their protection from armed mobs that are aggregating in some areas.  You&#x27;ll have to excuse me if I&#x27;m already tired of seeing these baseless claims show up over and over again when not even Trump himself can pull out evidence to support them when it comes time to do so in court.<p>If you want to learn about Benford&#x27;s law then good on you.  I think that it is a really interesting topic and there is some good entertainment to be had in learning about it.  However, it&#x27;s delusional for people like the author of this article to spend an evening learning about it and then act like it is the magic bullet from the Kennedy assassination.')
