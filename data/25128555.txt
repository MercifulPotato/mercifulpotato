The candidate pool is biased - in terms of demographics, under-30, college-educated, coastal-city individuals are dramatically skewed to the left. I think as IT workers get older, have families, and high paying jobs and education become more accessible to rural areas, we&#x27;ll see a shift to the center.<p>2. Tech companies are in the spotlight of the &quot;culture wars&quot; - if your platform is an echo chamber for the narratives of the media, those narratives will eventually become descriptive of your company&#x27;s identity.<p>3. H1-B visas and outsourcing is great economics for tech companies. This also reinforces the imperative for domestic workers and company culture to be highly inclusive.<p>4. More of a soft-factor, I think since most of tech&#x27;s growth happened under Obama, there was an incentive for companies that were still finding their culture to align themselves with the administration and ruling powers at the time.<p>5.
