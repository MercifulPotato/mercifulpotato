Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25367834], score=None, time=1607557581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362966, text='The Constitution doesn&#x27;t say anything about &quot;separation of church and state.&quot; The Establishment Clause says: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&quot;<p>This is one of those funny areas where liberals get originalist and turn to the writings of Thomas Jefferson. The &quot;separation of church and state&quot; view derives from a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1802. Of course, TJ wasn&#x27;t even in the United States at the time the Constitution was written, and he was a bit of a kook even in his day. The thing you have to remember is that &quot;establishment&quot; had a specific meaning back then--several states had &quot;established&quot; churches: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtsu.edu&#x2F;first-amendment&#x2F;article&#x2F;801&#x2F;established-churches-in-early-america" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtsu.edu&#x2F;first-amendment&#x2F;article&#x2F;801&#x2F;established...</a>. Given that, the most sensible reading is that the Establishment Clause prohibits Congress from regulating those established churches: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholarship.law.upenn.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1280&amp;context=jcl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholarship.law.upenn.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?articl...</a>.<p>The &quot;separation of church and state&quot; view is odd because several states had <i>official established churches</i> until long after the Constitution was adopted: &quot;New Hampshire kept its establishment until 1817; Connecticut kept its establishment until 1818; and Massachusetts did not abandon its state support for Congregationalism until 1833.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re incorrect to characterize <i>Engel v. Vitale</i> as saying schools &quot;cannot force children to participate in a prayer.&quot; That would be a straightforward violation of the first amendment Free Exercise Clause. The New York law in that case was voluntary--it <i>encouraged</i> but did not require students to participate in prayer. The case banned prayer in schools with any sort of official sanction.<p><i>Engel</i> is odd even leaving aside the original meaning of the Establishment Clause. Public support for religion is the norm, and sometimes even a constitutional right, throughout Europe. Several European countries, such as the Germany, Italy, and Spain, guarantee that parents can access religious education in public schools. The U.K. goes further and mandates daily school prayer &quot;of a broadly Christian character.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Collective_worship_in_schools" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Collective_worship_in_schools</a>. (Funnily enough, Spain has a constitutional provision that says &quot;no religion shall have a state character.&quot; Nobody reads that to preclude teaching religion in public schools.)')
