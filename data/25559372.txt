Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609165435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558879, text='From someone solidly in the age bracket that is supposedly discriminated against, what utter nonsense.<p>This is a bunch of hand-wavey garbage with no actual data backing it up. Some anonymous &quot;surveys&quot; and uncited statements of fact starting with &quot;Chances are&quot; or &quot;in some cases.&quot;<p>&gt; <i>Even if you get offered a position you will likely be offered a lower wage if going for a junior job.</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s how it works. You get paid for the position. If you have the experience for a senior role, don&#x27;t go for a junior job and expect a senior paycheck. If you don&#x27;t have the experience and can only apply for a junior role, why should you get paid more? Your mortgage and kids&#x27; tuition is irrelevant to the value you&#x27;re providing to the company.<p>&gt; <i>For a 50-year-old it may prove a struggle to make a career change pay off and could take several years to climb the ladder to reach a livable wage.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t the common refrain to 20-somethings that they should just eat out less and live with roommates if they&#x27;re not making enough money? If it&#x27;s that easy then the 50-year-old should do it, too.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for small mom-and-pop companies and large public corporations. Every supposed example of &quot;ageism&quot; I&#x27;ve seen in real life is much more about attitude than age.<p>&gt; <i>Training and promotion opportunities may not go your way if youâ€™re older. They may be offered to younger staff</i><p>Again with the hand-wavey &quot;may not go your way...may be offered,&quot; but I don&#x27;t accept the premise anyway. In my experience training is allocated based on how enthusiastically someone wants to get training, and how willing they are to follow-up and ask about funding, getting time on the work schedule, etc. If your attitude is &quot;I know everything I need to know to get my job done,&quot; the company is unlikely to go out of their way to spend thousands on training you.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the &quot;f you, I know everything I need to&quot; attitude from 27 year old jerks, and I&#x27;ve seen 60-something programmers tearing through the framework du jour without any trouble. It has nothing to do with stagnation and everything to do with willingness to learn, willingness to listen, willing to do something new, and whether or not you think everyone has something they could teach you.')
