Sounds like everyone is grasping at straws right now. In the early days of an investigation, that&#x27;s understandable for investigators, but the press grabs each of these theories as they come out and runs with them. If it turns out that the 5G paranoid theory is incorrect, doubt there will be even a token retraction or clarification. Instead it will be move on to the next thing and pretend the previous one was never suggested.')
