I attached a speaker to a raspberry pi and use its hardware random number generator to make that sort of noise. It&#x27;s a pleasant, smooth rumble that I leave on all night. I certainly find it helps a lot (I&#x27;m prone to insomnia) and I&#x27;d be astonished if it&#x27;s having any negative physiological effect.')
