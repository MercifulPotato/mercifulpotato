Here we have companies <i>competing</i> for employees, and then those employees <i>collaborating</i> anew.<p>Or a company might <i>license</i> certain IP from <i>another</i>, this is a form of collaboration too.<p>In this sense, collaboration and competition aren&#x27;t necessarily opposing paradigms, they can be tools to apply to the situation.')
