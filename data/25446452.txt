AMD can produce chips (and solutions) at much more scale (and thus far less expensive) than relatively small Innosilicon can. AMD has closer relationships to the fabs.<p>It also is other factors that go into this. Like the critical memory controller component. AMD owns the patents. AMD can also buy memory chips in larger bulk (and thus less expensive).<p>Also, the R&amp;D on GPU&#x27;s is an already amortized cost. They already exist. ASICs have to be engineered from the ground up and do what GPU&#x27;s already do.<p>At the end of the day, this is also beneficial because GPU&#x27;s can be repurposed, while sha256 ASICs are just e-waste every time a new round of smaller nm tech comes out.')
