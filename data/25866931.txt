You can generally write, build, and test applications entirely locally using containers. Port forward to remote dependency resources via your vpn if needed.<p>I think you’d pay back the costs of a pretty good laptop vs AWS workstation or EC2 instance (not VM - Instance) within a few months.<p>The only scenario where we use AWS Workstations is to provide in-country workstations for offshore resources in certain compliance situations.<p>If your builds or tests are taking too long due to compute constraints on your local workstation, maybe AWS CodeDeploy or something like that could help offload that to the cloud efficiently.<p>The pricing for AWS instances at least is pretty clearly stated on their site if you google for it.<p>Id recommend maybe looking at some AWS 101 YouTube videos to understand the space a little better.<p>Heroku is a pretty easy to grok cloud platform as well, efficient way to bootstrap but maybe not long term.')
