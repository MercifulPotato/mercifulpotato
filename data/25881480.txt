If you don&#x27;t have that, superglue will do nothing for you and you&#x27;re better off with something else. If you do, it&#x27;s quite strong.<p>The annoying thing is, glues work best when you use them in the exact situation (material, pressure, etc) they are designed for, but manufacturers are really vague about active ingredients or fillers, so you end up having to buy broad-spectrum glues that are not particularly good at anything.')
