Just as hard as outperforming the market consistently, in fact. They’re wasting their time, but time you enjoy wasting is not wasted, etc.<p>I don’t really feel the same way about options though. I don’t have a great explanation as to why. But options and the associated leverage are a totally distinct issue from picking individual stocks - options trading by retail investors is just gambling even if the underlying is SPY and not a psilocybin penny stock or whatever.')
