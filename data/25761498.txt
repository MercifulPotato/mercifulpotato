If they tried to help me out, it would not help at all, because they didn&#x27;t know how to use different perspectives or modes. I suggested several times that I would be more engaged if I could find an interesting way to engage with the material. I liked history, and problem solving. But much of the time, the only method the teachers would use was rote memorization or some formula which didn&#x27;t make sense. There wasn&#x27;t context or a story, just abstract concepts, and no visual clues, hierarchies, etc.<p>If somebody had listened to me and basically captured my user story and feedback, perhaps they could have found similar situations and developed a couple different structures for organizing and presenting the material. Or maybe I&#x27;m just weird.')
