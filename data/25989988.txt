My academic background started in the area of speech and musical audio processing, but more broadly I&#x27;ve applied myself as the digital signal processing field has expanded. I&#x27;ve worked with data ranging from neural recordings, to fingerprints, and general image classification tasks. My current role has both involved low level implementation in C&#x2F;C++ as well as high level DNN training of models in Python. My time outside of my primary role focuses on overseeing a long lived open source software project, which helps keep software skills honed.<p>Ideally I am looking for a role which works on state of the art systems for ethically applied machine learning, DSP, and data sciences.')
