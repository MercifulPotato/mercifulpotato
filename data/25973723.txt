More than anything it&#x27;s driven by the hyperbole produced by popular media.<p>I have watched the right and left respond to the media&#x27;s outrage of the day, week, month, on cue, and stop just as fast, for years now.<p>More than anything our political divide is a result of our fandom based culture and &quot;fans&quot; don&#x27;t care about facts. We grow up with this. If you&#x27;re born in New York you&#x27;re either a Mets or a Yankees fan and the other team sucks and always will no matter what the facts are.<p>Every night CNN and FOX compete to see who can stir up the most outrage in their fan base. We&#x27;ve got to the point where you&#x27;re either a &quot;fascist&quot; or a &quot;socialist&quot;. There is no middle ground for the hard core fan and they make the most noise.<p>QAnon is another fine example. Those fans love to wallow in their shared insults and disdain for those who don&#x27;t &quot;follow Q&quot;. They&#x27;re &quot;smart&quot; and everyone else is a fool. The find great joy in believing that and they will not give it up for anyone&#x27;s &quot;personal experiences&quot;. They&#x27;ll give it up when it &quot;goes out of style&quot;.<p>Most fans move on eventually because trends go stale and fandom feeds on trendiness. Our &quot;Media&quot; is constantly looking for &quot;the next trend&quot; (&quot;outrage of the month&quot; in the case of politics) and when they see one with potential they&#x27;ll push it for all it&#x27;s worth and squeeze it til the last nickle is made out of it.<p>We all love the concept of &quot;free speech&quot; but we live in a time where bullshit goes viral and can be deadly when it does. Where I live 55% of my neighbors believe &quot;masks don&#x27;t work&quot; while 1 in 70 of them who&#x27;ve gotten infected with covid-19 have died. Last year I saw them claim &quot;the vaccine has a tracker chip in it&quot;, &quot;proof that mask don&#x27;t work is I can smell my farts when I wear one&quot;, &quot;the virus is a hoax&quot;.<p>We have to figure out how to deal with these issues. With over 400,000 lives lost to covid-19 just here in the U.S. de-platforming bullshitters has to be on the table.')
