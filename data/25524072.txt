I&#x27;d argue that the NK article was fine as it -- it was about the soldiers long story coming to a close. Was it by virtue of the actions of T? Sure, I&#x27;ll give him that. Did he need to be specifically praised for that in the context? No, it wasn&#x27;t about him, it was about the soldiers.<p>The second article is a &quot;culture&quot; piece and the inclusion of T in that is a head scratcher. I was not impressed by it (regardless of the random T tidbit).<p>That&#x27;s a sample size of 2, and while both could be arguable evidence for your position, it&#x27;s not of much to work with.<p>You say you&#x27;re not a T. follower, but you imply that &quot;the media&quot; is not fair to him. Were you aware of any of his conduct in these past 4 years? Nothing out of the ordinary?<p>Are you aware that he&#x27;s actively trying to overthrow the election that he lost? Does that seem ok to you? Are you aware of Bush v. Gore?<p>I could go on and on if you wished. But the more important thing is: if I am correct and I&#x27;m unable to persuade you then where does that leave us? How can we fix a problem that &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;?')
