Another comment mentioned the standalone &quot;Image Capture.app&quot; which was also news to me.<p>However, all three are using the same underlying implementation. Scanning in color works. Scanning to JPEG works. However my preferred scanning mode (300dpi, A4, to PDF) produces the garbled image seen here[0], and apparently has been doing so since at least 2012 ...<p>My impression is that preview&#x2F;scanner&#x2F;imagecapture all trust the printer to do the conversion to PostScript&#x2F;PDF, but somehow don&#x27;t manage to tell it to use B&amp;W instead of color -- it seems like r&#x2F;g&#x2F;b pixels are treated as individual gray pixels.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.brother.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;b&#x2F;faqend.aspx?c=hk&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=ads2100_eu_as_cn&amp;faqid=faq00002976_000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.brother.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;b&#x2F;faqend.aspx?c=hk&amp;lang=en&amp;pro...</a>')
