And I think some hard-to-treat mental illness is preventing my day-to-day happiness.<p>When I feel envious of others, it&#x27;s not only that they&#x27;re rich and they travel a lot. They also have friends. They might even have a family they care about. They have hobbies and they have _something_ to do. A lot of them say they have problems with mental health, but you can&#x27;t film a year-long depressive episode and upload it to YouTube, so I have to take their word for it. And in truth I don&#x27;t. The world seems clean-split between people who have everything and people who have it even harder than me, and I always just feel alone in this middle ground, where I have all the material elements to be healthy and happy but I can&#x27;t put them together.<p>I have many things other people want, but I never find myself sitting back and saying &quot;I&#x27;m glad I have this.&quot; I always want things I can&#x27;t have, and it hurts a lot.')
