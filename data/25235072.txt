I understand that it is controversial whether this generates usable negative energy or is merely apparent negative energy relative to surrounding vacuum, but Miguel Alcubierre specifically mentions it as the only known experimentally observed negative energy. The problem he points out is that any practical superluminal drive would require morenegative energy than could ever theoretically be extracted via the Casimir effect.')
