But Google Ceo never once claimed she was fired as is pointed out in the article. The headline is straight up deceptive putting words into Sundar Pichai’s mouth.<p>We do not have to like Google or their actions in any matter including this dispute to see that click-baity headlines that deliberately lie lead us to be automatically cynical of the press and assume everything is “fake” news.
