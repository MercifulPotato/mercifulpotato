In the other thread you talk about things like &quot;the decent thing to do&quot;, &quot;showing empathy&quot;, and so on.<p>My question was, why. What&#x27;s it to you. As I said, I don&#x27;t know the woman with the spoons, and I also don&#x27;t play down her predicament.<p>So why do you want me to behave in a certain way? That&#x27;s &quot;lording&quot;, for lack of a better word. You want to determine how other people have to behave.')
