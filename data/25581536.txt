I was very dismissive at first, as a self thought dev. Its really hard for me to learn something unless its helps directly to solve a concrete business problem I’m facing, so I know where you’re coming from.<p>I think my epiphany was when I was trying to learn me some clojure on a couple of weeks sabbatical from work.<p>As a mostly js&#x2F;frontend&#x2F;react dev at the time I was deep into React ecosystem for building SPAs. I knew and largely disliked the amount of code a redux based app would require in order to be “complete” with all the data fetching and state management (this was before hooks and contexts). And then I sew re-frame, that implements a lot of the features in that whole ecosystem, in like 100ish lines of code.<p>Thats BS I told myself. Things are missing! It <i></i>cannot<i></i> be just this code in front of me. But no, it was all there, just elegant and clear. All of the “meat” of the logic distilled to its essence, without any of the boilerplate.<p>It was just that I had to learn all the “higher level” stuff around FP, but it turns out those things are shared and repeated in lots of places, so once you index it in your brain, you can read the business logic itself, without all the additional “fat” of the code. Simply beautiful.')
