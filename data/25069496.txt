All text editors especially the ones we are used to are friction less when we want to quickly open a new file and jot down something. But then, many higher levels things you want to do with chunks of text are not straight forward. You&#x27;ll have to use plugins or write your extensions which sort of do what&#x27;s required, but then they become clunky.<p>Doing the following things in a text editor is very clunky\n1. Drop files from a file browser\n2. A wiki that you&#x27;ll stick to and not want to switch every month.\n3. Write reasonably large documents that you&#x27;d actually also read in a text editor.\n4. Have the same experience on all devices \n5. Tables that are pleasing to the eye.\n6. Visuals cues that enhance understanding of the content.\n7. Select a bunch of text and convert them into pages or todos or tickets.')
