As soon as you get (re)elected you have to start working on getting money for your next election, hence people&#x2F;businesses with money will always have a higher chance of getting time in your schedule. As long as more money equals a higher chance of a position of power in politics it is at a minimum an unfair democracy. No lobbying, no money to politicians outside a fair wage.<p>2.) A two party system will always end up with candidates most voters &quot;can live with&quot;. Everyone else than the biggest candidates are wasted votes. This leads to populism, like how you can be hard on crime&#x2F;immigration&#x2F;whatever and the other candidates have to beat you. This leads to laws like &quot;Three strikes and you&#x27;re out&quot; and candidates like Donald Trump. No more Dem. vs Rep. It fuels hatred &#x2F; Us vs Them mentality.')
