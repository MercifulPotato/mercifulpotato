Elevator operator was never a skilled position in the first place.  The internet has actually created a massive crisis in the western world that we&#x27;re just now starting to realize - local newspapers going out of business is HORRIBLE for a functioning democracy, and nations across the globe are suing companies like google because of it.<p>You&#x27;re insinuating that there will somehow be a new job for the folks put out of work, but fail to explain what that is.  Look no further than Detroit, hundreds of thousands of middle class jobs that are simply gone.  More weight on the economy, fewer middle class citizens, but a handful of shareholders and executives that are significantly more wealthy.<p>While I appreciate the condescending tone, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve even begun to put critical thinking skills to the problem.  You&#x27;re just parroting the same old tired story that justified &quot;trick down economics&quot; which is also based on a reality that doesn&#x27;t exist.')
