The average build time was about 35 minutes over there. It was time consuming to put your changes on build and wait for it to finish. \nWe used to do a remote desktop and it was hard to maintain various systems on my local and remote machine. I spin up a high power azure vm and used to it compile my code, and when the VM was not in use. I used to turn it off. It worked well in reducing time but it was a time consuming effort to turn on and off the VM.\nI converted this pet project to a full time project. You can get an early access to the product.\nPlease let me know what do you think?')
