Regardless of their actual adult income. Which means they often spend ridiculous amounts of time and effort to save tiny amounts of money.<p>I grew up lower middle class instead, so I have other stupid frugal habits. Growing up, my parents never, ever, <i>ever</i> replaced a thing that was working. The only time you were allowed to replace a thing was when it was irredeemably broken.<p>Took me a while to get rid of that habit.')
