According to that paper I referenced, the SMART reallocated sector count is just binary (the critical threshold is 1 sector). Drives with non-zero counts are much more likely to fail but 85% of them are still in service a year later. If you proactively replace them you may indeed have avoided some surprise failures but it&#x27;s actually not a great deal more effective than replacing drives randomly, and it costs money.<p>Also we haven&#x27;t even discussed the online disk repair phenomenon, in which you take a &quot;failed&quot; disk, perform whatever lowest-level format routine the manufacturer has furnished, and get another 5 years of service out of it.
