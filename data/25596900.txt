If you use SCRAM-<i>, you&#x27;re committing your password storage to </i>only* use that method for storing the plaintext. So if you were state-of-the-art 20 years ago and used CRAM-MD5, and then you wanted to upgrade to SCRAM-SHA-1 when that came out... you don&#x27;t have a good migration story, since the password storage has the information needed to validate CRAM-MD5 but not SCRAM-SHA-1, and there&#x27;s no way to regenerate the information for SCRAM-SHA-1 without the plaintext password.<p>But if the authentication server gets the plaintext password, it can validate it against the old CRAM-MD5 storage, see that it matches, and then update the storage to SCRAM-SHA-1 on the fly. The entire process is invisible to the user, who gets a security upgrade in the process.<p>There&#x27;s another class of use-cases, where a service needs to authenticate a user based on a token from another service. But for this, it&#x27;s better to dispense with passwords entirely and instead go to something like Kerberos, where the authentication service gives you tokens in lieu of any password information.')
