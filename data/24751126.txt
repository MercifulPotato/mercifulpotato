Functional? Certainly, but missing the whimsicality of these older machines. I miss that personality. There&#x27;s not much JOY in today&#x27;s MacBook or iPhone. Hoping that we can see a return soon...<p>My dad was a teacher with a whole lab of Macs that I was fortunate enough to grow up around. I remember each incarnation from the 68k on, and there was a definite excitement that bled into hardware design around the time of Mac OS X.<p>For me it’s a bit crushing that I now associate Apple more with the face on the screen than the hammer thrower (Epic’s remake of the 1984 commercial nails it, regardless of the merit of their lawsuit). I have a personal app that would significantly streamline a big part of my work, but it uses private iOS APIs and the big struggle is managing the codesigning, entitlements, and provisioning profiles needed to let my own code run on my own (jailbroken!) device. We may just switch to android devices to get things done, despite our whole staff having iPhones.<p>Either way, I’m told history repeats itself. I share the author’s hope that we’ll see a similarly exciting experiential breakthrough in computing in our lifetimes. Something that enables new possibilities, not just certain functions presented in a catalogue (as it were). Wherever that next company is in its formulation, I’m cheering it on from here.<p>(Sent from an authorized, entitled, and provisioned browser that complied with all EULAs and ToSs on my slightly magical but possibly spying handheld computer)')
