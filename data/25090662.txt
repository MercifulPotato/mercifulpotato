If you take a perfectly healthy person and put them into solitary confinement, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll become depressed. It&#x27;s an extreme example, but my point is that for most people depression is very much circumstantial. If the circumstances can be corrected and no serious trauma was experienced, the depression will probably go away. When cirsumstances cannot be changed or there&#x27;s lasting trauma, medications are an option but outcomes are mixed..<p>There&#x27;s a minority of people whom regardless of their circumstances will be depressed. In this case, the argument that a person&#x27;s monoamine neurotransmitters levels (e.g. serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine) are just naturally out of whack makes sense and medications might be the best option.')
