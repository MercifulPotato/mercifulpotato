(I didn&#x27;t mention that in my original since it&#x27;s a bit less common of a language feature, but it&#x27;s valid too)<p>enforced semicolons and&#x2F;or significant whitespace&#x2F;newlines can resolve this in some cases, but it of course depends on the language.  and diverging too far from common langs has its own downsides too, especially where you&#x27;re changing the interpretation of what are already common patterns.')
