The mushrooms you do at burning man every summer do not make you an expert on the effects of meth and heroin on people who are living under a bridge.<p>2) Placation will make it worse.  Living under a bridge <i>near other homeless people</i> is the problem.  Efforts to decriminalize &quot;the unhoused&quot; make the problem worse.  Look at Portland, SF, Austin, and ever other city that tries this.  It gets worse EVERY TIME.  STOP DOING THIS.<p>To solve the problem:<p>1) Hold humans to a high standard.  No, you can&#x27;t live in the park.  That isn&#x27;t an option.  No you can&#x27;t do drugs.  No you can&#x27;t rob the walgreens.  No you can&#x27;t stand in my front yard at 2:00am screaming.  Doing these things will result in your spending your time locked in jail.<p>2) Get a job.  Places like Albuquerque have program where anybody can show up in the morning and get work doing things like cleaning the parks, cleaning the sidewalks, picking up trash, etc.  This is good.  More of this.<p>3) Our understanding of human psychology does not need &quot;disruption&quot;.  People who spend their time depressed and doing drugs while living in a ditch are going to develop serious stress related mental health issues.  People with structured 9-5 jobs which result in them having a house and food, and something to <i>work towards</i> are universally more mentally healthy.  And it isn&#x27;t the house and the food making them more stable, it&#x27;s the structure.<p>The efforts to fix this stuff: closing the mental health facilities, letting people sleep in their own filth, letting people commit petty crimes: these things make the problem WORSE.  Stop it.  This stuff might make you feel good, but it is at the expense of the people you are exploiting for your good feelings.  Stop being so selfish and accept that the solution to this problem isn&#x27;g going to be happy and fun and worthy of instagram posts.')
