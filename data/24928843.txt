I don&#x27;t have the patience.<p>For me organising means putting all my stuff on the desktop, which then goes in a folder &quot;Old Desktop&quot; when my desktop becomes so full that I can&#x27;t add more files to it :&#x27;). It&#x27;s become a nested chain of old desktops over the years. Yet I never seen to have issues finding even old stuff back. In fact it&#x27;s surprisingly effortless, somehow. When I navigate it, it feels like walking through an old neighbourhood I use to live in but haven&#x27;t visited in a while. Same with my notes mess in OneNote. For some reason it makes sense to my brain.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying different organisation methods in the past but they never stuck. It was a lot of work and didn&#x27;t really make retrieval easier because it was never that hard for me to begin with. So I&#x27;m taking that as a sign this lack of organisation is good enough for me :)')
