This is an art in it self. If you gradually increase the angle eventually you slide down. Train the legs to &quot;stand&quot; like this and gradually increase the angle by tiny amounts. This way it magically qualifies as a zero effort leg exercise. (my legs got huge muscles from it)<p>Get thick curtains to make the room pitch dark. Switch off the lights, adjust the themes and dim the screen to the point you cant see anything on it anymore without getting used to the dark for 5-15 min. This will allow comfortable naps while coding.<p>As soon as a task feels complicated take a nap. It is hilarious to wake up and see absolutely nothing besides text on the screen.')
