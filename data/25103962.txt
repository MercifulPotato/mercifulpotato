He didn&#x27;t even hide the fact that he doesn&#x27;t care that gay marriage or other issues were approved by voters; he would judicially end gay marriage in the name of &quot;religious freedom.&quot; But this freedom only extends to particular forms of Christianity, as Alito is quite comfortable with restricting the religious practices of Muslims and Wiccans.')
