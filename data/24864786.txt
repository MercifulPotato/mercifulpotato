Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=[24864962], score=None, time=1603412035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864532, text='&gt; It seems likely that this will cause ride-sharing not to be economically feasible in rural areas where per-driver utilization is low.<p>Or they will have to make allowances for areas that have very low supply and&#x2F;or supply that is very dispersed.  For example, charging for some&#x2F;all of the the time&#x2F;distance from the driver&#x27;s origination point to the pickup point.  That will necessarily make ride sharing more expensive in those places, but that&#x27;s because <i>providing rides in those places is more expensive</i>.<p>Another option that might work in tandem is to allow drivers to log in as a sort of &quot;if the offer is good enough I&#x27;ll take it&quot; sort of tier, and then you might get a lot more people in rural areas signed in in that state, and while any one potential driver might reject, a lot more eyes might see it that wouldn&#x27;t bother to have been looking before, and that might make cheaper rides more likely as closer people are logged in as potential drivers.  It&#x27;s worth noting something like this might also have kept Uber&#x2F;Lyft from having to classify the drivers as employees in the first place, since as I understand it choice of work is a big part of why they didn&#x27;t qualify as contractors.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also possible they&#x27;ll decide they won&#x27;t want to dilute their brands by offering a service which makes you wait 7 minutes for a ride.<p>7 minutes is actually on the lowest end I&#x27;ve seen where I live, and that&#x27;s in a metro area of ~250k people.  Usually it seems to be around 15-20 minutes.  Maybe it&#x27;s just particularly slow around here, but my guess is that you don&#x27;t get under 10 minute pickup times on average anywhere except for major cities.')
