The team heated a mix of citric acid, hydrogen and an iron-manganese-potassium catalyst to turn CO2 into a liquid fuel capable of powering jet aircraft.<p>The approach is inexpensive, uncomplicated and uses commonplace materials. Itâ€™s cheaper than processes used to turn hydrogen and water into fuel.&quot;')
