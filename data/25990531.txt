A little unsure about what to build given the limitations. It seems to expect the user to use direct SSH access to servers for anything that would normally involve sending more than trivial amounts of data to the server.<p>The most interesting part IMO is the restriction to use user-managed TLS client certs as the exclusive way to identify a user. Nice way to both securely manage user identity without clumsy passwords and all of the issues they bring, and easily allow the user to have zero, one, or many identities and switch among them anytime they feel like it. Eliminating cookies and other such things in favor of it eliminates third-party tracking and puts the user in charge of who knows who they are and when.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Gemini itself has a big future beyond a niche circle of bloggers. I would like to see the client cert feature be widely adopted within HTTP though. Maybe, among other things, Gemini can also be a lab to test out ideas that might make the mainstream web a better place too.')
