Gifted and talented programs exist in many if not most places. In multiple areas I’ve lived, the “local” (it might be over an hour away) university has offered some form of extremely talented youth program, although perhaps not at 12.<p>For kids who are so smart that those programs aren’t enough, it often stops becoming a question of money and more just numbers- kids that are 1&#x2F;100,000 level smart and live in an area where there are a million people, then the school system sees less than one of you per year&#x2F;grade. There aren’t enough “peers” to get a full class together.<p>I’m with you that GATE programs are beneficial and worth funding, but there will always be exceptions that a general program can’t cover and I can believe this kid is one of them.')
