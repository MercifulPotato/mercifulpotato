Says so right at the top in the first paragraph.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say it was an Internet standard. I said standardised. Ok, I&#x27;ll concede it is more of an informal or <i>de facto</i> standard but when IBM, W3C, IETF, OKF and others all publish the same parsing rules for CSV, it&#x27;s hard to agree when people make statements like &quot;there&#x27;s no standard in CSV&quot;. The problem isn&#x27;t that there isn&#x27;t a standard to CSV, the problem is that people often don&#x27;t follow those conventions. But you have that same problem with other file formats too.<p>&gt; <i>I think I have a few thousand files on my computer right now whose names end in &quot;.csv&quot;, and I&#x27;ll bet money not one of them agrees with RFC4180 to the letter except by accident of the data itself, and that&#x27;s a Real Problem to me.</i><p>That&#x27;s just conjecture. And even if that were proven true, it&#x27;s still only anecdotal. That said, I do sympathise with your point. But you could make the same argument for<p>- JSON files that don&#x27;t follow spec (support for comments, aren&#x27;t UTF-8 encoded, have been manually written so don&#x27;t follow the escaping rules correctly and thus only parse correctly by chance).<p>- XML files that have been manually cranked and so don&#x27;t follow schema<p>- HTML documents that don&#x27;t follow specification and thus browsers do a lot of non-specification interpretation work to render correctly<p>The IT industry is littered with example of people not following the docs. CSV isn&#x27;t unique in that regard.<p>&gt; <i>I can concede that two parties could agree to interchange according to RFC4180, but as a general format I maintain that for archival and interchange purposes CSV cannot be divorced from the rather complex schema I alluded to without data loss.</i><p>I wasn&#x27;t commenting on whether it&#x27;s a better format than another file format. I was commenting on your points about standardisation saying there are an abundance of published documents on how to read and write a standard CSV file and C-style escaping isn&#x27;t part of that specification.')
