The subjects all knew whether they have COVID-19 or not and knowing how strong psychological effects can be, what&#x27;s detectable in their cough might be their <i>knowledge</i> they&#x27;re sick. The researchers even acknowledge in the paper that &quot;sentiment&quot; is a big part of how a forced cough sounds.<p>What&#x27;s worrying is also how little of the data was from a diagnostic test (over half of &quot;positive&quot; samples were &quot;self-diagnosed&quot; COVID-19, whatever that means).<p>I don&#x27;t think FDA or any other regulatory body would accept such an app as a screening tool without a proper trial being done.<p>If it works, that would be the most practical and coolest application of ML I&#x27;ve seen - but it still feels like something from the &quot;too good to be true&quot; category at the moment.')
