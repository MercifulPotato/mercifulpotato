Would you say they&#x27;re incorrect? Is their data old? Etc.<p>It&#x27;s probably a combination of a couple things.<p>1) the article&#x27;s editorializing of the data doesn&#x27;t match up with the actual raw data -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MEPAINUSA672N" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MEPAINUSA672N</a>. This raw FRED data is basically as close to the &quot;primary source&quot; as you can get with this sort of thing.<p>2) the article looks at total benefits costs and compares them with total wages and salaries, which should set off a couple alarm bells: in the US <i>total compensation</i> is what we need to look at. Basically, they&#x27;re double counting healthcare costs by ignoring the fact that employers pay the majority of premium costs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;report-section&#x2F;ehbs-2019-section-6-worker-and-employer-contributions-for-premiums&#x2F;attachment&#x2F;figure-6-4-16&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;report-section&#x2F;ehbs-2019-section-6-worke...</a>), while also counting the full cost of those benefits against the after-wage dollar amounts. In other words, we&#x27;ve all been receiving huge phantom raises, and we just don&#x27;t know it because it doesn&#x27;t show up in our bank accounts.<p>3) They don&#x27;t take into account taxes and transfers, which median earners broadly enjoy. To give you a sense, here&#x27;s what the median disposable income looks like <i>after taxes &amp; transfers</i>, by country: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income#Median" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disposable_household_and_per_c...</a><p>&gt; My interpretation is, who cares if there&#x27;s a 50% wage increase from $10&#x2F;hr to $15&#x2F;hr if neither of those is a decent living wage to begin with, and the folks at the top of the pyramid are just making staggering amounts of money?<p>Because that 50% wage increase from $10&#x2F;hr to $15&#x2F;hr tells us very little about a single earner&#x27;s pay history — it presupposes that a single person stays at that level for the entirety of their life (which we know not to be true). Those numbers show us the snapshot-in-time income numbers for everyone currently at that salary level, but does not account for people actually moving income levels as they progress in their career. The data isn&#x27;t &quot;here&#x27;s the life of Joe over the last 5 years&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;here&#x27;s the life of people without college degrees that are X years old with Y years of experience with X &amp; Y held constant over 5 years&quot;. I suppose &quot;the lowest quintile wage has modestly increased over time&quot; has a different ring to it than &quot;the entry level starting salary has modestly increased over time&quot;.<p>Also, this is a bit more debatable, but one can also argue if it really matters if the people at the top are making staggering amounts of money, if people in the middle tier (again, not a static group) are also doing better, despite being of (predominately) lower skill — especially since that staggering increase at the top doesn&#x27;t happen in a vacuum, it&#x27;s because our system rewards those who play an outsized role in providing goods &amp; services that increase our collective standards of living.')
