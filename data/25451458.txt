If Eve can get Alice to sign the innocuous message then Eve can use the signature to attack Bob using the malicious message.<p>Collisions are still catastrophic for most applications that use signatures, but itâ€™s a wee bit harder to pull off an attack using pregenerated collisions than if you can find a second preimage. (Collision-based attacks need a signing oracle whereas second preimages do not.)')
