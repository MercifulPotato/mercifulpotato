Sure, there are ancillary mobile services, but the brunt of office work is done on desktops.<p>Desktop-like GUI&#x27;s are still the pinnacle of productivity for typical office use. They also created an established standard that mobile-influenced UI&#x27;s kicked in the gonads with screwy deviations.<p>Mice are simply superior to the average finger: right-clicking, roll-over pop-up text, precision, less need for borders around widgets, etc. And GUI&#x27;s take better advantage of medium and large screens.<p>What&#x27;s needed is a state-ful GUI markup standard so that Microsoft has real GUI competition. It would be kind of like dynamic XAML. JavaScript emulation of GUI&#x27;s has proven problematic such that the standard should encourage directly supported GUI idioms.')
