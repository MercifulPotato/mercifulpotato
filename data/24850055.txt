It&#x27;s likely to have hard-coded credentials, and it&#x27;s even possible that the licence for their translations don&#x27;t allow them to distribute them elsewhere! They might have conflicting licences.<p>As unsatisfying as it is, taking the site down is a reasonable step â€“ it mostly addresses the complainant&#x27;s request by ceasing to violate the AGPL.')
