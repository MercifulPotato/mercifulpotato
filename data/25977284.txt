I know it&#x27;s anecdotal, but I don&#x27;t know anyone here (I&#x27;m in the southern UK) who thinks that the government has handled this even remotely competently, but they also acknowledge that there&#x27;s not really an ideal way to handle it.  The only thing that seems to be going &#x27;to plan&#x27; is the vaccine rollout, which has surprised me as I never thought they&#x27;d get near the target figures they now look to be going to achieve (i.e. vaccinating the four key groups by Feb 15).<p>You have to make some sacrifices to win the battle, but it seems we&#x27;ve paid a lot of the price (in terms of economic costs as well as deaths), but without the positives that should have come from that.  As soon as there&#x27;s any sign of let-up in any of the statistics, it seems the government wants to remove the measures, which seems to be a bad idea to me, but I&#x27;m a chump who&#x27;s not making the decisions!')
