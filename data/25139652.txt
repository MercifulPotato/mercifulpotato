Because his reaction is pure instinct, the dopamine response <i>just to the colors and brightness</i> was shocking.<p>We now have to work HARD to keep these devices away from him. Part of it, of course, is he observes how much attention we pay them but his eyes definitely light up differently when they are turned on. And that&#x27;s without the manipulative, 1000-engineers-optimizing-for-your-addiction software built into them.<p>I honestly find it harder and harder to believe these things do anything positive for us. I 100% believe they <i>can</i> I just think we&#x27;ve turned them into something ugly, right now.')
