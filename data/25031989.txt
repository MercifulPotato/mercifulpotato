(rack pulls, sumo deadlifts, trap bar deadlifts)<p>Deadlifts as the exercise it purely is, is <i>less</i> likely to give you the strength for running you desire. Having been in the atmosphere of &quot;Train as efficiently as possible&quot;, I can attest that deadlifts are far from a great choice for physical health. My 75 y&#x2F;o coach would tear me a new one if he saw me wasting time training them.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised deadlifts have helped you gain a strong back, but having also trained for a marathon I can tell you there is a plethora of other benefits you will miss out on by training your lower back instead of your legs and overall cardio fitness.')
