Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610034224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669178, text='&gt; Why do you think Twitter is a publisher, in the sense of a newspaper, for example?<p>Because, like a newspaper, they provide an actively curated compilation of information received from a variety of contracted sources to readers. Sure, much (but not all) of the curation is algorithmic, and the direct sources are mostly not under employment contract and not getting paid money for the content (either providing it for free or paying money for reach), while for most newspapers many of the direct sources would be under employment contract and they and others would be getting paid money for the input they provide into the curated product, but that difference doesn&#x27;t seem particularly relevant to whether Twitter is a publisher. And, yes, a lot of the algorithmic curation is driven by explicit reader expression of preference, and some of the rest is driven by inferred reader preference from reader behavior. But that the curated product is highly personalized also doesn&#x27;t seem relevant to how free expression rights apply to curation choices.<p>For purposes of civil liability, Twitter is not a “publisher” solely because of Section 230, but since we are discussing how the Constitution applies to them (which Congress could not change by statute) not how civil liability applies to them, that&#x27;s not relevant.')
