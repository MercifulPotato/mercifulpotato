Which is what you should compare M1 against, anyway.<p>But sure, if you want to compare them against obsolete Intel chips, you can, and you&#x27;ll find improved battery life. It&#x27;s just not a logical comparison, as Intel isn&#x27;t the competition to M1 chips, the competition is AMD. And AMD does have high efficiency accelerated video decode on their laptop chips, and it also even supports 8K decoding, though it&#x27;s almost useless. It is less useless than on an M1 computer though, because at least then you have enough I&#x2F;O to actually run an 8K screen.')
