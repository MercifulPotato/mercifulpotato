I&#x27;m not as convinced the Gimbal video can be explained as easily. Combined with witness testimony and the Pentagon explicitly claiming it&#x27;s unidentified, I would love to hear a more convincing argument than &quot;it&#x27;s a plane and exhaust jet that the Navy&#x27;s state of the art sensors, pilots, etc. misidentified&quot;')
