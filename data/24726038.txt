Several outspoken activists started complaining and demanding all-company meetings, which were granted by HR and company leadership. In these mandatory meetings, which were attended by hundreds of employees, all sorts of contradictory accusations were lodged by the activists. For example, in the first meeting, one of activists complained about being (accidentally) mis-gendered by a new employee. In another meeting, a different activist complained about an employee <i>apologizing</i> for mis-gendering them.  Apparently this made the activist feel awkward, so they&#x27;d have preferred no apology at all. It was at this point I realized there is no reasoning with activists such as these. Their demands weren&#x27;t coherent. They were just a bunch of people complaining about hurt feelings. These meetings must have cost the company millions of dollars and huge amounts of lost development time. And they certainly didn&#x27;t resolve anything.<p>I and a lot of my colleagues just want to do our work without being forced to participate in regular struggle sessions.')
