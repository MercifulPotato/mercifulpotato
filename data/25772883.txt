It&#x27;ll have OS, apps, necessary data. This shouldn&#x27;t change frequently. Like one update a month, or a few months. Should last a lifetime.<p>- Second is the daily data memory. Logs, metrics, whatever. This would go bad more frequently, but the functioning of the car shouldn&#x27;t depend on this part. If this stops working and user doesn&#x27;t replace it, the rest of the car should work, except that no new logs will be generated. Or user is given the option to upload the logs straight to the cloud (is a Tesla vehicle always online?).')
