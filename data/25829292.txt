Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25829742], score=None, time=1611023259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829217, text='I notice you are never able to defend your confident, evidence-free assertions Mr. Jaquesm, with anything other than rhetoric and insults.<p>If I am so dumb, and you are so smart, why do you never humiliate me?<p>Or, you could even embarrass me right now, at least for fun.  Go find our last interaction, and post a link to it right here underneath my comment.  I have nothing to hide whatsoever, if I was a dummy in our past interactions, then link to it so others can see for their own eyes what sort of a &quot;master troll&quot; idiot they&#x27;re dealing with.<p>Or if you won&#x27;t do it, I will encourage third party readers myself.  Click my username, go read some of my &quot;wall-after-walls of text&quot;.  Get a feel for &quot;my whole shtick&quot;.  Judge for yourself if what I actually say matches this characterization.  Judge for yourself whether asking pointed questions that logically test the childish rhetoric and hyperbolic claims that are becoming an ever larger percentage of the discussion on culture war topics is &quot;a shtick&quot;.  Judge for yourself whether it makes sense that accuracy and sound logic are considered mandatory for technical threads, but when the topic of discussion is regarding matters like democracy (a <i>sacred institution</i>), then these things are not only not mandatory, but downvoted and outright mocked. A computer program won&#x27;t run as desired on ambiguity and imprecision, so why do we expect an entire country will?<p>By my estimation, the culture of this website, like that of the country, is going downhill.  People seem to be no longer able to speak truthfully, and they certainly won&#x27;t talk about <i>the abstract notion of</i> truthful speech, something that philosophers have debated <i>very seriously</i> for ages.  But here in 2021, on Hacker News, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s become some sort of a taboo.<p>There aren&#x27;t many people like me around here, but I&#x27;m not the only one.  You can downvote me and shame me all you want, but to get me to shut up about this apparently uncomfortable topic of The Truth, in high dimensions, you will have to get dang to ban me.  Go ahead - push the report button on me.  I suspect that day will come eventually, so might as well get it over with.')
