First one who does it, will be forever remembered as the one who saved artists and their fans. RIAA only protects labels who obtain \n rights to art in questionable manner (just read so many stories about artists being cheated by the label).\nWe need something that will be paying artists directly and there is technology to solve that. RIAA is a cancer and must go.')
