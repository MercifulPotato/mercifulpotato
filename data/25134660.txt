He has terminal lung cancer and had undiagnosed symptoms for months. That meant his quality of life was pretty bad. Thanks to palliative chemo and radiation he has a few months ahead that should see him temporarily feeling much better.<p>With the days he is not recovering from chemo he gardens and cleans up the house. It made me wonder what would I do in his shoes?<p>This last little bit of life, while difficult, is bringing him a lot of joy. Initially I thought it seemed like a waste of precious little time. But he gets to experience a little of the retirement he was only a year away from and it means a lot to him.<p>Now I&#x27;m trying to figure out how you measure a good use of your time. Is it really so important to invest so much time and effort in a vocation? Is it just as valid to find things that make us happy?')
