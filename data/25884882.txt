People have been writing articles about its demise, and yet, it is still here.<p>I have programmed in Java for a long, long time. Getters and setters, Maven and its vagaries, abundant use of patterns - all of these make sure people have strong opinions about it.<p>If any new person wants to learn Java, my two cents: Master generics and lambda.
