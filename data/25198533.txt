Just asking, as in the states we have people going 50mph (80.4kmh) on residential streets in front of parks full of kids, people running, etc.<p>I live near a park. The speed limit is 25mph. I have been driving down that street at 29mph, and had people _pass_ my car, blowing the horn and yelling (on a completely residential two lane) like I was standing still. This is a common, everyday occurrence.')
