This is one of the main reasons why curcumin (from turmeric), for example, is the subject of much research in the field.<p>Anti-microbial properties don&#x27;t apply equally to all species of microbes, and such selective action is essential for modulating the microbiome.<p>Disturbances of the gut flora do tend to lead to poorer outcomes more often than not, but this is not a hard rule. It&#x27;s rather that complex machines are fragile, and most modifications done in flight lead to adverse outcomes: without prior knowledge and generally speaking, it&#x27;s a bit like adding or removing a random line of code in a large application.')
