I disable all sshd features that I do not use, e.g. various methods of authentication or encryption other than those that I use.<p>I do not use sftp because it is a bad protocol, which cannot reach high speeds. This has been explained by other poster.<p>I frequently transfer tens or hundreds of gigabytes of files over ssh and with sftp that would be unacceptably slow. Also, sftp does not handle correctly all file metadata, in certain cases making incomplete file copies, with only partial metadata.<p>I use rsync over ssh, which does not have any of the problems that plague scp and sftp.')
