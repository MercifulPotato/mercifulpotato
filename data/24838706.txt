Item(by='ColanR', descendants=None, kids=[24840383], score=None, time=1603208694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834530, text='&gt;  Ham radio can&#x27;t be used for commercial purposes nor can it carry encrypted content. Operators also have to be licensed which means all of their personal details are on file with the licensing government. If they&#x27;re caught breaking the bounds of their license it will be revoked and they can personally face fines and even criminal charges.<p>I know that, it&#x27;s what I was referring to when I was talking about the <i>ability</i> to use HAM radio. It&#x27;s trivially easy to relay packets over HAM bands right now, given a transciever; the biggest thing preventing fairly wide-spread use is the legality.<p>&gt; the ham bands aren&#x27;t exactly brimming with available bandwidth<p>Even slow dialup speeds would be nice. I&#x27;m thinking of more-or-less direct internet connections between e.g. the US, Europe and Russia, or even just over a few hundred miles. Doesn&#x27;t have to be fast; the ability to send anything at all over that distance in a direct connection would be an improvement. A wifi mesh can&#x27;t do that.')
