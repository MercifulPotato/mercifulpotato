Rates for young people in the 20-30 age group are typically between 40-50%, leading many to speak of a &quot;lost generation&quot;.<p>- About half of the Catalans want to secede. Basques are right now at an uneasy peace thanks to favorable tax treatments, but before the defeat of terrorist group ETA about a decade ago, more than a thousand people were murdered in the name of Basque secession. Though violence is unlikely to return right now (hopefully), the Basque situation could become similar to Cataluña in a moment&#x27;s notice. There is also a clear rise of nationalism in other regions where this was barely a problem (eg, Comunitat Valenciana or Baleares)<p>- The two main national parties have been part of massive corruption scandals, going from the national down to the local level (the article alludes to this). We&#x27;re talking embezzlement in the billions, Roman-decadence levels of squandering (every town wanted its own airport), and intrigues that could be pulled off out of a cheap LeCarré knock-off.<p>- Education is quite poor, if not abysmal. Massive dropout rates in secondary education, really bad comparative performance in PISA reports, and barely any university makes it into top-200 institutions worldwide. Politicians keep changing the agenda every  four years instead of trying to agree to a national pact to get us out of this hole.<p>These are just things off the top of my mind, but I could go on for a while.<p>Maybe the fact that you only see Spanish people talk poorly about the country is a reflection of us being the primary subjects of its blatant problems, and of the fact that few outsiders care?')
