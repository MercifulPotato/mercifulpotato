Or if the moon has a very low orbit.  For Mars, Phobos is probably about as close to an eclipse-with-a-lumpy-moon as you could reasonably expect to get.  I think it&#x27;s not that far above the Roche limit where it would fall apart and turn into a ring, and if it were bigger it would tend to be less lumpy.  Potentially you could stretch it into a pancake-shape which would better occlude the sun by spinning it, but I suppose that would also make it more likely to fall apart and turn into a ring.')
