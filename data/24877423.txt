I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve looked at this set of tools since it was Metacard.<p>I love these threads every time they come up. Mostly because I loved HyperCard.<p>Without fail, everything suggested as a modern HyperCard replacement really nails at least one element of its spirit and really misses something else.<p>I think this is one of the closer ones overall. Its adherence to the stack model is much closer than the others and its programming language certainly is closer to HyperTalk than any other I recall, besides AppleScript.<p>Your walk through showcases the similarity really nicely.<p>It even looks like you can write the spiritual equivalent of an XCMD.<p>I think where LiveCode misses the boat is the packaging step necessary for distributing your &quot;Apps&quot;. With HyperCard, we passed around stack files. And unless we took some special steps to prevent it, they were also the preferred form for editing our programs. So if I gave my stack to you, you could run it as a program. But you could also edit and change it.<p>That default, where I could throw the exact thing I was working on onto a floppy and hand it to my dad, who could run it on his machine <i></i>but also edit it if he wanted to<i></i> is something I really haven&#x27;t seen replicated.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s a side of HyperCard that just can&#x27;t be recreated today. Or just shouldn&#x27;t, until the tooling to run the &quot;stacks&quot; gets distributed by default with a major OS.<p>Thanks for causing a fun re-exploration of a space that was really influential for me.')
