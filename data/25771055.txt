Making a <i>negative</i> of a handprint is absolutely not. Finding it in rock art across tens of thousands of years and tens of thousands of miles is proof of cultural elements being retained over unimaginable generations.<p>There are a also a set of about just 30-some abstract figures (zigzags, double crosses, etc.) that show up in rock art over many thousands of miles and tens of thousands of years.<p>And, a tool used by leatherworkers right up to the present, made from an animal&#x27;s rib, is found in its exact form with the same wear pattern at Neanderthal sites from 50k years ago.<p>And, the story of the Pleiades as, <i>exactly</i>, seven sisters, with one now missing, is found from Africa to Australia. It was last recognizably seven stars over 40k years ago. It could have been seven geese, or seven islands, or seven pebbles, seven eyes, seven eggs, but it is always and only seven sisters. People must have brought the story with them out of Africa to all the places it lives on in today.')
