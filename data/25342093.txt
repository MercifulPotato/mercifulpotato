Some people will insist on you talking to them using otr, and other will insist on omemo. Multi-device kinda sorta works sometimes. If you have program 1, the other person has program 2 on phone and program 3 on computer, and the issue is also potentially with the configuration of server program 4 or 5, then it starts to get complicated when issues inevitably crop up. Some of which lead to messages just silently going missing, and you mistakenly think that your friend is ghosting you unless you have an out-of-band way to communicate.<p>Conversations doesn&#x27;t display when your friends are online or not, which is fine if they are almost always online but if they are offline a lot, then depending on the server configuration and the phase of the moon, messages sent while offline go missing (silently of course).<p>EDIT: I think the only setup I could whole-heartedly recommend non-technical friends is Conversations talking to Conversations with Prosody default-settings server(s).')
