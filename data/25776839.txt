They are seen as costs which need to be minimised, when in reality it&#x27;s their core business. Little is invested in helping engineers to get better. Agile practices are implemented poorly. People do not start tech companies. The average software company is a body shop that rents out to insurers, banks and the government, which aren&#x27;t really tech. This model is only popular because it helps business dissociate itself from tech and gets around all employee protections. More lucrative models like Freelancing are sometimes legally restricted because of the same employee protections, so is not popular. Engineers wait for the hours to pass so they can go home. Code reviews are a tool for office politics. Software engineering is kind of a blue collar ish job which employers think anyone can do. There&#x27;s just no cachet to being a programmer in my slice of Europe. Simply put, there are so many things wrong with software engineering here that I would not know where to even start to address the issues even if I had the power to do it. And it&#x27;s not just about money too. It&#x27;s about something being completely and utterly broken.')
