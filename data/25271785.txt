For example, the newest iPhones have entirely custom privilege levels that are lateral to the typical ARM exception levels and entered using proprietary instructions that their own silicon understands. This is something you can find if you load the kernel into a disassembler and poke at it a bit. But Apple doesn’t mention it at all or document it…what’s the point? Why put up such petty barriers in the face of people trying to audit this?')
