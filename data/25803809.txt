The caste hierarchy could be arbitrary, or based on imaginary metrics such as being &quot;closer to revenue.&quot; It could have some basis in fact, for instance doctor hours are more valuable than nurse hours, which are more valuable than patient hours.<p>The upper castes have to be responsible for the work environment, otherwise it degenerates: The best people in the lower castes switch jobs to join a higher caste or a company with a better caste system. Or they unionize, either formally (like nurses) or informally by forming silos. Thus the castes become self fulfilling.<p>As an aside, one thing that HN has taught me, reinforced by this thread, is that I would not have survived in a high throughput coding environment, and am glad I didn&#x27;t steer my career in that direction, though I love programming. I don&#x27;t have the self discipline, and I&#x27;d have burned out quickly.')
