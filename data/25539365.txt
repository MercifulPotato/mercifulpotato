Last time I shopped for a laptop, the premium series ThinkPads (T or X series or so) cost pretty much the same as a similarly specced MBP. A Dell XPS didn&#x27;t differ that much. The Apple hardware might even had a bit more oomph than a similarly priced ThinkPad or XPS, e.g. by having a CPU with a higher TDP.<p>An X1 Carbon from Lenovo would have cost more than almost any other laptop with similar specs.<p>Of course things might have changed in recent years, or pricing could be somewhat different in different markets (I&#x27;m in Europe). Cheaper series (such as ThinkPad E or L or whatever they&#x27;ve got nowadays) would of course also be cheaper. But based on what I saw, the old trope about Apple laptops being especially expensive didn&#x27;t seem to hold if you compared it with premium models from other manufacturers, and not with value models.<p>FWIW, I ended up with Lenovo in any case and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. But price wasn&#x27;t really the reason.')
