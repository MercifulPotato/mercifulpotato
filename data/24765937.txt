(you in the general sense)<p>I think that is massive hyperbole. Do you despise all the people who work for oil companies also? What about everyone who works for Nestle (all the pushing of formula milk in Africa that led to the deaths of babies), I mean where does it all stop?<p>&gt; The foundation of the company is a guy who thought it was OK to create website to rate women. Fucking degenerate people.<p>He was a 19 year old man at this point (and I&#x27;m not even sure that happened anywhere except <i>The Social Network</i>). I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of 19 year old males have done things similarly except no one cares, because they&#x27;re not billionaires.')
