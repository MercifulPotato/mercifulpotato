Tiny fans are invariably whiney. The surface area of the blades is barely larger than that of the motor. Running it at 3V instead of 5V will make it move barely any air.<p>The Pi 4 can easily be passively cooled, you just need a slightly bigger heat sink. It pains me to see that they went the quick and dirty way with that crappy little fan. That case has a huge surface area. It&#x27;s what, ~9x7cm? Passive solutions would have been pretty easy, and probably not much more expensive than the $5 fan. And if you really want a fan, at least get a 50mm fan, so you can spin it slowly and still actually move air.')
