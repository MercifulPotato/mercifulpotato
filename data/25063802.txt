Item(by='monological', descendants=None, kids=[25064600], score=None, time=1605133940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25056351, text='Social dominance hierarchies are evident in many animal species, including bonobos and humans. Displayed aggression in social settings, with and without physical altercation, serves as a way to establish said hierarchy. Ultimately, the function of hierarchy is to provide stability to the tribe, by organically placing you in a appropriate position to maximize the chance of the tribe&#x27;s survival. There are clear biological differences between neurotypical human genders, such as endogenous Testosterone and Estrogen, giving rise to said behaviors. Conversely, the female&#x27;s typical function in a tribe is to provide social cohesion, stability and pacification, and is driven primarily by hormones. This dynamical system generally operates in a very carefully balanced fashion. Thus, when  humans intervene and introduce artificially made things like weaponized social networks that exploits and hijacks your dopaminergic system through likes or birth control pills that throws off your naturally occurring hormones and neurotransmitters, one could argue, just maybe, that it could have a potentially catastrophic long term effect on society.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that I don&#x27;t condone &quot;bar fights&quot;, but there is both a biological and sociological reason for male aggression and the pendulum has swung quite far the other direction, demonizing it as &quot;toxic masculinity&quot;.<p>Just my 2 cents though...')
