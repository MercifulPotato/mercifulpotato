Most likely, its net effect is that more ads are played and as a result, YouTube&#x27;s ad revenue has increased.<p>Now they implement a similar measure whose net effect would probably be comparable - i.e. an increased ad revenue.<p>It is perhaps logical for Google to behave like that, purely from the financial point of view. However, they could have done it a long time ago. It is unclear to me why they believe that the right time to introduce such measures is now.<p>Maybe they believe that their user base is currently large enough and stable enough that the decreased comfort levels while using YouTube would not motivate a critical portion of them to leave. It remains to be seen whether that is true.<p>Or, perhaps, their ad revenue growth is slowing [1] and they are trying to compensate for it even by using measures whose long term effects are unclear.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;thread&#x2F;60293363?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;thread&#x2F;60293363?hl=en</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;digital&#x2F;news&#x2F;youtube-google-q2-ad-revenue-coronavirus-1234721162&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;digital&#x2F;news&#x2F;youtube-google-q2-ad-r...</a>')
