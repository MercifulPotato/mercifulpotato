When I think about the tangible effects of something like this, I don’t see many downsides.<p>One thing that sticks in my mind - how easy it is for people to look at photos and videos from, for example, the Holocaust, and say “wow, the world was so very messed up way, way back then.”<p>The technology of the time isn’t telling the story in the full fidelity of those who lived it. Instead, it looks nothing like the reality that it was, and makes it feel further removed. Fine as an art form, but not a service to reality.')
