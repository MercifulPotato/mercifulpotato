They would have been a great idea, of more companies had followed the lead of Toyota, which is selling the Prius since 1998. At best, hybrids reduce the CO2 produces somewhat. But many hybrids are designed for pure compliance, not saving CO2 in real world usage.<p>But in any case, we don&#x27;t need to reduce the CO2 produced by cars, we need to eliminate it entirely.<p>Society needs to get CO2-neutral urgently, and cars are actually the low hanging fruit as perfectly nice electric cars are already being sold. In contrast, we have very little ideas what to do about flying for example, except use precious bio or synthetic fuels.')
