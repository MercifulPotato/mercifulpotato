The earliest started out the most pro-consumer and then over time got more demanding and even started their own streaming platforms to try to get in on thr action and made the user experience worse for consumers with things like paid and ad subcription tiers. If a company launches their own storefront and promotes it and claims it is to reduce costs and pass on savings they are lying to you. Breaking into a new market is expensive and risky. Initial sales are essentially a use of their marketing budget. The true reason is that their demands are rejected by the existing storefronts which usually means they are too aggressive in demands for margin or control.<p>They have the legal right to do this of course but we don&#x27;t have to like it and the impact on the market and can choose against them if you believe that their content is not worth commercials and rising prices.')
