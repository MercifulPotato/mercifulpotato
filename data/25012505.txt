Item(by='raspyberr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604710821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011320, text='&quot;Roguelike is a self-descriptive classifier -- something like Rogue&quot;\nWell play Nethack, Sil, DCSS, POWDER, Cogmind, Frozen Depths, DoomRL. Then play Spelunky, BoI, FTL, Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain, Ziggurat, Hades. You&#x27;ll very quickly notice the first group is a lot like....  Rogue. And the second group is a random mishmash of unrelated genres - Platformers, FPS, Twinstick shooters, slasher&#x2F;looters, and whatever FTL is.<p>If someone liked Nethack, I would happily recommend any game from the first list. If someone liked Ziggurat, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any of the games from the second list because they&#x27;re so different. Anyone doing the experiment in my first paragraph would clearly come to the same conclusion.<p>I think the second group of games is great. And so do a lot of people judging by their popularity. However, I prefer the first set but now searching for games like the first set is much harder. You can&#x27;t just search for the term that was always used to describe the set. And I&#x27;ve already seen people describe Spelunky as a &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; roguelike because it&#x27;s 12 years old now.')
