Item(by='Kliment', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602923544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808219, text='I do professional electronics design and some mechanical design. I use 100% FLOSS tools. KiCAD nightly is currently slightly less buggy than the closed crap, and about as capable. The major difference is that bugs I report get fixed within days, which I&#x27;ve never experienced with any of the commercial offerings. I use stable KiCAD for most projects, and nightly for things that need advanced functionality. It&#x27;s absolutely excellent. The mechanical design story is not as great, but FreeCAD is improving at a decent pace and now that Fusion is crippleware a lot of people are looking into FreeCAD, and complaining about how it works, and some are contributing and improving it. KiCAD went through this cycle due to a large influx of Eagle users when Eagle got eaten by the beast, and came out dramatically, shockingly improved. If the same thing happens to FreeCAD in the next few years I doubt we&#x27;ll have any excuse to go back. So I don&#x27;t feel &quot;hard pressed to get by&quot; - I feel more productive than before I switched to FLOSS tools.')
