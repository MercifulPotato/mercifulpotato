If we launch lots of bits of thin, reflective mylar film to the L2 Lagrange point with the sun, it will reflect incoming light and lower the Earth&#x27;s insolation. About $200 billion worth of Falcon Heavy launches, all carrying mylar film to L2, would be sufficient to lower insolation by 1&#x2F;20th of a percent, which would indeed halt global warming.<p>Obviously this would have tons of other consequences for the planet, and doesn&#x27;t account for solar wind pushing the mylar out of position, etc.')
