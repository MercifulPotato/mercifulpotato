I don&#x27;t own a wood stove myself so I&#x27;m not just protecting my own. I did grow up in houses with them. Everyone&#x27;s house had them. (upstate ny)<p>I wish people would not abuse the concept of public good or shared space etc just to get their way about every single thing they personally don&#x27;t prefer.<p>You don&#x27;t like wood smoke in winter? Go live in an HOA that doesn&#x27;t allow them. It&#x27;s a smell not a public health hazard.<p>Besides, oil and gas furnaces and coal and gas fired power plants are better? Really? Because that&#x27;s what the alternatives are still. We&#x27;re still a long way from having cheap plentiful electricity that doesn&#x27;t come from a bad source.<p>If this article is <i>really</i> ultimately driven by what it claims about a health hazard from particulates, then why does it only propose removing all wood burners instead of say, developing some kind of catalytic converter or double-burner or other means of cleaning the exhaust?<p>I would be more interested in a study of actual health histories and stats of areas where stoves were common vs not, than in this measurement of particulates and a claim that they are bad.')
