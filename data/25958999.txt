For strings, Python apparently caches the UTF-8 encoded string, so if you _repeatedly_ transfer it to Rust I suspect (but haven&#x27;t checked) that the cost is much lower.<p>In general I suspect it&#x27;s the usual &quot;NumPy arrays are fast, everything else you better be getting a sufficiently large boost from the low-level code to justify conversion&quot;.<p>For the thing I prototyped in Rust, it was wrapping the `ahocorasick` crate which was in fact faster than `pyahocorasick` which is written in C or Cython or something. Both have similar conversion costs, probably, so it came down to &quot;for lots of data the Rust version was faster&quot;.')
