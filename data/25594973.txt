In my view, these are some of the biggest advantages of Itinee over my previous spreadsheet planning:<p>- Visualize everything on a map. This is big for me just to help organize what days it makes the most sense to do things\n- Estimate travel costs (e.g. Ride sharing) based on distances between stops\n- Easily adjust number of attendees. Some costs are split regardless of how many people attend, like hotel rooms, while others are a fixed per person price, like event tickets\n- Ease of use for someone NOT familiar with spreadsheets. My wife couldn&#x27;t replicate any of this in a spreadsheet, but she can use Itinee.<p>Some of the above may in fact, and probably is, possible with some fancy spreadsheet shenanigans, but the main point was to make the whole process more accessible.<p>I&#x27;d be really curious if the advantages I mentioned weren&#x27;t apparent on the website or if they simply weren&#x27;t, in your view, &quot;enough&quot; of an improvement over a spreadsheet to justify paying for it.')
