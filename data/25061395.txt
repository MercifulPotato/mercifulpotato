It honestly stymies me how much bandwidth political discussions have taken over the years on the news spectrum in most democratic nations, regardless of development status. On the contrary, news in open autocracies seem to be more of the local type, focused on hyper local issues. And then there are the poser democracies such as Russia, Egypt or China, where news is highly nationalized dogshit, focused on how their enemies are bad, we are good and our government is the greatest.')
