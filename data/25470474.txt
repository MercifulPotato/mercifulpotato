Because I can tell you, every time I&#x27;ve worked on a codebase that repeated itself, it has been a freakin&#x27; -delight-, compared to the times where DRY was taken as a commandment from on high.<p>The former when something broke, I could just...fix it. And it would be fixed. Would other, similar situations, still be broken? Sure! And when those would be raised up we&#x27;d fix them too, and compare them with the other changes, and possible refactor. Fixing one bug = one bug less.<p>The latter? Oh God. Something is broken? We&#x27;d fix it. Aaaand, now there&#x27;d be two bugs. Fixing one bug = more bugs.<p>Perfectly balanced code, yes, fixing one bug = multiple bugs fixed. That&#x27;s the goal. But you won&#x27;t get it right if you do it pre-emptively. Which of those other two options would you prefer?')
