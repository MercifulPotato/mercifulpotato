But that doesn&#x27;t mean I think every application should be one service.  I just believe you shouldn&#x27;t create a second service until you have a good reason to like &quot;we need to run on two different tech stacks&quot;, or &quot;our team is getting hard to manage let&#x27;s split it into two teams that work on 2 services&quot;.')
