There is no linear loop of command input that becomes command output, it&#x27;s all one big buffer that can feed itself. Consider how there could be another window that perpetually shows the status thanks to a combination of inotify and git status, and you have a git view. Fiddle with the command line argument and you can choose wether to show whitespaces or not, whether to show a summary view or the full diff, or restrict the list to some files. Have another window where you can write some message, and a GitCommit command in the &quot;Tag&quot; of the window will use the whole buffer as a git commit message; boom, you have 60% of what I use git-cola for.<p>A bit more information can be seen by one of its creator here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M</a>. The possibilities are truly endless, and I haven&#x27;t seen anything that resembles it. There is just no editor that embraces your platform the way Acme does.<p>No, Emacs is not the same, because Emacs doesn&#x27;t integrate with your OS; Emacs is an OS unto itself. You can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s integrated to the OS when everything is implemented in the language that only Emacs uses.')
