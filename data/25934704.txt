Yuck!<p>I have, under duress. It was a result of using syntactic sugar wrapping a PHP website to make a Python API; it was convenient to pass form variables into a generic handler method of a class.  The problem?  The website, fully outside of my control, had a page which had an input named &quot;self&quot; which resulted in two values for that argument.  Rather than refactor the class and dozens of scripts that depended on it, I renamed &#x27;self&#x27; to &#x27;s_lf&#x27; in that one function and called it a day.<p>Also, python has class methods.  The convention is to use &#x27;cls&#x27; in that context, to avoid confusing the parameter (a class) with an instance of that class.')
