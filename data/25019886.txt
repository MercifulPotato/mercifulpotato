Of course as noted this was over a decade ago, and what passed for centrist back then might not today.<p>In case you&#x27;re wondering how this metric pans out for the most recent Senate: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voteview.com&#x2F;congress&#x2F;senate&#x2F;115&#x2F;text" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voteview.com&#x2F;congress&#x2F;senate&#x2F;115&#x2F;text</a> , which (according to this metric) lists the four most liberal senators (as shown by their senate votes) as, in order, Warren, Harris, Booker, and Sanders.')
