I mean, frostbite is a real thing. What about hypothermia? It seems there are serious risks to just going out and doing these things. I&#x27;m fascinated by Wim Hof but it seems the risks are not getting enough attention, unless the risks don&#x27;t really exist, in which case there are a lot of myths out there.')
