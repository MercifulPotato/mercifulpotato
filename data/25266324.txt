For me it largely comes from a feeling that there are a large number of tasks that I <i>have to get done</i>.<p>The biggest thing I do to overcome that is to take a day off and don&#x27;t do anything productive at all (easy if it happens to fall on a weekend, more effective if I do it on a weekday).  This breaks the first step -- less productive does not mean spend more time working, it means taking time off to recover.<p>For me it&#x27;s about &quot;reminding myself I don&#x27;t have to do things&quot;.  That voice in my head telling me how vital it is I get all the things done is just one voice.  All I <i>need</i> to do is work well enough to ensure me and my family are fed, clothed and have somewhere to sleep.')
