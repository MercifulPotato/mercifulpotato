Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=[24732222], score=None, time=1602261851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24729679, text='&gt; It always seemed weird to me that people make such high salaries in tech but just don&#x27;t value time as the main commodity of our lives.<p>It&#x27;s not about valuing it, the problem is that finding jobs which allow part-time work is just about impossible. I&#x27;d give anything for a job where I can work 40% time for 40% salary, but those don&#x27;t exist.<p>My wife has managed to arrange 80% time for 80% pay at the G of FAANG for a couple years, but the company absolutely hates the arrangement and tries every opportunity to sabotage it so it&#x27;s not that great. Also, management demands 40 hours of work for that 80% pay with the explanation that full-time employees are expected to work for a lot more than 40 hours.')
