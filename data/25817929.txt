I tend to devide my task in steps and execute them sequentially.<p>When I bake pizza rolls for instance: I need to make the dough, fill it with ham and cheese and then bake them. Of course that are idle time in between those steps (letting the dough proof and baking, for instance) so I insert a small task in between. Like making coffee or mayonnaise. Looks like I&#x27;m doing a whole bunch of things at the same time, but I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m making just one task of &quot;preparing a meal&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed context switching is costy at my current job. When I&#x27;m working on a feature usually I have to wait for my boss to do a code review. During that time I usually start a new feature. When I have to work in two features simultaneously that&#x27;s when I make a lot of mistakes (usually small mistakes due to lack of attention).<p>I much rather work at one thing at the time.')
