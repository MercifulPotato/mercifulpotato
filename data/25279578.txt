Item(by='anonacct38', descendants=None, kids=[25280028, 25281184, 25281007], score=None, time=1606933725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279237, text='&gt; Didn&#x27;t she inject code into an unrelated internal extension?<p>Depending on your definition of code, that&#x27;s probably not the case. She added an entry to a config file that contained a mapping of urls to messages. Such as:<p><pre><code>   dropbox.com&#x2F;upload -&gt; Friendly reminder: please don&#x27;t upload internal documents to dropbox\n</code></pre>\nAlso, Google generally trusts engineers and it&#x27;s not that unusual to have an engineer writing and deploying code. So essentially it was her job to work on and deploy this extension. I believe that had the message been an April fools day joke she wouldn&#x27;t have been fired.<p>So in my opinion arguments that others have made (not you) that: &quot;this was a unauthorized code change therefore obviously she should be fired on security grounds and charged with violating the CFAA too, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the message was&quot; don&#x27;t really hold water. There&#x27;s also an argument that she used some sort of &quot;emergency&quot; deployment mechanism, but that doesn&#x27;t really hold water either. Honestly it&#x27;s not that unusual to see people deploy some package when they need it rather than wait for a scheduled job to deploy it.<p>I think the grey area she was operating in boils down to: She had a platform to distribute certain types of messages <i>internally</i> and she put a message in there that probably wasn&#x27;t the normal type of message distributed. If I were her manager I probably would have taken some action but it wouldn&#x27;t have been firing.')
