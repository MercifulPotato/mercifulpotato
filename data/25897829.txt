In practice, JSON serialization libraries are used to map between domain objects and a JSON representation. The author notes that this really breaks into two problems, one of which is specific to JSON and the other of which is truly dependent on what exactly your domain model looks like.<p>The whole point is that no single library can solve a problem of unbounded (domain-dependent) complexity, and yet we rely on libraries like GSON to do that for us anyway. This leads to some problems, which the author calls out.<p>&gt; This is actually a very trivial problem indeed!<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree. The author specifically mentions the problem of coupling field names to names in the representation, such that an otherwise safe refactoring ends up breaking format compatibility.<p>The more general problem is a strict coupling between the structure of your domain objects and the structure of your representation. For instance, if your domain models cyclically-related objects, you <i>have</i> to decouple these structures somehow -- JSON cannot directly represent cycles. Sometimes you can tell whatever domain mapping library you&#x27;re using to cut cycles in certain ways, but the author rightly calls this a Faustian bargain.<p>Retaining full control over these representational issues obviates a lot of the problems you&#x27;d otherwise face when  adapting a library to your domain.')
