Certificates which lack SCTs (the proof that they were shown to Certificate Transparency logs before you) don&#x27;t work in some popular browsers, but those certificates are not policy violations, they just don&#x27;t work in browsers so you probably should not use them on a web site. In a handful of cases such certificates exist for legacy reasons (e.g. industrial environment that doesn&#x27;t know anything about the &quot;Web&quot;), in other cases they&#x27;re minted but not intended to be seen yet, for example Google&#x27;s front end facing systems can do this.<p>When Google accidentally made some of those certificates live with insufficient SCTs they just did not work in Chrome - which is embarrassing but it was not a policy violation, the subsequent root cause analysis was Google&#x27;s choice not mandated by the other root trust stores and there was no threat that anybody&#x27;s trust would get revoked.')
