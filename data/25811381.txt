Item(by='SkittyDog', descendants=None, kids=[25812358], score=None, time=1610896965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810837, text='From the WP article, under &quot;Folklore and Mythology&quot;: &quot;Some Greek astronomers considered them to be a distinct <i>constellation</i>, and they are mentioned by Hesiod&#x27;s Works and Day...&quot; (emphasis mine) So it would appear that they are both. FWIW, I have no idea if there is some astronomical technical jargon distinction between &quot;constellation&quot; and &quot;cluster&quot; that inspires your comment. But to this layman, your correction comes across as pedantix and unnecessary. The term &quot;constellation&quot; is clearly valid, here, as common everyday English is spoken.')
