Once they are done (&quot;once&quot; should be &quot;if&quot;), part of their savings goes to the investors. I think it is reasonable to assume that such process doesn&#x27;t need any crypto proof and ultimately depends on lawyers, salesmen and bankers. Making a company or an industry more efficient requires talent and strategy, not just pouring money and it is a very risky and long process. If these guys feel competent to make a profitable energy efficiency fund, they should start one. And with clear legal protection for the investors, not a token.')
