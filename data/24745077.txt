For 20 years, buyers have almost always been given the choice between a grey (now black or white) car that is in stock and can be delivered right away, or a coloured one in many weeks.<p>Now buying a new car is something that is though about for a long time before performing the act (often along many months), is a commitment for a long time after the buying act, and in a majority of cases happens without any emergency while they already own a well functioning vehicle (or several), so why people cannot integrate this waiting period in their process? I don&#x27;t think it is reasonable, but we can only observe as a fact that once they have made their final decision, they don&#x27;t want to wait any more.')
