With current dev team size each gets around 3 duties per year.<p>Dev duty takes care of rollouts, crises, rollbacks, keeping an eye on performance and error monitoring. It&#x27;s a great approach that works for us and allows every developer to get familiar with rollout process eventually, but I don&#x27;t know if there are downsides for smaller teams or for projects that are split into several independent services instead of one monolith.')
