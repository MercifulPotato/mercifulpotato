Instead mods can ban individuals and remove content. I think GP is suggesting something more like:<p>&gt; I want RT&#x2F;Fox&#x2F;CNN&#x2F;MSNBC&#x2F;NYPost&#x2F;Wapo&#x2F;NYTimes&#x2F;LATimes&#x2F;etc. Twitter, vetted by their teams. Allow me to filter Twitter&#x27;s content based on the input of my preferred &quot;trusted&quot; moderator.<p>This largely removes Twitter from the equation. They remain a platform for content, and others get to choose which content they interact with either freely (without moderation) or under their choice of moderation.')
