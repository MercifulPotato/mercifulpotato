The fact that you could come up with some chicanery that the host might pull which isn&#x27;t explicitly disallowed doesn&#x27;t make the original problem flawed in any way.<p>I bet you could take any problem of similar nature from anywhere and scrutinize hard enough and find some gimmick that lets you claim similar claims about it, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s useful or noteworthy.<p>At the end of the day we all rely on common sense and common assumptions about these kinds of things. It may be true that some don&#x27;t have the same shared experience to draw upon and lead them to the same understanding as others, but that doesn&#x27;t make the problem flawed. It just means people understand things differently.<p>If a significant number of people brought up this issue then my opinion might change, but as I said, this is the only time I&#x27;ve heard of this particular complaint (and I&#x27;ve been enjoying posing this problem to people for decades now), and that means, in my opinion, there is no grounds to claim your misunderstanding as some objective flaw in the wording or presentation of the problem.')
