A short wave in April of excess deaths hasn&#x27;t changed much on a longer term basis, because there was no winter flu death season this year.<p>Perhaps you meant &quot;deaths assigned to COVID&quot;. The FT work has a few issues. One is that they assume any mismatch in COVID vs excess death means undercounting. This is based on the faulty assumption that lockdowns don&#x27;t kill anyone, but in the UK the hospitals were emptied out, people were afraid to go to A&amp;E. Admissions halved almost overnight and took months to return to prior levels over the summer, then they dropped again due to the second lockdown. Actual death certificate data in the first wave showed about \nhalf of all excess death didn&#x27;t mention COVID anywhere. The FT&#x27;s assumption is strange and unsupported by any data.')
