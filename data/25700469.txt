And donâ€™t even get me started on the destructive horrors of automatic&#x2F;implicit type coercion..)<p>In Haskell, types feel like the nubs on jigsaw puzzle pieces, guiding you to what (potentially) fits together, which drastically reduces the amount of programming details you need to keep in your head, so you can focus on the actual, fuzzy, real-life semantics of the system your developing.')
