He spends a lot of time talking about what <i>isn&#x27;t</i> defamation --- people use defamation suits and threats thereof to chill free speech, and he&#x27;s a 1st Amendment guy --- but the Dominion cases are apparently examples of very serious defamation cases.<p>The core of defamation is (1) a false statement of purported fact that (2) causes damage (there are some exceptions to (2) that aren&#x27;t relevant here). Most defamation cases you hear about fall apart on (1) - they target non-falsifiable statements of opinion, which can&#x27;t be defamation because they don&#x27;t purport to relate an objective fact. What makes Dominion&#x27;s cases terrifying is that they are chock full of purported facts, all of which are batshit, and have so devastated Dominion&#x27;s reputation, in a reputation-intensive business, that it had to hire private security to protect its employees from death threats.<p>What makes the case challenging for Dominion is that they will almost certainly be treated as a public figure for the purposes of the case. The standard for defamation of a public figure is higher than that of a normal person; we add a condition (3): actual malice or negligence, meaning Dominion must show that Giuliani either intended to destroy Dominion&#x27;s reputation by spreading facts he knew to be false, or that he was at least negligent, acting with reckless disregard for the truth.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s not totally clear whether Giuliani believed any of his crazy-talk. It may actually be the case that Giuliani is just off his rocker. If he himself was sold by the (false) facts he received from others, he is a more difficult defamation target.<p>Here&#x27;s attorney Akiva Cohen analyzing the case a bit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AkivaMCohen&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353700596407283721" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AkivaMCohen&#x2F;status&#x2F;1353700596407283721</a>')
