Accessibility, localization, scalability, permissioning, observability and alerting, reliable deploy and testing pipeline... all these things are table stakes for a new project at the company I work at, represent A LOT of complexity, yet an application delivered without them might have a nearly identical user experience...<p>That’s not even to mention the added burdens on the planning side of things, e.g. getting infosec and legal and compliance to sign off before breaking ground, gathering requirements from 10 different teams across the world, appeasing more stakeholders, etc.<p>The difference just in table stakes between a young startup and a mature company can easily account for an order of magnitude difference in effort required to deliver a feature, and it shouldn’t be surprising.<p>Edit: and this is why I weep when I see mature companies under-investing in developer tooling.')
