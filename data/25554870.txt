(Wikipedia says so, but I&#x27;m no expert).<p>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;We barely have a decent ARM ecosystem&quot;. Are you talking about the tools to build for those processors? Or the tools to build new ones of those processors? Or the actual chips that are available?<p>I remember the early OpenWRT &#x2F; RPi days when many packages weren&#x27;t even compiling for ARM. Now I think we are in a much better shape. The chips were available, but the software ecosystem was way behind.<p>&gt; At worst, RISC-V could be equivalent to ARM, without many of the parts that suck about it.<p>What I do know about ARM sucking is that the whole board design makes each product need a customer kernel more or less. Which is why we still don&#x27;t have a &quot;Linux for your phones&quot;. What I&#x27;ve read about RISC is that it&#x27;s going to be roughly the same: encourage a lot of co-processors which mean custom boards to me and probably custom kernels.')
