Land Rover has a new subscription product but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of momentum behind it. You pay a monthly fee that isn&#x27;t more than if you financed the whole car at the moment, and you can keep getting new vehicles and absolutely everything (servicing etc) is covered because they&#x27;re motivated to keep re-sale value extremely high because re-selling it is their problem.<p>I think software, cars, etc, as a service is somewhat liberating and I&#x27;m in favour of it.')
