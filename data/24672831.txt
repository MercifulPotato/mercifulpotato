I don&#x27;t see this app store being about providing alternatives. that&#x27;s just a talking point.<p>This app store is all about forcing every android sold in India to have a system installed govt driven app, which will report back to the govt on tons of private information about the device and owner. Information that Indian govt will be too incompetent to keep safe and given its authoritarian nature, should never have access to.<p>This is an authoritarian nightmare abut to happen. Modi wants India to move in the direction that China chose. And this scares me a lot.')
