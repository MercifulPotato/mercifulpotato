Item(by='zjs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608103647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434753, text='As a data point: I pay Google $5&#x2F;month to accomplish essentially the same thing.<p>I pay for Google Workspace, have a handful of domains configured, a single &quot;real&quot; user account and a catch-all rule that forward all mail to that real account.<p>Other than inertia and pricing (I have &gt;10 domains, so I&#x27;d fall in the enterprise tier), there&#x27;s one key feature that keeps me from switching: I can set up custom routing rules.<p>For example, when I RSVP&#x27;d for a wedding last year with a plus one, I set up a custom rule for that alias so that my plus one also got any updates.<p>I suspect you could build a significantly better UX around that, where someone could link additional recipients to an alias with some sort of special reply to the email, see that those other recipients are included when receiving messages (as a reminder they&#x27;re &quot;linked&quot; to the alias), etc. I&#x27;m probably over thinking it, but I&#x27;d love to be able to somehow react to an email with &quot;+friend@example.com for 2 hours&quot;. (Example use case: you place a food delivery order for a group of friends and want them all to get the rest of the confirmation emails until the meal is actually delivered.)<p>Random ideas:<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to have an easy way to &quot;bind&quot; aliases to a domain&#x2F;sender. Most of the time when I invent a new alias, I only expect it to be used by whoever sends the first message to it.<p>It&#x27;d also be interesting to be able to have a &quot;snooze&quot; feature for an alias. I use this a lot on social media (e.g., Facebook makes it easy to say &quot;don&#x27;t show me anything from this person for 30 days&quot;) when I don&#x27;t want to totally unfollow someone. I think I&#x27;d do that with some merchants&#x27; emails.<p>Maybe these could take the form of message headers that get added? That way, it&#x27;s easy to configure a client-side skip-the-inbox rule (or mark it as low priority or whatever), so it&#x27;s not in your face, while ensuring you can still search for stuff you think you might have missed.')
