You can bypass the wget command by downloading that file in Safari, then doing<p><pre><code>    mount -t ios . &#x2F;mnt\n    # Pick &quot;Downloads&quot; from &quot;On My iPad&quot; in the GUI\n</code></pre>\nThen you can run<p><pre><code>    tar xvzf &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;apk-tools-static-2.10.5-r1.apk\n</code></pre>\nWhen you cd to the root.<p>Though, I suspect apk itself will fail if you can&#x27;t resolve domain names.<p>Edit: As gorkish points out, make sure iSH has network permissions first and try again with the original command.')
