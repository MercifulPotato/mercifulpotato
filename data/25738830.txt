Even if the mob is composed of &quot;relatively peaceful&quot; people who aren&#x27;t trying to kill people, all it takes is one or two bombs to go off at the right time (or one or two actual right-wing terrorists to take advantage of it), to turn a bad situation into a worse one.<p>Yeah, Timothy McVeigh style attack would be terrible. You know what would be worse? Timothy McVeigh hiding inside of an angry crowd of supporters.<p>Or hell, TWO Timothy McVeighs. How many angry right-wing extreme nuts are coming to this thing next week?')
