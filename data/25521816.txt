Well, calling the process of uploading a firmware image to an embedded device during early boot via U-Boot as &quot;firmware flashing&quot; is well established, so we can start from here... thus, uploading a new Android image in <i>Android Recovery</i> is not &quot;flashing&quot;, but uploading a &quot;recovery&quot; image in Android bootloader is? Now, would you call firmware uploading via iOS&#x27;s DFU mode &quot;flashing&quot; too? Or do you believe that the DFU mode is end-user accessible, thus not low-level enough? Then, would you accept that uploading the firmware to the baseband processor (which I believe uses its own EEPROM) via DFU &quot;flashing&quot;?<p>I guess the definition varies, it was what I meant by &quot;an appropriate context&quot;.')
