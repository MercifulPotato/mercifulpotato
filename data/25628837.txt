That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about here - all the MVP should do is the absolute minimum to solve the problem it sets out to solve, and <i>as a customer</i> you don&#x27;t know if it actually does that until either you&#x27;ve tried it, or you have validation from other people who&#x27;ve tried it.<p>No one should be worried about perpetual licenses or offline support for an app that hasn&#x27;t proven it even solves the problem in a viable way yet. If those things are key to your purchasing decision then you probably ought to be buying from established businesses with proven products and good support, and that is definitely not any startup I know.<p>I suspect your comment betrays the fact that you think the first version of a startup&#x27;s software is the first <i>finished and stable</i> version. That&#x27;s the main problem here. Startups need to be selling <i>long</i> before they&#x27;re at that stage.')
