I don’t want to censor video games but I do wonder what the effect of murder simulation is on people, along with regularly witnessing the frequent sexual assaults that get dramatized in our media (movies, TV). Does it lead to aggressive behavior? Maybe not, but I’d be surprised if these influences are a net positive for the well-being of individuals or communities. We’ve lost much of any ability to have community standards with any toolset other than the force of the law, but all this energy people put into trying to ban words or speakers, topple statues or cancel companies might be better focused into social disapproval of the portrayals of murder, rape and the rest of the violence we inundate ourselves and our kids with on a daily basis.')
