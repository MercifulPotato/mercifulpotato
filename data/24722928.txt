I got a spare phone lying around and turned phone verification on from there to be able to login to my other devices. It&#x27;s simply not safe to be using a Google Account without a mobile device by this logic. I have in turn decided to move away from Google, my Drive is now like 100 mb used cause of GMail which I have now forwarded to iCloud and am also just slowly changing my email everywhere I had signed up to my company mail or my personal iCloud mail.\nRelying totally on Google was the worst decision ever I suppose.')
