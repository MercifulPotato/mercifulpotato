I&#x27;m trying to convince him that he&#x27;s making bad choices, that he&#x27;s making his own life dramatically harder in the long run, and so on, trying to get him to actually think what he wants to be when he grows up and create a plan of some sort for how to get there, maybe. He even nods in agreement. The moment I turn around he fires up a game or YouTube and he&#x27;s right back to his dopamine cycle. So I&#x27;m afraid the school of hard knocks it&#x27;ll have to be.<p>There&#x27;s this misconception among non-parents (or even parents of well behaved kids) that kids are robots and they will automatically listen to whatever &quot;lessons&quot; you give them. That may or may not happen, depending on the kid, and you really have little to no control over whether it does happen.<p>And gaming, social media, etc, companies aren&#x27;t making any of this any easier, unfortunately. This is something we&#x27;ll have to pay a heavy price for in 10 years or so, that much is pretty certain.')
