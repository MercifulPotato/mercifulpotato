Mostly because the security is inherent in no one having 51% of the currency.<p>I find that this is not a problem in practice. Even the government with infinite money would struggle to buy even 20% of circulating supply because they would have to drive the price to absolutely insane amounts in order to achieve that.<p>I&#x27;m involved in a DPoS project called Lisk and participants are constantly observing each other&#x27;s wallets on the blockchain. If a whale tries to move too many tokens to an exchange to sell, the whole community will know and that individual risks losing their delegate position. There is a strong incentive to not sell too many tokens because everyone in the community can see it and it can have negative ramifications. Some groups of forgers make deals with each other and they agree to keep 50% of their forged tokens as reserves in exchange for votes.<p>Also, you can vote to earn interest on your tokens so a lot of people only sell a portion of the interest they earn and would never sell their principal.<p>In practice, investors&#x27; hands tend to become stronger as the price goes up.<p>It would be essentially impossible for an outsider to accumulate 51% of tokens. By the time they accumulated 10%, they would have paid so much money to get them that they would totally lose the incentive to harm the project.')
