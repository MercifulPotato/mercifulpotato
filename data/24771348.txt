In another post in this thread I mention that the plastic &#x27;furniture&#x27; could be made white at least.  And in common police firearms, namely glocks, that&#x27;s most of the gun that could be recovered.  I don&#x27;t think the Glock company offers such guns presently, but if there were widespread police aesthetic reforms I don&#x27;t think supply would necessarily be a problem.<p>As for camouflage, I think police should be forbidden from using it.  If a bank robber needs to be ambushed from the bushes in some sort of &#x27;Bonnie and Clyde&#x27; scenario, let the beat police call in specialists.  These armoured vehicles don&#x27;t need camo in the likely scenarios in which they&#x27;d ever be used, particularly since the entire premise of such vehicles in a police role is that they&#x27;d be impervious to the small arm fire they might encounter.  In a military role they might get hit by an RPG, but such anti-armour weapons are exceedingly unlikely to be relevant to police.')
