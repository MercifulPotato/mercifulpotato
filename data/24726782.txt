I was trying to be more narrow and keep it with EO 12333.<p>My argument was:<p>A. The definition of foreign power and foreign agent are loose enough that a legal team acting in bad faith could make the argument that protesters could be included in the latter group.<p>B. EO 12333 could then be applied to those protestors, which would allow the FBI to engage in unconsented physical searches, etc under the executive order<p>C. Could occur at a time when the heads of the White House, DOJ, and IC elements were politically aligned and showed no dissent<p>D. Could occur under a situation of disorganized oversight occurring during a time of national chaos<p>Under this more specific scenario, what would prevent this from happening, where a protester is included in a legal definition made in bad faith that makes an end-run around those other obstacles you mentioned (via EO 12333) to arrive at novel law enforcement powers?<p>Again, I appreciate you taking the time to talk about this. I&#x27;m just curious and bored so I wanted to play with the idea.')
