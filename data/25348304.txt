Level 3 allows you to take your eyes off the road, and car will notify you if there’s something it cannot deal with, in advance. Tesla FSD will kill you if you do that.<p>As I said, it’s very impressive for level 2. But just because it can do more stuff that any other publicly available l2 system, it doesn’t make it self driving system. And Tesla knows that. They’ve quietly walked back most of their claims. They used to advertise it as level 5, that you can go to sleep. Now they advertise FSD as system that requires full human attention, and only missing thing is auto steer on city streets.')
