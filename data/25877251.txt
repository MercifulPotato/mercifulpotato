You are almost guaranteeing someone will compromise it eventually.<p>Userbase is built on the assumption our entire database and server will be compromised, and the attacker would still not be able to access protected user data. Validating that we protect user data in that scenario was the goal of our security review. [1]<p>On top of this, requiring users to provide an email or some other identifiable means to sign up, which is the practical way to defend against enumeration, compromises a level of privacy AND security in the average user (since this data would be leaked in the event of a breach). So this is a significant tradeoff, not as simple as one way is secure and the other is not.<p>Finally, we recognize the impact of allowing user enumeration. We will offer protection from user enumeration for those who are comfortable with the tradeoffs in user experience, and with sacrificing a level of privacy and security for their users.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userbase.com&#x2F;announcements&#x2F;#1-security-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userbase.com&#x2F;announcements&#x2F;#1-security-review</a>')
