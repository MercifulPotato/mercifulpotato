It just delights in being realistic. This is how FAANG (and Stripe) interviews work. You play the game to get paid (and contribute to the company). Some people might disagree with the IQ comments (but former presidents of Harvard and many in SV like to thwart people&#x27;s assumptions here as a form of loose, survivorship bias, imho).<p>IMHO, he&#x27;s being honest. Interviewing and capitalism is super imperfect currently (life isn&#x27;t clean like logic). It&#x27;s part of the game. One goal is to change the game.<p>I thought his sections on Judgement and Personality were pretty good &#x2F; show experience. Though for some of this there are more targeted ways that FAANG does this (Amazon leadership principles, Googleyness, Netflix freedom and responsibility etc.) - but I agree with him the signal is mostly around those who prepare for it (as it is with just about all tests; the SAT, etc.).')
