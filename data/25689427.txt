For example, do you plan for the worst case scenario (ivy league, no scholarship or out of state state school, no scholarship) -- $250k and climbing.<p>Or the best case scenario (they take tons of ap courses and courses at local cc until transferring their jr year to in state school with full tuition scholarship) -- ~$20k?<p>Maybe try to aim for the midpoint? It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>What I&#x27;ve read that mad sense to me, though, is that kids can borrow for college and you can&#x27;t borrow for retirement (reverse mortgage notwithstanding).')
