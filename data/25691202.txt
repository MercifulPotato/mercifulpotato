Is it specific to the US? Or North America? In Europe (or at least the European countries I’ve been in) and Japan, you go to the dealer, they will have a few showroom and test cars, and then you sit down, spec your car, haggle the price (this is changing in Europe with third parties who will negotiate for you), and then wait for your car to come out of the factory<p>From time to time there will be a showroom car on sale that matches, especially if you’re near the end of that generation')
