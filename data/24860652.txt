It&#x27;s commonly thought to, but the actual result is unknown; a subsequent President&#x27;s authority to arrest him on his &quot;pardoned&quot; actions and try him for commission of crime under the theory that one cannot be pardoned for crimes not tried has never been tested in the US legal system.<p>Trump is enough of an outlier that someone might actually be willing to test the hypothesis on any pardons he fires off.')
