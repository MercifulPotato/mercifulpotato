There were some plans allowed to be grandfathered, so the plans wouldn&#x27;t terminate as non-compliant, but in practice the vast majority of plans terminate every year, and essentially everyone with health insurance now has an $8,500 per individual annual out of pocket maximum.  I&#x27;m sure if you look at your own insurance, you&#x27;ll find $8,500 or less.<p>It&#x27;s true this cap only applies to in-network, approved care.  But that&#x27;s the same under any health plan, whether universal, or not.  For instance, Sovaldi and Harvoni are curative for hepatitis C, but it costs $50,000 for a 12-week course of treatment in the UK.  There are 210,000 people with hepatitis in the UK, but the NHS only furnishes 10,000 courses of treatment per year.  If you&#x27;re not approved, you can&#x27;t get it from the NHS, but you&#x27;re free to buy it yourself, of course.')
