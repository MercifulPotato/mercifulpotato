Item(by='zdragnar', descendants=None, kids=[24960674], score=None, time=1604239185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959238, text='There are two common cost structures: estimated time and fixed bid.<p>Fixed bid is relatively simple: company says project will cost X dollars, and takes on the risk of that amount ending up being too low. As a consequence, these projects tend to be very rigid; if a client wants any changes made to the plan or outcome, typically that involves another charge (unless certain revisions were allowed for up front).<p>Estimated cost is just that- firm offers a guesstimate of the total project cost, but only actually charges for the total number of human-hours worked. These contracts can be a bit more flexible- sales may tweak the hourly rate to keep clients happy, changes can be incorporated if the client is willing to sign off on a new estimate, etc.<p>One newer and slightly less common variation during initial development is capacity based- again, a very rough outline for project timeline may be put together up front (businesses like plans) but the company bills a flat rate to provide hours per week, rather than progress towards a dedicated plan. This allows for a more &quot;agile&quot; workflow, and is also happens to be a common arrangement for maintenance phases where a client may choose whether to add new features or work out existing kinks without needing to sign a new agreement for every little feature. It offers the most flexibility for clients while also putting most of the risk on them as the development shop hasnt agreed to any specific outcomes.')
