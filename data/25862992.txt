We&#x27;ve already covered that above, so lets not reiterate... any implied pre-filtering here is imagined.<p>Pre-arrangement is the world we live in and the very definition of the modern internet. What&#x27;s been proposed is to introduce an improvement to how things are pre-arranged. I&#x27;d love to live in your utopia where we have the time to read everything in Google&#x27;s index one-by-one and select which ones we value individually, but here in the real world, things are pre-arranged. This is about trying to find the best way to ensure that that pre-arrangement is not horribly skewed and corrupt.')
