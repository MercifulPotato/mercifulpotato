But if the coin lands on tails, you lose 40% of your total. Since you’re just as likely to flip heads as tails, it would appear that you should, on average, come out ahead if you played enough times because your potential payoff each time is greater than your potential loss. In economics jargon, the expected utility is positive, so one might assume that taking the bet is a no-brainer.<p>&gt;Yet in real life, people routinely decline the bet. Paradoxes like these are often used to highlight irrationality or human bias in decision making. But to Peters, it’s simply because people understand it’s a bad deal.<p>In real life we would create an investment fund for this. We gather the money of many people into the fund and the fund managers would then play the game more than once. If you play it 4 times with two coin flips each the expected ROI is around 7%. However, there is something weird about this game. The expected ROI grows the more money you have. Playing the game 16 times with 4 coin flips would get you an even greater ROI. I don&#x27;t think such an investment exists in reality because we would run into diminishing returns. Spending too much money will always decrease the ROI. People need a cheap car to drive to work and the car increases their earnings potential significantly but spending twice as much to buy a Tesla doesn&#x27;t increase their salary beyond what the cheap car got them.')
