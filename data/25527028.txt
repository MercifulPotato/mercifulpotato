It is really confusing as in some cases an &#x27;xxxOS&#x27; really is a new OS but more so these days it means &#x27;xxx Linux distribution&#x27;.<p>Also given their links to fsf who insist on &#x27;GNU&#x2F;linux&#x27; it is amusing to see the name contain neither GNU nor Linux.<p>As a huge Linux fanboy (I contribute to the kernel minorly as a hobby) I can also see the positive side - using Linux is such a foregone conclusion that we don&#x27;t even need to mention it any more :)')
