Corporations have already embraced this idea of converting cost centers into profit centers and it makes life more difficult for consumers. Every time I call support at my ISP, because my internet is down, they work on my problem and tell me that my plan is slow and that I can upgrade my package for an increase in my bill.<p>This sets up perverse incentives, that as far as I can tell, are theoretical, but have potential to become more prevalent. Because of the cost center as a profit center idea, my ISP can generate more revenue by providing <i>less</i> value to me. If failing infrastructure causes me to call support more often, and more support calls increase the likelihood of more revenue, why should the ISP invest in better infrastructure?<p>The key to having a successful business is to carefully align the incentives of specialities in an organization to make the most competitive offerings to the market. If there are competitors, and customers can switch to them, and the competition is more compelling, then I would go to other ISPs.')
