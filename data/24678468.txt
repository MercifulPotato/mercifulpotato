Item(by='auxym', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601814210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24676827, text='I have a (research&#x2F;thesis) master&#x27;s in mechanical engineering  and currently work as a research assistant in a university research lab that works on many topics, some of which related to robotics.<p>It&#x27;s fun, interesting work with many upsides, like working with very smart people, flexible work week, possibility of teaching classes as a contract lecturer and making many contacts in industry, especially with R&amp;D departments, since I work on many projects with industry funding. Not to mention, on campus daycare.<p>The downside is salaries don&#x27;t compare to industry engineer salaries since, at the institution I work at, all RAs are unionized and on the same pay scale, no matter if your topic is law, biology, english or engineering. Moreover, it&#x27;s a dead end internally: to become a PI&#x2F;professor, I&#x27;d have to get a PhD and complete at least 1 postdoc, most likely in a different institution that is considered elite, and even then it&#x27;s a crapshoot.')
