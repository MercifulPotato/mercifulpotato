For example, Germany has to pay it&#x27;s neighbours to receive peak generation.<p>Coming tech will improve that but we could get to carbon zero far quicker and cheaper with a mix of nuclear and renewables. One problem with nuclear is that safety concerns. However nuclear has caused less death than coal generation. It does require a huge capital investment but it pays for itself over the long run. Waste is an issue but it produces a tiny volume of waste compared to any other form of generation.<p>We could get rid of all current coal and gas plants and have power when it&#x27;s required with nuclear. Until we have a better storage option the true can&#x27;t be said of any renewables (unless you are lucky enough to have abundant geothermal options). With wind and solar you have too much during peak supply and too little during peak demand.<p>Even the article you linked states whole sale solar and batteries are not yet economically viable.<p>If there is a viable thermal storage option, I&#x27;m wrong but I&#x27;ve not heard about it. I would love to be wrong if that is the case.')
