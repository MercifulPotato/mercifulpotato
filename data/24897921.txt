For example if R = 3.0 you need to vaccinate 66% population  until infections start to decline.<p>REALITY: Assuming 75-90% efficacy vaccine, vaccination is non-random and population is heterogeneous. You want  to vaccinate everyone who agrees to take it.  Just like with children diseases, there will be clusters of anti-vaxxers, or people just don&#x27;t bother and they are often clumped together, travel around the world and spread the disease.')
