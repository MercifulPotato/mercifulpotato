I made a mistake of looking for a junk removal company with shields down. Every marketing software on the planet got the idea &quot;oh, this guy is really into junk removal, let&#x27;s help him!&quot; and all ads in every place where I couldn&#x27;t disable them were about junk removal for half a year at least. Needless to say the junk I need removed was long gone after the first week. Now if I ever need junk removed again in a year or two... well, actually I already forgot all those ads, so it was just a waste of money for them.')
