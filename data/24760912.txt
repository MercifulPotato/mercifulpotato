Claiming otherwise is silly.<p>Git&#x27;s <i>user interface</i> (porcelain) is <i>not</i> a great thing. Not because it&#x27;s a CLI, but because it&#x27;s not great for non-power end users.<p>Case in point: Lousy naming inconsistencies. Git supports a staging area, but sometimes calls it a staging area &amp; other times calls it an index. &quot;Index&quot; is a terrible term, because the word has too many other meanings. It&#x27;s time for them to use one term (&quot;staging area&quot;); the inconsistency makes things harder to explain &amp; use.<p>Git is excessively complicated for simple uses, and it&#x27;s easy to go wrong. Otherwise there wouldn&#x27;t be sites like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohshitgit.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohshitgit.com&#x2F;</a> and cartoons like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1597&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1597&#x2F;</a><p>Mercurial (hg) shows that it <i>is</i> possible to have a distributed version control system with a simpler and clearer UI.<p>Git has many technical advantages, and I use it all the time. Its fast branching, smart merging, and so on are all awesome. And while some people argue about the staging area, many have found it useful. It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to say &quot;I like the tool&#x27;s capabilities, but its user interface is not so good and needs improvement&quot;.<p>That said, git&#x27;s UI HAS gotten better over time. For example, &quot;git checkout&quot; was overloaded with two different meanings, and more recent versions of git have given them different names (git switch and git restore): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-programmer.info&#x2F;news&#x2F;90-tools&#x2F;13027-git-adds-switch-and-restore.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-programmer.info&#x2F;news&#x2F;90-tools&#x2F;13027-git-adds-s...</a><p>But it&#x27;d be great if the git developers worked to make it easier to understand &amp; use by the non-power-users.')
