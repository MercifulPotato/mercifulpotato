Where they could work from home, live close to family, have a bike commute?<p>It&#x27;s not for me (or you) to decide for others, however :) . I just think there are many more dimensions than raw salary to consider. You could work like a dog for 5 years at a FAANG, make a ton of money, and die just after you retire. It&#x27;s all weighing the risks and rewards and there isn&#x27;t a formula for that.<p>BTW yes, 2-3 months of free time to prep may not be worth it given:<p>* one will miss&#x2F;sacrifice other aspects of life<p>* one may not get the job. Nothing&#x27;s guaranteed, after all<p>* the job may not be right even if they get it')
