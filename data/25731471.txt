I understand the 1st amendment argument, but isn&#x27;t this more an anti-trust case? If a baker won&#x27;t bake you a cake because you&#x27;re gay there are dozens of other bakeries nearby that will, regardless of the merits or lackthereof of choosing not to bake a cake in that situation. If your service provider kicks you off their platform they&#x27;ve destroyed your entire business. I understand if they won&#x27;t allow certain businesses to sign up, or if they give them a reasonable amount of time to transition to another provider, but revoking existing services with very little warning seems extreme.')
