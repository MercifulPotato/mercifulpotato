As a passably straight white man I can afford to pay more than an LGBTQ person of color. Just like I can pay more in income taxes than people in different financial situations.<p>It doesn&#x27;t bother me if an applicant pool is made a bit bigger for marginalized people than myself, because I do not struggle to fall into any applicant pool whatsoever and have not for most of my adult life. Be it for employment, education, or housing.<p>Where conversations can get annoying is when I feel demonized because inequity exists independent of my individual actions. But I can live with someone bitching on Twitter because I&#x27;m not afraid of the police or telling potential employers I have a kid on the way.<p>What I don&#x27;t like living with is the inability of others like myself in my own caste who would dismiss reality on reductionist notions &quot;hiring by race or gender is inherently racist&quot; without critical thought. Ignoring lack of diversity tacitly supports inequity and is itself racist or bigoted, by virtue of doing less than nothing to correct it.')
