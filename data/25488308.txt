Item(by='burntoutfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608488396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25484595, text='&gt; The fine motor skill and expert timing are a given in automation<p>I&#x27;m not convinced. For example, robots are absolutely terrible at handling cloth tasks (for example, folding laundry). I suspect that handling food, which has complex and unique (depending on ripeness etc.) physical responses to manipulation isn&#x27;t much easier. Just try to give some in theory simple slicing tasks (such as - slicing an onion or a chicken fillet) to a 7 year old and see how well he does. The robot is no better.')
