Android is also a rather fat cow.<p>The Android version of this would be &quot;Android Things&quot; which would be perfect for this use-case (and some Googles own hardware is running Flutter on Android Things), but that platform has been completely discontinued. So booting up a thin Linux until you get a Flutter canvas just makes way more sense.')
