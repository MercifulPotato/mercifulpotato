Unless there have been other regulations passed?<p>I can&#x27;t find anything about ePD changes that forces Facebook to do this, all I can find is the upcoming ePR (ePrivacy Regulation) that will affect Facebook and others, but it hasn&#x27;t been passed yet.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of any privacy&#x2F;GDPR&#x2F;ePD changes recently other than the EU-US Privacy Shield invalidation.<p>Is there anything I can read on the changes you&#x27;re talking about?')
