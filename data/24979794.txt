Fiscal spending crates money with no debt (in the process transferring wealth from savers to borrowers). These counter-currents let the system stay stable while credit flows from savers (via equity) and creditors (via debt) to investments and borrowers.<p>Leveraged systems have a multitude of steady states in a zero-sum environment. Even more when tastes and preferences change as human tastes and preferences do.<p>&gt; <i>growth in fossil fuel use are very closely tied</i><p>I have debunked this in another comment [1]. Energy intensity of GDP has been falling for decades. The carbon intensity of our economy is falling faster.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24979345" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24979345</a>')
