Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610924445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802207, text='Regarding legal independence of USA law, you&#x27;re legally right I&#x27;m sure because that&#x27;s indeed how GDPR works. I just can&#x27;t imagine Amazon Europe telling a USA judge &quot;sorry your honor, we really can&#x27;t tell our subsidiary to give you this data relevant to national security, it&#x27;s protected by European laws.&quot; It&#x27;s one company, not a separate entity.<p>Perhaps it would go this way and perhaps they would rather incur sanctions or take to the media when ordered to hand over data stored in Europe. But so we&#x27;re trusting Amazon with our data.<p>I guess, if I&#x27;m being fair, I just don&#x27;t really know enough about this. Perhaps a legal entity in the USA cannot be held liable for not complying with a judge&#x27;s orders to tell its wholly owned subsidiary to do something, or either of them for the subsidiary not complying. It might work that way. I just expect that in practice, they might very well simply comply. Or, like you say, that a &quot;European intelligence agencies carr[ies] out such a task for them&quot;.<p>&gt; message notifications on phones usually use Firebase Cloud Messaging (or the Apple equivalent)<p>When questioned about the privacy of using Google&#x2F;Apple messaging stuff, what I&#x27;ve always heard as reply is that it only nudges the phone to fetch new messages. It still connects directly as well, as I have heard it (though it seems silly to me, why not just put the encrypted message right in there? Or is that a metadata thing then, revealing the message length to Google&#x2F;Apple? Idk).<p>&gt; Knock at the door of that European datacenter and hope employees won&#x27;t say anything to the press?<p>That is very much how legal intercept works. And the NSA doesn&#x27;t do those, it&#x27;s a judge that gives the tap warrant and something like police (or a person of similar status) that executes it. I have never heard of it being leaked that some company is being tapped or in relation to which case (for all we&#x27;d know, it would be on European orders). That taps are happening is a well-known fact, just not on whom and especially not for what purpose. In a tour of an ISP data center, they pointed out now-decommissioned tap boxes to us that the police had put there. Distinctively blue in color if I remember correctly, and a hacker space later made a, um, tap out of one of them (beer tap).<p>&gt; For once, an advantage of The Cloudâ„¢ haha<p>:D<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that hard to find out who&#x27;s running a server (in Europe) when you have its IP address.<p>Indeed; that&#x27;s not what I meant, but I that sentence can indeed be read both ways (sorry). I meant to say that you don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s running servers, like, do you run one? Do I? Or the other way around: do I connect to a Matrix server? You have to actively check the server since the traffic is just TLS on tcp&#x2F;443 (so much for passive tapping). More concretely, if a government (judge, secret service, ...) wants to find whom I talk to, instead of knocking on the door of a (few) central service(s) like Amazon or even Signal itself and telling them to send copies of TCP flow logs, you have to first tap my home IP, mobile data, see where I connect, then check those servers if any of them might be chat servers, then request a tap on those IPs in their respective countries, use that to check who else connects to those, if it&#x27;s more than a handful of people you need to do traffic correlation there as well...<p>I see what you mean, though, with the centralized system requiring one to overcome scaling issues before any intercept can start, and potentially requiring cooperation of a party like Signal who will certainly make a ruckus. Which one will turn out to be easier might depend a lot on the situation.<p>&gt; the NSA and its partner agencies are sitting at every major internet backbone.<p>They definitely have taps in many places, but <i>all</i> of them, in each country? And what about private peerings, can I not talk to anyone within one country without it being caught? Surely when ISPs A and B have a private peering in Germany, the BND doesn&#x27;t automatically have a permanent tap installed there. It seems to me like there would be too many interconnects to really monitor all of them. But this is rather speculative, I don&#x27;t really know. Also about the tier 1 backbones: sure it&#x27;s a fair assumption that a random one of them is being tapped and so we need proper encryption, and also multiple strategic ones, but all of them all the time all across the world? I don&#x27;t know.<p>&gt; (Unless, maybe, your Matrix contacts are all in your neighborhood and are all with the same ISP.)<p>We here are Internet people, we talk to faraway people all the time. A good friend of mine lives on the second-furthest continent, latency-wise (Australia&#x2F;NZ would be further), our traffic typically runs through the USA when we do a traceroute. Some of my friends moved to work in other countries. But an average mom, who does she talk to on WhatsApp? I think the furthest person my mom regularly talks to is me (~50km), and for faraway old friends maybe 150km across the country. The Matrix home server I use traceroutes through the nearest internet junction point (Frankfurt, 200km), I guess depending on how the physical interconnects go this might be on an easily tappable line, but it&#x27;s not a given that it passes through a big backbone to make it onto another ISP&#x27;s network within the country. In case you have some way to tell (I&#x27;m curious now), these seem like the most likely points in the trace:<p><pre><code>    6  bundle-ether2.0003.dbrx.02.fra.de.net.telefonica.de (62.53.28.149)  25.9 ms bundle-ether1.0003.dbrx.02.fra.de.net.telefonica.de (62.53.14.163)  21.5 ms\n    7  bundle-ether1.0005.prrx.02.fra.de.net.telefonica.de (62.53.10.51)  20.1 ms\n    8  ae3-1337.bbr02.anx25.fra.de.anexia-it.net (80.81.195.166)  24.3 ms\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, what I was saying is that if you&#x27;re hiding from the police or an intelligence agency, you&#x27;d probably avoid centralized servers, and that a random public home server is not as centralized as Signal. Not so much that this would definitely prevent a backbone capture, but that it would not make the traffic be caught in the same filter where they capture traffic going to&#x2F;from a central chat service.<p>By the way, in general, I like your reasoning. I think the places we differ in opinion are mainly about how we weigh different risks or how prevalent we assume things are that neither of us can truly know. It&#x27;s interesting to exchange thoughts and speculate about, though. There is no contact info in your profile but it might be fun to talk more about various topics - I see that you were asking in another thread about getting into cyber security. There are already good answers on that particular question, but as someone already in that field, perhaps I can be of help :).
