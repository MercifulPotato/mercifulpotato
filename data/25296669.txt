A good king might bring the country toward democracy but a wise king would take steps to make sure that will not lead to the collapse of the kingdom and possibly not do it if there is a high risk of it leading to serious consequences. Democracies are relatively new and thus are still experimental. The oldest and longest lived empires were usually monarchies. It’s a lot simpler to get things done when the ruler can command the entire nation to change according to their will and thus they will always have the upper hand when at war with a democratic nation of equal power and resources that is limited by their due process. Monarchs only have to worry about invasion, collapse of the economy, natural disasters and uprisings. Democratic rulers have to worry about all that and being liked by anyone that can vote. The bottom line is when you don’t have to worry about what people think or who owns what resources and can issue orders with no questions asked you are more effective at leading an army. The advantage however only applies when the monarch is intelligent enough to plan effectively or has a very wise and trusted council who can do this for them.')
