There&#x27;s something missing about Deno and why people will still use and love Node, and it&#x27;s not all about std API as much as it&#x27;s not all about DX. Because he&#x27;s just someone who don&#x27;t stop learning.<p>I wish this Guo Lai Ren is something more common to people. The tolerance and desire to experience more, the other side, the beyond-comfort-zone<p>Edit: thanks for the character development link.')
