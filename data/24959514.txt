Because as individuals, they focus on the things that matter to them, and that enable them to have much higher incomes - like education as one obvious example.<p>Those attitudes, motivations, concerns, behaviours are passed down from generation to generation and though it&#x27;s unfair to characterize anyone by their culture, those things have tremendous impact.')
