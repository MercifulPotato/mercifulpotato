Or you can rent their cheapest model for $59&#x2F;month, $708&#x2F;year.<p>&gt; You can also buy the equivalent Mac Mini for $1,899.<p>Not only that, but MacStadium lets you run multiple VMs on a single Mac at no extra cost.  Amazon&#x27;s offering is seriously underwhelming.<p>The more I use or learn about MacStadium, the less impressed I am with it (3 layers of virtualisation is overkill in my opinion!), but it beats the hell out of what Amazon has just announced.<p>The big problem with CI&#x2F;CD on Mac is that Xcode does not allow you to run builds in parallel, so you need one Mac per build unless you use virtualisation.<p>To be honest I&#x27;m surprised that no one has added namespace&#x2F;jail support to macOS yet.  The XNU kernel is open source so this should be possible.  In fact, can someone explain to me why there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any sort of XNU hacking community?')
