If you work in manufacturing and you&#x27;re any good at your job, you analyze what it actually cost to make a product. If for example, the price of a commodity heavily used in your product bottoms out from a previously very high price, you should make a call to your supplier demanding some kind of price adjustment (either future or retroactively).<p>SV paid high prices because the explosive growth and geographic constraints made housing prices very high, therefore salaries had to go up to entice people to come. Rising salaries were not based on competition for talent alone.<p>I get that a lot of companies are posturing that they wont localize pay, but eventually they&#x27;ll wise up since their talent pool has grown very significantly. Salaries use to go because pool of applicants who were willing to move to SV was a lot smaller. Now that limitation has all but evaporated. These companies aren&#x27;t stupid, they&#x27;ll find cost savings just like those people moving to the boonies.')
