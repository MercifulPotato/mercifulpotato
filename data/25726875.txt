They don&#x27;t dictate instructions, they regularly spend time with business people to understand their needs and what they care about, work with engineers and designers to craft solutions that are the best suited to what the business needs. When the relationship works well engineers are shielded from constant interruptions, and can rely on one person to answer their business questions instead of trying to have discussions between all the stakeholders.<p>As an engineer I was myself very skeptical of the role in the past but then worked with 2 awesome product owners for a few years and it was a fantastic experience.')
