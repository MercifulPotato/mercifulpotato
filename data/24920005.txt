ADAS systems will kill people, as all systems can and will fail. Six people (the number of people killed while Tesla vehicles had Autopilot engaged) seems within a tolerable amount if we expect progress to reduce human caused vehicular deaths. NHTSA and adjacent regulatory bodies allow Tesla to continue to sell Autopilot functionality, and allow it to remain active on sold vehicles. Their opinion counts far greater than that of Consumer Reports.')
