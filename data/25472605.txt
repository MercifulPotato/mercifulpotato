Not even slack clone or email.  And if we don&#x27;t use something for 90 days we lose it.  It&#x27;s not uncommon in my role to have to request something every day. Then have to wait for manager approval, sometimes one up approval, Then resource owner approval, Then wait for provisioning etc. Even read only github access requires senior manager approval (A relatively high role, like 3-4 away from the CEO at a Fortune 50 company)<p>We can&#x27;t plug in USB drives either and our database queries are logged and suspicious queries (the heuristics for &quot;suspicious&quot; is not great admittedly) automatically get sent to your manager. Even the files on the hard drive are scanned.  I&#x27;ve had so many false positives for the prior two things.<p>Also we&#x27;re totally moving away from laptops.  Everything will be a thin client.  The performance on the things is miserable due to oversubscription and technical limitations.')
