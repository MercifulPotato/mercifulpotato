The  protocol  s&#x2F;MIME  (V3)  allows  signed receipts,  security  labels,  and  secure  mailing  lists  and  is  layered  on  Cryptographic  Message  Syntax (CMS), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specification for cryptographic protected messages. It can be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt any form of digitaldata.The  underlying  certificate  used  by  the  s&#x2F;MIME  mechanism  has  to  be  in  compliance  with  X.509 standard.  In  order  to  ensure  common  standards  and  procedures  with other  Prüm  applications,  the processing  rules  for  s&#x2F;MIME  encryption  operations  or  to  be  applied  under  various  Commercial Product of the Shelves (COTS) environments, are as follows:<p>–the sequence of the operations is: first encryption and then signing,<p>–the encryption algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256 bit key length and RSA  with 1024  bit  key  length  shall  be  applied  for  symmetric  and  asymmetric  encryption respectively,<p>–the hash algorithm SHA-1 shall be applied.<p>s&#x2F;MIME  functionality  is  built  into  the  vast  majority  of  modern  e-mail  software  packages  including Outlook, Mozilla Mail aswell as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major e-mail software packages.Because of s&#x2F;MIME&#x27;s easy integration into national IT infrastructure at all States&#x27; sites, it is selected as a viable mechanism to implement the communication security level. For achieving the goal &#x27;Proof of  Concept&#x27;in  a  more  efficient  way  and  reducing  costs  the  open  standard  JavaMail  API  is  however chosen for prototyping DNA data exchange. JavaMail API provides simple encryption and decryption of  e-mails  using s&#x2F;MIME  and&#x2F;or  OpenPGP.  The  intent  is  to  provide  a  single,  easy-to-use  API  for  e-mail clients that want to send and receive encrypted e-mail in either of the two most popular e-mail encryption  formats.  Therefore  any  state-of-the-art  implementations  to  JavaMail  API  will  suffice  for the requirements set by Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three,  such as the  product of Bouncy Castle  JCE (Java Cryptographic Extension), which will be  used to implement s&#x2F;MIME for prototyping DNA data exchange among all States.<p>Curiously, the phrase &quot;JavaMail API provides simple encryption and decryption of  e-mails  using s&#x2F;MIME  and&#x2F;or  OpenPGP.&quot; appears to be taken directly from this[1] SourceForge page from 2004<p>[1]<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;javamail-crypto.sourceforge.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;javamail-crypto.sourceforge.net&#x2F;</a>')
