Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24929525, 24929687], score=None, time=1603968796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928991, text='&gt; People will (rightly) ask you to state the rules before you enforce them.<p>Will they? Lots of communities do just fine without spelling them out. If you go over the line, you get a warning by a moderator etc, or, if you&#x27;ve gone way past the line, you get kicked out. You don&#x27;t need to know where exactly that line is drawn, because reasonable people don&#x27;t come close to crossing it. And unreasonable people don&#x27;t care about lines and rules.<p>If you do spell it out, you invite litigation of rules and endless &quot;but you didn&#x27;t punish <i>that</i>&quot; and in the end you&#x27;ll have to say &quot;yeah well, I didn&#x27;t find that offensive&quot;, so it&#x27;s back to &quot;there&#x27;s a line, but there&#x27;s also some rules that are meaningless, because in the end the line I draw on the spot is what matters&quot;.<p>Since those kinds of rules will always be vague, and will never be applied evenly, I doubt they are helpful. Maybe there&#x27;s a small subset of people that would behave perfectly reasonable only if there&#x27;s a guide book of rules that they can abide by, but I don&#x27;t think that group is large enough to offset the problems CoCs bring.')
