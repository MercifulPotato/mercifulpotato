Item(by='sgift', descendants=None, kids=[25237217], score=None, time=1606558814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236663, text='&gt; Why would I then base a development project on Rust, if there&#x27;s neither a spec nor an alternate implementation? This is strictly worse than what we have now.<p>How exactly is having one compiler defining what is okay and what is not worse than &quot;what we have now&quot;? The multiple implementations of C++ are all incompatible with each other in various subtle ways, produce code which works differently and at the end of the day everyone just takes one and says &quot;we write C++ which works with &lt;compiler&gt;&quot; and that&#x27;s it.<p>&gt; When Mozilla announced they were getting rid of Rust teams, all we heard from said Rust devs was that this doesn&#x27;t spell the end for Rust. My impression was that they were mainly motivated by advancing their language rather than, you know, implementing a browser.<p>Why exactly is it a problem that the core team of a language is interested in the language? Or do you want to imply that the rust devs working on Firefox weren&#x27;t interested in it? All the progress Firefox made in the last few years tells a very different story (yes, not all of it is due to rust, but a relevant part is).<p>&gt; And to this date, I haven&#x27;t really read a critical post-mortem addressing claims that Rust can actually replace C or C++ in the areas where these languages are essential. Apart from kernels and drivers (where Rust seems an outright no-go), C is traditionally used for higher-level language runtimes and compilers&#x2F;interpreters&#x2F;VMs. But Rust&#x27;s borrow checker is a bad fit for just about any text book algorithm and technique in that space. Hell, even Rust devs themselves say implementing a DOM is about the worst use case for Rust.<p>If you haven&#x27;t read any critical postmortem about Rusts difficulties in these spaces you haven&#x27;t looked around very much. This is an impression I generally get from your post. You don&#x27;t like Rust (for some reason, it&#x27;s not very clear what it is) and seem to have an axe to grind with it. Which is .. okay? No one forces you to like a language, but doesn&#x27;t make for a very interesting conversation.')
