The purpose of CVEs is to ensure that we&#x27;re talking about the same vulnerability when we discuss a vulnerability; to canonicalize well-known vulnerabilities. It&#x27;s not to create a reliable feed of all vulnerabilities, and certainly not as an awards system for soi-disant vulnerability researchers.<p>If we stopped asking so much from CVEs, stopped paying attention to resume and product claims of CVEs generated (or detected, or scanned for, or whatever), and stopped trying to build services that monitor CVEs, we might see a lot less bogus data. And, either way, the bogus data would probably matter less.<p>(Don&#x27;t get me started on CVSS).')
