It&#x27;s very likely that a half dosage&#x2F;reduced dosage might be deemed acceptable, but AFAIK no national authority has allowed a dosage regime deviation from what was tested in the Phase III trials. The closest would be the UK allowing upto a 12 week gap between doses of the Oxford vaccine. I agree that it&#x27;s probably worth it to half the dosage and double the number of people who can be covered when initial supplies are so limited, but till the FDA makes that call, we have to stick to the dosage as specified.')
