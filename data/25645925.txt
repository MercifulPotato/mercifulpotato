Amusing or not it suggests that perhaps you are missing something that those experts are aware of.<p>&gt;&gt; We need something better if we ever want to leave our solar system and colonize space.<p>The way I understand it -I am, myself, no expert in the matter- we could be colonising space right now, the challenges are primarily engineering and economic (it would cost too much to develop the necessary technology) but we are not really lacking fundamental knowledge of how to do it, e.g. generation ships <i>could</i> work for that purpose, in principle, but nobody is mad enough to build one, let alone ride it if one was built.')
