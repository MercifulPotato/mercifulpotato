Most people feel shame if they take advantage of someone else which is good and keeps your society together. Some people feel shame if they get abused which is bad because the abuser can continue.<p>I wonder what the debate of nature vs nurture is with respect to shame? I cannot think up any example for inborn shame. Maybe murder? When a human intentionally kills another one there is usually a mental switch to not consider the other as a human anymore.')
