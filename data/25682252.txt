I personally didn&#x27;t like it. I come from a Hibernate&#x2F;JVM background. Writing a data access layer with that much boilerplate isn&#x27;t something I consider to be practical in today&#x27;s fast paced environments.<p>After sqlx, I gave sqlc (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kyleconroy&#x2F;sqlc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kyleconroy&#x2F;sqlc</a>) a try and I found it to be much more painless than any other database solution (for PostgreSQL) for Golang.<p>Edit: sqlc is an inversed solution. Instead of generating SQL queries using Golang, you write annotated SQL queries and sqlc generates Golang source from them.')
