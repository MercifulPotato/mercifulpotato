Depending on the application this might be completely fine. This is not a security risk of flatpak but of the application. Developers are responsible for releasing updates, not flatpak.</i><p>Not so much in a system that links executable dynamically to system provided libraries (e.g. Debian), or provides system wide maintenance updates to statically linked binaries when their dependencies receive important updates (e.g. Alpine).<p>...which really covers every sane, actively maintained *nix system with a package manager, so in that sense Flatpak is definitely a step down. Instead of trusting, say, the Debian or OpenBSD maintainers to provide timely security updates, you have to trust each individual vendor of your flatpaks.<p>The only advantage I can see for them is in providing closed source software, which OS maintainers simply can&#x27;t maintain and update. A developer advantage may be that the standard of inclusion is much lower than for Debian or OpenBSD, but that&#x27;s IMO a user disadvantage.')
