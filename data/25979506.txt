It has, maybe,  \n  some documentary value, but it does not substitute\n  documentation on other invariants. For example, your \n  invariant might be something like I’m expecting here a \n  monotonically increasing array of numbers with a mean \n  value of such and such and a standard deviation of such \n  and such. The best any static type checking will let you \n  do is “array[float]”. The rest of your invariant must be \n  expressed in words as a documentation of that function.\n</code></pre>\nI wonder if &quot;design by contract&quot; [1] tooling would help here?  It seems to me one could express the stated invariants of the array as pre- or post-conditions on any function processing that array.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?DesignByContract" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?DesignByContract</a>')
