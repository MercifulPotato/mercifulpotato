But I know a number of men (to go with the example) who think it&#x27;s <i>unmasculine</i> to dance (or to dance in certain styles and settings). However, as a single guy taking up ballroom and tango dancing was a great idea for meeting women (along with, at that time in my life, getting in better shape and starting to dress better). The notion that &quot;real men don&#x27;t dance&quot; (like real men don&#x27;t eat quiche) is harmful to many individuals because it&#x27;s become internalized as a quality of themselves due to identity and not due to actual preference.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with labeling and holding onto an identity too strongly. It can contradict the actual desires of the individual and can often contradict reality.<p>But I agree, don&#x27;t force it on people. I&#x27;ve never tried to force anyone into something they don&#x27;t want to do. When they, on a rare occasion, participate in something they ostensibly hate and express real joy in the experience, it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s not the activity that&#x27;s the problem but something else.')
