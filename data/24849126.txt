Most people aren&#x27;t even aware that Google.com is still both HTTP and HTTPS; you can easily test with curl or lynx to verify yourself.  If your browser doesn&#x27;t support HTTPS (e.g., maybe its blocked in your library or another free wifi), then Google.com would still work just fine.  (Another question is that many other sites aren&#x27;t as easily available, sadly.)')
