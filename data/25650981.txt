And this could be resolved simply by asking public health experts to do the relevant studies.<p>My concern is that is not going to happen, or—more likely—public health experts will issue a recommendation which will be ignored by the the politicians. The reasoning is that people’s pet argument of <i>extra daylight hour</i> is convincing enough.<p>Also note that this pet argument ignores the majority of the working class who will most likely be working this extra hour in the service industry.')
