The number is always <i>available</i>, but from the sound of it, someone about to commit self-harm is often feeling hopeless, alone, and <i>has severe tunnel vision</i>. So you have to get the offer of help <i>right</i> in front of them. This is why the number is posted all over bridges.<p>It&#x27;s also allegedly a very acute thing. Many individuals contemplating self-harm, I am told, don&#x27;t <i>really</i> want to, and are in that vulnerable moment only briefly, maybe only ever a few times. So helping them is truly possible.')
