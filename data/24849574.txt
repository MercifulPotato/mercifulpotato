It&#x27;s the option you <i>prefer</i>, not the only viable one.<p>It&#x27;s also a lie to pretend that Google is any more evil than DDG. Both are capitalist corporations marketing a story to convince people to give them money (in this case, to convince you to make money for them). Neither of these organizations have morals, they have profit margins and consumer strategies. &quot;Privacy&quot; is just the tech equivalent of &quot;Organic&quot;, a marketing tool to convince you to choose their brand. Eventually Google will get on the &quot;privacy train&quot; and people will completely forget they were &quot;evil&quot;, just like with Microsoft. It&#x27;s all so much Eurasia versus Eastasia.')
