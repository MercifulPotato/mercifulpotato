Both are hitting keys on a keyboard after all.<p>I agree that, if you&#x27;re hiring someone who will primarily be managing others or, maybe, architecting some systems, without doing the actual implementation (which, btw, I think is a suboptimal way of doing things), then you shouldn&#x27;t test their coding. But if you&#x27;re hiring someone to code, you need to check they understand how strings, memory, dynamic programming etc works.')
