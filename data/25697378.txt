Since we don&#x27;t keep personal data of deleted accounts I cannot tell you who it was but I am 99.999% sure it wasn&#x27;t actually Donald Trump. Both deleted and suspended accounts return HTTP 410 Gone. I don&#x27;t know why this is getting posted now as news.<p>That being said, the actual Donald Trump would not be welcome on mastodon.social, nor would he be welcome on most servers that I am familiar with. He would likely have to host his own Mastodon server.')
