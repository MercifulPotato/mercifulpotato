Item(by='Infinitesimus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611438761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885410, text='&gt; You talk about OTA updates as if thatâ€™s some huge technological moat? Hell, cars have been receiving very frequent software updates for over a decade.<p>I think OTAs are a moat but highlight an important incentive difference. Traditional automakers want to sell you next year&#x27;s model of the car. Tesla seems like they want your car to get better over time.<p>Perhaps it is organizational cruft or the dealer network but consider even the simple case of adaptive cruise control systems in cars today that have radar + cameras. Most of those systems bounce between lanes and can&#x27;t even stay centered well. This is something that could be a software fix but you&#x27;ll have to wait for the next N models when they redesign the car to see it.<p>Infotainment systems are another example - they are almost universally crappy and it is rare to get updates OTA. Shipping a car with capable hardware and slowly improving software capability imo is a smarter long-term approach.<p>Time will tell though.')
