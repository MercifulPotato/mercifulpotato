It seems like it would be much better way to demonstrate the point if the author wrote 100 pages about producing more work&#x2F;art&#x2F;code, without any rhyme or reason or editing. After all, the thesis is &quot;Quantity leads to quality&quot;, why not just <i>do</i> that?<p>Of course, I appreciate concise writing and if it were 100 unedited rambling pages it would never be posted on HN or read by anyone. But admitting that seems to be antithetical to the entire point of the blogpost. It just seems like the article doesn&#x27;t even believe in the idea. It also feels like there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of thought put into the post, and I guess that&#x27;s evidenced by the fact that the art class anecdote doesn&#x27;t have a source.<p>The blogpost also ignores all of the issues related to being prolific. Imagine a would-be-weightlifter who has awful form, but does a ton of reps. Not only is their exercise near worthless, it could be potentially dangerous. Or in music, where you could accidentally continually practice a bad habit instead of taking the time to find a mentor and learn how to practice correctly. In software, you could potentially produce something that is buggy and insecure by default. If the code were then included as a dependency in larger projects it could be a cause for a security disaster. I think there&#x27;s more to high-quality work&#x2F;practice than just doing it more often, even if that ends up being the most important part of getting good at something.')
