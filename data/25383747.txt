I do remember having the exact same problem on my 1994 Passat, where the radio would lock itself and you had to go to the dealer to have it unlocked.<p>&gt;&gt;And we do not have the pin, we were never given a pin<p>Literally the same problem, except 25 years later :P Manufacturers almost never issued these special pins to unlock radios.<p>And like, disconnecting the battery has always been a problem in cars, BMWs, Mercs, Opels, Peugeots, Fiats - I&#x27;ve had them all and they all did something weird if you disconnected the battery - more often than not, a check engine light would pop up and you had to bring it to the dealer to clear it. This is not new.')
