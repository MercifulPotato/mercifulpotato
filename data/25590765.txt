And then it sometimes comes wrong anyway.<p>Source: ordered a 2017 Chrysler Pacifica. Couldn&#x27;t order 15&quot; wheels with premium trim. Ordered a spare tire, and got the built-in vacuum instead (this worked out OK, the donut spare, ordered separately, fits under in the middle seat stowage, if you finagle it). Still would have prefered 15&quot; wheels over 17&quot; or whatever we had to order, but not enough to buy new wheels. Would not recommend buying that early in the model cycle, but that&#x27;s somewhat separate from ordering; except that they had no Pacificas on the lot to sell anyway, so it wasn&#x27;t too hard to convince them to order one.')
