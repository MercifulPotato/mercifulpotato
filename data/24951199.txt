It&#x27;s one thing if it&#x27;s a website for throwing virtual sheep at another; nobody really cares if your Facebook feed omits an update or two.  It&#x27;s another thing if a software bug means that you die.  Or at least it should be - I&#x27;m amazed at the number of people who seemingly don&#x27;t care.<p>I also wonder what this is doing to Tesla&#x27;s brand reputation.  I was just in the market for solar panels and Tesla&#x27;s offering (both the panels and the solar roof) was very, very attractive on price &amp; aesthetics, but their reliability record with their cars made me think twice about buying a 25+ year product that keeps my home powered and dry.')
