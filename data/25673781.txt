They are convinced the election was stolen and nothing you (or he) says would sway their minds. Insulting would only lead to anger.<p>You have to acknowledge the feelings of the other individual before they&#x27;ll listen. They see themselves as good, honorable people, so you address them as such. Once you have their attention in an agreeable manner (instead of an antagonistic manner), you can address the issue at hand.<p>Trump did precisely this. He empathized with them and their cause. After he had an agreeable mood somewhat established, he then appealed to consequences.<p>If he hadn&#x27;t asked them to stop, congress&#x27; attempt to reconvene would have no doubt been interrupted as well. The fact that didn&#x27;t happen goes a long way against the claim that it was a call to violence.')
