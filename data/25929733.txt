Item(by='bitcurious', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611762789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928970, text='&gt; In my experience, which is limited to phone cameras and the like, they seem to produce realistic images at short ranges, but a landscape picture looks much smaller and more distant than how the scene seems to me as I take it, unless I zoom in. That has me wondering if there is some geometry that would give realistic-looking pictures at all distances? Perhaps if the camera is sized such that the lens-to-sensor distance is about the same as the eye-to-picture distance when viewing the images?<p>If you have access to camera with a manual hardware zoom, put it up to your right eye, keep your left eye open. Adjust the zoom on the camera until what you see with your right and lines up with what you see with your left.<p>That’s the perspective that you see at. Do this with a few friends and you’ll find out that you all see at slightly different “zoom levels,” meaning there can’t be an out of the box universal “eyesight lens.”')
