It highly depends on the project and what you look at. I wouldn&#x27;t sign &quot;hardware can never be remote&quot;, but I also think &quot;hardware always can be done remotely&quot; is very wrong. And that leaves out the massive space of hybrid models.<p>I.e. I do know of embedded projects where the hardware designer works out of his living room and the software developers are spread across Europe. Does that count? Or doesn&#x27;t it because the PCB fab and assembly service obviously works out of a factory? It certainly is remote as far as the developers are concerned - and it wouldn&#x27;t work as well if the device in question didn&#x27;t easily fit on a desk.<p>Somehow embedded developers often tend to (understandably) bemoan that the overall &quot;software community&quot; doesn&#x27;t understand their work, while at the same time falling into the same trap regarding the breadth of what embedded development is today.')
