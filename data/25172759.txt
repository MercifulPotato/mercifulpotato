In fact it&#x27;s the one social media account I didn&#x27;t get rid of. For two reasons mainly:<p>* Announcements - Some of the sports I follow don&#x27;t have a &quot;regular season&quot; like e.g. Basketball or American Football, they are organised more like boxing where an athlete may compete for one federation or another, and the events don&#x27;t follow a pre-determined schedule: so you need to keep up with the news if you want to be able to watch them at all.<p>* Instructionals - athletes often will publish instructional videos and when that happens they advertise them on their channels. Those are usually an order of magnitude more in-depth than anything you can find for free (e.g. Youtube) - I was never very athletic but I&#x27;m finally trying to get better so those are very helpful for me. (Edit: Of course this is a form of advertising but I&#x27;m very disciplined and avoid overspending at all costs, I buy instructionals once in a blue moon).')
