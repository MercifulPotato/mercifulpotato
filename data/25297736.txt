I don&#x27;t see the emails in my sent items, but when the receiving party replies (his boss) I see the original email that was sent from my old email address.<p>The party invite was from a real person, not those evite sites.<p>I can no longer login to the old account and my recovery options no longer work.<p>While yes, the possibility of a hacked account crossed my mind, but Gmail is pretty loud when someone logs in from a new ip.<p>This has been atleast 2 years now.<p>Maybe I should call him.
