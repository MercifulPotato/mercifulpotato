This is not about margin accounts. When trading on margin, it&#x27;s RH that&#x27;s financing you and taking on the risk. That&#x27;s separate from what the clearing house does. Incidentally, RH did increase margin requirements due to the higher volatility.<p>2. The problem is RH offers instant settlement. That is, you can use your proceeds from a trade immediately in the apo, before even the trade is settled. That exposes RH, and the clearing house to settlement failures, and that&#x27;s true regardless if the trade was done on a margin account or not. And that&#x27;s the risk that clearing houses try to mitigate via asking for collateral.')
