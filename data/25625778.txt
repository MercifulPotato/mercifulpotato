The average is somewhere around 16 so that gives a standard deviation of 4.<p>So there&#x27;s about 3 standard deviations between the two, this sounds like quite a bit but really means they&#x27;re both 1.5 standard deviations from the supposed mean. Which is, not great, though it might pass some of the weaker statistical tests.<p>Now you should actually weight the values by the total number of impressions in which case you might get a slightly higher significance since the one with 12 clicks was seen by more people.<p>So on the balance you should be wondering what you&#x27;re paying the graphic designer for, but perhaps not start a new career designing low-budget adds.')
