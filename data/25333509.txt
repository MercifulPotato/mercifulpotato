It’s clearly become an activist website, or at least one that looks the other way while pages are rewritten to fit the zeitgeist.<p>I’d like to see a Wikipedia in the old encyclopedia style, when being neutral was the goal. As stated in their own rules, Wikipedia just uses the collective opinion of its sources, many of which are extremely biased.')
