Item(by='jyriand', descendants=None, kids=[24706182], score=None, time=1602056421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705980, text='Few days back I stumbled upon a video about Ramanujan [0] and the: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ..(to infinity) = -1&#x2F;12.(Turns out the proof in the video is incorrect or at least not concise enough, because you can&#x27;t do that with divergent series). So that got me curious and I wanted to understand what&#x27;s going on. How can 1 + 2 .. etc equal to -1&#x2F;12 and not infinity. So I went on small binge watching videos to get an intuition and understanding about this. This led me to Riemann Hypothesis and Euler&#x27;s identities and complex numbers etc. Now I have a list of books that I want to skim&#x2F;read to get a historical context around these problems. I don&#x27;t take any notes just yet, because I don&#x27;t know what is important and what is not, I just jump into the stuff and hope that when I come out of the other end I will at least have a understanding why it equals -1&#x2F;12. It&#x27;s like panning out gold, there might be some gold nuggets. And maybe, just by pure chance, I come up with some ridiculous ideas how to disprove Riemann Hypothesis ;P (I think I have to revisit Gödel, Escher, Bach and Gödel&#x27;s Incompletness Theorems to prove that it&#x27;s not provable).<p>- [0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww</a><p>EDIT: Sorry to all facepalming mathematicians who happen to read this comment.')
