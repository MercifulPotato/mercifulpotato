I always wish that CPU reviewers would stop churning out pages of graphs with synthetic benchmark workloads and instead post things that actually matter, like compile times and other programming benchmarks.<p>The M1 processor is extremely impressive for the price and power envelope. However, I&#x27;m noticing a lot of people have taken Apple&#x27;s marketing material a bit too literally and assumed that it somehow beats any and every desktop CPU out there, which is clearly not the case.<p>Moreover, as the author mentions: A significant portion of Apple&#x27;s lead came from buying exclusivity on TSMC&#x27;s 5nm process through the end of the year. It will be interesting to see how AMD stacks up as they roll out 5nm parts in the future, compared to Apple&#x27;s scaled up M1 successors.<p>Exciting times. It&#x27;s good to have some progress in CPU technologies again after years of Intel stagnation.')
