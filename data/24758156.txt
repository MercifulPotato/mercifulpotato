Remember that actual health problems almost always develop over time. Even COVID takes days to kill you. At 40, you have a low likelihood of sudden cardiac death. It can happen, of course, but as long as you work out and eat well, you&#x27;re doing what you can. So, if you feel like hell for 5 minutes, with distinct waves, it&#x27;s probably a panic attack.<p>The tingling symptoms you get are probably the result of hyperventilating. Slowing down your breathing can help. To an extent, though, these things just have to be ridden out.<p>Cold water helps a lot. Go to the sink and splash water on your face. Optimal temperature seems to be 20 C (68 F). That&#x27;ll help lower your heart rate. Slow your breathing to match.<p>Also, as someone with panic attacks, I know that during the first ones, I feared the shame and embarrassment that would accrue to sudden collapse at a young age (I was 24). Thing is, no one&#x27;s going to think it&#x27;s your fault. If you have a random-ass heart attack at 24 (or 40), it&#x27;s not something you did and you shouldn&#x27;t feel bad about yourself. You can still die-- life is inherently risky-- but no one&#x27;s going to think bad of you for being unlucky, and you shouldn&#x27;t think bad of yourself (in that extremely low-probability counterfactual) either.<p>Death: either there&#x27;s an afterlife or there isn&#x27;t. If there is one, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what&#x27;s on the other side of this whole thing. If there&#x27;s no afterlife, you won&#x27;t exist to be disappointed. Either way, not worth dread. People <i>die</i>, but no one <i>is dead</i>. If those who have left us still exist, they probably see themselves as more alive than they were when down here; and if they don&#x27;t exist, then it is not accurate to say they <i>are dead</i> so much as they just <i>aren&#x27;t</i>.<p>Plenty of Buddhists meditate on their own death. It helps to process the inevitable; to dedicate 10 or 20 minutes once in a while to the acknowledgement of mortality. Don&#x27;t do this during a panic attack because you can&#x27;t really &quot;meditate&quot; while in one.<p>Music often helps. Smells can help, as long as you don&#x27;t develop that meta-level anxiety.<p>There&#x27;s also no shame in seeking therapy and medication. You said 20 attacks since April-- that&#x27;s about 1 per week. If that&#x27;s all you have, taking a benzo, typically at a low starting dose, as-needed, isn&#x27;t going to make you an addict. You don&#x27;t want to be taking those things every day though.<p>Finally, panic attacks do end. They are the ultimate troll, and they can throw all sorts of weird-ass symptoms (including phantom smells) but they don&#x27;t last forever. Each wave, in my experience, is about 90 seconds (90 horrible seconds). Awareness, crescendo, semi-relief, return to merely moderate anxiety. The interval of vulnerability (in which these waves are prominent in my mind) is 15â€“60 minutes, 90 minutes on the outside.<p>As I get older, the attacks themselves get a lot milder. That said, the physical recovery is more of an issue. Even a mild attack leaves me feeling like I overdid it at the gym. But I&#x27;ll take that over the all-out psychic horror I experienced in many of my first ~50 panic attacks.<p>Good luck! I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you&#x27;re going through this.')
