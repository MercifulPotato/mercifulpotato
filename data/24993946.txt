For me, vim is all about the cumulative benefits of plugins and little hacks like this that optimize my workflow in a way that aligns to how my brain already thinks.<p>The main criticism I receive for this setup is that if I ever have to ssh into a machine that I don&#x27;t control, I won&#x27;t have any of my custom settings and fancy plugins, but I&#x27;m ok with this since my custom vim setup is my IDE and I wouldn&#x27;t expect to have my IDE available in an SSH session if it were vscode or webstorm or whatever. Also, it&#x27;s possible to edit files over ssh, and worst case scenario I just temporarily switch contexts to hjkl, but in practice I don&#x27;t really have to edit code over ssh.')
