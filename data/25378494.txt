No issues, no bugs encountered. Granted I&#x27;m only 6 hours in, but still. I think people go out of their way to find things to complain and be negative about.<p>Frankly 1.0 releases of just about anything these days are buggy.<p>I don&#x27;t expect initial releases of anything to be error free, and in a world of internet based distribution and continuous updates of games, I&#x27;m turned off by constant complaints about initial releases.<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was pushed back to address problems and people complained. They released with problems and people complain.<p>Game companies can&#x27;t win in any scenario.<p>Announce too soon? Complain. Release when you say you will, but with bugs, complain. Release late to address bugs, complain.<p>Tangentially related, IMO the term &quot;beta release&quot; has evolved from being a true &quot;help us test and find bugs&quot; as a marketing tool to excuse negative feedback.')
