It is a sad story. I loved when Sting reacted to Disney&#x27;s decision of canning all his songs and come up with 1 song (obviously so Disney can put his name on the credits) instead of sending them their way he said: &quot;I am a craftsman&quot; I gather he meant that he will give them their song because they ask him for one. Great intro song he gave them.')
