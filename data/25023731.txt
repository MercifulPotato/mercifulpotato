Are you kidding? CI is generally 2-4 points in these election polls.<p>The models and their data are public. The 538 model predicted an 80%CI of electoral votes for Biden as: 267-419, with the CI centered around 348.49 EVs. That means that Biden had an 80% chance of landing in the above confidence interval. Things seem to be shaking out to Biden winning with 297 EVs. Notice that this falls squarely within the CI of the model, but much farther from the median of the CI than expected.<p>So yes, the results fell within the CI.<p>Drilling into Florida specifically (simply because I&#x27;ve been playing around with Florida&#x27;s data), the 538 model predicts an 80%CI of Biden winning 47.55%-54.19% of the vote. Biden lost Florida, and received 47.8% of the vote. Again, note that this is on the left side of this CI but still within it. The 538 model was correct, the actual results just resided in its left tail.')
