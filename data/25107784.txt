In Charles Koch&#x27;s case, he will have that congressperson&#x27;s direct phone line. When he goes to Washington, they&#x27;ll have a sit down meal together. Hell, if he wanted it, he could have asked for and received a cabinet position or an ambassadorship.<p>That isn&#x27;t just free speech -- that is derailing democracy. By limiting contribution amounts, it will make the elected less beholden to big donors.')
