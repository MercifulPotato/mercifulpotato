For this reason, I doubt we&#x27;ll see a Republican Senator from California anytime soon.\n- Republicans running for state positions tend to be more moderate, and sound a lot more palatable as a result.  Doubly so for the less political positions like state auditor and treasurer, which are not about making policy as much as just making sure we use the state&#x27;s resources appropriately.  At least, for the candidates I see on my ballot in San Francisco.')
