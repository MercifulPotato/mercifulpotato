Anything not implemented in the prototype is not in the patent.</i><p>Interesting rule. I&#x27;m not sure that a single prototype per patent is reasonable, though, given that claims may cover mutually exclusive claims and divergent use-cases.<p>A set of prototypes that collectively cover all claims (though not all possible combinations of claims) might work, except that the hard part might still be reducing to practice a particular combination of claims not in any of the prototypes.<p>Eg. A patent that has claims for electronic storage and playback of music and claims for a handheld data storage device (each claim embodied separately in prototypes) as well as the combination of a handheld device for electronic storage and playback of music (claim not embodied in a prototype).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to construct the rules in such a way that you aren&#x27;t either saddling inventors with the need to produce a huge number of prototypes representing a combinatorial explosion of claims and their combinations, nor allowing patent holders to extort subsequent inventors for inventions that they could never have reduced to practice themselves.<p>Leaving the determination of which combinations of claims to allow as &quot;reducing to practice is left as an exercise for the engineer&quot; up to the patent examiner still leaves in place the existing misalignment of incentives that the current system has, except it makes applying for patents more expensive.')
