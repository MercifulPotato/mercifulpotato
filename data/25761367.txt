Just the same way you don&#x27;t understand twitter to have tons of thugs because of what you&#x27;ve seen.  More people have been killed and linked to #killallmen (which has trended nationally on twitter multiple times) than died at the DC riots. There&#x27;s plenty of room for subjectivity, but I do think it&#x27;s objective to say thugs exist on both platforms.')
