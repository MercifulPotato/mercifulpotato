But everyone&#x27;s <i>equating</i> eventual consistency with the noticeable lag itself, implying that EC per se is a bad thing.<p>For an analogy, it would be like if people were talking about how rectangular cakes suck, because &lt;problems of unequal width vs length&gt;, and thus they use square cakes, but ... square cakes are rectangular too.<p>(What&#x27;s going on is that people use &lt;larger set&gt; to mean &lt;larger set, excluding members that qualify for smaller set&gt;. &lt;larger set&gt; = eventual consistency, rectangle; &lt;smaller set&gt; = strong consistency, square.)<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s not a problem for communication because everyone implicitly understands what&#x27;s going on and uses the words the same way, but I wish people spoke in terms of &quot;has anyone actually seen a consistency lag?&quot; rather than &quot;has anyone actually seen eventual consistency?&quot;, since the latter is not the right way to frame it, and is actually a good thing to have, which happened both before and after this development.')
