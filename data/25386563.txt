All the investors in the world looks first and foremost to make money. They paint this in different colors and VC investors in SF are no different. But the rule remains the same - they are here to make money. \nIf a competitor of Airbnb would have broke the law they would have accused him in unfair business, but if its&#x27; their own investment then everything they do is kosher in the way to the final target which is making even more money. \nSo sad to see this culture and really happy that many people are finally seeing this investors and companies as true as they are.')
