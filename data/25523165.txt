His comments about Timnit were violently aggressive and disgusting. He doesn’t even know Timnit yet has so much hatred for her that he basically wants to kill her? She wrote a few tweets. She’s not Hitler. Again, someone _else_ flagged his comment as they rightfully should have. Yet I get downvoted for calling out bad behavior. I hate that I have to work with people like you everyday. HN is almost as bad as the Blind app.<p>BTW you still didn’t explain yourself.')
