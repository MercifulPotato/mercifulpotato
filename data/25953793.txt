Buying the stock is the <i>easy</i> part, but for a true short squeeze to work <i>every</i> current owner of the stock need to coordinate on HODLing the asset even as the price goes higher and higher, only ever converting a small fraction of their theoretical, paper gains. Even a tiny handful of defectors would crash the whole scheme. I&#x27;m very skeptical of this ever happening.')
