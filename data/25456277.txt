A microscope allows you to directly see a small object. A metaphor hints at an object for you to visualize yourself, and the reference is imprecise. That’s exactly Djikstra’s point.<p>And we can (and do) learn without metaphors. We need base knowledge for the metaphor to refer to. They are useful for learning, but not essential.')
