And error out immediately if the wrong type is passed in.<p>This allows you to operate on the data at a more logical level (what it implies), as opposed to just at the technical level (what data type it is).<p>For example, you can pass in a single string, or a list of strings. And your function can check the type and handle it appropriately.<p>In C++ and Java, because of the rigidity of the function declaration, in order to do something like this, then you would need to create multiple functions to handle each of the different types that you want to allow. Then you’d need to create a wrapper function to dispatch it to its appropriate sub function. That becomes a complete mess after a while.')
