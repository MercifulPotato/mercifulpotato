Details are in the wiki.<p>When a volume starts getting full (let&#x27;s say above 98% or something), performance suffers. This is also documented behaviour. Take monitoring seriously, even more than usual.<p>Pools and subvolumes can be a bit confusing at first, even if you&#x27;ve had experience with other volume managers. Read the documentation make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.')
