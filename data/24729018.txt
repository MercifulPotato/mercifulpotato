I was hoping somebody would steer me in the right direction if they had something. I wonder when AMD will focus on making things that are developer focused, I know for example that Intel has their own C++ compiler, not sure if AMD has one, though I heard it mentioned they&#x27;ve been contributing to LLVM.
