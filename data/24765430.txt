The people frustrated were the ones that did their jobs as good as they could and were frustrated by a lack of excellence in the face of large scale and complexity. I wouldn&#x27;t call this misery. And one of those companies was literally rated the most hated corporation in America. I&#x27;ve also worked for places were people were lazy, bureaucratic, and did the least work possible to collect their paycheck (heck I <i>was</i> that person). Ultimately corporations are made up of people, and there&#x27;s all different kinds of people out there, so there&#x27;s also all different kinds of corporations.<p>&gt; led by a class of people who are completely unaccountable to anyone but themselves, who therefore have no incentive to make things decent for the workers.<p>They&#x27;re accountable to shareholders and government regulatory bodies, and in very rare circumstances, to unions. Certainly there should be more accountability <i>within the organization</i> from the bottom-up, but it&#x27;s fallacious to think they don&#x27;t answer to anybody. The actual incentives vary, but usually stem from either competition, or seeking to drive quality and efficiency. Business management is more art than science.')
