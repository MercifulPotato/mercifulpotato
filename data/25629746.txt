Item(by='wruza', descendants=None, kids=[25629908, 25630713, 25632165, 25632043, 25630656], score=None, time=1609757745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629106, text='&gt;sign up&#x2F;sign in<p>Why were clear terms like login&#x2F;register&#x2F;logout replaced with a “sign ...”? I get confused twice a week by these, especially because the difference between “in” and “up” is so subtle (and overloaded, like “sign up for a meeting at friday”, unrelated to registration routine). Sorry for offtopic, but it is really annoying. Is it more linguistically correct or just a hipster thing?')
