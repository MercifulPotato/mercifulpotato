But shitty technology tends to have hard upper limits to scalability and shitty security tends to put hard upper limits on the company life span. It&#x27;s interesting how established companies can have one security issue after another but the customers are so locked in they can&#x27;t leave and so those companies are not nearly as affected as they should be (Equifax anybody?). But your run-of-the-mill start-up would be mortally wounded by such an affair because they still need to sign the bulk of their customers.<p>Of course it doesn&#x27;t always play out like that (to every rule there are plenty of exceptions), but investors don&#x27;t like to be associated with companies that fail or that blow up their reputations either because it makes their exit that much harder or even impossible.<p>I&#x27;ve seen investors that took the responsible route and made fixing major security issues or other undesirable elements of the target companies a condition to investment and typically these investments succeed in the longer term, not in the least because they cleaned up their act and could then turn that into a USP relative to the rest of the field.<p>Even so: better invest in a company with a mediocre product and a stellar sales team than to invest in a company with a fantastic product and a mediocre sales team. The first one will get you a better ROI, and tech can be fixed post deal.')
