Item(by='tasty_freeze', descendants=None, kids=[25610526, 25609245, 25610075], score=None, time=1609544306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607664, text='My estimated lifespan is probably close to 90 years, but very likely the last 15 to 20 will be marked by health issues of increasing difficulty. If the various modalities of life extension leave the shape of the healthy&#x2F;sick profile but simply stretch it out another 30 years, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be happy about that. If it could simply remove sickness and I died healthy at 90, say of a massive stroke, that would be a great improvement over my current expected trajectory.<p>That leads to this thought: if anti-aging can&#x27;t simply remove sickness but just stretches out the existing healthy&#x2F;sick profile to say 120 years, one way to achieve what I want would be to accept the anti-aging drugs and enjoy good health, then kill myself at 90.<p>Lots of people will be horrified by the thought, but it is still an absolutely better outcome than not taking drugs and following the usual course of events. Also, my approach circumvents many (but not all) of the negative consequences that would occur if the anti-aging technology works and everyone uses it.')
