I would advise designing with unique pointers first and minimize shared pointers where possible.  Shared pointers have a smell.  Smart pointers have reference counting overhead.  Unique pointers communicate ownership, while smart pointers communicate lack of ownership.<p>I would also recommend using an IDE with decent tooling.  C++ is insanely hard to parse.  If you go so template&#x2F;macro crazy that you confuse your IDE context parser, you will most certainly confuse other people reading your code.')
