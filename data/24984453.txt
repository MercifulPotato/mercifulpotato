I don&#x27;t think you can maintain something like that without some kind of religious &quot;glue&quot; to support it, i.e. to be the veneer of goodness over the racism that lurks underneath.<p>I&#x27;m sure this crosses over with a lot of that &quot;protestant work-ethic&quot; type stuff, especially as it allows some people who didn&#x27;t do a lot of work to make claims to have done so, e.g. &quot;Thomas Jefferson built Monticello.&quot;')
