Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607626244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376036, text='Debian comes in five suites actually: oldstable, stable, testing, unstable, experimental. There&#x27;s oldoldstable but it&#x27;s practically dead but, it&#x27;s there.<p>You can manage these suites in two different modes: rolling (suite based) or non-rolling (codename based)[1].<p>As you also noted, testing has a sinusoidal rolling speed. It starts rolling slowly when a stable is released. Then rolling gets faster. Then slows down (feature freeze) and stops (RC&#x2F;Full freeze). Then that version becomes stable. Testing separates and whole cycle starts again.<p>Testing never becomes unusable. Unstable has this risk. Instead testing is always tried to be kept in a semi-rc state. Any breaking bugs is a barrier for unstable to testing migration. As a result, testing can be used as a desktop system without any big drawbacks.<p>[1]: Since unstable is always codenamed sid and experimental has no codename, they always roll. Similarly since stable is rolled from release to release, it doesn&#x27;t quite roll but backports and volatile allows it to creep forward in a controlled manner.')
