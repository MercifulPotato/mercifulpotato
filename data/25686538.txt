The best signal for that is grid frequency, as it’s a very direct measure of grid health.<p>Many of those large consumers you speak off will be contracted to respond directly to grid frequency, either shedding load or adding supply, to make sure the grid doesn’t completely collapse if a shock event happens. That buys grid maintainers the time they need to recover the grid in a more controlled way.')
