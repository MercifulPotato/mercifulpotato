I was given the openAPI spec and instructed to find a mock server generator to get a boilerplate app up. I spent like two hours trying to find some sort of generator that provides value. All the generators I tried seemed half baked (I wanted to use rails for this project, because that’s what I am most familiar developing in. I understand rails is a sub optimal choice for this project.)<p>In the time I wasted trying to find a generator, I could’ve just wrote the code by hand. Once I just started manually writing code, everything started moving much quicker. Even if I had used a generator, I’d still need to manually update things every time the interface changes, yeah? Who is openAPI for?')
