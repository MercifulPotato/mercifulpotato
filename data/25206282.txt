Press outlets will certainly make bad faith arguments to get ratings. For example by twisting someone&#x27;s words into the most outrage-provoking interpretation possible. Even if they personally feel that the politician probably just misspoke or meant something benign or whatever.<p>As for private individuals, like posters arguing on the internet, yes they probably tend to believe what they say in the moment. A big problem there, perhaps ironically, is people assuming bad faith about each other.')
