Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25890110], score=None, time=1611428705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884075, text='&gt; I&#x27;d like to know what exactly is so &quot;insane&quot; about pointing this out.<p>Well, it’s both false on some points and misleading in much of the rest, in service of a false narrative, like much of Greenwald’s monomaniacal campaign to drive a wedge between the Left and the Democratic establishment [0]; the Espionage Act was not passed primarily to criminalize dissent, and the aspects that were arguably intended for that purpose and definitely misused for it have been largely neutralized by subsequent court decisions narrowing their applicability on Constitutional grounds (as, also, have other aspects of the law that address what is more commonly understood as spying), and were not, in any case, the provisions of the law under which prosecutions were carried out under the Obama Administration.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not necessarily insane, if, for one example of a scenario in which it would be perfectly rational, Geenwald’s goal is to advance the interests of common opponents of both the Left and the Democratic Establishment<p>[0] I have no problem with driving a wedge between the Left and the Center-Right Democratic establishment based on <i>the truth</i>, as a Left-leaning pragmatist I recognize that&#x27;s the only way to get any drive for progress on Left issues. Doing it based on lies and distortion doesn&#x27;t create pressure for progress, just division and distraction.')
