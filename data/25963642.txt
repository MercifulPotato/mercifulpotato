Then I switched to ThinkPad because I had sold my MacBook pro 2015 and needed a new laptop. And the new MacBooks were not to my taste. The Thinkpad was fantastic. T470s, took care of all my needs, lots of ports, upgradeable RAM und SSD.<p>Recently I upgraded to a Ryzen-based Dell but it is hot and loud. I am considering going back to MacBook depending on what they release next.')
