Consider Static Analysis via typing to Obviate Bugs<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using typings (we&#x27;ve tried around 1 year ago for multiple greenfield services ~5k LOC each):<p>- you will be better off investing into proper testing (I mean here code coverage), refactoring and onboarding documentatio&#x2F;handholding sessions with devs who are on top of the codebase<p>- in practice annotations make code LESS readible, not more (unless variable names and general code structure and conventions are bad)<p>- remember most Python devs have little experience with staticly typed langauges, so in practice your team will be skipping annotations - e.g using Dict[str, Any], which defeats the whole purpose of annotations; actually seasoned C++ devs will be skipping it once they will see they can get away with it<p>Typings are still in 0.x version and are constantly changing - do it for fun or to put typings on your CV, but don&#x27;t expect it&#x27;s going to help with readibility, bug prevention, documentation. These are solved with proper structure, conventions, testing and developer prep (readme + pairing).<p>If you believe bigger projects need annotations tell me why Sentry didn&#x27;t go with them yet?')
