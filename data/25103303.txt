If you don&#x27;t succeed, you did something wrong. But define &quot;a lot of money&quot;<p>Is a &quot;lot of money&quot; a six figure personal income? A six figure income is easy to get. Just work hard and be good at your job for a few years, and don&#x27;t be afraid to negotiate. Set your terms, if you&#x27;re valuable they&#x27;ll pay for your time.<p>Or are we talking on the scale of companies? I helped build up a small garage operation into a multi-million dollar turnover enterprise - is that a lot of money? Probably to some people, but not compared to the multi-billion dollar companies.<p>Some random nobody made a website that lets people post 140 characters and we all lol&#x27;ed and now it&#x27;s worth more than twenty billion dollars. There were millions of web forums experimenting with different modes of communication. Did everyone who tried to start a social media website at the same time as twitter do &quot;something wrong&quot; because they didn&#x27;t understand the magic formula?<p>If you&#x27;re talking on a personal level, then yes, making money in &quot;tech&quot; is easy. I&#x27;ve made &quot;a lot&quot; of money in &quot;tech.&quot; I live more comfortably than my peers. But I would not say it&#x27;s been easy, or it&#x27;s just been some fluke.')
