Churches, charities and other non-profits are also exempt.<p>So it seems that the cost of money laundering has gone from a few thousands dollars for a Delaware C-Corp to running a fake business that employs 20 people and has an office. The minimum to launder under this scheme is $5m per year.<p>This seems like the government stumping on small money launderers while giving the big guys a tax: employ some people, and rent some real-estate.')
