Sure, Warren Buffet is rich, but would you like to swap with him and be 90 years old? Sure, that engineer is getting promoted faster than you, but do you also want their mental health issues?<p>It&#x27;s a pernicious fiction to only imagine swapping a single characteristic (their success) and forgetting or not knowing about all the ways in which you&#x27;re better off (fitness, friends, family, mental health, age).')
