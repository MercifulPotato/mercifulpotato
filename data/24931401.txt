It seems very clear to me that spindab0ter was arguing that this is not an example of weaponizing the CoC.<p>Your alternative interpretation doesn&#x27;t really resonate for me, because it sounds like a &quot;no no, guys, there was nothing at fault in the CoC itself&quot; to a subthread where <i>nobody</i> claimed there was anything wrong with the contents of the CoC in the first place.')
