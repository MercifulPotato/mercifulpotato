So I talked to a lot of people, from politicians to policy makers, and from educators to entrepreneurs, even before writing a single line of code. Guess what? Everyone said that the idea is really very good, but not doable in its current form. Unless, it solves an immediate problem that is tractable. If you have a big vision, try to break it down to very small pieces such that not only does those small pieces are understandable by people who will be affected by that project, but also it is easy and quicker to implement.<p>So if you have a big problem that seems difficult to implement, then try to break down that problem and attack each piece from different angle. And once you have enough leverage within the community&#x2F;user-groups then go after the grand vision.')
