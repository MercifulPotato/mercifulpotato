Everytime someone has a brand new concept, they get some promising results and then reach the same problem: we need to build a vacuum chamber 10 meters in diameter to see if it&#x27;ll produce power. And then you&#x27;re back to ITER - which is what its exactly trying to do (the internal diameter of ITER is...about that scale).<p>We know rockets work inside an envelope we can see, it&#x27;s a matter of how to do it cheaply. What we know, today, is that fusion <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work in envelopes much smaller then ITER.')
