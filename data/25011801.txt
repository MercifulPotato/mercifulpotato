But (as with any other positive intervention), if <i>lots and lots</i> of people (say 50 percent of website owners, by traffic volume) reduce their footprint by 40 percent of so -- then that&#x27;s a different story now, isn&#x27;t it?<p><i>According to the Carbon Fund you can offset your CO2 emissions for $10 per metric ton.</i><p>Red herring, different topic.  It&#x27;s agreed by now that, whatever benefits offsets may bring (and this is hotly debated) -- we absolutely <i>have to</i> reduce emissions at the source as well.<p>If that point isn&#x27;t 100 percent clear by now - then there&#x27;s not much left to talk about, now is there.')
