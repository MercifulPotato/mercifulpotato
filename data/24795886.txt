Nobody has fought for a right not to sell cupcakes to gay people.<p>In Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the owner declined to <i>perform a creative service</i>, that being decorating a cake for a gay wedding.<p>You might think that is <i>also</i> wrong, and that’s fine, but it’s a very important distinction. Legally compelling someone to perform a service that violates their religious beliefs is tricky to balance against non-discrimination. You have to consider the precedent that doing so would set. The supreme court recognized this in a 7-2 decision, so it’s clearly not a trivial or ridiculous objection. It only is to <i>you</i> because you don’t share the religious belief. But we must balance everyone’s rights, and that isn’t always easy.')
