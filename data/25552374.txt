Kind of interesting Recently Verizon cut me off (despite their promise not to) and their agents don’t seem to understand the concept of my not having enough power to call them and wait on hold for a possible resolution. So I’m stuck living off grid with a carrier who I can’t explain the situation to, actually I got a temporary SIM but I still can’t access my phone number. I know it sounds like a sob story. The point of sharing is to emphasize that nobody really understands the ramifications of not having unlimited power available on tap.')
