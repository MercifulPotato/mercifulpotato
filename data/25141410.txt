Being able to write just a function and have it consume just that tiny amount of resources rather than a whole VM is huge. Being able to spin instances up and down as you need them is huge.<p>I think that&#x27;s been obvious for a long time, but what I&#x27;ve seen less obvious to the business analysts is the impact of more advanced cloud services. The direction of cloud computing is managed services where they run your databases, container platforms, etc for you. Trying to run a huge Cassandra cluster or Kubernetes cluster takes up a ton of expensive labor&#x27;s time and there&#x27;s a good chance the cloud providers are a lot better at it than you.<p>Sure, cloud services tend to be really expensive, and besides cost, there&#x27;s also concern about things like vendor lock-in, IP protection&#x2F;data privacy, and ability to tweak the small details of your platform. But cloud platforms in 2020 have a lot more features than in 2010 and in 2030 will have even more. The direction is pretty obvious. Running your own datacenters will be about as common as running your own power plant.')
