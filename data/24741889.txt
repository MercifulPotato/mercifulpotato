But looking for one specific item in a whole life change is looking at the wrong problem.<p>We are looking in the wrong place here - we live in an &quot;obesogenic&quot; world - rather than looking for a fix that helps us live with aisles in super markets stuffed with sugar and crisps, shouldn&#x27;t we take those aisles away? A coffee shop does not need cakes, just good company.  A fast food takeaway does not have to be fried.<p>It&#x27;s not the fault of each of us as individuals that (so many) of us cannot resist what we are programmed to eat.<p>It&#x27;s the fault of &quot;us&quot; as society - we talk about designing better cities, more walkable, more community -  it one of those designs we also need is access to healthy food.<p>Nobel laureate Richard Thaler talks about a Libertarian Paternalism - i think we need to consider something like it.')
