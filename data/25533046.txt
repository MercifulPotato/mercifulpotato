I wonder if a lot of this comes from classical piano players (which there seem to be a lot of, proportionally?) assuming that everyone who learns piano is necessarily aspiring to play those super difficult classical pieces one day. I&#x27;ve started picking up the piano with jazz in mind and it&#x27;s hard to tell if a lot of the advice out there is spot on and I&#x27;m worse off for ignoring it, or if it&#x27;s really just not relevant to me because I don&#x27;t intend to play Bach or Mozart. A lot of it _feels_ irrelevant, but I hesitate to dismiss it when it&#x27;s coming from people who are clearly a lot more experienced than I am.')
