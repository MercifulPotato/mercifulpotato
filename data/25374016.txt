We don&#x27;t have to guess and say &quot;them&quot; and &quot;their&quot; work.<p>Assumptions are presumptuous and harmful. Everyone is a they&#x2F;them until otherwise stated. These are extremely useful pronouns.<p>You&#x27;re a they&#x2F;them.<p>Calm down. You seem to be overly attached to regressive labels. I don&#x27;t know what drives this in you, but the universe is burning and people just want to be happy. Your life is short; you&#x27;re going to die and rot away. Is this really something to get worked up over?<p>In the future, when our descendants are all uploaded to computers or replaced by an AI overlord, people will be all sorts of genders. They won&#x27;t be bound by yesterday&#x27;s norms. Would you be a stuffy gender policeperson, or will you just let people be who they are?')
