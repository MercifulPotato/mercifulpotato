And as any data scientist will tell you, charts without labels are bad charts.<p>A progress bar should measure exactly one dimension, where a total is known, and a label should show what the dimension is. Usually progress bars implicitly measure &quot;time left&quot;, but the total isn&#x27;t known in that case, so progress bars are inapproprate.<p>For most &quot;loading&quot; scenarios, a spinner is a more appropriate element.')
