The rates are set by the business and you use the network&#x27;s charge card or App to activate the charger.  I&#x27;ve seen a couple, and used one charger that accepted credit cards but those are definitely the minority.<p>I only ever used one network, ChargePoint, and they sent you 2 RFID cards in the mail you could put in the car or on your keychain.  You could swipe them on the charger or use your NFC equiped phone with their App.  I accidentally swiped my phone once without opening the App and it opened up Google Pay and let me pay that way as well.  There are a lot of free ChargePoint chargers, I encountered those mostly on government property.<p>Allegedly the larger networks are interoperable now to some extent but I&#x27;ve yet to use that.  Since I moved to California I&#x27;ve only charged away from home once.')
