The dirty secret of politics? This is battle on the Serengeti. There are no sides, no code of conduct.<p>A tweet can start a riot. What a joke. 0.25% interest rate increase, these hypocritical petty rich fools go on a bread line. Probably lead to 5 week social security checks, hurting the most vulnerable the most, but America is not going to be old forever. Perhaps they can cut back on the heroin.<p>Normal Americans held back from fighting thieves and arsonists unleashed on them by their leadership.

Americans just have to stay out of it. Take the free money, save it while everyone chases the spotlight maiming each other in the process.
