That&#x27;s an enormous crowd of people all deciding, tacitly or not, consciously or not, that democracy isn&#x27;t for them anymore. And phrases like &quot;take our country back&quot; aren&#x27;t even subtle; anyone who&#x27;s been paying attention recognizes them as dog whistles. The obvious indication is that this crowd believes the votes of the democratic majority are not legitimate because they came from people who aren&#x27;t entitled to run the country. And, while we can certainly spend an entertaining afternoon sealioning about particular examples, it would be easier to just take a look at some of the wide angle shots of the crowd. The crowd is clearly communicating exactly <i>who</i> they think isn&#x27;t entitled to have a voice in how the country is run, either explicitly by holding flags and banners, or implicitly by consenting to be represented by the people holding the flags and banners.')
