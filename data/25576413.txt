In most cases research leads to unexpected results in grand scale. F.e. Research in string theory field led to developing new mathematics which eventually helped to calculate particle paths in LHS, which helped to make gathering data manageable and which lead to discovering Higgs boson.<p>&gt;most socially unaware people (often science)<p>99% successful scientists are very socially aware. Usually socially unaware people do not become successful even in science.<p>&gt;social artifacts can dominate their sphere<p>Because thats how world works. F.e. phd student does his own research, then he consults with his professor, who suggests how to add marketable layer to his research and with that layer his research becomes one for string theorists, though it was not his initial goal. This marketable layer helps him get the grant.<p>&gt;Now, the existential issue of the fact that their &#x27;entire worldview&#x27; and &#x27;life-long work&#x27; is tied up in something, delusions can become very strongly internalized.<p>This is made by popular media, movies. Most scientists live normal life, create families, try separate work from life, therefore research does not come from worldview.')
