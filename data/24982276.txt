If you change the amount of gasoline, without changing the amount of oxygen, you&#x27;ll end up running too lean or too rich, and both conditions have negative consequences.<p>To boost economic growth it would be great to have both an increase in final consumption by the government, combined with moderation of interest rates. A combination of financial policy with monetary policy. But in the USA the Republicans have been sabotaging this simple process for decades. Final consumption by the government has stagnated, which has put the USA into a situation where it has had to lean much too much on monetary policy (low interest rates) to try pump the economy. This inevitably leads to distortions. The obvious way to fix the problem is to have the government increase the amount of final consumption that it is engaged in. Tax cuts do not help, what would help is an increase in final consumption, to directly drive economic growth and directly create jobs.')
