Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610646528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778827, text='&gt; How about people who actually commit bad acts are the ones responsible for it?<p>&quot;Strangely&quot; enough this does not apply when corporations&#x27; money is at stake, hence sites like The Pirate Bay are held responsible. Taking 2 opposite approaches for the same issue in order for the lobbying corporations to profit is a sign of acting in bad faith.<p>Facebook built this 2 billion people village, exploited them and collected taxes, then said &quot;You know what? Policing it is hard so let the governments do it&quot;. And the governments should do it. EaaS - Enforcement as a service. And as any service it should cost. No personal liability needed, once money starts pouring out of the companies&#x27; coffers you&#x27;ll see how quickly they find a solution.')
