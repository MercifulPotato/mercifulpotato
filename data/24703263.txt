Ultimately I am not sure if it was worth the effort, but I can tell you that I type at least 40% faster (tested), and typing &lt; 100wpm is a &#x27;bad day&#x27;.<p>Ultimately does it matter? Maybe on slack, but not while I&#x27;m coding. To me, learning my editor well (Vim) is where I got my 40% from while coding.')
