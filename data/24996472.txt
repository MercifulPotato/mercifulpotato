You have a single return value, it&#x27;s type is either a valid result (i.e. a string) or an error. The compiler expects you to do runtime type checks (basically) to assert whether your return value is actually a value or not.<p>Not quite.  I am suggesting a tagged union.  Not a runtime type check.<p>You&#x27;d check the tag.<p>Some language only support the runtime type-checked version of union types.  That&#x27;s a bit silly.  For example, it makes it much harder to write a function that may either error out itself, or produce an error message as its bona fide value.')
