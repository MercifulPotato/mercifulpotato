It causes some confusion, and I often need to remind others that if they are using Chrome, to please clear their cache.<p>The other thing that I should have mentioned is with non-dev staff. When new builds and updates get pushed out, they often have problems because of Chrome&#x27;s aggressive caching. This group isn&#x27;t as privy to knowing about developer tools and chaching, and it is highly frustrating and annoying for them. It seems like they will still use Chrome for casual browsing, but then start to use Firefox or Safari for testing builds.<p>I use Firefox 100% of the time and very very rarely have these kinds of issues.<p>All I can say is that something is seriously wrong with Chrome&#x27;s caching policy, from a UX perspective. People do get frustrated in ways that they don&#x27;t when using Safari or Firefox.')
