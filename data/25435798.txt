You don&#x27;t run sed, awk, and jq directly, you run them via Bash, <i>your</i> preferred scripting language that can execute arbitrary, sophisticated code.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t use Python much for these use cases. For anything beyond trivial scripts I write Go programs, compiled into statically-linked executables that I can scp onto a host and run, the only dependency required at that point being libc. Or ideally the remote host is running inside a container, which would allow me to reproduce the dependencies locally (but also has a bunch of other complexity).<p>But saying &quot;just use Bash&quot; and then patting ourselves on the back is not really solving the problem, it&#x27;s just kicking the can down the road, possibly not even very far.')
