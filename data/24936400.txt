And it is meant to be automatically pre-downloaded for you.<p>Meanwhile, almost every single e-mail message I get just includes the whole thread quoted under its actual body (duplication level = insane). And it looks and works very weird when people actually need to respond to particular parts of my message paragraph-by-paragraph.')
