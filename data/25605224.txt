Basically, lucid dreaming on hard mode. Like going through sleep paralysis on purpose.<p>Dreams are so close to waking state, I’m always in awe when I successfully transition. Touch, taste, smell, every sense. It’s like waking reality, but with god mode.<p>That said, vision is really really weird. If you pull your sight into your dream body (hard to explain), then it’s just like you’d expect. It’s like it’s possible to see multiple perspectives at once, and it’s visual, but it’s all like one continuous field of view. Sometimes I don’t even really notice that I’m looking forward, backward, and from above all at once.<p>When I’m just playing around, I like to smash things and jump so high that I fly above the clouds, feeling the cold air above and the weightlessness at the apex. It’s no more visual primary than waking, IMHO.')
