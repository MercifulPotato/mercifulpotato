Item(by='pjc50', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604506376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24989865, text='The two-pin version certainly exists and is sold as &quot;zero ohm resistors&quot; in surface mount packages. The multi-pin version probably exists but I can&#x27;t find it with 30 seconds of searching.<p>But then there are two problems: controlled impedance and buried layers. Both the signals in question, HDMI and USB, are high-speed, and design recommendation will be that they cross as few vias as possible. They will be on &quot;microstrip&quot; paired line arrangements carried <i>inside</i> the board on one of the inner layers, while the top and bottom layers are ground planes. This won&#x27;t be visible from a simple photograph of the board, you need an xray or the original Gerber files.<p>So while it&#x27;s possible if you have enough space to punch a signal up to the surface of the board, through a package, and back down again in a different place, that will usually have an effect on signal integrity.<p>The normal solution is more layers. I don&#x27;t know how many are there at the moment but I suspect it&#x27;s 4. Increasing that to 6 costs more - not quite 50% more, but heading that way.')
