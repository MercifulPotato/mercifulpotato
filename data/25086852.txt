The top U.S. general gave a speech to that effect earlier this week. You can draw your own conclusions as to the timing of his remarks:<p>&gt;” We are unique among militaries. We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a tyrant or a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. No, we do not take an oath to a country, a tribe or religion. We take an oath to the Constitution. And every soldier that is represented in this museum, every sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman, each of us will protect and defend that document, regardless of personal price,&quot; Milley said during remarks at the opening of the US Army&#x27;s museum.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;politics&#x2F;mark-milley-pentagon-turmoil&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;politics&#x2F;mark-milley-pentagon...</a>')
