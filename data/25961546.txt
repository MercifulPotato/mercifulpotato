(See it&#x27;s working!)<p>Fundamentally, whether this is going to favor the mega-corps or not, I don&#x27;t want people tracking me. I don&#x27;t want companies having the sort of information Facebook and Google have, they&#x27;ve demonstrated they are poor stewards of our data. At the same time, I don&#x27;t want <i>additional companies</i> to gain access to a stream of information about me, regardless of whether that helps FB and GOOG or not.<p>If helping FB and GOOG is the cost of keeping more information about myself (My family, etc) private, then I guess I&#x27;m Ok with that. It&#x27;s the lesser of 2 evils.')
