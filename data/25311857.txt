We couldn&#x27;t do it the first time around because we finished only 3 days before the external deadline and there wasn&#x27;t enough time to get it approved internally. This seemed to be very standard around me. People were actually submitting well ahead of time and to me it seems like that Gebru expected the rules to be bent for her if she realistically believed a single day would be enough. Let me just point out that this is a standard practice even in academic research at universities when larger teams are involved.')
