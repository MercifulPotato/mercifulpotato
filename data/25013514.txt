Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604730432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013242, text='&gt; &quot;come back to life&quot; are plainly uncharitable phraseology<p>There are many meanings to the phrase &quot;come back to life&quot;. For example, my car &quot;coughs into life&quot; when I start it, and &quot;comes alive&quot; when I floor it, though nobody would infer it is actually alive. If someone &quot;steps lively&quot; that doesn&#x27;t mean they are otherwise dead. A &quot;live wire&quot; isn&#x27;t expected to be living, and also a person can be called a &quot;live wire&quot; meaning they&#x27;re very engaging.<p>To &quot;come back to life&quot; in this context appears to mean simply that the person becomes animated and responsive to his surroundings. It&#x27;s a phrase that would never occur to me to be offended by.')
