I remember conversations with Nvidia driver peeps on the OpenGL boards 20+ years ago, and it was very very striking that they would always, <i>always</i>, flatly refuse to implement any kind of &quot;is it in hardware?&quot; query.

And maybe a bit of &quot;you don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s hardware, you care if it&#x27;s fast&quot;, which isn&#x27;t unreasonable.')
