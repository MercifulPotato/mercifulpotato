I have been reading about COVID every day for the last year and never saw anyone make that claim before, so this looks like motivated reasoning. Are you thinking of wet markets? The whole &quot;people eating bats&#x2F;civets&quot; theory fell out of favour ages ago, and of course none of those animals crossed borders anyway.<p>As for spread of people, truckers have been allowed to cross borders even when they&#x27;ve been closed the whole time, as otherwise supply chains would collapse. So it&#x27;s irrelevant to this case. The guy wasn&#x27;t doing a COVID check.<p><i>I also think you really don&#x27;t understand the job of a border controller.</i><p>I think I do! Political trolling and lunch confiscation are definitely not components of it.')
