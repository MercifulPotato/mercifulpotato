I originally bought a light switch and some of their pass through plugs, but recently I’ve been expanding with more light switches and a relay, mostly to control hard-to-reach-the-switch things like outside lights but now I’m thinking about replacing more indoor lights and sockets for a more complete solution<p>Lighting-wise their dimmers just replace your regular dimmers, though they are push buttons rather than switches and they have led indicators on them (that you can turn off). They work without the hub, not that the hub has ever failed for me<p>I’ve never had a problem with range like tfa suggests, even in places that struggle to get a wifi signal and out in the garden (125 year old Victorian terrace over 3 floors)<p>Their stuff is fairly expensive but my oldest equipment is maybe 10 years old now, still works well and is compatible with the newer generation. My wife is even coming around to it - being able to say “Alexa turn on garden lights” instead of trudging outside in the rain to turn them on has convinced her I think!<p>If&#x2F;when we move I can mostly just put the old light switches back in and a) keep my kit for the next house and b) not have to subject the new owners to my home automation addiction')
