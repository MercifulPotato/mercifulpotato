It makes some things easy and some things hard, so it nudges you do to things that fit their intended work flow. Learning a language is like getting inside the mind of the designer.<p>I&#x27;ve been completely unable to do that for CSS. Whoever designed CSS layout, they don&#x27;t think like somebody who designs print pages (or we&#x27;d have had &quot;grid&quot; decades ago). They don&#x27;t think like a programmer, or we&#x27;d have a rigorous algorithm we could study (and that browsers could implement consistently).<p>Of course it&#x27;s designed by committee and evolved over time, so there&#x27;s really multiple different paradigms within it. That just makes it harder, but even if I focus on one, I can&#x27;t suss out what it was they were thinking. I&#x27;m guessing that each one was designed to be easy to implement on some extinct browser engine.<p>So my way of learning CSS is to take a first pass, and then stab manually at settings on the browser&#x27;s inspector until it&#x27;s close enough. Then I try to remember what worked until I can copy it into my CSS sheet, then re-render and repeat the process.')
