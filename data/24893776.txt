I have four monitors - 4th above the middle one on my custom aluminum profile. MKB &amp; mouse, studio lighting.<p>I run Win10, but all my work is through WSL2&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x2F;MS Terminal. I happen to really like this combo - and it&#x27;s my computer, so my choice.<p>#) Everything&#x27;s new this year - I renew every 5 years or so, and son gets my old. Am however using an old 1080TI and holding off on the GPU until well into 2021, due to current market craziness and to be able to see the size of AMD&#x27;s rabbit. Oh and my Soundblaster ZXR stayed too; love the wired audio I&#x27;m getting from this!')
