But I&#x27;m still leaning towards case sensitivity, because passwords are case sensitive, so it&#x27;s easier to train users to consider both of login and password as case-sensitive. And it&#x27;s a shame that some e-mail providers caved in and started making e-mail case insensitive…<p>P.S.: Should we also forbid the O&#x2F;0, l&#x2F;I characters in logins, like base58 does, because they can be ambiguous ?<p>P.P.S: And Unicode has added a whole new level of issues to this. Of course ASCII-only logins are completely unacceptable these days –<p>(think of users that don&#x27;t have a latin-like alphabet as their native one)<p>– but I&#x27;ve recently ran into the issue where a service didn&#x27;t properly normalize my password, so the µ from my previous keyboard layout ended up being considered as different from the μ from my new keyboard layout !')
