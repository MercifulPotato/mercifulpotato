Performance is important, and you have a chance to utilize multi-threading for positive effect. There&#x27;s no complicated external dependencies like drivers, etc; it&#x27;s just basic input and output streams and some math in between. It&#x27;s not too big and not too small, a few hundred lines is just right for creativity and experimenting without taking months.')
