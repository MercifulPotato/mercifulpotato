Item(by='jackson1442', descendants=None, kids=[25652196, 25651963], score=None, time=1609881090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650660, text='&gt; I have no idea to this day how macs became the premier development environment.<p>I&#x27;ve been editing a tutorial one of my coworkers wrote that targets new Python users on Windows. From my findings, the grass is not greener.<p>Granted, geospatial Python is somewhat of a mess, but a lot of tools I have to use are somewhat messy forks of Unix tools (looking at you, pyenv-win) with tons of incompatible extensions. For development, Windows is the exception because you can transfer just about anything from Linux to macOS.<p>On my Mac, I can easily install all of the Python packages I need without needing to install Visual Studio, pipwin, anaconda, etc. I have bash&#x2F;zsh as my default system shell. Maybe it&#x27;s easier to native Windows users, but bash&#x2F;brew is a much better combination than anything I&#x27;ve found in Windows.<p>WSL is a step in the right direction, but it still feels secondary. If a first-class terminal experience existed on Windows, I have a strong feeling that it could be the premier development environment, or at least closer to Mac.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t been made clear on how to use it right.')
