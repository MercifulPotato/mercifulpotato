It&#x27;s simple as that. Look at the relentless pro-censorship brigading on most social media. Lots of money, power and influence is being applied here. If this was china or russia, we&#x27;d call it a soft &quot;purge&quot;. They&#x27;d call it promoting &quot;harmony&quot; or &quot;protecting the people&quot;. Not sure what we are going to call it.<p>Seems like whatever battle Trump and his faction was waging behind the scenes the last 4 years failed and he simply failed to win over enough power&#x2F;influence to his side. We&#x27;ll never know what really happened, we can just guess.<p>But feels like history is happening. I don&#x27;t think any of us have lived to through anything like this. I know I certainly haven&#x27;t.')
