Let those nationalist parties have their nationalism, or stop violating human rights. The EU could argue open and strong: Have it your way, or play for the collective. Don&#x27;t let them use populist interpretations, confront them transparently.<p>What&#x27;s Poland without the EU? They don&#x27;t have the economy to  even fade like the UK. They would lose everything.<p>We don&#x27;t have to endure their shit, their nationalistic, misogynist and homophobic populism in the EU politics.<p>Sure we depend on them geopolitically, but so do they. They are afraid of Russia much more than the rest of the EU. And they are nothing without the EU economy.<p>Mind you, I am advocating for the enforcement of human rights and social progression, nothing more.')
