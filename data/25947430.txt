Though, there&#x27;s a difference between &#x27;currently loaded&#x27; and just the address, and for less-than-high-end computers, that difference can mean a lot.<p>That graph also contains a lot of noise - e.g. documents that aren&#x27;t needed.  I wonder if VR would help, by letting us see more, or if that better paradigm could also be implemented on 2D screens.<p>There&#x27;s already various graph visualization tools. But the tricky part would be wrapping that up into something useful - like a tree graph vs. tree style tabs. And if this would be more than 1-dimensional, like TST, then it would likely have to be a full page.')
