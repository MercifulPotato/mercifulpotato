I’m not 100% sure if it has USB because it hangs off my network (which then Ubiquiti devices provide WiFi). It’s worked reliably and 3rd party toner is readily available and works well. If a major component wore out or failed, it would probably be cheaper to replace the unit than the part, but parts are technically available. I’ve had an excellent networked color laser at home for around $75&#x2F;yr including toner.')
