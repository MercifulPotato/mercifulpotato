The 3D-print&#x2F;wood is only used for its compressive strength across the ~1 cm hull thickness, which is really high, and the glass (or carbon) fibre translates bending of the hull into tension of the fibres plus compression of the separating material - loading each material in the way where it&#x27;s strongest.<p>The technical word for this is a torsion box, and you find it everywhere, from doors in your house to aircraft wings.')
