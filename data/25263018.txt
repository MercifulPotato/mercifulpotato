They can bring more functionality into the package that they sell to Dell, etc. <i>like they have already done.</i><p>&gt; but I think the point they&#x27;re making is that Moore&#x27;s law created a situation where you couldn&#x27;t ramp up frequency anymore because the transistors are so small.<p>That is not the point they are making. Clock frequencies have not changed since the deep-pipelined P4, but transistor count has continued to climb. Here is what the author, who clearly does not know what he is talking about, said about that:<p>&quot;increasing the clock frequency is next to impossible. That is the whole &#x27;End of Mooreâ€™s Law&#x27; that people have been harping on for over a decade now.&quot;')
