Tesla Motors makes money on regulatory credits that conventional automakers must purchase in order to offset their ICE vehicle production. That&#x27;s actually Tesla&#x27;s only source of profit. Unfortunately for Tesla Motors, those regulatory credits aren&#x27;t going to be in such high demand in a world where major automakers each produce hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles.<p>Tesla has a 20% gross margin, which is significantly better than most competitors.   So they make lots of profit per car, lots more than they make from regulatory credits.<p>On a free cash flow basis, Tesla is profitable.<p>On a GAAP basis, Tesla is profitable.<p>If you remove all non-recurring revenue &amp; expenses, Tesla is profitable.<p>Removing non-recurring revenue (aka regulatory credits) from their income statement is a useful exercise when trying to predict their future revenue.   But if you do, you also should be removing non-recurring expenses too (mostly Musk&#x27;s stock grant).')
