TCP typically uses an exponential backoff in re-transmission times to avoid exacerbating congestion.<p>When dealing directly with UDP, one can implement different application-level logic for dealing with packet loss: &quot;NAK&quot; packets, different backoff strategies, and even forward error correction.')
