The codec isn&#x27;t much use to me, but the camera is 720p with pan&#x2F;tilt&#x2F;zoom&#x2F;exposure controlled over serial. It looks outstanding and I can re-aim it easily in my office where I sometimes sit different places.<p>I use a cheap HDMI capture device to get the video off of it, and due to Cisco&#x2F;Tandberg being a bit evasive about the control protocol I&#x27;m working on my own software to control it this evening... that and notes about getting it up and running here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcrawfordor&#x2F;tandyberg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcrawfordor&#x2F;tandyberg</a><p>These Tandberg systems were expensive ($1500 and up) when new but the outdated ones turn up at auction somewhat regularly and the cameras, having been top of the line at the time, are still pretty good by modern standards. I&#x27;m quite happy with it for $35. Later versions were 1080p as well.')
