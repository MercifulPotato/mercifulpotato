Your own example suggests &quot;yes it should&quot;.</i><p>Not at all. If you give governments powers to censor people, sooner or later you will have someone in power that will use those tools maliciously against their own populace.<p>Therfore you don&#x27;t allow a government (or anyone else for that matter) to censor except in very specific circumstances e.g. when the content is considered obscene (child pornography being an example).<p>That why it is important that everyone has a right to speak their mind, even if it highly objectionable.')
