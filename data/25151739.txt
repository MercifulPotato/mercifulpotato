During a shot of a huge expanse of the telescope&#x27;s metal, the narrator said something to the effect of &quot;as one gets closer to the equator the sun&#x27;s rays are stronger and the metal becomes too hot to touch&quot;. This, combined with the fact that I had a globe with a raised ridge around the equator, caused me to assume (for many years) that the equator was literally a metal ring that encircled the entire earth.')
