It is pretty easy. To be fair it is harder in the Bay Area than let&#x27;s say Europe, but it is still a non-issue. Also, the language is extremely easy to pick up, everyone is able to understand the code. This week for example I &#x27;ve had an ios dev that is using Obj-C&#x2F;Swift just dig into the code themselves to get clarity on an endpoint&#x27;s execution.<p>&gt; dev retention is hard.<p>Never really had an issue there.<p>&gt; hard to find people that write clean, modern, performant PHP<p>This also has not been a problem in the past few years. For context, I &#x27;ve had multiple devs excited and pushing to start using new PHP8 features, already (and I had to be the boring one and ask to wait for hotfixes, a version .1 or .2 and see \n how stable and secure 8.x is first).<p>&gt; It does not enjoy the best reputation as a language.<p>This is true. I &#x27;ve met people who refuse to even look at PHP code, even though they are paid to do so (they might even refuse at the detriment of their peers). I &#x27;ve never seen a &quot;this is beneath me&quot; attitude with any other tool or language before. (except perhaps the hate SQL databases got in 2015-2016)\nSo yeah, the hate runs deep.')
