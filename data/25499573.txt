Apple Card was perhaps a dipping of the toes moment.<p>In theory, Tesla shouldn&#x27;t be worth what it is because the tech behind it is increasingly getting commoditized (though they work hard to stay slightly ahead). But people love Tesla and it&#x27;s the first choice EV because they&#x27;ve really thought through the UX of a semi-self driving car EV thoroughly.<p>Apple is just about the only company with a similar ethos and enough money and patience to be a viable competitor and have a competitive brand known for quality.')
