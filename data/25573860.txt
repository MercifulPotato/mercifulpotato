You should feel ashamed of yourself for writing that, and, I question what your real intent is in posting such an unpleasant comment - that the woman’s boyfriend, who tried to defend her and was shot in the process of doing so, is somehow ‘responsible’ for her death.<p>Even if he made a mistake in good faith - which is unclear - that’s a far cry from ‘responsibility’ in any legal or moral sense.<p>Again, shame. Shame on you.')
