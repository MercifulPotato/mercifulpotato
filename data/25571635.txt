AFAIK, Google is getting things like store hours when it crawls websites.  Which, of course, it&#x27;s doing anyway for indexing.  As long as it can figure out the address and the store hours from the website, it can put them on the map.<p>In the meantime, OSM generally doesn&#x27;t even have place addresses in my experience.  If I could resolve addresses to places in OSM, then I could easily write some scrappers to help out with filling in other data.')
