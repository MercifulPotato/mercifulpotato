A man who has enough to live on, if he knew how to stay with pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea or to besiege a town. A commission in the army would not be bought so dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the town; and men only seek conversation and entering games, because they cannot remain with pleasure at home.[139][#201908302349]<p>This quote is often summarized roughly as: &quot;all of humanity&#x27;s problems stem from man&#x27;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.&quot; (i.e. the title of this post). Taken out of context, this would seem to suggest (to me) a belief that if we could simply meditate and avoid external distractions (a commission in the army, conversation, games, Pascal suggests), we might find happiness.<p>However, a reading of the full passage reveals that &quot;on further consideration&quot; he thinks the reason for this is that if we were to sit with our thoughts, the &quot;natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition&quot; would drive us to despair.<p>He thinks that someone who truly understands the human condition would do everything they could to avoid sitting alone with their thoughts (&quot;there is nothing they leave undone in seeking turmoil&quot;) . We seek diversion because if we didn&#x27;t have any distraction, we would end up dwelling on the miserable human condition (selfish, pre-occupied with self-gratification, sensitive to the opinion of others, judgmental, etc. - basically, &#x27;sinful&#x27;).<p>In the end, he suggests that we should look for happiness externally, in God, which he then talks about a lot.<p>[#201908302349]: Blaise Pascal (1958):  _Pascal&#x27;s PenseÃÅes_, New York: E.P.
