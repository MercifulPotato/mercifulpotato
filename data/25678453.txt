Optimize the nuclear battery size to minimize excess. If that battery gets full, release the excess as heat to the ground or sky, and also use some of it to maintain the lithium battery at optimal temperature. It will be only 1&#x2F;10 of the driving wattage, so it will be much easier to do something with it.<p>Or plug in the car when you get home and it can power a good fraction of your home.')
