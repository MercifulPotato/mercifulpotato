If the Play store went with Android to a new spinoff company that would certainly be a more financially viable company, but that’s a much, much more invasive dismantling of Google than separating out Android the OS and hardware platform. Once a proposed division gets deep enough to be partitioning datacenters it becomes less a discussion of spin-off companies and more a discussion of abolishing Google and seeing where the pieces fall.')
