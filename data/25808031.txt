While people do convert between religions, most will stay with what they grew up with and try to make things work within that framework. Sometimes that&#x27;s not possible so they pick one or the other of their religion or their political ideology. Religion doesn&#x27;t always lose out and my gut instinct is that it wins out more than politics does but that&#x27;s more difficult to see since membership and public interaction for religion works differently than it does for political parties.')
