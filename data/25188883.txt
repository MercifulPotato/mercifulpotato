Item(by='akiselev', descendants=None, kids=[25189077], score=None, time=1606151126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187806, text='There may be a rare exception here or there where network effects or some other unique market need require a startup to treat their infrastructure as cattle, but otherwise it&#x27;s absolutely true. Running `git init --bare` on a server, setting up some remote origins, slapping some bash scripts into the git hooks folder, some .service files for systemd, and then running `git push origin dbhost &amp;&amp; git push origin apihost &amp;&amp; git push origin ...` is a hell of a lot simpler than even getting a toy version of kubernetes up and running. For the developer with average linux skills, it&#x27;s probably even easier than figuring out which cloud orchestration monstrosity to choose. Throw in Github actions and baby, you&#x27;ve got a stew going!<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding the whole &quot;pets vs cattle&quot; thing but you don&#x27;t need to lose repeatability or give on process altogether; it&#x27;s a false dichotomy. Just don&#x27;t dive headfirst into the massive complexity that is &quot;scalable&quot; devops - you can still use terraform or docker compose or whatever to deploy your application and provide repeatable development&#x2F;staging&#x2F;test infrastructure.')
