When I mentioned the &quot;everything F[_]ed&quot; in my top post I thought I&#x27;d made it clear that I knew the commonalities.<p>And I have to admit that I find these commonalities very fascinating. I can still remember how I enjoyed applicatives and the like when I started with scalaz back then. Whether the model becomes simpler? I do not really know. I just found out for myself that I do not need this knowledge at work and that it didn&#x27;t really help me to solve my daily problems.
