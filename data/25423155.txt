It was a really fantastic way to discover the city for the first time. I don’t think flying in to an airport then taking a taxi would have been nearly as memorable.<p>The only problem IMO is that sleeping on a train is not comfortable unless you’re young. It’s basically a minor step up from staying in a hostel in terms of noise, other people, and general cleanliness. I think there would need to be a dramatic upgrade in the quality of sleeping cabins for trains to really replace flights.')
