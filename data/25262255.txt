That you were born into a class, and that was your role for the rest of your life. If that is your frame of mind, then the conclusion of the movie makes perfect sense. The most honourable thing the ruling class can do in such a world is to give their workers some free time.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t know what Lang&#x27;s political views were, and Serfdom has been abolished in Germany for about 100 years when the movie was made.<p>I actually like like the movie quite a bit, but I&#x27;ve always been disappointed with the ending.')
