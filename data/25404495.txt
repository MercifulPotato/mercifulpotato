For instance there is a possibility in some individuals that the mRNA itself (not just the spike protein) as well as the lipid encasing it to protect it and transport it into the cell can cause an immune response. It’s theoretically possible that in some individuals that could result in auto immune responses to other forms of messenger RNA in their cells.
