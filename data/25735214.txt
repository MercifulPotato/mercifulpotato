Militarily, economically, socially, culturally and spiritually they offer no better alternative to the American one. Similar to how &quot;China owns US treasuries and can crash the US dollar&quot; was the common trope until recently, the US called them out the trillion dollar loan to Qing dynasty which was transferred from KMT to CCP after Chiang Kai Shek&#x27;s defeat (and really a symbol of CCP&#x27;s legitimacy over Taipei), and China began buying more US treasuries to increase its US dollar dependence. <i>Without HK, the yuan-hkd-usd peg is collapsing and CCP is running low on US dollars</i>. Kyle Bass&#x27;s interview with Guo Wengui explains this in detail [1]<p>I even had Chinese students condescendingly tell me that China is taking over and everybody will be speaking Chinese by 2020 back in 2005.<p>If Winnie the Pooh, censoring wikipedia, university students protesting over Tibet, Tianmen Square massacre, organ harvesting of Falun Gong (they are &quot;scientology&quot; so its okay they said) causes the security apparatus kick into high gear then you really are the complete opposite of anti-fragility which is what the US is.<p>US is anti-fragile, authoritarians are not because they are susceptible to even the smallest shock in the economy or the mindset of its citizens, so they use excessive violence and fear to maintain its power. They don&#x27;t last at all.<p>It&#x27;s more likely that people who made a lot of money working with&#x2F;in China have an extremely skewed view of the world.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZBl05xNq_AU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZBl05xNq_AU</a>')
