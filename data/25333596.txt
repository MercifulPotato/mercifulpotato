It is also a reasonably good, but far from perfect indicator of how much work went on building it.<p>That measure is also one of the arguments for highly expressive languages, because developers seem to produce approximately the same length of code whatever language they use. And leads to some very good questions about why that length changes a lot from one place to another, but doesn&#x27;t change much when one changes the more development-centric options (like the language or editor&#x2F;IDE).<p>But, of course, if you start ranking people based on it, it will stop being a good predictor of anything.')
