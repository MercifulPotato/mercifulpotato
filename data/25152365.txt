So we quit our jobs as software developers to focus full-time on building an app that would help.<p>We recently launched what weâ€™ve been working towards, Charge Scheduling for Optiwatt, www.getoptiwatt.com, a 100% free app that automatically schedules your Tesla to charge during the cheapest electricity rates and tracks your exact spending.<p>We spent months organizing utility data so that users can automatically integrate their electricity rate schedules based on their zip code without having to dig through utility bills.<p>Our goal is to reduce our reliance on dirty coal plants that get fired up during high demand by helping users track their consumption and automatically charge during off-peak hours.<p>Please let us know what you think :)')
