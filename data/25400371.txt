He is a pediatric anesthesiologist who has done much work on development of entubation systems. I think he has at least six entubation patents, and was also the developer of the light tube entubation method.  Back in the early covid days we were discussing possible lung lavage tubing methods, but neither of us had time to work on that.  I can put you in touch with him if you are interested.')
