The word open is superfluous if that&#x27;s the case.  What&#x27;s the meaning of the word open if not unoccupied or available?<p>Of course that begs the question, why did they use open instead of unoccupied?<p>If open is meant to mean bed that can be utilized, then we don&#x27;t have a true number of beds or a reason why a bed would be closed.<p>Either way it&#x27;s confusing but generally the term open as the opposite of occupied for filled.
