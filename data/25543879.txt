I mean all you&#x27;re showing them is how fast the current implementations of the algorithms are, and obviously being too fast isn&#x27;t great for password hashing, but your benchmark doesn&#x27;t in itself actually prove the security of bcrypt as a hash algorithm so I don&#x27;t know why you would expect that to convince them.<p>Maybe the real problem is that the FIPS standards are too conservative?')
