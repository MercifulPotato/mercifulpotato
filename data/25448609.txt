The reception for the device has been very positive, citing the MeeGo v1.2 Harmattan UI, pseudo-buttonless design, polycarbonate unibody construction and its NFC capabilities. Still, many reviewers did not recommend to buy the N9 <i>only</i> because of Nokia&#x27;s earlier decision to drop MeeGo for Windows Phone for future smartphones – often questioning this decision at the same time. Engadget&#x27;s editor Vlad Savov said in June 2011 that &quot;it&#x27;s a terrific phone that&#x27;s got me legitimately excited to use it, but its future is clouded by a parent that&#x27;s investing its time and money into building up a whole other OS.&quot; In a later review, Engadget writes: &quot;Love at first sight — this is possibly the most beautiful phone ever made,&quot; and &quot;MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan is such a breath of fresh air it will leave you gasping — that is, until you remember that you&#x27;re dealing with a dead man walking.&quot;')
