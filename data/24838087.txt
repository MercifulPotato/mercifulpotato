Makeswift components are just React components and as only developers of those components at the moment we plan to follow accessibility best practices.<p>&gt;-Clean and efficient output html (every square space site I visit is slow as shit)<p>Again, because the components are just React components, it&#x27;s a matter of keeping markup clean in the components themselves. This is something that I think we could do a better job at right now. But we will definitely improve and there&#x27;s a clear path for it.<p>-No cdn resources. Allows you to pack your own fonts and assets.<p>We&#x27;re currently focused on delivering a great out-of-the-box experience so we take care of that for all of our customers. In the future we plan to open up an API that will allow developers so extend Makeswift however they see fit, including writing their own components, panels, and integration with assets, etc. This would allow you to pick your own custom fonts and assets.<p>That being said, today we do support custom snippets that you can add to your pages as well as an Embed component. With these you can bring your own &quot;anything&quot;.')
