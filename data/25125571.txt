It seems to solve a bunch of my pain points with bare Docker Compose, so I&#x27;m eager to try it out.<p>It does not address my biggest issue though - setting up a Docker development environment is a considerable upfront investment that slows me down. When I start a new project, I want to jump into writing code in a complete Docker environment right away, and not spend hours or days setting up Dockerfiles, docker-composes, remote image builds, etc. Recently I have been trying to solve that with hocus [0], which is a very early stage framework for creating and managing Docker development environments.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hocus.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hocus.dev&#x2F;</a>')
