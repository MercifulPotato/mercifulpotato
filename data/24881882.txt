The date went well, but I did not follow up.<p>So, I see truth in their assessment, but I strongly question their conclusion.<p>&gt; <i>if heterosexual men are looking to get a match, itâ€™s probably a good idea if they save showing off their photos with their favorite felines for the first or second date</i><p>Or you might not want to build a relationship with someone who thinks that owning a cat isn&#x27;t &quot;manly&quot;, and this becomes a good filter.')
