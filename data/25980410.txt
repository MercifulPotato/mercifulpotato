It uses the concept of a Purdah: A pseudo-anonymous online identity. It&#x27;s related to concepts of trust, fingerprinting, etc.<p>It inspired me to built a WIP website where you create an identity by linking accounts in various locations, that the site proves you own. The idea is, you build trust &#x2F; an identity through content you&#x27;ve written on a site - then someone who reads your post on another site knows something about your trustworthiness. I think an especially potent use is in reducing the change a given user (poster, reviewer) etc isn&#x27;t a bot or marketer.<p>We&#x27;ll need to think about this more in the near future as internet communities (and public opinions) are more heavily influenced by bots and other forms of manipulation.')
