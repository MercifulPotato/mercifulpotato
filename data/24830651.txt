The slippery slope going the other way (silencing platforms) is just as bad as the one we&#x27;re on. Throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>Problem is you run into a physical limit at that point, there&#x27;s only so many social media platforms we can be on, so creating such competition would be... hard... at this point.')
