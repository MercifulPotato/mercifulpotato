I have them all and they were all pretty fun, but only for a couple hours per quarter...<p>I guess the experience I&#x27;m trying to replicate is like a lot of gen-x computer people I once got a copy of SciAm magazine in the mail and two hours later I&#x27;m writing a very slow but working mandelbrot fractal program in interpreted basic on an 80s home computer, not because the execution speed was fast but because the development time was fast and it was a fun and exciting experiment.<p>There must be something like that today?')
