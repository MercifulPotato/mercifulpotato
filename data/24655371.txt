However, for pure data-transfer purposes, the cable would work fine, and be cheaper that fully-compliant cables.<p>[1] After all, a full-featured cable needs to fit 16 (!) conductors, and the shield, into one flexible cable.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USB-C#Cables_2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USB-C#Cables_2</a>')
