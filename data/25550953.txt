I don&#x27;t see why that would change. Switzerland as you point out has similarly high wages.<p>I can&#x27;t see innovation, talent or companies moving to the EU at any stage. It&#x27;s a regulatory horror show and has massive brain drain to places that actually pay developers reasonable wages.<p>Developers in Sweden are paid the equivalent of 51k USD. This means even including cost of living such as health insurance, you can make substantially more in the US, London or Switzerland.<p>Developers in the EU get shafted big time. Free health insurance is not worth half, or even one-third the salary.')
