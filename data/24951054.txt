It&#x27;s not &quot;wind and gas&quot; as a single entity, it&#x27;s &quot;wind farms supply power to the grid at £40&#x2F;MWh and gas plants <i>also</i> provide power to the grid at £40&#x2F;MWh&quot;. In other words, it just means they cost about the same which is half the cost of nuclear. There is no 30&#x2F;70 split as you imagined.<p>Which makes sense. Scotland gets around 90% of it&#x27;s electricity from renewables, of which around 70% is wind power. It couldn&#x27;t possibly do that if your figures were correct.')
