You should not need to go over the network because you need a process to run for more than 10 minutes.  You should be able to check the status of  resource creation via for loop.<p>An argument can be made for not needing a server, but I can easily fire off a container in fargate&#x2F;gks&#x2F;ecs and get similar benefit.')
