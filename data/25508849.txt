Item(by='VLM', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608658509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508355, text='&gt; This sort-of feels like cheating on the side of the professors.<p>There are some general issues with leadership training in the military.<p>You&#x27;re randomly and arbitrarily in charge until you&#x27;re not.  You&#x27;re randomly and arbitrarily practicing your group cooperation skills until you&#x27;re not.  In theory you&#x27;ll get a lesson about paying attention, hopefully not in a career ending manner.<p>There is a strong push to demonize the kids who do dumb things.  But its worth considering they&#x27;re not evil, just a bit slow on the uptake.<p>Surely if a kid at training methodically organized the process of unloading a truck that would be valid leadership training.  If the same kid organized the chemistry lab so operations run smoother, that&#x27;s good too.  If the same kid organizes group study sessions against an outline of the syllabus that is good leadership.  If the kid goes a bit far and study session photocopies change from similar questions to the test, to actual questions from the test...  The kid&#x27;s not necessarily evil incarnate but a bit slow on the uptake about the precise definitions of expectations and an attention getting reaction from the actual leaders is appropriate, whereas blaming the kid retroactively for Iraq not having WMD is just a bit overboard.')
