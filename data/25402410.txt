I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to spend significant time on it, though, as I have my hands pretty full. I am hoping to do more explaining and public communication as part of my piet-gpu work.<p>A good snapshot of GPU font rendering work from 3 years ago is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aras-p.info&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;Font-Rendering-is-Getting-Interesting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aras-p.info&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;Font-Rendering-is-Gettin...</a> . The linked papers are quite good and have informed my thinking, though of course I hope to advance the state of the art even further.')
