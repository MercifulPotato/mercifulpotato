A difference like night and day, or a significant percentage of academic literature studied versus an insignificant percentage resulting from the same intensity of lifetime study.<p>Well this is just academic knowledge.  Which is a tremendous advantage, but when you include everything else known about western civilization at the time, there&#x27;s a much lesser percentage difference.  And when you bring in the whole world, we&#x27;re in the same state of confusion as 300 years ago.<p>You have to go back a lot closer to the cave man for us to be much more fully baffled.<p>Even though there sure are a lot more people now spending lifetimes making things un-necessarily complex, it&#x27;s been pretty gonzo the whole time.<p>I would also say we may now just be more aware of our complete misunderstanding.<p>I think it applies to emerging complexity not much differently than it did in antiquity.<p>Regardless of what you are saturated with, anything more is an overload.<p>Note: it&#x27;s just the greatest recession this century.  So far.  Well, probably until now.  The century&#x27;s still young.  Plenty of people saw 2008 coming, even more knew it was inevitable, and way way more than that FELT a downturn like that was going to happen sooner rather than later.')
