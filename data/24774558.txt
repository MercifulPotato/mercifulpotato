I&#x27;m really trying to vote with my wallet here, so I&#x27;ll hope the cheap iPhones will keep the port and luckily in my city repair vouchers are out as part of the local corona relief program, so I&#x27;m giving my iPhone 7 another year or two. In fact USB-C would have been the primary reason to upgrade for me.<p>I would have moved to an Android device with a headphone jack and USB-C port, but I prefer to stay away from Google products as much as I can.<p>Going wireless with everything where it isn&#x27;t necessarily needed is just a bit overrated in my opinion: \n- The biggest driver in network speed to me was adding all devices I could to wired connections - there&#x27;s 20+ different networks in my area and some of the devices use old Wifi standards, so I avoid all of that for devices I don&#x27;t move around. Homeplug devices with higher speeds than my internet connection were necessary here to make the experience better than wireless (compared to laying new cables wireless is better to me, but I hope devices like TVs keep their LAN port) \n- In the car: it&#x27;s just a constant pain to switch the connected device (when more than one person is present), especially when a call comes in, simply using the headphone plug would be much quicker.\n- When working: switching the devices the headphone is connected to when a call comes in between phone and laptop is equally painful, again, switching plugs would be simpler (though here at least I can walk around with the headphones, so there is a bit of a benefit).')
