Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606837343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264946, text='The term “maintenance mode” specifically implies an <i>orderly</i> disablement. I expect anything it applies to to receive some sort of message as to what’s going on if you try to use it.<p>Unless otherwise specified, I assume that it will be applying to an <i>app</i>, but not to a marketing website—because these are almost always treated as separate things, and shifting the app into maintenance mode doesn’t take down the marketing site (even if it’s on the same infrastructure).<p>I expect URLs like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everch.at" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everch.at</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everch.at&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everch.at&#x2F;about</a> to be part of a marketing website, because that’s almost always what they are.<p>What I observe is that the marketing site part (presuming I’m right about it being marketing site—I still haven’t seen the page) seems to all be there and responding fine, loading its unreasonably large megabytes of JavaScript rather than just serving plain sensible HTML, but that it doesn’t actually render anything. There are no JavaScript errors in the console; the only potential hint is that it’s getting a 503 from wss:&#x2F;&#x2F;everchat-server.herokuapp.com. But is that the cause? It’s not at all normal for a marketing site to break if a WebSocket connection fails. What’s it trying to do? I have no idea. So I give up and ask. :-)<p>If trying to take down the entire thing, I’d hope for all requests to the website to yield a 503 response with some kind of “Everchat got overloaded, be back in a day or two” simple HTML response.')
