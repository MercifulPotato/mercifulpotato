Driving on a motorway one winter coming round a bend, I suddenly encountered a patch of snow that hadn&#x27;t been cleared. There was no time to slow down ahead of it, I was in the outside lane and with a vehicle in the lane next to me - I just gripped the wheel and responded with the reflexes I&#x27;d built up from the snow stages.<p>The car twitched and started snaking but I kept it under control in a way I know I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to without the hours of in-game training.')
