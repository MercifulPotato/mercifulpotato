It seems Facebook is making enemies of the people that think political censorship is a good thing, that do not value free speech as a principle, and that are appalled that people have different values and beliefs.<p>Now as is brought up every time there is a complaint that tech companies are violating the first amendment, these are private companies and can control what is posted and what it shows. So, if Facebook decides they want to allow these posts in the name of free speech, it is their right as a private company.<p>Frankly, I am glad that people who believe that we should have more censorship are leaving their positions of influence at Facebook.')
