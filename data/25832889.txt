But there&#x27;s also no precedent or prior ruling about this, thus not existing in common law.<p>I think you are right about the redistricting decision. I still think it&#x27;s wrong and lazy for the legislature to have the courts handle it. This sort of indifference is sloppy and leads to inefficiencies and injustices, such as appeals, retrials, or misinterpretation. The courts really shouldn&#x27;t be doing much interpreting. The system is supposed to use hundreds of representatives to be the voice of the people, not 1-9 judges.<p>I also see that you are saying that people should be guilty if they violated the spirit of the law. This doesn&#x27;t currently happen. Look at the tax loopholes in wide use. My opinion is that you can&#x27;t expect someone to know that something is wrong if the statute says something contrary.')
