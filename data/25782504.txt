It didn&#x27;t seem to be noticed, or in any way effective, less so over time. Then my (school aged) son and I got caught in the middle of a sudden kettling while waiting for the bus.<p>I determined authorities were only too happy to use violence. Per that John Lennon quote. And once there&#x27;s any violence, whatever message or intent is immediately lost.<p>So I turned to activism, lobbying instead. That seems more fruitful.<p>Independent of everything else, because I do have a lot of opinions, I am delighted by two developments since.<p>The peaceful women&#x27;s march was really remarkable. I wish I knew how they avoided or short circuited the backlash.<p>I&#x27;m so heartened that the BLM and adjacent issues went mainstream this time. (I&#x27;m less impressed by the bored frat boys LARPing as Antifa in places like Portland. After WTO, I personally intervened to stop such nonsense where I could. Like I said, I have opinions.)<p>I guess I have one more opinion. I wholeheartedly support people&#x27;s right to protest, march, speak, whatever. So I have zero problem with Trump supporters doing their thing and think it&#x27;s fantastic we live in a place that&#x27;s encouraged. Civil disobedience, rallies, occupy, whatever. I support it all.<p>But goddammit cut out the violence. Violence only begats more violence.')
