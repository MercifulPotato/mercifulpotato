In fact, MS-DOS 4 failure was an attempt to make it more UNIX like.<p>At the same time, maybe to reduce costs, the OS vendors started to reduce the amount of compilers they were selling it for their platforms, selling only the same ones as they were using themselves for the OS, which by then naturally meant C.<p>Any other language started to be available only from third parties, and most of the time without bindings to all OS APIs.<p>So given the choice of buying the language programming tools from the OS vendor, with everything ready to code, or paying even more (you would need the OS SDK anyway) and having to code bindings, the majority stayed with OS SDK only.<p>As C++ is a C sibling, coming from UNIX birthplace, it quickly found a place among C compiler vendors tooling.<p>Java, well it was pushing by Sun, quickly adopted by Microsoft, IBM and Oracle on their platforms.<p>So enjoyed a bit that extra love from platform owners.<p>Having lived through this evolution, I have learned only to bet on platform languages, or those that eventually get blessed by platform owners on their official SDKs.')
