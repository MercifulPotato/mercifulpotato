I read tons of books, did MOOCs, tutorials, learnt new tools and frameworks...<p>What I found with time is that I forgot most of those. Except for the very basic and foundational concepts, anything that I haven&#x27;t kept practicing is almost gone. I can&#x27;t even remember most of the courses or books I&#x27;ve read.<p>Even worse, in some cases I ended up actually using that cool tool that I learnt 3 years ago. Guess what, now it is 2 major versions ahead and most of what I knew is useless anyway.<p>I love the reference to JIT learning in the article. This has been my primary way of learning for the past few years: wait until I&#x27;m facing a problem, and then put the effort to learn enough to solve it.<p>I still do some background explorative learning, but JIT is much more efficient and effective.')
