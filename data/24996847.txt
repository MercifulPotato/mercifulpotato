Item(by='pwm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604569249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24994508, text='I haven&#x27;t yet looked much into effect systems so can&#x27;t really talk about them but I think even with something like MTL you can achieve a decent level composability&#x2F;modularity where you build up a library of capabilities that you can then use to pick and choose effects from, eg.:<p><pre><code>  type FooContext m = (GetTime m, GenUUID m, Log m, Auth m, ReadDB m, WriteS3 m, BarApi m, etc...)\n\n  foo :: (FooContext m) =&gt; UUID -&gt; m Foo\n</code></pre>\nThe main downside is ergonomics, ie. the amount of boilerplate needed, but personally I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a high price to pay.')
