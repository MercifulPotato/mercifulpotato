It is easy to find accounts that look like they could be bots, but I wonder what portions of those are just very dedicated individuals.<p>I don&#x27;t use social media a lot but I do regularly post on HN for instance. I don&#x27;t know what my average message rate is but it&#x27;s probably around 1 message&#x2F;day. Now if I just wanted to spam my political agenda on the site (and the site let me do it) I could very easily copy&#x2F;paste the same bullshit a hundred times a day on every story on the frontpage. If like 20 other people did the same thing the amount of noise we&#x27;d generate is pretty large<p>Look at random fan wikis to see the amount of free work some dedicated individuals can achieve. I&#x27;m certain that many of these super active troll accounts are just that, dedicated individuals who feel very strongly about something and just spend 10 hours every day spamming and harassing and copy-pasting. If your output is like 100x that of a normal user (and you know how to game the algorithms to amplify your message) you don&#x27;t need a huge number of accounts or automation to become a real nuisance.')
