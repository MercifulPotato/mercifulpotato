The requirement for the highest-skilled workers would rise to the 95th percentile, from the 67th percentile.<p>This is pretty abstract and probably the most important detail. How much would a software engineer have to make to qualify? I&#x27;d figure it&#x27;d have to be at ~200k if it&#x27;s 95th percentile. A number high enough and it truly would be for only highly skilled, hard to find software talent, rather than just labor cost cutting. Does anyone have concrete numbers?')
