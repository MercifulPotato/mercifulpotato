I&#x27;ve been 3d-printing devices that helps with DNA extraction in my lab.<p>I am interested in automating the lab I am running now. We have an opentrons that we bought couple years ago that I never got around to using. But now that we are regularly getting a decent amount of samples in a week, I really want to get it going. Are you starting a lab automation service?<p>I agree with your point about plate sealer&#x2F;unsealer. It is a huge pain point in automation. However, I am not sure if you can convince regulatory bodies to approve it. Are you doing some kind of mineral oil top layer to prevent evaporation? We&#x27;ve actually tried that before and it kinda worked, but the problem is that the mineral layer messes with the SPRI bead purification step. I am sure it can be solved with more testing, but it just wasn&#x27;t worth the inconsistency at the time.')
