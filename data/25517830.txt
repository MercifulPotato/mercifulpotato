It&#x27;s pretty nice that youtube let&#x27;s you edit that and doesn&#x27;t use a &quot;full history&quot; to train the recommendation algorithm.<p>I try to be careful and always use private browsing when opening &quot;suspicious&quot; videos, but every now and then, one slips and taints my recommendation.<p>OTOH, with a clean history, I barely subscribe to channels, since new videos usually end up in the recommendations, anyway.')
