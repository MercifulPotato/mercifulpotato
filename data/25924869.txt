I think it works because it makes discussion possible even for the most extreme ideas by reducing the emotional response.<p>People don’t become racists&#x2F;terrorists&#x2F;etc simply because someone told them so. Content removal of speech supporting these ideas doesn’t do any good.<p>However removing things that break the discussion works. Spamming, flooding, being very rude or provocative, all make the discussion impossible.')
