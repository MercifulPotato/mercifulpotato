Why are computers allowed to talk to strangers at all? They should just drop all data coming from unauthenticated connections. This would destroy the mass appeal of the modern internet but it makes a lot of sense for computers hosting personal services that are meant to be used by one or few users.<p>Technologies such as port knocking and single packet authorization make vulnerabilities irrelevant since there&#x27;s no way to exploit them before authenticating oneself.')
