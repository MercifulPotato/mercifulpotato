This.<p>I&#x27;ll throw in a few other ideas:<p>1. &#x27;Opinion&#x27; panels should come from both sides of the political isle. Thoughtful panelists should be able to get to the bottom of ideas (instead of getting caught up in partisan minutiae). If they can&#x27;t have a good discussion they shouldn&#x27;t be on the panel.<p>2. Recommendation algorithms _must_ attempt to diversify a user&#x27;s taste rather than silo them. This is an ethical issue and may hurt the bottom line.<p>3. Journalists should fundamentally believe bare facts speak for themselves and trust their readership to make the right conclusions. It is patronizing to have it any other way.<p>4. Context is key - sound bytes and cheap twitter drama are destroying journalistic integrity. Journalism is archaeology of the now. It should be treated with the rigor of a science. Have some respect for yourselves and we will do the same!')
