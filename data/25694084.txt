The latest year for which I can find easy data (2018)[0] shows that over 600,000 legal abortions took place. That is aided and abetted by messaging that the primary concern is an expectant mother&#x27;s choice to terminate or not, and the feticide is often deliberately obfuscated by concerns about general obstetric health, even though very few pregnancies pose a significant health risk that would require termination. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m pro-choice, but we should be honest about what&#x27;s going on here. Even pro-choice advocates always talk about it &quot;not being an easy decision&quot; for most women, so there is definitely a lot of persuasion at work, both in direct consultation and in broader messages spread by leaders, advocacy groups, and the like. It doesn&#x27;t change the reality of feticide, which depending on your ethics, can be considered a wicked act.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;ss&#x2F;ss6907a1.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;ss&#x2F;ss6907a1.htm</a>')
