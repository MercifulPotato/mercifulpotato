No one at this point - parents, players, fans - should have any illusions about the consequences of playing these games. These are blood sports with huge toll on the human body. Since ancient times humans have watched and cheered on brave people who enter the ring and battle. It speaks to our competitive spirit.<p>Many things in life can have severe, life-destroying consequences including smoking, drinking, and eating fast food, but none of those can pay you tens of millions of dollars and the praise of millions of people like sports can.<p>So let everyone make their own decisions. It&#x27;s sad that some people&#x27;s brains are scrambled while playing football. Not everyone dies of smoking cigarettes. Not everyone dies from brain injuries related to football. So all of these articles and hand wringing - so what? Don&#x27;t watch. Don&#x27;t pay money. Let those who like it continue to. It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s right to make their own decisions.')
