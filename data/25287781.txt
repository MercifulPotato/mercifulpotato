Impossible to read the design language.<p>- The original author of Tailwind complains about naming classes in the css but Tailwind ironically names things that are “tx—-bb-4-2” or whatever the hell that means. No thanks, I’ll write “customer-support-card” or something useful. Maybe even more generic - “card”.<p>- Tailwind’s front page is everything that’s wrong with this. Moving around components with “mr-4” tags and shifting it up. Left. Right. Making it larger. That means that there is no standardized design language and you’ll create design that will have no cohesive unity. One component will have “mr-4” margin and another “mr-3”.<p>We have the technology. Sass can create compositional components with reusability and logical hierarchy. There is no need for this Tailwind nonsense.<p>Tailwind is a controversial project, not mature.  It’s proponents think that others just don’t get it. No, we do. We’ve used it and it makes it <i>very fast</i> to get something working but that’s more telling about one’s inability to take the time to think about layout&#x2F;design and writing proper sass.')
