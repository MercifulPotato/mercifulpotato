Followed by an apology for any offence caused.<p>If there was further evidence she did not feel the need to disclose further. However it does appear that mentioning the association was enough justification.<p>Also the complaints that were aired didn&#x27;t provide any further evidence other than the fact that she was on the platform. Again only providing the association as the source of the concern.<p>How do we get from that to a very public firing over a space of a few hours? More evidence may come to light but there are several things very problematic about this.')
