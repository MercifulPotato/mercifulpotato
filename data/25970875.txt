We can say that it&#x27;s bad for Facebook and Discord to censor WSB without trying to argue that it&#x27;s illegal or that it&#x27;s something that the government should stop.<p>Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook have a 1st Amendment right to decide what goes on their platform. It&#x27;s not just that they don&#x27;t have an obligation to host everything, the Constitution protects their right not to host everything. The reason they can censor WSB is because they have freedom of speech. This is a central &quot;conflict&quot; in the 1st Amendment: it guarantees both freedom to say what you want, but also freedom <i>not</i> to say things. It guarantees freedom of association for private entities.<p>Free speech advocates are constantly trying to balance those rights and figure out solutions that make it easier to speak without removing peoples&#x2F;companies&#x27; fundamental right to decide what speech they host and who they associate with.[0] That&#x27;s not always trivial to do, which is why knee-jerk reactions like the Fairness Doctrine are problematic -- they ignore that difficult balance and instead just try to force private platforms to be &quot;fair&quot;. This is also why some of the current dialog about cancel culture is problematic to me. Yes, we can talk about whether these trends are healthy for a society, and that&#x27;s a valid conversation to have. But fundamentally, complaining about people online and criticizing them <i>is free speech</i>. A lot of cancel culture falls into this area where it&#x27;s not clear at all which part you could legislate or make illegal without violating the 1st Amendment in the process.<p>My personal opinion is that we should be cautious about handing control of our public communication to a small number of private companies -- in other words, it&#x27;s not the freedom of association that&#x27;s a problem, it&#x27;s Internet centralization. Worrying about the power of platforms like Facebook is not the same as saying that nothing should be moderated. It&#x27;s good, even essential, for communities to moderate. It becomes more of a problem when one or two platforms control large swaths of the Internet.<p>I&#x27;m personally less worried about Facebook than I am about AWS&#x2F;Cloudflare&#x2F;Apple. But it would be nice to have more competitors to Facebook, and there are a lot of ways that we could try to get more competition in the social networking space. Just a few things we could try:<p>- Antitrust (Facebook regularly buys competitors so it won&#x27;t have to compete with them, we could put a stop to that)<p>- Adversarial interoperability (We could limit the CFAA and DMCA so that scraping content you own from Facebook was easier and more legal. It&#x27;s a more complicated discussion, but this could help combat the &quot;network effect&quot; problem with new startups)<p>- Promoting decentralized alternatives that are easier to self-host (ie, Mastodon, Peertube, etc...)<p>- General education (teaching people to be cautious about making these private platforms essential to their lives, and to be more proactive about seeking out Open alternatives)<p>----<p>[0]: In my own &quot;manifesto&quot; about Internet rights, I try to explicitly call out both the Right to Communicate and the Right to Filter as being equally important (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anewdigitalmanifesto.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anewdigitalmanifesto.com&#x2F;</a>). I think that both freedom of speech and freedom of association are essential, and neither really works well without the other.')
