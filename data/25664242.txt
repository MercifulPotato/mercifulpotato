You wrote:<p>&gt;I failed to comprehend from the title how could a doctor have the authority to forgive half a million dollars alone when most of the costs go to the hospital for services and infrastructure. But in this case, the doctor decided to close his entire treatment centre.<p>I presumed you were not aware that the doctor himself (or his personal business) was capable of being owed $650k.  So I was pointing out that doctors (or the businesses they own) do earn enough to be able to be owed $650k that they can forgive.<p>Now that I re-read your comment, I&#x27;m actually not sure what you meant or where hospitals came into play.  This doctor closed his business because he retired, it had nothing to do with the debt he was owed.  And since he (or his business) was the entity that was owed $650k, it seems well within his rights to choose not to pursue payment for the debt.')
