Item(by='tgb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605808688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151261, text='Say a student is completing a problem set and is asked to prove P. If the student writes &quot;P therefore Q therefore True since Q was proven in class. QED&quot; then the student has committed a significant error in reasoning. If the student instead just writes &quot;P. Q. True. QED&quot; then they are writing the above in a more terse manner and have equally committed an error in their reasoning. If they first write that but then amend in some &quot;iff&quot;s between each step I&#x27;ll give them full credit (assuming iffs are valid) but be slightly worried that they just learned that you need to put an &quot;iff&quot; in those spots to keep the teacher happy but don&#x27;t understand why.<p>If a strategy is not guaranteed to give proof, then you need to verify afterwards that the putative proof is in fact a proof. Just as if you get a potential solution to an equation (via solving a more general equation, perhaps), you have not &quot;solved&quot; the original equation until you actually check that solution, even if your putative solution is the true one. If a student does not do the &quot;check if steps are reversible&quot; part, then they have not written a proof even if every step is reversible! That&#x27;s what&#x27;s lacking form their proof.')
