What I read in the Spring was that research money and interest had dwindled not long after MERS, and that the few labs still hammering away at the problem weren&#x27;t making much progress. Unless it was just sheer luck, it seems what SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 provided was a proving ground for already well developed methodologies.')
