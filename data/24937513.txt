Instead, he&#x27;s spent about twice as much time on the links as Obama did, including during various crises that would demand a normal president&#x27;s full attention.<p>If they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> report how the President was responding to a given crisis, you&#x27;d criticize them for <i>that</i>.  So I don&#x27;t see how they can win here.  They keep pounding the &quot;Orange Man Bad!&quot; drum because yes, in, fact, Orange Man is Bad, and people need to know that.
