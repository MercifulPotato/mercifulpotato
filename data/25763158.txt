When I was a kid, Reagan would occasionally &quot;pre-empt&quot; normal prime-time TV to talk about whatever the hell was on his mind.  It drove me crazy: he would suddenly be on every station and there was nothing else to watch.  I asked my parents why he was allowed to do that and they&#x27;d say, &quot;TV operates on public airwaves and the government owns the public airwaves&quot;.  Well, as annoying as Reagan pre-empting the Cosby Show was back then, the &quot;public airwaves&quot; argument was used to justify a whole heck of a lot of worse government overreach that I really, really don&#x27;t want to see come to the internet.')
