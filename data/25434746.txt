Reusable masks do &quot;work.&quot; Masks lose effectiveness over time and should be changed regularly, but it is not true that &quot;correct&quot; usage involves changing them &quot;numerous times a day.&quot;<p>There are two major factors that, as I understand it, drive the use of disposable masks in clinical settings. First is that healthcare workers see many sick people a day and they are worried about surface transmission. This is the main reason why <i>they</i> need to change their masks so often. The rest of us, who are moving through the world without looking directly into the mouths of sick people, have fewer foreign moisture on our masks. The second is that masks do become less effective over time, but the relative import of mask effectiveness should be judged proportionally to risk of the situation. Again, clinical workers are in a higher risk situation, so they change masks more often. The utility for the general public is lower.<p>Cloth masks were called into question early in the pandemic due to a 2015 study indicating they spread disease[1]. This was in a medical setting and, as I understand it (I am a layman) it was because of poor mask sanitation (i.e. using masks for many days without cleaning). My understanding is that using a cloth mask for a day is better than no mask. Of course it would be better to change it more often, <i>but the relative risk is low</i>.<p>Since then we have done a number of studies on cloth masks in the population and those studies have shown that cloth masks are effective[2]. It is true that &quot;better&quot; masks protect better, but that protection is almost always trumped by compliance. The mask you will wear is 100% better than the mask you won&#x27;t wear. So health experts have focused on that.<p>The medical community has done a shit job of communicating this, but that&#x27;s no reason to say things that don&#x27;t seem to be true.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4420971&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4420971&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucsf.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;417906&#x2F;still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucsf.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;417906&#x2F;still-confused-abou...</a>')
