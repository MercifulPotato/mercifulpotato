Without the processor on, I&#x27;m profoundly deaf - so video would be quite useless. (thus the reasoning for a vibrating smoke alarm thingy).<p>I keep my phone on vibrate-only.<p>At the end of the day I&#x27;m a little different because I rely on my cochlear implant and for some people in some communities (see deaf vs Deaf), there&#x27;s quite a lot of stigma.')
