Item(by='loeg', descendants=None, kids=[25242713], score=None, time=1606614943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25241899, text='This is more like &quot;random concept car&quot; &#x2F; F1 than audiophilia.<p>The idea here, if it is sound and measures well, is basically only useful to track racers (because they race single-speed bicycles).  Current chains are extremely efficient, and mostly compatible at the same nominal width (expressed as 10-speed, 11-speed, 12-speed).  And they are very cheap.  People <i>do</i> spend absurd money shaving grams on bikes, but this product is not really in that space.  It requires an IGH or a single-speed and isn&#x27;t compatible with <i>any</i> other high-end drivetrain components on the market.  That&#x27;s a non-starter even for the people spending $15k on a bicycle.<p>Here&#x27;s a better &quot;audiophile&quot; example in vogue in cycling at the moment: ceramic bearings.  These cost a lot more than high-quality steel bearings and quickly become less efficient than steel ones because the hard ceramic bearing destroys the softer steel races.')
