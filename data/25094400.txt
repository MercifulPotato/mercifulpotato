Item(by='cmroanirgo', descendants=None, kids=[25096042], score=None, time=1605378833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093916, text='&gt; <i>I used Google&#x27;s name in the title because that name elicits reaction from almost 100% of the audience,</i><p>And<p>&gt;<i>Changing the title from &quot;Google&quot; to &quot;Third Party Auth&quot; significantly softens the impact and urgency I want the reader to feel upon reading the title,</i><p>It sounds rather like parent was correct in calling it click bait. For me, any article that has aspirations to manipulating ones emotions in order to illicit a particular outcome is definitely selling some propagandist notion... Aka click bait.<p>That the article&#x27;s content, HN submission and the parent comment is the same person @gurjeet, I would like to thank @dang for the modification.')
