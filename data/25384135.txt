Wet is water, sugar, honey, oil, salt, etc.  Dry is various flours, oats, multigrains, etc.<p>When it comes time to make bread (usually the night before we want it), it&#x27;s a simple matter of pouring a wet kit into the machine, sprinkling over a dry kit, some yeast, setting the timer and pressing &#x27;start&#x27;.<p>The kids do that, and do most of the batch prep, which we&#x2F;they&#x27;ve optimised for teamwork, and for example we&#x27;ve 3d printed scoops in the right measures for the recipe, to speed measurements.<p>So from my point of view, I almost have &#x27;automatic bread&#x27; :)')
