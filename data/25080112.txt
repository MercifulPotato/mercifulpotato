Its fairly easy with Docker [1]. However via self-hosting you don&#x27;t get the <i>anonymity</i> benefits from their upstream (Bing, Yandex, whatever else you enable) which you do get via a public SearX. But with a public SearX instance you don&#x27;t get the privacy benefits from that instance (ie. all searches can be traced to you).<p>So I end up using both public and self-hosted SearX, DDG, and Google as last resort.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;searx&#x2F;searx-docker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;searx&#x2F;searx-docker</a>')
