I don&#x27;t so basing all on videos alone. In a video to promote the bleeding edge of their development with Lex Fridman Hotz was driving the car to a specific part of a freeway that had a tilt and he was able to let go off the wheel for a brief moment. In another part the car was driving by itself in an urban setting and the highlight was that it was able to stop by itself at an intersection. This is light years removed from anything resembling a self driving system. But again, if you have more insight than the few videos I am basing this on please share. Would be interesting to hear more.')
