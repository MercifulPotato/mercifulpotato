For example, &quot;cat &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null&quot;, the redirection is done by the shell and isn&#x27;t passed to cat&#x27;s &quot;char **argv&quot;, in the process tree you can only see a &quot;cat&quot; running without arguments (and a shell built-in is invisible). It also gives no information about the control flow of your one-liner shell script (e.g. what does the &quot;for loop&quot; do?), nor environmental variables, etc. You can try to reconstruct some information by inspecting its open files, its environ, etc., but it&#x27;s not practical for any complicated combination of commands).')
