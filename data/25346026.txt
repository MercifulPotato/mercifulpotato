Also, at least in Germany the fares are regulated to ensure people are not ripped off in &quot;hot times&quot;.<p>- Hotels, and most AirBnBs <i>are</i> de facto hotels, are regulated to prevent issues with fire safety, theft, privacy, noise complaints (it&#x27;s illegal to build hotels in residential zones for a reason) and many others.<p>- Something like Grubhub putting their own intercepting phone number in Google results via shady SEO tactics and charging people for any call is just ripe for abuse by competitors, additionally it&#x27;s extremely unfair.')
