The military, economic and geopolitical factors which underpin it are the reasons that it is the only game in town. These underlying factors won&#x27;t go away simply because the implementation details of the currency change.<p>Perhaps it will come to pass that the US is no longer the dominant geopolitical player or currency issuer. Davos etc. would prefer to have a supranational hegemon. They have been planning and advocating for this for decades.<p>It is not hard to imagine globalist interests corralling a multipolar world into their schemes. They need only play the edges against each other until they meet in the middle. They&#x27;re experts at positioning the goalposts.<p>Even further afield is the idea that the CCP will take the driver&#x27;s seat.<p>Either way, I find it hard to believe that these top-down solutions will provide anything other than a paradigm of increased centralized control as implemented by a single dominant player.<p>In my view the policy options for CBDC are the primary motivators. Taxation, tracking and &#x27;stimulus&#x27; measures are better served by CBDC. It is a technocrat&#x27;s wet dream.<p>Who will be implementing it isn&#x27;t as relevant. If I had to guess I&#x27;d say the existing paradigm will continue and the globalist faction will continue to push for dominance. Even Libra was modeled after the SDR.')
