You feed the paper into a custom frame (add margins to the PDF -&gt; JPG script) and then add a slightly sharp cutting edge at the bottom of the frame so that every day the previous day&#x27;s frontpage will come out from the bottom of the frame and you can tear it off (reuse as needed).<p>You would need to pay for something like a 700&#x27; roll of 24&quot; butcher paper for $18 and ink (yes I know HP is a terrible company on ink) but it might be even more realistic!')
