You should probably stop watching Fox or reading Facebook and the NY Post for your “news”. These same characters have been selling various similar stories for the last 4+ years, and every one has turned out to be complete bullshit when given the tiniest bit of scrutiny.<p>What this story demonstrates more than anything is that Giuliani and Trump are getting pathetically desperate, because it is looking likely they will lose and both are facing significant criminal liability once they aren’t shielded by the Barr DOJ’s position that a GOP president enjoys absolute impunity and by the pardon power (which has already been corruptly used to let other Trump henchmen off the hook for crimes committed in his name).')
