Best to hunker down and hope the civilians sort their shit out before giving an order you know is going to result in a lot of resentment and formerly good, dependable people being locked up for insubordination (best case), or entire organizations dissolving in an orgy of mutiny, violence, and&#x2F;or desertion (worst case).<p>As far as a split goes, it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;clean.&quot;  Unlike in the 19th century, individual units aren&#x27;t constituted from people drawn from the same geographic area.  There&#x27;s a centralized bureaucracy managing personnel, so most units really are a cultural melting pot made up of people from all over the country.  So I don&#x27;t see the military splitting, I see it falling apart.')
