I showed them Firefox, Skype and the photo manager and it all worked well. Everything is done in the browser nowadays.<p>At some point one laptop was purchased with Windows so one guy could game. He played Fifa for a week then asked me to put Ubuntu since &quot;this is what he was used to&quot;.<p>So, you see, it works that way too!<p>I&#x27;ve also been introducing Chromebooks with some success. One of them seems to fail spectacularly: I assume the battery is dead and needs a hard reset every once in a while which means going through some weird wizard that&#x27;s confusing for basic users.<p>Sadly, Linux hardware support is still hit and miss. My latest Lenovo Legion  has a whole lot of issues, the biggest one being that the trackpad just doesn&#x27;t work. Sound also dies sometimes when waking up from sleep. But other than that it&#x27;s a beast of a machine with a killer Ryzen CPU!')
