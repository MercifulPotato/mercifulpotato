I don&#x27;t know about Finland specifically, but based on my experience when I didn&#x27;t know the local language yet and that of friends.<p>&quot;Hello, thank you, goodbye, yes, no, sorry, I don&#x27;t speak Finnish, English?&quot; is probably ok for everyday life, if you don&#x27;t care about not fitting in.  \nAnd even that might not be necessary, most of the time you know what might be asked. E.g. if your getting groceries then pretty much every answer is going to be no from you. Just a head sign and a smile will work fine. Or just go to the self-checkout.<p>For administrative stuff, Google Trad (or similar) is often good enough. Especially nowadays where most things are online. For critical stuff (hospital, ...), they&#x27;ll find someone that speaks English.<p>Funnily enough, it&#x27;s the stuff like getting an haircut, going to the garage and other non-critical but non-automated&#x2F;common tasks which are the most difficult. You start to dread those situations because you cannot make by with just smiles and yes&#x2F;no.')
