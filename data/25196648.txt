What a fail.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget countries like UK want to have electric and hybrid-only cars allowed in mere 9 years (with most being hybrids). As usually with many eco-related changes that cost billions from ordinary folk&#x27;s pockets, good intentions pave road to hell once money and politics get involved.<p>I know what our next car will be if&#x2F;once 2nd baby comes - diesel bmw 530xd wagon. One hell of an utility and proper fun driving with minimal real consumption, euro6 emissions. If lucky with good state of crucial parts, will last 10 years easily. We do long hauls quite often (1500km drive in 1 day or spread to 2). At one point happy to switch to electric, but right now they are too costly &amp; cumbersome, plus we always buy used for 25-30% of the price which isn&#x27;t a thing with electric. Used hybrid - no thank you.')
