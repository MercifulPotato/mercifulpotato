A few are also sending defibrillation drones to heart attack locations.  I&#x27;ve not seen anyone use one for organs, but I do not see any technical reason they could not if the failure rate of the drones is lower than human operated equipment.  There are probably insurance obstacles to get over.  Drones can fly in weather that professional pilots with thousands of hours of IFR experience can not in terms of average failures and the range of said drones is improving exponentially every year.')
