For example, it doesn&#x27;t magically give your cross-shard transactions. And there are situations where it can cause straight up deadlocks, if you&#x27;re not careful about how you structure your queries.<p>So basically your devs can see the DB as &quot;one gigantic instance&quot;... but they also have to be (painfully) aware of what Vitess is doing under the covers to avoid poor interactions with it.<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound like a win to me.')
