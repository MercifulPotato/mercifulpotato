How does it affect me that it&#x27;s part of FB? How is my life improved if its not? Another voice&#x2F;video app will somehow thrive?<p>WhatsApp used to have strong guarantees against tracking (and ads) as long as they were independent.<p>They were wildly profitable and was my favorite messaging service until Facebook bought them.<p>Now I reluctantly use Telegram, but I&#x27;d much rather have something like WhatsApp back were I can pay real money for the service instead of paying with my metadata.')
