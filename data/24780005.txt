It’s got an atmospheric half life of ~7 years and rapidly turns into CO2.  Hydroelectric’s steady state is therefore already baked into the current climate and future releases are equivalent to about ~285 million metric tons of CO2.  (The difference is due to CH4 being heavier than CO2.)<p>Except the carbon in that methane comes the atmosphere  so the the long term global warming impact of existing dams is approximately zero.<p>Now increasing methane production can have an impact, but it just doesn’t stack linearly like CO2 does.')
