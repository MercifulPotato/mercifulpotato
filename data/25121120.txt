But its very close and foams very well. There might some difference, because I noticed the coffee would hit a little bit stronger with oat milk. Perhaps there&#x27;s some chemistry going ... don&#x27;t know why.<p>But the reason I switched, is because I was getting stomach cramps about once a month from cow&#x27;s milk in my coffee. Would ruin my day. The only thing that help me with the stomach cramps was a bowl of rice for some reason.<p>Decided to try other milks to see if would fix my problem and it did. Never liked any other kinds of milk until oat milk. \nThey add lots of chalk to the nut milks. So with oat milk you can avoid that too.<p>The only downside is the price.')
