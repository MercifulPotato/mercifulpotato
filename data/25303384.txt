Web pages in the late 90&#x27;s were necessarily very form driven (no AJAX back then), and users were frustrated to submit a form, wait for a response, only to be told that they were missing a required input (or as you suggest, 4 digits for zip code).  So there were complex frameworks to let Javascript validate the form before it was submitted - the Struts framework would even generate the Javascript for you and keep it synchronized with the backend.<p>But yeah, there wasn&#x27;t really a whole lot of functionality.  You <i>could</i> do fancier things with the Layer API in Netscape, but it only worked in Netscape.')
