Many of the great technological advances of the last decades were made in the way of the former. Or do you think that Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc. prioritize(d) your psychological safety over everything else?<p>I think we learn most when we struggle* than when we have everything laid out in front of us from a more &quot;senior person&quot;. Sure beginners should be given some slack and space to grow, but I&#x27;ve also seen bikeshedding and dozen&#x2F;hundreds of hours spent trying to reach a decision that was actually never reached to avoid hurting someone&#x27;s feelings.<p>*from a bit to moderate struggle.
