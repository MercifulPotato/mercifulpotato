Therefore, it is often understood differently by different people in different contexts - such as those from different countries, cultures, or belief systems.<p>While no standard definition of violence has been established, it is important, when developing effective prevention strategies, to have a clear understanding of violence and the context in which it occurs. In its 2002 World Report on Violence and Health, the World Health Organisation (WHO) proposes a definition of violence that has since become a working term for many international and South African organisations working in the field:\nWHO definition of violence<p>“The intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation.”<p>---<p>Psychological violence (also referred to as emotional or mental abuse) includes verbal and non-verbal communication used with the intent to harm another person mentally or emotionally, or to exert control over another person.<p>The impact of psychological violence can be just as significant as that of other, more physical forms of violence, as the perpetrator subjects the victim to behaviour which may result in some form of psychological trauma, such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. This includes, but is not limited to:<p>* expressive aggression (e.g., humiliating and degrading),<p>* coercive control (e.g., limiting access to things or people, and excessive monitoring of a person’s whereabouts or communications),<p>* threats of physical or sexual violence,<p>* control of reproductive or sexual health,<p>* and exploitation of a person’s vulnerability (e.g., immigration status or disability).<p>This not only leads to mental health problems, but also to severe physical problems, such as psychosomatic disorders.<p>---<p>There, I have done <i>your</i> research into a pre-established, publicly accepted fact which I have no obligation to do (or else I would be doing it all day!). Your welcome.<p>Now it&#x27;s your turn to come up with reasons why this evidence of historic colloquial use will not be enough for you.')
