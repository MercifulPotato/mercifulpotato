It&#x27;s just as bad when it&#x27;s &quot;iPhone had this first!&quot;.<p>So what?<p>&gt; Itâ€™s amazing how quick we are to go ooo ahhh when big tech replicates what is already common place in little tech or academia.<p>Translation: &quot;You&#x27;re dumb for liking this thing I had years ago&quot;. What an empty comment.<p>I don&#x27;t have an Android and never heard of SoundHound, and I&#x27;m quick to go &quot;ooo ahhh&quot; because last weekend my mom was humming a song she didn&#x27;t know the name or words of, and next time I talk to her I can tell her to try song humming on OK Google, and her phone now does this by default, and if it works I&#x27;m predicting she will tell some of her friends or sisters as well.<p>perhaps I should make sure to remind her that she shouldn&#x27;t be impressed if it works, because a thing she would never have paid that much for, didn&#x27;t care about and never owned, could do it years ago, would that help?')
