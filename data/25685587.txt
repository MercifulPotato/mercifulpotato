This last one, additionally, tends to make people use classes for essentially no other reason than that closures don&#x27;t work natively.<p>&gt; My favorite example is: &#x27;,&#x27;.join([&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;])<p>I&#x27;ve always found the discrepancy between this example (instance method call), list((&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;)) (technically a method call, but resembles a functional call), and str.lower(&#x27;AB&#x27;) (class method call) to be quite maddening.')
