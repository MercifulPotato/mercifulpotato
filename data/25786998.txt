Consequently, learning about digital signal processing, and studying how different synth sounds are created.<p>- Working on a Vulkan-backed renderer optimized for multi-surface rendering.<p>- Learning and practicing cartooning &#x2F; drawing. I like the art style of Adventure Time and tend to gravitate towards the characters within.<p>- Writing down ideas as they come around for a game I’m making. Anything goes: storyline ideas, specific dialogue I’d like to use, visual effects I want to create.')
