Perhaps those two diseases have different seasons? (Maybe not, but they way they present it, it is impossible to know). Perhaps all the flu deaths happen in December and all the Corona deaths in March? (Just an example). Also for example Sweden had exceptionally few deaths last years, leaving exceptionally many people &quot;ripe to die&quot; this year (what Marginal Revolution calls the &quot;Dry Cinder Effect&quot;).<p>Also comparing to averages can also be very misleading. It is in fact to be expected that any given year deviates from the average. It would be very odd if every year was exactly on the average.<p>Then in the middle of comparing death rates of previous years, they seem to jump to absolute counting of Covid19 deaths again (&quot;The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show&quot;). When the whole point of looking a death rates of previous years is to establish how many excess deaths were really attributable to Covid19.')
