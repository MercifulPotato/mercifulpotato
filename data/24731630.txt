The assertion that Nazi propaganda played a significant role in mobilizing anti‐Jewish sentiment is irrefutable. But to claim that the Holocaust could have been prevented if only anti‐Semitic speech had been banned has little basis in reality. Leading Nazis, including Joseph Goebbels, Theodor Fritsch, and Julius Streicher, were all prosecuted for anti‐Semitic speech. And rather than deterring them, the many court cases served as effective public relations machinery for the Nazis, affording them a level of attention that they never would have received in a climate of a free and open debate.<p>In the decade from 1923 to 1933, the Nazi propaganda magazine Der Stürmer — of which Streicher was the executive publisher — was confiscated or had its editors taken to court no fewer than 36 times. The more charges Streicher faced, the more the admiration of his supporters grew. In fact, the courts became an important platform for Streicher’s campaign against the Jews.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;policy-report&#x2F;mayjune-2015&#x2F;war-free-expression" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;policy-report&#x2F;mayjune-2015&#x2F;war-free-exp...</a>')
