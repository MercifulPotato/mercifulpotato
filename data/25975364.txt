Imagine that, rather than having walkable cities, every Norwegian commuted alone by car for one hour every day. Imagine - and having lived in Scandinavia for many years, I know this is hard - that there is no grocery store within any reasonable biking or walking distance. Imagine an 8-hour drive is a normal weekend thing to do, because there is no working train infrastructure.<p>In this version of Norway, every single Norwegian would own at least one car. Generally you own multiple cars, because if your one car goes to the shop, you cannot leave your house - it would take hours to walk or bike to work!<p>This version of Norway, as you can imagine, has way, way way more cars. Specifically, roughly twice as many (~400 cars per 1000 Norwegians vs ~800 cars per 1000 Americans). And they drive, way, way way more miles per year.<p>When you combine the much higher number of vehicles in America with the much higher number of annual miles driven, the American challenge, in kWh added to the grid, is perhaps 4-5 times the size of the Norwegian one.<p>Not to mention that, in Norway there is a single grid maintained by a single operator working in lock-step with the national governments climate priorities. In America there are three grids managed by nine regional operators that all hate each other in various fascinating ways.<p>All to say. There are definitely lessons, but Americas relationship to cars makes the &quot;Norway can ramp car sales to 50% BEV why can&#x27;t you&quot; argument misplaced. It&#x27;s like arguing that since the US grid adds, per quarter, twice as many BEVs as the Norwegian grid adds per year, why can&#x27;t Norway take some pointers from the US? Well, because that&#x27;s a silly comparison.')
