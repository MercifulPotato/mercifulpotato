Unfortunately, my wife (who they would actually talk to) works in a SCIF, so I had no way to get a hold of her and had to just leave her a message and wait.<p>It turns out someone had called and claimed to be moving into my house, so they canceled my account in order to enable setting up a new account for the person who claimed to be moving into my house.<p>I am still amazed that this is possible. You can get any customer&#x27;s Internet turned off and they can&#x27;t stop you just by signing up to get a new account at their address.')
