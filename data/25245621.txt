You don&#x27;t want to consider it. That&#x27;s fine...oh wait...what about:<p>I never said that. I was criticisng how he was analysing it. Today there is a habit of denouncing all the progress someone did in the past because their attitudes and actions at the time weren&#x27;t up today&#x27;s standards.<p>&gt; Some people argue people rode Dinosaurs. That&#x27;s about as compelling, as well. For the most of the cultures that contributed to writing portions of the Bible, religious text was law.<p>The point is that a combination of things that culminated in Europe (partly because of Christianity but not wholly) resulted in the secular societies we have in the Western world today. I will remind you just because you don&#x27;t find it compelling doens&#x27;t mean that it isn&#x27;t valid. I think there is <i>little</i> bit of truth to it, but I don&#x27;t think it tells nearly the whole story.<p>I know that many people seem to think that Christians are fundamentalist lunatics like Ken Ham, but most aren&#x27;t.<p>&gt; The point is about intent, which is relevant. &quot;less perfect&quot; or whatever that&#x27;s supposed to mean to you, is irrelevant. This is history, not a relative comparison of ideals.<p>Less perfect means that &quot;It was a step in the right direction&quot;. This isn&#x27;t really difficult to grok.<p>&gt; Sure you can. Confusing Moral analysis and Contextual analysis is noise.<p>You really shouldn&#x27;t. It distorts people&#x27;s view of history.<p>&gt; Characters are caricatures (incomplete) if you ignore known qualities. Interestingly enough, while you are objecting strongly to the characterization you could have noted that bladegash might have been wrong about the Patrick Henry quote.<p>I am not an American, I don&#x27;t know anything about the people involved and don&#x27;t claim to. I was simply commenting on the fact that people seem to view history through the standards of today.<p>&gt; Maybe spend more time researching, instead of emotionally posting.<p>I did no such thing.')
