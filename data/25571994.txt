Or are you suggesting that they only support Intel Core 2 Duo + NVIDIA GT 640?\nI don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re suggesting. A video editor needs good hardware, either you can go with mac, or PC. On PC, you can not really lock yourself into one model, even the developers are gonna have a variety of different hardware.')
