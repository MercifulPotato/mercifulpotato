The system is miserable. My gf has mental health issue, short of actually attempting suicide, there is pretty much no way to get access to any psychiatrist [I guess she wouldn&#x27;t be a burden on the system if she succeeded...]. Her father had bloody urine, and was recently denied cancer appointments. And on top of that private practices are straight out illegal.<p>Also, as personal experience, while living in Quebec, as I was in-between visa, I had to walk for 2 days on a broken foot as the ER wouldn&#x27;t check me unless I paid ~1000$ for a consult. I was lucky to be be able to go to a private clinic, paid $50 and was done.<p>I really wish I could just pay to access a private practice...')
