And indeed that&#x27;s true: water rights, zoning, building codes, pollution and noise restrictions, and more ought to depend highly on the population density of the area, and it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary or even moral for rural voters to have much say in how dense cities set those policies.<p>But my point is that there are plenty of <i>other</i> policies which don&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) vary based on population density, and thus grouping districts based <i>only</i> on population density might give very little influence to interest groups for those other policies. Civil rights are the extremely obvious example, but there are others.')
