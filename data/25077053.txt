The Postgres support for it lags pretty well and is mostly and after thought. It&#x27;s much better to try to leverage something more native, either the WAL or if on a more modern version take advantage of logical replication.<p>For coming off Heroku DMS isn&#x27;t going to work cause you don&#x27;t have a replication slot, so your only approach is wal-e, or maybe wal-g?<p>Fast cloning is one nice feature for sure of Aurora, but when you go into Aurora you&#x27;re starting to deviate more and more from native Postgres. Fast cloning can definitely be done one without Aurora. We&#x27;re working on bringing our ability on Crunchy Bridge down to a few minutes similar to Aurora, while still being 100% Postgres. Not there yet, but suspect we&#x27;re a few months away.')
