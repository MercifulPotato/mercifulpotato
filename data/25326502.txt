CF Workers already run at the edge and have a globally distributed kv store... you could use this coupled with Workers and KV to run an entire site along with data storage fully on the CF edge. That would get ridiculously low latency, automatic https with termination in the same DC as the compute (whereas with Netlify you either use their CDN and https or you run it thru CF and have 2 hops), and the ability to run lambdas in multiple languages with CF workers. I’m going to have to give this a try as soon as it’s available.')
