Item(by='bitwize', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608929941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535258, text='&gt; My impression from modern art galleries I went into was not &quot;social critique&quot;. Very little of that was in social critique category.<p>It&#x27;s almost never quite so direct as that. Rather, the job of an art piece, especially in conceptual art, is to take some aspect of the way audiences typically view a work -- or any object -- and challenge it. Turn it on its ear somehow. Because there&#x27;s nothing universal about what we find beautiful, what we find happy or sad, how we respond to color or light or space, etc... all these things are indoctrinated in us by the consumerist society that surrounds and pervades us. The purpose of contemporary art is to challenge that, to offer an alternative. To counter the desires and judgements that have been ingrained into us since childhood by capitalism.<p>As such, art isn&#x27;t really art unless it&#x27;s anti-kitsch, because kitsch affirms consumerism. Being &quot;anti-kitsch&quot; in this way is like being &quot;anti-racist&quot;: inasmuch as you fail to adequately oppose kitsch you are kitsch. Damien Hirst&#x27;s <i>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</i> was art because Hirst offered a novel challenge to how we view life and death, or living and dead things. Having done so, however, any subsequent pickled animals would not be novel. They would be kitsch -- trite reproductions, shallow copies of what Hirst had accomplished.')
