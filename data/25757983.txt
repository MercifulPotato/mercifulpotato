If we don&#x27;t, we&#x27;re going to slip into a world with less liberty.<p>Libel, slander, and &quot;yelling fire&quot; are sufficient limits on free speech. Seeing or hearing people say things you don&#x27;t like isn&#x27;t going to kill you. Society already has the tools to shun those who act egregiously.<p>We have other legal mechanisms to quell the events that happened last week. Prosecute for politicians inciting violence, fine trusted news organizations spreading misinformation, jail those who destroy property, trespass, or assault another person.<p>We have ways to stop radicalization too: being better to one another and making sure people have their needs met.<p>I vehemently disagree with Voat, Parler, thedonald.win, &#x2F;r&#x2F;sino, J. K. Rowling, and many other communities and persons. But they have a right to carry on, and we shouldn&#x27;t deplatform them.<p>If we didn&#x27;t have free speech, we wouldn&#x27;t have gotten to where we are today. I&#x27;d rather live in America than a country that has less free speech.')
