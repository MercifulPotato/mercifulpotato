What he did say (in an article about first-aid treatments for snakebites, weirdly enough), was this:<p>&gt; We but mirror the world. All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.<p>-- <i>The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandi,</i> vol. 13, p. 241 (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gandhiashramsevagram.org&#x2F;gandhi-literature&#x2F;mahatma-gandhi-collected-works-volume-13.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gandhiashramsevagram.org&#x2F;gandhi-literature&#x2F;mahatm...</a>)<p>Not quite as snappy, admittedly.')
