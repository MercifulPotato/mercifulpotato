That is what links most of the things in the article: a business person needs to know certain business things to be effective, and so if you&#x27;re considered a business person you get told things like what the competive landscape is, what the budget is, and so on.<p>For me, the engineer is actually the only person who can do those business functions properly, if the business is solving new problems (rather than a cash cow). I tolerate people who aren&#x27;t engineers, because I often can&#x27;t avoid them, but once you get more than a few of these people in your business, things get awkward for the actual engineers.<p>I also tend to think of engineering as more than just coding. An essential part of it is communicating. You can&#x27;t do that without technical skills, there&#x27;s just so much friction.')
