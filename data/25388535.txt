I can get mid-range studio quality headphones for that price, from a company that is actually focused on producing the best headphones.<p>Apple has a huge R&amp;D budget and I&#x27;m sure that they could make some very nice headphones if they wanted to, but up against a company that&#x27;s been making really good stuff for 40+ years, I&#x27;m skeptical. If it were an innovation thing, I&#x27;d be down to get the hot new headphone experience, but these are just wireless can headphones with some noise cancelling, a product that&#x27;s been around for quite a while now.<p>(I&#x27;ve had Bose QCs for ~8 years now (the same set, mind you), I&#x27;m pretty happy with them. I&#x27;m also pretty happy with the earbuds that came with my phone. so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m allergic to spending money on stuff I think will be worth it or I&#x27;m some audio snob).')
