You justify this with “consumers don’t give a shit”. I think consumers clearly <i>do</i> give a shit about trading costs, and my evidence for this is that zero-fee brokerages like RH are taking over the industry.<p>What consumers don’t have the time or resources to do is try to reverse-engineer the costs that they are actually paying when using RH’s platform. I’m not even sure they possibly could do so given the information asymmetry between firm and customer, and your “maybe there’s a Google search but I have low confidence” counterargument isn’t moving me. The SEC report shows that for some customers RH’s costs were inordinately high compared even to competitors that charged fees, but others weren’t. How do I, as a customer, actually figure this out?<p>The question is what should regulators do about it? Your position seems to be some kind of binary “we must either disallow PFOF entirely or allow any PFOF arrangement without reservation as long as brokerages disclose it in page 30 of their TOS.” My point is that different PFOF arrangements have very different impact on customer prices. For example, it&#x27;s easy to envision a large class of PFOF arrangements that are undeniably harmful to customers, and yes, absolutely regulators should find some reasonable grounds to police those. Because at the highest level, a situation in which those deals are allowed is going to be terrible for consumers. With brokerages hunting for new revenue sources, those situations are going to become increasingly the norm.<p>ETA: Even ignoring the “page 30 of the TOS” point, it’s not obvious to me that simply disclosing “we have PFOF arrangements” is sufficient. It seems problematic that a single disclosure should apply equally to everyone from Vanguard to Schwab to RH (or even some hypothetical future scam brokerage that massively overcharges its customers via PFOF) when all of these companies have wildly different arrangements that affect customer trading prices differently. The nature of the arrangements matter too, and <i>at minimum</i> customers deserve sufficient disclosure of the arrangements that they can make determinations about which company is going to cost more to trade with.')
