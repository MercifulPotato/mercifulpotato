If you only look at the numbers or try to run simplistic calculations, it&#x27;s easy to think that bikers are just deluding themselves.<p>Bikes are all about diminishing returns.<p>If you spend $500, you get a bike that&#x27;s probably twice as good as a $250 department store bike.<p>Spend $1000, and you get a bike that&#x27;s half again as good as that $500 bike.<p>Drop 2 large and you get a bike that&#x27;s 25% better than the $1k bike.<p>etc etc until you are paying $15,000 for a bike that&#x27;s 0.5% better than a $10,000 bike.<p>We all find what part of the curve we want to participate in.<p>Personally, I think $4500 for a really nice looking eBike with some fantastic add-ons is a decent deal.')
