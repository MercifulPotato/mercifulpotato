In a lot of ways the ethernet standards of today are basically the same thing that we&#x27;ve had since like 2000.  There&#x27;s no reason it can&#x27;t use a lot of the same techniques that are used in wifi, other than it increases complexity.  1 Gbps is enough for anyone... right :D<p>Surprisingly, you&#x27;ll see a lot of the wifi standards have analogs in cable broadcasting.  DOCSIS is very analogous to how WiFi handles data transmission.  It is pulling a lot of the same tricks.<p>&gt; Related, for somebody who wants reliability, is Ethernet&#x2F;wired still a sane choice, or does that just make them an old geezer?<p>Yeah, ethernet is still way more reliable than Wifi.  You run into far fewer problems with interference or noise.<p>Some of the higher frequency WiFi standards (60GHz) suffer less from noise (because they can&#x27;t penetrate walls very well).')
