The latter one is knowledge management tool,  and contains also unread books because it is useful to also manage ones future knowledge.<p>If you want to go the deep end, in 1970s or so Eco wrote guidebook to academic thesis writing that comes with a tutorial how to bootstrap a bibliography and an index card system for your research or other professional purposes, of course most conveniently (though maybe not most cheaply) used with your personal research library that contains whole of your bibliography.<p>That said, there is also a failure modes of sorts. One that used to be famous was people who collected a respectable looking library (or had someone collect it) but never read or used it themselves, only show off their supposedly good taste in books to visitors. Other, related one, but more in the spirit of plans &quot;I will do all the cool things I wanted ro do when I have time after retirement&quot; involves similar mismanaging ones time and thus spending too much time collecting the library compared to using it.')
