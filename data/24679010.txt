I guess if you sleep with it that’s a valid concern. I don’t and so I have to take it off anyway - so it’s not a big deal to just place it on the charger next to my bed and grab it first thing in the morning. The magnetic ‘clickiness’ of the desktop dock is nice and very smooth to drop on and take off.')
