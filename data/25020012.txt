The manufacturer may be audited.  Their processes and people may be background checked.  Their hiring practices subject to a standard.  Some of their devices may be selected at random, scrutinised, picked apart, checked by third parties, just to be sure.  It&#x27;s not done much, but perhaps it should be.  Anyway, if that&#x27;s done there is some higher level of justification in trusting the manufacturer&#x27;s integrity, even if it remains a weak point.<p>If we already have to trust the device manufacturer and&#x2F;or their auditors, that makes <i>them</i> owning the software trust root a very different proposition compared with anyone else owning it.')
