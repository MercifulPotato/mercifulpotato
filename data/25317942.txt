It seems a bit out of left field unless it&#x27;s rhetoric to overthrow project leaders that consider themselves &quot;BDFL&quot;s. Even if that is the case it&#x27;s incredibly melodramatic melodramatic to conflate LKML with Der Sturmer. I don&#x27;t think project management strategies necessarily line up with political systems.')
