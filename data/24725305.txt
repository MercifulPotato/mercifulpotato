Then they just need to establish that their equity programs are well substantiated by educational barriers which are inescapably racialized.<p>Basically the argument is that since race in America is unavoidably intertwined with educational opportunity, it is not possible to have an admissions procedure which is &#x27;neutral&#x27; with respect to race; that in fact equity programs aim to strike the best balance in this conundrum, and are therefore the least discriminatory policy available in the overall context of the program.')
