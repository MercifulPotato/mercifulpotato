I go to bed in a similar state like after going to the gym, that is, eager to sleep and rest.<p>With videogames, the experience usually is very different. I&#x27;ll blink, and suddenly it&#x27;s time to go to bed and my whole free time for the day is gone. I don&#x27;t want to go to bed because my mind is telling me that there&#x27;s still more day left, no way it&#x27;s all done already; so I usually go to bed really late.<p>Days feel <i>far</i> longer when I&#x27;m not playing, in a good way. Gaming is like presing the fast forward button on your life.')
