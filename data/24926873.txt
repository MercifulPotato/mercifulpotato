Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=[24927132], score=None, time=1603942108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926720, text='Health insurance premiums are just total healthcare costs for the insured lives plus x% for operations of the health insurance company.  If all hospitals have to raise prices to meet IT costs, then presumably the total cost of healthcare for the insured lives goes up, and hence the health insurance premium has to go up.<p>So yes, typically if your vendor&#x27;s suppliers increase price, then your vendor will increase their price too.  If your vendor has big margins and you have the ability to switch to a different vendor, then maybe the vendor will eat the cost, but health insurance is already a low margin business, so that&#x27;s not likely.')
