Having to get a billion dollar emergency bail out is not the sign of a sinister plot, it&#x27;s the sign of a colossal fuck up.<p>What about a sinister plot that fucked up? Being bailed out is consistent both with being dumb and short-sighted, or being deliberately negligent and short-sighted. Failure is possible in both cases if not more likely in the latter (this failure wouldn&#x27;t be possible if Robinhood didn&#x27;t decide to facilitate liquidity out of its advertised risk class, but would be tempting to ignore if you precluded the possibility of retail colluding on its own. The benefit for Robinhood would be greater order volume over time which means i.e. higher quarterly revenues).<p>In addition, if you are willing to claim bailouts are evidence that deliberate negligence&#x2F;&quot;sinister plans&quot; aren&#x27;t present, you would have to claim the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis didn&#x27;t feature deliberate negligence, which isn&#x27;t true.')
