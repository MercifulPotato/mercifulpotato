I have to pay attention to how I&#x27;m holding the pen, if it&#x27;s legible, if I have room for the next word on the line, if I&#x27;m going to smudge something, if I can keep up with what&#x27;s being said or just cross this sentence out and write the next one before I forget that one too.<p>So sure, my brain is <i>way</i> more engaged when I&#x27;m writing by hand. But it&#x27;s engaged in a bunch of BS related to writing, not the subject at hand. If anything, it&#x27;s making it harder for me to pay attention, which (at least for me) is definitely detrimental.')
