Item(by='WanderPanda', descendants=None, kids=[25348368], score=None, time=1607447399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347341, text='Do you also have these sound level bugs with your XM3, where you adjust down the volume before connecting and then the headphones adjust the volume back up to some level when connected? This has severly blasted my ears multiple times and I can&#x27;t express how angry I get when that happens (its a miracle I didn&#x27;t destroy them yet). Its just a shame they combine so good battery life, ANC and sound quality with such a bad software, to a point where I rather get mediocrity in all points than what sony is offering me. Since I got my AirPods Pro I rarely use the XM3s anymore so I will probably not directly jump for the Maxs but they will definitly be an option for me in the future')
