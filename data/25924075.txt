I would love it if it weren&#x27;t dependent on filesystem locking. Wondering about network locking now. If it&#x27;s already forking a daemon, might as well store that lock data in memory and communicate it over a network socket. There&#x27;s still the question of resolving the network service, but that&#x27;s a flaw in the TCP&#x2F;IP stack. I bet it could be solved by a simple wrapper command to a service resolver. Custom protocol syntax for locking per dir should be trivial. Heck, maybe move the network logic out to the wrapper, and have the locking be some other interaction between the wrapper and nq.')
