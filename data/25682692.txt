I used to visit Stanford several times a week. Walking briskly, you can cross the core of campus, where most of the instructional buildings are, in about 15 minutes from one end to another. The athletic center and undergraduate dorms are located around the periphery of this core. I assume students don&#x27;t typically go back to their dorms multiple times per day. The engineering campus is pretty compact. The medical complex is, yes, another brisk ten-minute walk, but I doubt many students need to go between the hospital and the rest of campus more than once a day. If your daily schedule takes you from the dorms to the core of campus, and then to the hospital, and then to the campus gym, and then to the student union or the main library, then yes, maybe you&#x27;ll choose to take a shuttle. But for an able-bodied person, these are very reasonable distances to travel on foot, and certainly on a bicycle or scooter.<p>For comparison, I went to a university with a much smaller campus, and it was still at least a ten-minute walk from one end to another. And it was fine.')
