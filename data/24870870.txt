They are no more digital than your bank account in 1985 was and not using any technology newer than that. They are just normal dollars held directly by citizens at thhe central bank which is useful as a monetary policy tool.<p>Sure you can tokenize something to create a stable coin but that still had none of the interesting properties of a Blockchain. It just makes itt marginally easier to interact with that ecosystem.')
