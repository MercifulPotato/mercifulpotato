For example, it could be work burnout causing it.  It could be not going outside that is causing it.  It could be not socializing that is causing it.  It could be your diet.  It could be ...<p>If you can identify the cause you can find a solution.  Unfortunately, the best most people have is a shotgun approach where they try a combination of solutions attempting to address every possible cause.<p>When in a depressed state it makes you want to lay down, to do less.  It&#x27;s exhausting and depending on how bad the depression is sleeping seems better.  For the majority, doing the exact opposite of how you feel works to get out of that state, which isn&#x27;t easy for many, so it helps to take it slow.  Sometimes just walking around in a circle in your house for 15-20 minutes can sometimes be enough.  This can be done without getting dressed or even thinking about it.  It can be done while cooking food or going to the bathroom.  It&#x27;s only 15 minutes and for many that is enough exercise to start feeling not drained again.<p>For many today depression can be caused by doing too much instant gratification type activities in your free time, which can cause that feeling drained feeling.

So for some the solution to this kind of depression is socializing.<p>And it goes on.  This is why talking to a professional (preferably someone who specializes in CBT, but it&#x27;s not required) can help.  It typically only takes a few months of therapy to get out of most kinds of depression.')
