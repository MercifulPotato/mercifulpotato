Item(by='korethr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611977023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963509, text='&gt;  A sustained short interest does not necessarily mean that the shorts are holding their initial position, they could have closed and reopened at these elevated levels.<p>This occurred to me today. I see it as entirely plausible that one or more large funds willingly took the loss to exit their initial short position, and proceeded open new short positions at the current crazy prices. In fact, I would not be surprised if they haven&#x27;t been doing that all this past week with iceberg orders[1] so to not tip their hands by driving the price that much higher while doing so. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they were able to bankroll the new position themselves or had to take on additional leverage to do so. A huge profit could be made from trying to short from these new crazy prices, and I&#x27;d not be surprised if big money was willing to fund such an attempt.<p>With all the hype this past week, a bunch of people have jumped onto the bandwagon. I&#x27;d wager many are doing so out of an emotional excitement, without honestly considering the risk and whether they&#x27;re truly willing to lose everything they put into this play. I&#x27;d also wager there are many who only <i>think</i> they&#x27;re willing to lose everything they spend on $GME. But, when the share price starts going down, whether crashing from a panic selloff, or gently drifting downward as people start exiting their positions to lock in their profits, many will realize they&#x27;re not as willing to lose everything as they thought.<p>I fully expect the funds to try to play chicken with those trying to short squeeze. I fully expect them to try every dirty trick in the book to kick off a panic selloff. I would not be surprised if new dirty tricks get invented. I would not be surprised if favors get called in from politicians and other persons of power to try to scare everyone out of holding, whether that&#x27;s looking the other way while the big funds do something maybe-not-so-legal, or other shenanigans, like very public arrests of u&#x2F;DeepFuckingValue and others on BS charges.<p>There&#x27;s potentially <i>very</i> big money to be had here, and the big hedge funds everyone wants to screw over didn&#x27;t get to their present riches by playing nice or fair.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;i&#x2F;icebergorder.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;i&#x2F;icebergorder.asp</a>')
