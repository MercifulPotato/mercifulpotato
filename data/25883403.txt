Starting a conversation without a greeting is very rude in a lot of cultures. But yes, it&#x27;s annoying in chat form, and especially when the conversation is left dangling. Depending on the situation, I&#x27;ll write out what I&#x27;d like to say, then copy it before starting off with a &quot;hello&quot;. If the person starts typing, I&#x27;m ready to follow up with the request. If not, I&#x27;ll prepend it with: &quot;when you have a minute&quot;, or whatever makes sense given the urgency of the request. And I&#x27;ll generally only start with the &quot;hello&quot; if it&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve interacted that day.<p>We&#x27;ve also experimented a little bit on my team with prepending asynchronous messages with emojis: a turtle means you can take your time, an alarm means it&#x27;s urgent, a custom thumbs up&#x2F;thumbs down emoji means you just need a yes or no answer.')
