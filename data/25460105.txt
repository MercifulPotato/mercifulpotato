We had a customer who had a name I didn&#x27;t recognize.  I was always curious about who buys our product and this company was hard to track down as to what they ... do &#x2F; if they even existed.<p>Then the tech support case went on and they sent me the logs I requested... yeah lots of dns related entries for porn sites and etc.<p>I really don&#x27;t know if they just provides services to other porn companies or what but it explained a lot.
