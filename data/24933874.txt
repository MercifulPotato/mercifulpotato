So we had the option for a min char count, but users wanted to have one letter workspaces (for fun I guess?). We need to revamp our navigation anyway since it&#x27;s hard to know where to click to change workspaces.<p>Good point on the whitespace- will take a look.<p>As for creating tasks- we&#x27;re thinking of a sticky area on the left (that&#x27;s always on) to create tasks.<p>For priority- we&#x27;re releasing labels in 3 weeks. You should be able to assign #P1 or priority overall on different sets of tasks. That being said- we are considering adding some form of auto recognition or NLP to suggest priority and labels automatically based on past tasks. For time, we have 3 effort options (points, hours or days), we kept it simple to create a standup view where you can see how engineers track throughout the week.<p>Let us know which other parts may be tedious. We have more work to do!')
