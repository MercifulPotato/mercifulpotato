And it’ll likely take maintenance too as you learn what you need (easier when you’ve seen it done already).<p>Most of these trivial things probably take nontrivial time, and if you add all of them together for all the trivial projects you use, it’s probably saved a really serious chunk of time.<p>The ocean is made of “trivial” drops of water, yada yada.')
