Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611442714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25886247, text='&gt; I confess I&#x27;d expected quiet but farm equipment, tractors, etc. make quite a lot of noise.<p>Well, they are less noisy than they used to be (think of the change of noise emissions for cars, though added dampening body), but the usage is now constant.<p>&gt; I realize that a few acres an hour from the city isn&#x27;t quite enough for solitude, you&#x27;re mostly in a working food factory (fair enough I suppose); if you want real quiet it seems you might need 50-100+ acres many hours away.<p>If you have meadows around, that&#x27;s easier: the tractors only pays quick visits in the course of 3 days, once or twice a year, to cut&#x2F;ted&#x2F;make bunches of hay. Cutting grass is faster than ploughing a field, it requires less power, and less operations are needed along the year. And it smells good :) Then you have the cattle, but cattle in a meadow is not a nuisance generally.<p>&gt; if you want real quiet it seems you might need 50-100+ acres many hours away.<p>But then you are the one who must maintain all those acres :-)')
