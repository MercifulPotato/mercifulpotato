But  the  plaintiffs  would not take the district court’s “yes” for an answer. They appealed instead. And, because  they  appealed  ,  the  evidentiary  hearing  has  been  stayed  and  the  case  considerably delayed.  For our part, the law requires that we dismiss the appeal and return the case to the district court for further proceedings.</i>&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.gand.284055&#x2F;gov.uscourts.gand.284055.73.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.gand.284055...</a>')
