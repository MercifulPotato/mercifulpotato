Item(by='KirillPanov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610587927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765128, text='The problem is the <i>capital cost</i> of the cryocooler.<p>The upfront costs of a cryocooler, spread out over the usable lifetime of the cryocooler (they&#x27;re mechanical, they wear out), vastly exceeds the cost of electricity you save by switching from CMOS to JJs.  Yes, I did the math on this.  And cryocoolers are <i>not</i> following Moore&#x27;s Law.  Incredibly, they&#x27;re actually becoming slightly more expensive over time after accounting for inflation.  There was a LANL report about this which I&#x27;m trying to find, will edit when I find it.  The report speculated that it had to do with raw materials depletion.<p>All of the above I&#x27;m quite certain of.  I suspect (but am in no way certain) that the energy expended to manufacture a cryocooler also vastly exceeds the energy saved over its expected lifetime as a result of its use.  That&#x27;s just conjecture however, but nobody ever seems to address that point.')
