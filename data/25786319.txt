That being said, I do agree with you on their view of masculinity and it is fair fodder to critique them on. That is their point, they stand for a certain set of values, they are very clear in what those values are and that is what they should be weighed in the balance for. For the record I am not defending them, rather I prefer to see peoples arguments weighed for what they are saying not for what other people paint on them. It&#x27;s not fair and it is attempt to dilute their message. I think their message stands for itself and most people will reject it. Attempts to paint them as a racist organization when they are clearly not, only muddy the water and lend credence to their argument that they are being treated unfairly. It plays into their hands.')
