Yup, not familiar with coders&#x27; strange hours, the temporary works car park had been totally locked up. The only escape route was to drive across the building site for a new casino in central Dundee.<p>To saw the journey was an obstacle course is a complete understatement. Eventually, at 4AM I got a Rastafarian to unhook the metal fencing, so I could leave the far end of the building site.<p>I got to bed at 6AM!')
