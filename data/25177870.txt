If someone gets banned from Twitter for posting statements inciting violence, there&#x27;s nothing stopping that person from going to other outlets like Reddit or Facebook, or even starting their own site&#x2F;newsletter.  But if a private company were legally incapable of removing content that they determined was unacceptable on their platform, that would be totally okay with you?')
