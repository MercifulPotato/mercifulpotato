Children gather in Roblox, and predators targeted Roblox.<p>The features that make something more or less safe are the controls put around preventing that from happening, minimising the risk, being very clear to parents about what&#x27;s expected of them, having excellent moderation, and having excellent reporting.<p>The PC version of roblox fails all of these somewhat.<p>Many parents today are simply a bit too trusting of products aimed at children. This thing isn&#x27;t going to expose my children to predators; my kids aren&#x27;t going to learn about gang rape from this game; this toy isn&#x27;t going to record audio or video; etc.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily think parents need to ban Roblox, because that means you can&#x27;t teach children about how to keep themselves safe or what to do if they&#x27;re not enjoying something happening online. But I do think parents need to be aware of what happens.')
