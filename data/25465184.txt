I mean, how far detached from reality and clueless about games in general must you be? There are very few studios who can produce such quality prior to release (ie last Zelda), but I guess they are not under such pressure to release on many platforms in parallel just before christmas.<p>It will be an amazing game once the patches progresses, and if you are tolerant I am sure it already is. I would expect decent in 2 months, great in 6 months, awesome in 1-2 years (unofficial patches&#x2F;modding including). Just like many other open world games.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ll wait for those 2 months at least, also due to getting better&#x2F;smoother performance out of my current PC rig. I have no doubt its a game I will enjoy tremendously, again and again, it fits my preferred style very much.')
