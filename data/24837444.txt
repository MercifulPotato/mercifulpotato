I may have also described the current internet as &quot;giant steaming shithole&quot; a time or two because it&#x27;s so polluted with dubious information and algorithmically generated content.<p>At the same time I&#x27;ve been going through some old books (mid-19th century) that were in my grandfather&#x27;s house.  There are some that cover extremely specific subject matters.  They are well indexed, so that finding good information might indeed be easier than googling for it.  I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s superior to internet search, but sometimes we forget that there is actually information that has never been digitized.')
