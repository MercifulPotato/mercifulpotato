Item(by='qlk1123', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1609979880, title='Ask HN: DevOps stories in non-western company', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='After finishing &quot;Phoenix Project&quot;, I&#x27;m reading &quot;DevOps Handbook&quot; and &quot;Effective DevOps.&quot;  While I find the approach described in the books fascinating, it is also frustrating when trying to apply it, mainly because of cultural differences.
