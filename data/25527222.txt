Terseness is something I value in bug reports as a maintainer myself. I don&#x27;t want to read someone yarning on about the breakfast they were eating when they encountered a bug. I want them to tell us everything they know, and then nothing else. The pattern I did here - create a record of the bug with what I know, then investigate it on my own and update the discussion when I have more information or a solution - is also something I like to see as a maintainer.<p>Rude, entitled users is definitely a problem maintainers have to face.
