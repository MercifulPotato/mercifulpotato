I believe much more in starting with one service and splitting it when it becomes absolutely torture to work with...

This is basically what the article suggests in detail, but I assume you disagree with it?<p>Bounded contexts DO NOT need network partitions to be enforced BTW. For example, I&#x27;m pretty sure Google has all their source code in a single repo (or at least a LOT), how do they with a million developers stop people from intertwining everything? My guess is code reviews, hiring good people and tooling.<p>EDIT: sorry to the person who liked it I&#x27;ve rewritten this comment for clarity, and removed lots of words...')
