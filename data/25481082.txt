You give an estimate of $X for the current quarter and $Y for the next quarter; your boss changes your estimate to $1.5X and pushes it up the chain. Now there&#x27;s two weeks left in the quarter and projections are that you&#x27;ll only reach $1.1X, so your boss pushes you to stick more ads and make them bigger &#x27;just for two weeks&#x27;, but also reminds you that your revenue target for next quarter is $1.5Y, so maybe you should keep the big ads.')
