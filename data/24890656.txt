Nor are the creditors who can afford to eat a loss.<p>My concern is more about the ripple effects. Many low-skilled workers rely on service work, and servicing corporate real estate is a real industry (janitorial services, managerial duties, parking lot attendants, plumbers, even construction). They are already having a pretty hard time of it, and if this industry vanishes, &quot;moving on&quot; may mean going out on the streets. San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and San Diego have enough homeless already.')
