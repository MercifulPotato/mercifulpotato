That&#x27;s unbelievably fast.<p>The crash was at an access road for one, but the bigger part of being there so fast is thanks in part to the medical car that stages on the track and starts with the cars, but behind the field.  They follow the racers around for the first lap so that theyâ€™re almost immediately at the scene of any crash.')
