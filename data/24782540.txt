Iâ€™m not sure what the law is on slander (which would be the law in question here, I believe), and if social media companies would be breaking the law if they allow slander to be distributed on their platform.<p>But regardless if it turns out that the story is bogus, and the NYP is charged with slander, but this article had a widespread distribution and is successful in swaying voters on a false claim. Then the damage to democracy is quite significant, but the NYP gets away with a fairly minor charge of slander.')
