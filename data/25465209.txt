Browsers don’t have direct measuring methods and require stupid workarounds, that’s it. Measuring text layout (most complex thing) in wfh&#x2F;hfw in js is as fast as in css, because it is just el.getSizeForW(w) and then c++ does the thing as usual. There is no black magic in calculating layouts, it is arithmetic.<p>&gt;JS layout is also somewhat prone to problems with things like browser zoom level, OS display scaling (although I&#x27;ve not seen that be an issue in a couple of years),<p>It’s not a property of js either. If a browser provides a stupid internal api that requires manual accounting to zooms and dpi, then css implementation is also prone to that.<p>&gt;differences between browsers and browser versions, and so on. Layouts with CSS, so long as you&#x27;re being reasonably conservative, do work quite well in 2020.<p>The problem is that apps are not conservative, apps want innovation instead of a text layout that spends 20 years to learn a proper vertical alignment.')
