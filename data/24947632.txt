Other DBMS works with threads instead of processes and don&#x27;t have any issues.<p>- Easy to configure high availability with multiple nodes<p>Less important:<p>- Graph capabilities directly in PostgreSQL without extentions or something else<p>- Running a scheduling tasks directly in PostgreSQL without external tools (for example a script that removes old data from database).<p>- Supporting Temporal Tables<p>But overall I like PostgreSQL more than Oracle or SQL Server, even if I miss the above features.')
