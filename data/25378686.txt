And what if they&#x27;re on a low-bandwidth or capped cell plan and can&#x27;t download a 100MB app easily, where 3&#x2F;4 of the data is duplicates of stuff in their other 5 copies of the app?<p>What happens when a user tries to book an Uber from one area with a special app version to another area with a different special app version? This could easily generate tens of thousands of permutations.<p>What happens if the user is physically in one country right now, but is a national of another country and wants to pay for their Uber in their usual currency and payment method?<p>If the user ends up needing to have 20 copies of the app for various locations, how well will they sync ride history, changes in payment methods, and other such info?<p>I don&#x27;t even work for Uber, and I thought of all of these complications in 10 minutes.
