All Dominion supplies are fancy printers and optical scanners.<p>The verification process in Georgia involved physically counting all of the paper ballots. The Dominion machines were totally uninvolved in the hand-recount (and, unsurprisingly, the hand-recount found that the original machine tally was extremely accurate)<p>Again, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear you don&#x27;t understand what role the machines actually play in the voting process.')
