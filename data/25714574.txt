I wrote the paragraph out of conviction that we face a social movement unlike anything we have known in modern times and that it isn&#x27;t based on arguments but emotions and exploitation of social dynamics.<p>My ego isn&#x27;t infinitely tied to my opinions and views - though to some degree it certainly <i>must be</i>. I don&#x27;t believe in deleting what I wrote but maybe I could have written something less polemic. I was probably damaging discussions myself.<p>The question is always: can you take a step back, reflect and maybe adjust your opinions? I even understand resolute positions on ephemeric topics such as ethics and value systems.<p>One can have long discussions about how to deal with a hijacked airplane heading for a population center. But baseless opinions about a virus or measured climate change, such as outright denial of their existence or impacts, have no place in &quot;adult&quot; discussions.<p>We should be concerned about <i>how</i> to face these issues and not discuss with trolls and gaslighters about established, independently proven facts.')
