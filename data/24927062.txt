I mean I don’t know, do they actually? You’d think programmers would be the exact types of people to try and analyze this, and yet it seems people are afraid to even ask the question. Of course they do, you’d have to be stupid or hateful to wonder otherwise.<p>I’m not buying it. When the hell have solutions to deep-seated, complex social problems ever been as simple as a markdown document with some carefully written bullet points? I believe CoCs accomplish <i>something</i>, but some days I am left wondering what that is.<p>For what it’s worth, I don’t really care that much. Projects having CoCs does not bother me or anything like that. But the unquestioning acceptance that they “obviously” work has been a little unsettling despite the fact that I don’t think it’s obvious open source has become more welcoming at all.')
