So while health insurance might make up e.g. 5% of what is paid for a software engineer, it could make up 80% of what is paid for a janitor. This puts a big  incentive on companies to get rid of their lowest paid employees (or wiggle their way out of providing benefits), since there is essentially a fixed price income tax that always needs to be paid on any salary regardless of it&#x27;s size otherwise.')
