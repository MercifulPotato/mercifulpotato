Nowadays even people who are familiar with his mainstream output (from ads to cartoons made with Adriano Celentano) don&#x27;t necessarily know his name or the fact that he became famous with erotic comics in late-70s&#x2F;mid-80s. I would not expect anybody under 30 to be familiar with his name.')
