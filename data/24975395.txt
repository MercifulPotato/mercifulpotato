There was an auto-complete suggestion that was auto-selecting when you pressed &quot;enter&quot;, and it was fixed shortly thereafter. There is a blog post about it called &quot;On Partner Referral Codes in Brave Suggested Sites&quot;.<p>That said, it does essentially the same thing Firefox does when you do a search on Firefox. Try right now: go into Firefox, type in a search in the URL bar, press enter, and you&#x27;ll see it appends&#x2F;&quot;injects&quot; a Firefox &quot;affiliate code&quot; as a query parameter so that Firefox gets a cut from Google. One salient difference is that Firefox&#x27;s &quot;affiliate code&quot; is a vanity code (human readable: &quot;?client=firefox-b-d&quot;), so it isn&#x27;t viscerally shocking.<p>If it read &quot;?client=brave&quot; like it does on Firefox, it&#x27;s very likely no one would have ever cared!')
