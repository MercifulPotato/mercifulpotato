The original href already is the visited URL, so I&#x27;m not sure that trying that <i>again</i> is wise, or appropriate, unless the user chooses to reload.<p>The entire design philosophy here is to mimic apparent browser behaviour, or to delegate to it. Hence, to GP&#x27;s question; you should expect the appearance of browser-like behaviour in any circumstance, modulo anything Turbo is specifically trying to do different. Deviation from baseline browser semantics was certainly a basis for filing bugs in its predecessor (Turbolinks).<p>As for what Turbo actually does, I checked the source. Good news, even for a first beta, they&#x27;re not the cowboy nitwits alleged; it gracefully handles &amp; distinguishes between broken visits and error-coded but otherwise normal content responses, and the state machine has a full set of hooks, incl. back to other JS&#x2F;workers, busy-state element selectors, and the handy CSS progress bar carries over from Turbolinks.')
