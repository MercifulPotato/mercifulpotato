I often commute 40 miles on relatively quiet roads,  and then at the end of that another 10 miles on one of the busiest roads in the country.  When I leave home Google and Waze both underestimate the delay caused by the fact that the busy road is gridlocked by the time I get there.  I am therefore better than Google and Waze at calculating journey time.')
