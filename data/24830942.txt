You are completely (and willfully!) ignoring how vulnerable passwords are in <i>any</i> threat model that invalidates a FIDO2 implementation of Face ID. No threat model invalidates the security of Face ID for the Web without similarly invalidating passwords. At least, you have chosen not to present such a threat model, which would help my (apparent) failure of imagination.<p>You <i>cannot</i> protect your passwords from someone who would physically take your iPhone before you can lock it and who would have a life-size reconstruction of your face ready and waiting. Such a person could shoulder surf your passwords with far less effort, or compromise one of the dozens of websites the average user re-uses their passwords on. At a certain point, the person in this threat model will just pull out a wrench and beat you with it until you help them get into your account. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;538&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;538&#x2F;</a><p>If you can show how some random person on the other side of the internet having your fingerprint helps them get into a website using your account... that would be interesting discussion. As it is, they <i>must</i> have physical access to your device. Your biometrics are useless without physical access <i>and</i> rapid action, since the biometrics quickly become useless as the device falls into a state that requires the user&#x27;s passcode.<p>You&#x27;re completely ignoring everything I actually said in my comments, so I&#x27;m done here.')
