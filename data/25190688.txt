So if you have a setup where your laptop can RDP into your desktop with minimal credentials, someone gaining control of the router can access your desktop as well. If you do practice good security and require a username&#x2F;password for the RDP session, the router can still spy on that traffic for the malicious remote. In addition, the remote can issue Remote Assistance requests. More nefariously, if your PC is not on the latest patch, which most PCs aren&#x27;t, an exploit could be used to install a RAT or ransomware or equivalent. Are you using a NAS that is open to every machine on the internal network? If so, the remote will have a field day with your backups and shared data.<p>In short, once the remote has gained access to your internal network, many types of attacks become possible.')
