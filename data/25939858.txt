But nature around us is still even more complex, and there are many mechanisms in nature we don&#x27;t understand (like the human brain). Therefore I don&#x27;t understand why you consider the technical systems to be especially &quot;hellish&quot;.<p>Even if you Mac is somehow &quot;locked&quot;, you can still take an electron microscope to its mainboard and try to understand the circuits and so on. (In theory - in practice, I&#x27;ve just read a modern Ryzen chip consists of billions of transistors, so good luck trying to reverse engineer it).')
