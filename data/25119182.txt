For example, I find &#x27;helicopter parents&#x27; to be very frustrating. I am closer to (but admittedly still fall short of) the &quot;free range parent&quot;. On the whole, our society overemphasizes &quot;zero risk&quot; policies of which I am not a fan, especially when it comes to children. In summary, I am not a fan of the &quot;nanny state&quot;. So perhaps you find my vehement defense of masks incongruent.<p>However, I have a strong sense of duty to a cause larger than myself. So when there is a tradeoff between a minor inconvenience to myself (say a vaccine or in this case a mask in public places), I tend to err on the side on a minor personal inconvenience to help out the larger whole. When it comes to matters of personal responsibility that have consequences limited to the individual engaging in the activity, I tend to say that is their choice.<p>I&#x27;m curious - you haven&#x27;t mentioned any concern with other communal health mandates. After all, clothing mandates for private businesses aren&#x27;t even all that crazy. Have you tried entering a restaurant--or indeed any business--without a shirt or shoes? (I have) You&#x27;ll be politely asked to leave. Why should your freedom to wear (or not wear) clothing of your choice be infringed by the proprietors of these establishments?<p>BTW- I used to think that these requirements (&quot;no shirt, no shoes, no service&quot;) were part of local health codes, but as I was researching my comment here I came across this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;where-did-shirt-shoes-required-come.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;where-did-shirt-shoes-requi...</a>. I have no idea if that&#x27;s true or not, but I find it even more interesting that nobody has a problem complying with that rule but when it comes to reducing the risk of a highly contagious airborne virus, wearing a face covering is suddenly a huge imposition.')
