Limiting this with data caps is at best misleading to customers and at worse a scummy business practice.<p>You must understand that they can only sell you a 1gig pipe because they know not everyone will use it at the same time.<p>EVERY ISP in the world operates by oversubscribing their capacity. EVERY. ONE.<p>You want 1gig and removed data caps by law? Ok, get ready to be introduced to “boosted” bandwidth. You’ll get 1gig for the first 30 seconds of a connection then they will throttle you back. Already exists in some places including mine.')
