So is the social micro-targeting used by Cambridge Analytica&#x2F;AIQ which swung the Brexit vote in the UK and also did a lot to get Trump elected in 2016.<p>It would be irrational to assume the same thing wasn&#x27;t attempted this year. All the media outlets I read - not just social media - have been heavily astroturfed with posts making the same pro-Trump scripted talking points over and over and over.<p>(HN has been relatively free of this, but I suspect that&#x27;s primarily because conventional political debate is strongly discouraged outside of the occasional thread not because it wouldn&#x27;t have been tried if it were possible.)<p>The problem with micro-targeting is that if you&#x27;re not in one of the target groups, <i>you don&#x27;t see the ads</i> - so unlike a TV campaign you&#x27;re not aware of what the other guy is saying unless you can contrive some real and&#x2F;or fake accounts that will get you an in.<p>And the propaganda techniques are both subtle and outrageous. (You might not think QAnon is subtle, but it&#x27;s <i>very</i> carefully designed.)<p>Trump significantly outspent Biden on social. But the Trump campaign never really ended, while Biden had to start relatively cold.<p>So for all these and other reasons you&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s not about money, it&#x27;s about narrative engineering implemented with money - and the right has always been much better at that than the left.')
