In my opinion, Snowden and Manning are traitors and the latter should have been left in prison.<p>&gt; Had a white male done this, it&#x27;s hard not to think he&#x27;d be praised as a hero on here.<p>I&#x27;d be equally dismissive of any person who committed the following actions.<p>1. Griping about the racist reviewers of her paper on Twitter.<p>2. Sending an email to a internal list criticizing Google&#x27;s behavior and telling people to stop working on diversity.<p>3. Demanding the names of reviewers and threatening to resign if they weren&#x27;t provided.')
