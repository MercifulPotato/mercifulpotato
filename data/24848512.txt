These days, you&#x27;ll always have &quot;Program Files&quot;, and if you have the OS configured for a different locale, it&#x27;ll create a hard link for the localized name. The Windows shell (including the standard file picker dialogs etc) will also use the localized name preferentially whenever it has to display a path that contains one of those folders, but still allows verbatim paths to be used wherever text input is allowed.')
