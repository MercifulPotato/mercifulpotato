Meanwhile, there are plenty other &quot;force multipliers&quot;, who are paid a pittance. Even a cleaner is a &quot;force multiplier&quot; - they enable people not dying from diseases coming from dirt - that&#x27;s much more in terms of multiplying output than we do (without cleaners, everybody dies and there&#x27;s zero profit).')
