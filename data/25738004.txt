We initially launched Brave Rewards (called &#x27;Payments&#x27; at the time) with Bitcoin. Unlike HODLers, Brave users only wanted to purchase $5 or $10 at a time. In 2017, network fees and congestion got so bad that users would see 90% fees, and still not know when their BTC would arrive.<p>We pivoted to the BAT, built on ERC-20. This relieved us from large fees and heavy network congestion, as well as enables us to do things like create a User Growth Pool (300M BAT) to drive growth. As an example, we recently sunsetted our referral program which generated more than $13M in rewards for publishers. Initially we had planned to stop the program after $1M had been distributed, but a healthy UGP enabled us to go much bigger.<p>There is no animus towards BTC today. In fact, for our verified creators (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creators.brave.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creators.brave.com</a>), we&#x27;ll even auto-convert your received BAT into BTC (or ETH).')
