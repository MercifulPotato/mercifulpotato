Your laptop is generally constrained by how much heat it can push through the heat sink. If you get &quot;lucky&quot; you have a CPU that can remain stable at lower voltages. So it&#x27;s effectively the same as an &quot;overclock&quot; because your laptop can turbo the core speed up for longer (or forever). Your laptop rarely runs at maximum turbo all day. It can only do that for a few hundred ms usually. It&#x27;ll basically just hold the clock speed at whatever it can before hitting some specific temp (85-95c). When you undervolt, the frequency that it can &quot;hold&quot; at that temp threshold is higher.')
