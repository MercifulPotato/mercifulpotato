Without that the Access to Data provisions is largely moot. Why would it occur to anybody to send access requests to some large market analytics company they&#x27;ve never heard of? Its beneficial in the narrow scope of cases where a data subject knowingly consents to a party that they are directly familiar with having their data (like Facebook), and they want to find out specifically what it is. But your average data subject is being tracked without consent by a myriad of companies they&#x27;ve never heard of, and all that data is aggregated and sold on by a myriad of other companies they&#x27;ve never heard of. Without informed consent, the GDPR falls incredibly far from even coming close to achieving it&#x27;s stated objectives, and that&#x27;s basically where it is today.<p>And as I said, for the companies that actually do have to worry about enforcement, it&#x27;s largely just incorporated into the cost of business.')
