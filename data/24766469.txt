Sometimes it is just about parking wealth and extra rent is gravy.  So if you are just parking, moving to the max rent possible can be a desirable effect.  As you may price people out and you do not have to have someone to &#x27;manage&#x27; that property as intensively (broke AC, leaky sink fix, etc).  Which would be an annoyance on a passive property.')
