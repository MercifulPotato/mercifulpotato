Of those bugs, only some will be executable in your configuration. Of that buggy code, only some will create security issues. Of those security issues, only some will be network-exploitable.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of partitioning.<p>So it&#x27;s fair to say systems run on other systems, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s likely that every system has an undiscovered, network accessible security vulnerability.')
