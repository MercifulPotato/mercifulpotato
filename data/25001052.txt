(Where does the <i>next</i> YouTube&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Facebook come from when the hurdle is they need to install lots of middle boxes to small, more siloed networks?) Not to mention the name &quot;internet&quot; itself comes from the global joining of a lot of individual networks. A re-balkanized &quot;internet&quot; with a lot of mostly disparate networks that don&#x27;t really talk directly to one another hardly deserves the name &quot;internet&quot; at that point. (From that perspective CGNAT is an attempt to murder the internet from the inside.)<p>&gt; the lower 64bits of the 128bit addresses doesn&#x27;t count (due to privacy)<p>That&#x27;s not how that works? For privacy a device is picking a 64-bit random number, sure, but that&#x27;s still 64-bits of random numbers for a lot of devices to roll before collisions. It&#x27;s not like it is just one device per lower 64-bits of address space. (Sure, maybe for &quot;privacy&quot; to avoid easy&#x2F;obvious port scanning you superstitiously avoid &quot;unlucky numbers&quot; like ::1 or ::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, but that&#x27;s still a lot more random numbers to roll than anything &quot;the lower 64bits doesn&#x27;t count&quot; implies.)<p>(ETA: And of course, that assumes you are using privacy-focused SLAAC. There&#x27;s still the power to micromanage a prefix with DHCPv6 and allocate every single one of those lower 64-bits if you really must.)')
