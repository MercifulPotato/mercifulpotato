We can get everything delivered to our homes instead of having to go to a store, walk around and pick it out ourselves. So much more happens purely online now, even something as simple as going to the corner store to rent a movie is a thing of the past.<p>All of these things used to add up to at least some physical exercise. Perhaps not ideal amounts, but it got people moving at least. Obviously this is not universal, a lot of people still do get their movement and fresh air, but my thinking is that it&#x27;s less than ever before, combined with access to high-calorie food that is also easier than ever before.<p>So in that sense, physical activity, or the lack of it, is the force multiplier in regards to one&#x27;s diet. I try to get at least 30 minutes of some sort of activity in every day, and preferably more. Just a walk outside or cleaning the apartment or doing a project. Most days I walk to the stores to shop, as a conscious choice to get my physical activity covered.')
