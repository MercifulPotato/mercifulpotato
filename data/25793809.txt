I just inserted a floppy disk and did A: then TP.EXE (which was just as arcane as knowing $PATH) but do I really want to work on Turbo Pascal in MS-DOS? Of course complexity skyrocketed!<p>That&#x27;s not a counterexample because beginners have contemporary expectations. There are simpler alternatives that just work. Why do beginners want to use Node.js locally then?<p>&gt; We do things the way we do things largely for historical reasons<p>Nobody challenged that. The question is: is the alternative better or just a different (but equally arcane) set of quirks?<p>If you&#x27;re not using $PATH you&#x27;d be using an analogue system to solve the same problem, and you&#x27;d lose portability with current OSes.<p>Sounds like NIH to me.')
