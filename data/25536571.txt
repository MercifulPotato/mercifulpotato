My 5S still receives the odd security update in iOS 12 from time to time (basically when something really big comes up).<p>If it would make sense, I&#x27;m pretty sure Apple could update the first iPhone still. And that would cover every iPhone 1 in existence. Android with its fragmentation makes that pretty much impossible.')
