Yes, there are contractors associated with each, and localized impact for service workers (now surely less.)<p>But I’m not sure that we can say tech is saving our economy right now.<p>Amazon requires people to buy to increase revenue, meaning they have to have spending power already. So they have to either use savings or have income.<p>Apple the same. Netflix too.<p>There needs to be more information that Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, etc. are employing more people than before — i.e. backstopping what would otherwise be a crashing economy.<p>When you look at their numbers, that’s not the case. They’re not seeing explosive growth during the pandemic, despite expectations to the contrary.<p>If we look to the stock market as a measure of economic strength — and we shouldn’t — it has been propped up by lowered interest rates.<p>With bond yields as low as they are, investors have to put their money _somewhere_ and stocks are the seemingly appropriate risk&#x2F;return for the moment. But that’s not a sign of a good economy. Quite the opposite.')
