I went in high school in Virginia, and I know smart people, that wanted to stay close to home, for family reasons, and they went to community college.   The mix of a community college is mix of very smart students, average folks, to straight up dummies....   but at least they have a second chance to perform well.<p>Some one that does well, in a community college, should be transfered into a  proper 4 year college.   I know a lot of state schools do this, but it should be more common&#x2F;normalized.<p>Plus community colleges tend to be much cheaper.')
