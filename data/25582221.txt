My little &quot;holiday&quot; project of these days is to work on a memo on corporate strategy that I intend to submit to John for review. Who knows, maybe an opportunity will arise from it.<p>After doing some work and some digging on Stripe (despite I knew the company quite well already), I completely agree that there&#x27;s still a ton of opportunities for them to expand.<p>It&#x27;s actually hard to select a single expansion opportunity, as there are too many to pick from. Well, as said, a nice holiday project.<p>p.s. if you&#x27;re willing to help me with some ideas, email me ($my_hn_name at gmail) and I&#x27;ll happily share the document with you, as long as you can promise to be nice and not share it elsewhere.<p>edit: not sure why the downvotes?')
