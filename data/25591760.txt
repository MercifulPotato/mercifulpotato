Looking at our top menu items again I can see how it looks for a new visitor.<p>* Product (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;defold.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;defold.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;</a>) lists engine features. This should probably be renamed Features.<p>* Showcase (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;defold.com&#x2F;showcase&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;defold.com&#x2F;showcase&#x2F;</a>) shows games made with Defold. It is not so much a showcase for specific engine features but rather a showcase of different kinds of games that has been made with Defold. Perhaps we should rename it to Games.<p>As a side-note regarding games: We will start posting developer case-studies in a few weeks. These case-studies will show both the games and the features of the engine as well as clever solutions to problems and how Defold has helped the creators while developing their games.')
