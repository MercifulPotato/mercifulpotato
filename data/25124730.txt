If you were to see my github page it is empty.  I personally find with most of my &#x27;side projects&#x27; are one off and sometimes I might pluck out a function or two out of something else but that is it.  They are like you said mostly static and never really revisited.<p>I wonder if a &#x27;rules of the road&#x27; sort of document in repos would help?  A sort of &#x27;here is what you can expect from the maintainer of this repo&#x27;.  I think some people end up taking on too much and then you find out some key bit of infrastructure is done by 1 guy in his spare time, and managing their own job.  Then others come along and expect you to fix it for them when you pretty much have abandoned the project.  For example many of my projects would be in a &#x27;AS-IS&#x27; category, if I made them public.  I am not going to really revisit a project from 6 years ago that did something specific I needed.  Not even if you show up with a nice pull request unless I am feeling particularly charitable that day.')
