They used copyright takedown requests across various platforms.  They never actually filed a DMCA complaint.<p>You could argue that those takedown requests only exist because of DMCA, but they <i>should</i> exist, regardless of the law.<p>The problem here wasn&#x27;t even that this company filed the takedown requests.  It&#x27;s that Youtube&#x2F;etc complied with them when they shouldn&#x27;t have.  And to make it worse, blamed the victim and refused.<p>That is, until Forbes got involved and made it higher profile, and then Youtube looked at all of it and realized the mistake.<p>There&#x27;s nothing here to indicate that this situation won&#x27;t continue to be the norm for takedown requests, though.  They haven&#x27;t apologized or said they&#x27;ll improve their processes.  They just swept it under the rug.')
