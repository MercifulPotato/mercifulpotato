In Bangladesh, we have strong norms in favor of marriage and strong taboos against divorce<p>The argument about shame based &quot;norms&quot; keeping people together aside, it was in many places, quite literally the law that forced women to stay with their husbands.<p>Up until the 70s and later, in many US states it was:<p>* Legal to rape your spouse<p>* Legal to restrict a woman&#x27;s access to contraceptives<p>* Illegal for a woman to abort an unwanted pregnancy, even due to rape or incest (the previous two combined with the first essentially stripping a women&#x27;s autonomy to decide when and how many children to have)<p>* Illegal for women to work in certain careers&#x2F;legal to discriminate on whether a woman was pregnant or had children<p>* Legal to prevent a woman from opening a bank account or line of credit without their husband&#x27;s consent<p>This was more the case in some places vs others, but talk to an older women in the US what the culture was like for women then. The women&#x27;s liberation movement happened in reaction to severe oppression and we absolutely should not consider reverting to a society before then.<p>EDIT: Yikes. I was curious about the norms in Bangladesh. I don&#x27;t think Bangladesh should be held as an example for anything related to marriage.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.girlsnotbrides.org&#x2F;child-marriage&#x2F;bangladesh&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.girlsnotbrides.org&#x2F;child-marriage&#x2F;bangladesh&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; 59% of girls in Bangladesh are married before their 18th birthday and 22% are married before the age of 15.<p>&gt; Bangladesh has the third highest prevalence of child marriage in the world, and the second highest absolute number of women married or in a union before the age of 18 globally â€“ 4,382,000.<p>&gt; 4% of boys are married before the age of 18.')
