I intend to fix this as soon as I can and have posted a question about it in the official Sciter forums here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciter.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;topic&#x2F;position-absolute-bottom-0-doesnt-update-on-scroll&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciter.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;topic&#x2F;position-absolute-bottom-0-d...</a><p>I would like to emphasize that this is my attempt at a clone but it&#x27;s not a port.  Since the original Clippy is written in React, a genuine port would utilize Sciter&#x27;s &quot;Reactor&quot;.')
