Cultivating an interest in electronic components through toy disassembly and repair (actually thinking about doing a video channel analyzing low end electronics for fun), no actual circuit design as yet. After achieving literacy and exposure to minecraft, currently having success with co-op puzzle platformers which require multi-step solutions to puzzles (<i>Putty Pals</i>, <i>Koala Kids</i>, <i>Ibb and Obb</i>, <i>Shift Happens</i>, etc.), <i>Crypt of the Necrodancer</i> (turn-based dance pad rhythm game requiring comprehension of algorithms), a short JRPG (<i>A Short Hike</i>) and in terms of actual programming a Steam robot programming game called <i>SMIB</i>. Lots of board games, currently <i>Puerto Rico</i> (&quot;Age: 13+&quot;). Also recommend <i>Sleeping Queens</i> (card game requiring creative deployment of simple equations). Endgame: <i>Shenzhen IO</i>.')
