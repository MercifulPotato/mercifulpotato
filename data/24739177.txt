The US regulatory structure is extremely friendly to small businesses.<p>Small businesses are rare because the government has abdicated its antitrust responsibilities, ignoring companies that use anticompetitive practices like labor violations and price fixing that lock competitors out of the market.<p>Small businesses are also rare because of zoning codes and infrastructure policies that promote the use of cars. It used to be that commercial spaces and housing were evenly mixed, now businesses often need to be a mile or more away from anywhere people live, thus needing to be able to support very large customer bases, and the locations need enough land to fit empty parking lots big enough to support double or triple the actual capacity of the building itself, creating enormous artificial up-front capital costs for business ownership.')
