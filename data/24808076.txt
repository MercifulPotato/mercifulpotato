When my partner and I had our first child we talked about children&#x27;s books (and TV shows) that were formative for us when children. I was completely shocked that she had never heard of pippi (I&#x27;m German she is French), because to me Pippi is probably one of the most famous children&#x27;s characters of all times in many languages.<p>She then did some research why pippi wasn&#x27;t know in France, turns out they thought it was too subversive and anti-authoritarian so only brought out a very censored translation in French which cut out pretty much all Pippis main character traits and unsurprisingly flopped. It was only in the mid-90s that they published a new faithful translation (by that time my partner had long outgrown children&#x27;s books).')
