Upthread you compared Chrome to &quot;all popular web browsers [which] had a user interface for installing client side HTTPS certificates for user authentication&quot;. I just opened up Firefox, and found a very similar menu to Chrome&#x27;s: the only option was to &quot;import&quot; a cert from the filesystem. I agree that we should expect more from our tools, but has any popular browser ever allowed the user to generate a new cert? If one were to do so, how would the generated cert be connected to PKI -- who would sign the cert and how would they do that?')
