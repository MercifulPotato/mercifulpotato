Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605118219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060452, text='I tend to have a pretty good supply of things like TP, cleaning supplies, and standard dry staples like rice, in the house. I have the space and it&#x27;s cheaper&#x2F;easier to buy relatively large sizes. When things started to get a bit crazy, I stocked more in than usual (including some meats etc. for the freezer). And filled up a big water container.<p>But, really, my &quot;prepping&quot; was mostly around avoiding stores as much as possible and being able to handle broken supply chains and potential short-term disruption to utilities. I was actually without power for a couple days in June but that was because of a wind storm.')
