So that second article correctly matches 9-figure with $100M. This tells me that the first article just has a typo, not that there&#x27;s some sort of 1&#x2F;1000 conversion factor for salaries. I have a hard time believing in a 1&#x2F;1000 conversion factor for salaries without some source clearly explaining that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;biggest-deals-netflix-hbo-jj-abrams-shonda-rhimes-ryan-murphy-2019-11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;biggest-deals-netflix-hbo-jj...</a>')
