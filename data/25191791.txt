That means if you&#x27;re a heavy downloader, you should seriously consider switching to DSL.<p>What I find especially galling is that the first 1.2TB costs half as much ($10 per 100GB, assuming a $120 monthly bill) than the subsequent data, even ignoring the fixed cost of the connection. I think if they merely charged a fair decreasing rate for usage, rather than trying to price gouge heavy users, they wouldn&#x27;t be seen as such villains.<p>Alas, muni fiber for the win. Gigabit symmetric and forget about it.')
