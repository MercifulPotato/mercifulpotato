I&#x27;ve produced well over 100 projects, and have had some very huge wins. I have an absurd work ethic.<p>In my small peer group, people constantly talk about &quot;youre smartest person I know&quot; and this makes me somewhat cringe on the inside, because in my mind.. the people who _I_ consider are actual geniuses, who have such an insane otherworldly level of learning ability, math ability, talent, programming ability (ie like John Carmack).<p>So, I constantly am called smart, smartest, etc, yet in my own head I often feel incredibly dumb because of the people who I look up to, and don&#x27;t even remotely hold a candle to. It feels like being stuck in a sort of no man&#x27;s land... where I have enough IQ to realize how little IQ I have.<p>I always feel like certain subjects often lie JUST outside my mental grasp and I must spend considerable effort to visualize it before I can understand it. For example, I&#x27;m starting to build an algorithm for trading and it involves bayesian statistics, and calculus, linear algebra, with a dash of machine learning. All things which have long been forgotten. I spent about 60-70 hours over a few days re-learning a lot, and making huge strides in understanding, feeling pretty good I just got such a huge chunk of learning done quickly, and then I go on youtube videos of math geniuses who probably accomplished what I did effortlessly in the blink of an eye.<p>I suppose I have no other question, other than does anyone else feel like this? It really kind of sucks, as I do highly value intelligence, and it would be different if I weren&#x27;t 1&#x2F;4 or 1&#x2F;2 of the way there.')
