The feed conversion ration on chickens is 1.6: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feed_conversion_ratio#Poultry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feed_conversion_ratio#Poultry</a> â€“ that&#x27;s incredible to consider, 1.6 pounds of feed turns into 1 pound of chicken!<p>Chickens don&#x27;t just produce meat, they are self-contained meat growing machines with components to support that growth, including the ability to extract and filter nutrients from food with limited processing, a built-in enclosure for the process with self-healing abilities, a control system to deliver nutrients periodically and maintain system temperature, control systems to create a balance of nutrients at the cellular level, resilient systems to deliver those nutrients, and on and on.<p>No lab will be as efficient in making chicken meat as a chicken is. And it&#x27;s not because God got it right the first time around: chickens are human products, but a chicken is product that leverages all of the resilience, complexity, and power of a full organism.<p>(There are ethical questions about factory farming... but it should be noted that those are not environmental questions.)')
