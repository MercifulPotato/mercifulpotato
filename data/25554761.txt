We still use Roman roads and aqueducts, our cities are built on Roman settlements and follow the same structure, Roman law is a course and matter of examination at law university.<p>My &quot;real Roman&quot; friends can trace back their family roots to Roman people and have Roman family names (Fabi, Crescenzi, Emiliano, Lattanzi etc.)<p>Also we should not forget that Christians took a lot from the Hebrew tradition (angels in the old testament were inspired to mythological Egyptian or Mesopotamian creatures) and you can find testimony of their original form here, for example this Tetramorphous as Ezekiel described it, can be found at Anagni, a small city outside Rome. AFAIK there aren&#x27;t many other places in the west where you can find them.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lundici.it&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;Cattedrale-di-Anagni.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lundici.it&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;Cattedrale-...</a><p>So, in a way, we are more connected to our past history than ever.')
