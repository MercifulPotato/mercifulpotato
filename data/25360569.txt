The stability of Debian tooling for large-scale, hyper scaleable solutions is outstanding. I just feel like the world balks at me every time I do something considered slightly &quot;old fashioned&quot; completely ignoring the finished product to shame me for not using buzz-word tooling.<p>Containerization is fantastic don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I&#x27;ve had more success with old-school approaches to package management, deployment, optimization, debugging, etc. running thin Debian servers. Just... prod ops is easier and more stable at the end of the day. I really don&#x27;t see the need to containerize everything outside of cross-platform development tooling. I also really prefer having a semblance of an OS&#x2F;bash terminal when it comes to ops!<p>Also: this is purely anecdotal. And, to get ahead of the folks yelling &quot;you just don&#x27;t understand Docker and K8s&quot; - yes I do. I still think they&#x27;re great, I just am not fully sold on them for every use-case.')
