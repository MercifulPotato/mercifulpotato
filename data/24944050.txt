There is some subjectivity here of course, but I occasionally replay games from when I was in college or even elementary school (hello Apple II, Atari and Nintendo). The graphics and limitations are clear, but within those constraints it’s hard to say games have improved that much.<p>For all the advances in the tech we’ve had I don’t believe we’ve seen equivalent gains in actual gaming experience.')
