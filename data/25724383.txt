The applications are much too numerous in many different fields of science and engineering. &quot;Graph partition&quot; problems generally search for ways to separate a graph into subgraphs such that some measure is optimized. E.g. resilience of network connections, immunizations, some error correction algorithms, optimizing flow of stuff through nodes, logistics. This list probably barely scratches the surface.<p>Edit: my comment sounds a bit rude on second read. My apologies, it is the limitations of this medium.')
