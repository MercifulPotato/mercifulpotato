To invoke it, you assume (even if arguendo) that the copying <i>did take place</i>. Fair Use is a legal justification of the copying, not an argument that copying did take place.<p>So, pointing out that copying took place and spiking the football as if that&#x27;s the end of the conversation is nonsensical if you&#x27;re arguing against a Fair Use defense.')
