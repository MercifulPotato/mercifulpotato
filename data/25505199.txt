This is handy because you don&#x27;t need an HDMI capture card!  The only problem I have now is I need an A&#x2F;C adapter for my camera, as the battery only lasts about 1.5 hours.<p>I found that using my standard zoom lens is fine, the 50mm portrait lens looks better for pictures but that is overkill for a Zoom meeting!  Any DSLR camera will blow a webcam out of the water even in low lighting.')
