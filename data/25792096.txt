Item(by='stonesweep', descendants=None, kids=[25792570], score=None, time=1610725141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789895, text='I&#x27;ll add a +1 to pCloud (pcloud.com) - SyncThing doesn&#x27;t fit my use case (I have no &quot;one device to hold everything&quot;, it&#x27;s all disparate laptops&#x2F;phones) and I wanted a centralized location to store my encrypted backups and files and stuff.<p>My requirements were integration with rclone and FolderSync (android app) to work natively with their APIs and it works like written on the tin. I was able to use rclone on a cloud server to transfer data out of Google Cloud (rclone can act as a local proxy to copy between services) and I&#x27;m able to use FolderSync on my mobile to keep it backed up.<p>The pCloud branded mobile app is OK (nothing great), the webapp works well (again, just sort of works) and so far I&#x27;ve found no real problems with it - no failed syncs, my backups are backing up nicely, it just sort of works without fanfare.')
