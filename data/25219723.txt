I’d venture that most spammers already have higher end machines than end-users to solve existing captchas.<p>I’d probably approach this with a different strategy. I’d send an encrypted time stamp as the nonce. On the client, I’d first do a few easy PoW tasks and estimate the PoW difficulty for the given machine that would take at least X seconds to do. Then, send the PoW, the encrypted time stamp, and difficulty to the backend. If it’s been shorter than X (with a margin of error), or the PoW is wrong, it’s not valid.<p>In this scheme, it doesn’t matter how powerful the device is, a core is going to do some work for X seconds or at least be throttled by time.')
