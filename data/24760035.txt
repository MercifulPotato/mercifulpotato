When I said &quot;implement a hash function&quot;, I actually meant &quot;implement exclusive-or with the result of the hash function&quot; or something similar.<p>&gt; As well, cryptographic hash functions are generally not [invertible] anyway.<p>Good point.  But aren&#x27;t there one-to-one equivalents, called one-way functions, trapdoor functions or something like that?  My cryptography is even rustier.')
