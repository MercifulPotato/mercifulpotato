You can do either, or both of:<p>1) Block existing ads (like any other ad blocker)<p>2) Opt in to Brave ads (which are served via system notifications).<p>If you opt in, you can get &quot;paid&quot; in BAT. You can cash this out (from an exchange) or donate them to the sites you visit.<p>Realistically, it will never be an amount worth cashing out, so I suspect most people donate it to the sites and content creators they like. Thats what I do anyways.')
