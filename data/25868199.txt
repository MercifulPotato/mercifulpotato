That&#x27;s the key difference between an MFD and a touchscreen. The touchbar is a one-dimensional touchscreen, with all of its downsides.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that displays on the buttons themselves are bad. But we pay way too little attention to the ergonomics of fine motor control and tactile&#x2F;muscle memory. If you look at the article linked in this post, the key point being made is how hard it is to hunt for a featureless touchscreen button while your wrist is in the air being jostled around by turbulence. An MFD with a wrist rest, uneven button spacing&#x2F;sizing&#x2F;tactile patterns, button LEDs to color-code functions in addition to on-screen labels, would be superior to the touchbar. Actually, the numpad on &quot;full-size&quot; keyboards is tantalizingly close to that in some ways - it would be great if someone took a full-size keyboard and replaced the numpad with something that sort of looks like it but is functionally an MFD.<p>By the way, all keyboards already have tactile pattern aids - the little bumps on the F and J keys that let your fingers quickly recognize whether they&#x27;re correctly positioned on the home row. Everyone knows that, but it&#x27;s just a glimpse of what&#x27;s possible if we invest more in tactile interface aids.')
