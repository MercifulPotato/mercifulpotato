It&#x27;s easy for legitimate apps to suddenly start recording on laptops&#x2F;desktops when you&#x27;re not expecting it.<p>One example is when you&#x27;re waiting for a video conference to begin, you don&#x27;t want the camera to suddenly turn on when you&#x27;re not ready for it.<p>I like there to be an explicit action before I allow recording. For smartphones there&#x27;s a permission model where I have the ability to explicitly grant permission every time an app wants to turn on the camera.<p>However such a stringent permission model doesn&#x27;t exist on desktops&#x2F;laptops, so a slider is a simple low-tech solution to the absence of a sufficient software permission model.')
