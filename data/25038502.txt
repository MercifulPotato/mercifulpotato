It&#x27;s full of porn. Email isn&#x27;t as warm as a hand-written letter. Communicating online isn&#x27;t professional. Etc.<p>Guess what, all those things were true but they turned out not to matter. You can do whatever else you want in a network that also carries porn. You learn to dodge fraud. Email is freaking convenient once everybody is using it, standards of behavior change, etc.<p>Cryptocurrency may be something or it may not. It&#x27;s in very early stages. Even those who are interested have trouble following everything that is happening. But it&#x27;s not even Internet-in-the-90s. It&#x27;s Internet-in-the-70s. You can be skeptical about it, you can ignore it, but I don&#x27;t see why someone would spend so much of their time being opposed to it.')
