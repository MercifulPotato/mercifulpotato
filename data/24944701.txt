I&#x27;ve never thought about it or seen that taken into account (its not something we fit to when constraining cosmology)<p>I just looked around and LIGO has constrained Omega_GW &lt; 1e-7 (they find no evidence, but that is the limit of their sensitivity). This is at least an order of magnitude smaller than Omega_Radiation and so will have a negligible effect on cosmology&#x2F;total energy content.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1612.02029.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1612.02029.pdf</a>')
