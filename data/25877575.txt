Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25877631], score=None, time=1611357606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877407, text='<i>&gt;&gt; The important point is not necessarily the mechanism, but rather the intent and a good-faith effective effort to keep things fair and underpinned by public-good policy objectives.</i><p><i>&gt; Regulatory bureaucracies, especially in the United States because of our political and legal norms, can&#x27;t be expected to police intent and good-faith.</i><p>Someone should tell the FTC and SEC ;-)<p>BTW, I generally agree with the rest of your post. But it&#x27;s really not that hard to imagine a world where ISPs are mostly municipal departments or non-government organizations that aren&#x27;t profit-motivated and generally 99.9% of the time act in good faith. Like, IDK. Look at HAM radio or most gov-run community centers or lots of open source projects or 100s of other examples. It&#x27;s possible for non-profit-motive to produce good outcomes.<p>And in that world where ISPs are just these little pieces of local and regional bureaucracy -- like the county community center or public works departments -- you can imagine all sorts of reasons why a net neutrality rule isn&#x27;t necessary, and where isolated violations of net neutrality effectively achieve this or that goal. Eg a city with limited upstream bandwidth blocking Netflix during the day so that it can offer free broadband to every student during a pandemic without increasing any expenses or laying any new fiber.<p>I think the extreme pessimism about the possibility of non-market-actors actually doing things competently is mostly manufactured bullshit, and manufactured by the exact people you&#x27;re complaining about.')
