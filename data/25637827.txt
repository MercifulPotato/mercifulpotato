I would think it sounds like inviting the vampire in (legal, HR, etc) without board representation of workers &#x2F; codetermination similar to the German system. In America&#x27;s way of doing things, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good. Would not look forward to &quot;You have appropriate amount of non-union experience but you are 10th in line so we&#x27;ll be calling you in 12 months, if we do.&quot; A theoretical for tech, not so for film unions which are being excitedly pointed to as good. It can take a very long time to get work under these schemes, which seems incompatible with how tech has worked.')
