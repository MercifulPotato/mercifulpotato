Item(by='_Nat_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608745777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519812, text='&gt; I think this is very different from the advising process in graduate school.<p>All of that sounds normal to me.  Including filtering out trade-secrets, which is completely normal when working with trade-secrets in grad school too.  Additionally, it&#x27;s completely normal to filter out intellectual property you might plan to patent; confidential information; proprietary industrial information; information protected by law; dangerous findings (e.g., hackers often omit details of an exploit until the relevant vendor has had time to fix); and a few other categories.<p>Maintaining a positive, constructive tone is also completely normal.  For example, failed experiments are typically described as progressive steps toward an ultimate success; unforeseen problems are discoveries; and major issues are seen as research challenges to be overcome.  Or, ya know, stuff like that.<p>I mean, is that all this story&#x27;s about?  Because if that&#x27;s it, then it seems like nothing substantial.  But if that&#x27;s the case, why is this in the news?')
