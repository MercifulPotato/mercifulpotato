I suppose you could argue if everyone suddenly became aware of the causes of problems (such as world hunger, climate change, wealth inequality, wars, propaganda, etc.) then we could just easily solve them, by just not doing the thing. But this is such a naive and childish concept, the world is doomed in a much more permanent, irreversible way. If everyone were to think hard about the world, they would still come to vastly different, diametrically opposed conclusions. Pascal believed that everyone would believe in (his particular version of) god if people only sat alone in a room for once and thought about it.<p>He also thought that we ought to believe in (his particular version of) god since we have everything to gain and nothing to loose. The logical counter argument of which particular god we are supposed to chose to worship on the off chance they are the real thing, is not something Pascal even could contemplate rationally about:<p>&gt; As far as Pascal is concerned, the demise of the pagan religions of antiquity speaks for itself. Those pagan religions which still exist in the New World, in India, and in Africa are not even worth a second glance. They are obviously the work of superstition and ignorance and have nothing in them which might interest &#x27;les gens habiles&#x27; (&#x27;clever men&#x27;)<p>So yes, indeed you could solve all problems if you just label everyone opposed to your views as subhumans, conquered and culturally&#x2F;religiously cleansed them from the earth.<p>Just so people understand where this guy is coming from.')
