Item(by='elcritch', descendants=None, kids=[24793728], score=None, time=1602788064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791529, text='Thanks! I was hoping it&#x27;d coincide enough but was probably too late. Maybe I&#x27;ll do a write up article later and compare C&#x2F;Nim&#x2F;CircuitPython. It&#x27;s amazing what even basic maps&#x2F;tables with generics provide. No more `void <i></i>` blackholes.<p>That said, `Nesper` is basically stable. It&#x27;d be nice to make prettier Nim-first API wrappers. It&#x27;s stable enough that I&#x27;m planning on shipping product out next couple of weeks with it.<p>P.S. all of the Nim runtime and a simple async http server only adds about 80kB vs the standard `smart_config` esp wifi example! Not sure even Rust matches that.<p>I&#x27;m curious, are you working on embedded devices for side projects or for work?')
