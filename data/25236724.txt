You aren&#x27;t a doctor, and have no way to judge anyone else&#x27;s fitness to prescribe or perform treatments on you, but they have a diploma that you are assured by everyone you ever met that those are hard to get, especially if you look one level deeper and look at the school name rather than just the fact of a diploma at all.<p>If you can be useless and still get the cert, then the cert is not only of no positive value, it is of actively negative value, at least in the macro scale for everyone as a whole.<p>It can obviously be of positive value to an individual as a game move within a disfunctional game.<p>But that just comes at the expense of everyone else, like capitolizing on some tax loophole or something instead of seeking to close it.')
