I don&#x27;t like &quot;pure&quot; REST, where POST, PATCH, and PUT statements are submitted as XML and&#x2F;or JSON.<p>I tend to do what I term &quot;REST-like,&quot; sort of the way most APIs seem to do, these days, where the sending methods are done similar to standard URI GET&#x2F;POST stuff (URI arguments).<p>I tend to have responses come back as both JSON and XML, with a translator between them. XML is useful, because I can publish a schema, but otherwise, I prefer JSON.<p>But REST-like is quite simple. I don&#x27;t need to bring in any dependencies to provide the API, so it&#x27;s fast and lightweight.<p>But then, I have fairly humble servers. I suspect that GraphQL would be something I&#x27;d want for more ambitious servers.')
