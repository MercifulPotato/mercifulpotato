The only one who has is following its recommendations and is well on his way to being a millionaire as a young man.<p>&gt; I contest the term<p>That&#x27;s pretty much denying that people have free will. For example, the public schools teach people to read. I recommend the book. The book is available for free. They don&#x27;t read it. That&#x27;s <i>their</i> choice, not fate.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m old. I&#x27;ve noticed a common correlation between peoples&#x27; attitudes and their wealth over the years. The ones who believe they are hapless victims of fate, never manage to get anywhere. The ones who see themselves as having choices are very likely to accumulate wealth.<p>You are who you <i>choose</i> to be.')
