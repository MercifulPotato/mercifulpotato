Instead, all users are subject to the same EULA and TOS, and likewise, are judged in terms of the content they post, not their political leanings. If you owned a website that allowed public postings, would you ever consider yourself obligated to protect a member of the government&#x27;s speech in a way you do not for a normal user?<p>Also, you can hardly call it a MITM attack when they are specifically announcing their policy. Your usage of that term implies an underhanded policy designed to hide their intentions and actions. This is clearly not the case.')
