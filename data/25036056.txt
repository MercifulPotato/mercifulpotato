Having top level protection vaccine with 2 shots is of course great and may be what you would be aiming for in &quot;normal&quot; times, but when it&#x27;s race against the time trading several efficiency percents for quicker population coverage may be worth it.\nYep, J&amp;J one is the only candidate requiring one shot. Hopefully it will show some good results soon as well.')
