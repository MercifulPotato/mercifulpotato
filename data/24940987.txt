People agree or go somewhere else. Its how they are applied. Having hacked material not allowed would be totally fine but you cant allow it once and then block it another time. Either is against the rules or not. And before creating such a rule there would need to be serious effort to figure out how to enforce it fair and if that&#x27;s not possible the rule should never even be set up. This no hacked content rule for example was nonsense form the beginning. You would need to block everything instantly or at first report because you simply cant know if its hacked content. And it puts twitter in the position to judge if something is in fact hacked content or not. And by the time they decide its already all over the internet anyway because the Streisand effect is real. Its just a useless rule with no concept to implement but it opens doors to suppress something from becoming a trending topic.')
