That&#x27;s the one reason that to me, it feels disingenuous. When even the smallest thing is &quot;really amazing&quot;, everything is &quot;really amazing&quot;. Result being, whatever that person says has very little worth except when something is clearly detrimental.<p>That alone would be manageable. Yet, this behavior is often expected from others too, which creates an environment that, at least to me, is incredibly suffocating. What&#x27;s worse, such an environment caused two problems for me:<p>First, by upping the average of &quot;relatively perceived as positive&quot;, objectively neutral people are perceived as negative. I&#x27;ve actually had colleagues go into emotional distress and vent to me over this.<p>Second, it at least <i>seems</i> like overly positive environments are afraid of criticism and critical people. As a critical person myself, it has been incredibly difficult to navigate such an environment and it lead to me essentially becoming an assembly line worker who &quot;just shuts up and does their job&quot;. Also anecdotal, without critical people, going into the wrong direction either ends up being corrected very slowly, or not at all (and given how multi-dimensional work tends to be, going into the wrong or nowhere-near-optimal direction is very likely).<p>As a result, to me, no feedback at all is only slightly worse than overly frequent, overly positive feedback.')
