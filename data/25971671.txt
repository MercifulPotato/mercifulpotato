I wonder whether there&#x27;d be interesting new database applications on NVMe when doing as small as 512 byte I&#x2F;Os (with more efficient &quot;IO engine&quot; than Linux bio, that has too high CPU overhead with such small requests).<p>I mean, currently OLTP RDBMS engines tend to use 4k, 8k (and some) 16k block size and when doing completely random I&#x2F;O (or, say traversing an index on customer_id that now needs to read random occasional customer orders across years of history). So you may end up reading 1000 x 8 kB blocks just to read 1000 x 100B order records &quot;randomly&quot; scattered across the table from inserts done over the years.<p>Optane persistent memory can do small, cache line sized I&#x2F;O I understand, but that&#x27;s a different topic. When being able to do random 512B I&#x2F;O on &quot;commodity&quot; NVMe SSDs efficiently, this would open some interesting opportunities for retrieving records that are scattered &quot;randomly&quot; across the disks.<p>edit: to answer your question, I used 10 separate fio commands with numjobs=3 or 4 for each and randrepeat was set to default.')
