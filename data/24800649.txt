Some people need a real kick in the ass to consider anything outside the fragile walls they&#x27;ve built around themself. I hear stories like this from time to time, and the subjects always attribute the change to a specific substance, encounter, event, person, or experience. The trigger is irrelevant; they were just wound-up too tight and something released the pressure. Great, I&#x27;m glad they got some relief and finally managed to ditch all their baggage. This can turn into a real problem, though, when they misattribute the experience and start evangelizing for all the wrong reasons. I see this in particular with LSD; people run around encouraging others to do it, when it&#x27;s really not life-changing for most people, and can lead to psychological harm in some. You see the same thing with religious zealots, self-help addicts, and many other situations. Just because one person coincidentally had some kind of breakthrough associated with a drug or experience doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s going to help others. Most of us weren&#x27;t living a lie in the first place.')
