Wouldn&#x27;t this create a competitive advantage to the larger network ?<p>Also, it seems awfully similar to the treatment for cellular communication providers. What are the differences here ? Or would Verizon&#x2F;ATT be rolled into this since the statute just mentions large communications provider ?')
