We tend to speak louder than necessary during such calls and to overdo our &quot;performance&quot; because we feel we have to compensate for missing channels such as the full range of gestures, body posture, and facial expressions.<p>Here are a few general tips for speaking in (semi-)public settings (not just when on Zoom calls):<p>- Slow down.<p>- Lower your speaking voice. There are exercises for finding your natural speaking pitch.<p>- Smile (just a little, no creepy Joker grin ;-) ).<p>- Focus on your diaphragm rather than your throat for putting emphasis on words or syllables. This admittedly takes some getting used to.')
