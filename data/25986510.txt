I had a genuine pleasure reading the spec: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;specification.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;specification.html</a><p>I&#x27;ve entertained an idea to build a set of tools for contemporary development (version control, code review, CI, etc) which would only speak Gemini. That would be both the UI and the API.<p>Blockers came fast:<p>* no way to upload anything that exceeds 1024 bytes,<p>* escaping is subtly broken and so it would be impossible to review code written in Python or Markdown (triple quotes)<p>* No text editing capabilities, pretty much.<p>Which is fine: Gemini is great because it&#x27;s restricted. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to abuse. It will find its users, even if it would not be me.')
