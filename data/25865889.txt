Personally speaking, my experience with Xcode has been just <i>ok</i> (not amazing) while IntelliJ based IDEs have been clunky and arcane, with some of their &quot;smarts&quot; functioning in ways that aren&#x27;t expected or intuitive at all. Both are functional if you let me pick which to spend a work day in, it&#x27;d probably be Xcode.<p>What one is first exposed to and how they&#x27;re exposed to it probably makes a big difference.')
