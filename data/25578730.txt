The recent push for FPTP really strikes me as the kind of wonk stuff that people bend themselves around as a huge fix, when the reality is it empirically doesn&#x27;t do what people thinks it should do, and comes with it&#x27;s own problems.  It&#x27;s a lot of wasted political capital for very little if no benefit.')
