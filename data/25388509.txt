After all, Linux doesn&#x27;t need a license but without extensive documentation and support from Apple it&#x27;s like saying you&#x27;re free to challenge your boss openly, it&#x27;s <i>pedantically</i> true, but it is impossibly impractical for most.<p>Unless Apple provides extensible documentation for 3rd party drivers to be developed for their SoCs it&#x27;s just cheap talk from their side.')
