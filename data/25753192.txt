Instances of speech that are forbidden are generally not considered political speech, even if there are political issues involved. For example, if I threaten the President because of his policies, there is obviously a political angle to that, but it is also a fairly uncontroversial felony.<p>For a concrete example of nominally political threatening speech that was found not to be protected, see Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists, where it was found that certain anti-abortion ads were not protected by the First Amendment because they reasonably caused the targeted doctors to fear for their safety. I don&#x27;t believe they explicitly invoked the &quot;fighting words&quot; doctrine, but it relied on the same principle as Chaplinsky â€” that if speech has the effect of creating a real-life threat, the speech isn&#x27;t necessarily protected by the First Amendment.<p>(To be clear, the point wasn&#x27;t that Chaplinsky is the be-all-end-all, just that the concept of &quot;hate speech,&quot; where the consequences of some speech make it unworthy of free speech protections, is not a recent invention.)')
