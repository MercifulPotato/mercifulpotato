A tremendous amount of the complexity of lens design - and hence the size of the lens and quality of the output - is in the need to flatten the image across the recording medium without creating excessive distortion. Seeing it in terms of a sales of is the kind of garbage hot take I&#x27;d expect from people knowing nothing about photography.<p>As far as using legacy glass: Sony don&#x27;t have medium format glass. At all. They&#x27;ve never built a medium format camera under their own name, and Minolta last made medium format in the 60s. Again, the grandparent hot take, and the upvotes, are coming from people who know zero about photography.<p>Either Sony are going to get into the medium format market for the first time (which seems unlikely to me, but you never know), or this is a sensor design for one or more of their MF customers (i.e. all the remaining medium format manufacturers - Hassleblad, Phase One, Pentax, and Fujifilm). I&#x27;d expect that if it&#x27;s the latter there will either be adapters, or electronic compensation.')
