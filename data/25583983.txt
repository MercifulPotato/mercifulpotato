But it seems that even a &quot;well argumented&quot; idea can get very little traction unless the circumstances are right, i.e. your interlocutor doesn&#x27;t care much about the topic. There was some study about this a little bit ago, where pointing out problems with an erroneous but established &quot;fact&quot; just caused people to dig further into their position, even <i>after</i> the &quot;fact&quot; their position was supposedly based on was proved to be completely and irredeemably false.<p>This is the problem with letting idiots and hucksters push out garbage &quot;facts&quot; - they build communities that are uninterested in counter-arguments. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if the &quot;facts&quot; are somehow eventually refuted, because the attitudes informed by them have already hardened. And, the only way I can think of to prevent those idiots and hucksters from being so effective is to introduce some kind of social restraint - thus, shame.')
