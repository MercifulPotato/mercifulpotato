I&#x27;ve been trying to see the other dimensions but have been coming up increasingly short. For example when he&#x27;s asked about his Covid response - he always comes back to talking about banning travel from China. It seems the only way he knows how to make policy is to claim some group is responsible for the problem, and exclude them. The concept of attacking the details of problem itself is beyond him.<p>So the deeper problem isn&#x27;t merely that Trump has racist tendencies, but rather than it&#x27;s the only lens through which he sees the world. In his mind, every problem is due to bad people disrupting things for good people. Stop the bad people and things will be good. But the world is much more complex than that.<p>I do get if you&#x27;re still hanging your hat on his China policies, then it&#x27;s possible to agree with his approach without being personally racist. Although those policies also reek of the simple minded thinking of racism - tariffs to keep out bad Chinese goods, don&#x27;t care about Hong Kong because it&#x27;s Chinese, blaming Chinese apps specifically rather than data collection in general - and they will all be long term strategic failures that miss the forest for the trees.<p>&gt; <i>I don&#x27;t like the manner in which he&#x27;s done this, but I am very displeased with the way this pandemic has been marketed (for many reasons), so I am &quot;ok&quot; with his buffoon-like performance.</i><p>If it were just the way he communicated I would get over it. But the real problem is the rejection of experts. He basically kneecapped the entire federal response, for which we&#x27;ve been paying a large amount of taxes, in favor of letting Covid spread unchecked. He&#x27;s the leader and his job is to lead <i>everyone</i> - the &quot;both sides&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t hold water. The standard politician thing would have simply been to defer to the experts and make sure he himself couldn&#x27;t be blamed. This culture is itself suboptimal, but would have produced much better results than what we got.<p>If he had deferred to any experts, Trump could have easily gotten the wartime president boost rather than presiding over a needless disaster. And the lack of PPE would have directly tied into his call for domestic production, but instead crickets. If he were anything besides an empty suit, he would have wised up by now.')
