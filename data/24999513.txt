Multiple paths to a single node is verboten for single ownership. Note that DAGs may still be useful in single-ownership languages: recursive traversal will never touch a visited node, so if you exclusively borrow the whole graph, then you can safely exclusively borrow any node you traverse (which you couldn’t do if the graph was cyclic; in Rust terms, you’d have to check it at runtime).')
