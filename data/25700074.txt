But I also want to add that as a freelance developer, I&#x27;ve done quite a number of medium sized projects for business use cases in Haskell singlehandedly. Empirically, the results were very low in bugs and remain at use at the companies in question without requiring much maintenance.<p>So this kind of thing is something that is well served by Haskell, in my opinion. I wouldn&#x27;t seriously recommend someone else that the best path to doing this kind of work is to go and learn Haskell but I also feel this is something I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do as well using many other more popular languages.')
