Perhaps unsurprisingly, they don’t end up with higher average incomes than their peers with light personalities.<p>&gt;The key factor here seems to be empathy: the capacity to resonate with – and understand the perspective of – the emotional experiences of others. Individuals with light personality traits show a great deal of empathy for others, while those with dark personality traits tend to show very little. In our new research, we found that this seems to be what leads to a more satisfying life. Similarly, being prosocial – acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others – is also significantly linked with higher wellbeing.<p>Maybe the comparison between &quot;dark traits&quot; and &quot;light personalities&quot; yields this, but its been shown pretty consistently that higher agreeableness (more empathy) has a negative effect on salary, primarily for women. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;41343711?seq=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;41343711?seq=1</a><p>Also, the framing of this article between essentially low agreeableness and high agreeableness as dark and light is awful. There are advantages and disadvantages to being high or low in this trait, and the framing that being high in it is what&#x27;s more desirable makes me doubt how seriously whoever wrote this takes their work.')
