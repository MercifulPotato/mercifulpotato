On further visualization the plasma seems to just form a 4D sphere that rotates and translates in 6 dimensions. The flatness of the 2 &quot;missing&quot; dimensions corresponds to the quality of the focus and synchronization of the system, so they are not going to ever be completely missing.<p>The focus is like what you&#x27;d get if you were looking at slices of a solid ball. You&#x27;d see a point grow into a large circle, then shrink again to a point. It&#x27;s basically the view on the left side of the simulation on my website.<p>The right side of the simulation video shows a different cross section. The x axis there is the one dimension of the 4D sphere that stays in 3 space.')
