But I also have a cheap Android phone, and even though I&#x27;m not using it very often I find it more consistent&#x2F;intuitive than iOS, mostly for two reasons:<p>One is iOS&#x27;s arbitrary separation of settings and other app functionality. It makes no sense. I&#x27;ll never remember what goes where.<p>Secondly, Android&#x27;s back button is simple. I can use it without thinking even though you can probably find a lot of inconsistencies in its behaviour. iOS has multiple inconsistent one-off solutions for going back that cause a lot more mental friction.')
