So now I&#x27;m gauging if that statement still holds when the situation doesn&#x27;t cut across political lines...i.e. why is no one saying &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, go build your own Google&#x2F;Robinhood&quot;.<p>I think the answer is that since it&#x27;s no longer a partisan-political issue, HN wants to treat the situation differently and forget what they said over the past few weeks.')
