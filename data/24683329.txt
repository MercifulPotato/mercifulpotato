Item(by='Camillo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601856707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681841, text='&gt; We set out to better understand the effect filtered selfies might have on people’s wellbeing—especially when filters are on by default. We conducted multiple studies and spoke with child and mental health experts from around the world, and found that when you’re not aware that a camera or photo app has applied a filter, the photos can negatively impact mental wellbeing. These default filters can quietly set a beauty standard that some people compare themselves against.<p>Hm, I find myself unable to say whether I agree or not. I would say I am 70% confident that these filters can negatively affect people&#x27;s wellbeing (based on my intuition&#x2F;bias), and 15% confident that we can get a scientifically valid answer to that question (based on the track record of social psychology and related disciplines).')
