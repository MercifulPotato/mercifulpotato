The surviving members of his family don&#x27;t believe he made the quote:<p>&gt;...Multiple family members of Ehrlichman (who died in 1999) challenge the veracity of the quote: The 1994 alleged &#x27;quote&#x27; we saw repeated in social media for the first time today does not square with what we know of our father...We do not subscribe to the alleged racist point of view that this writer now implies 22 years following the so-called interview of John and 16 years following our father&#x27;s death, when dad can no longer respond.[22]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Ehrlichman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;John_Ehrlichman</a><p>This is a very explosive quote - if Baum had included it in his book in 1996 I am sure it would have garnered a huge amount of attention for the book. Instead Baum did not include it in his book, but instead would wait for many years before making the claim when Ehrlichman was no longer around to dispute the quote.<p>At any rate, if the quote was actually said by Ehrlichman, it isn&#x27;t a very accurate description of the overall drug polices of the Nixon administration. While Nixon is remembered for &quot;war on drugs&quot; rhetoric, the actual substance of his policies seem to be different than what people think it was:<p>&gt;...I have been fortunate over the years to discuss the distorted memory of Nixon&#x27;s drug policies with almost all of his key advisors as well as with historians. Their consensus is that because he was dramatically expanding the U.S. treatment system (by 350% in just 18 months!) and cutting criminal penalties, he had to reassure his right wing that he hadn’t gone soft. So he laid on some of the toughest anti-drug rhetoric in history, including making a White House speech declaring a “war on drugs” and calling drugs “public enemy number one”. It worked so well as cover that many people remember that “tough” press event and forget that what Nixon did at it was introduce not a general or a cop or a preacher to be his drug policy chief but…a medical doctor (Jerry Jaffe, a sweet, bookish man who had longish hair and sideburns and often wore the Mickey Mouse tie his kids had given him).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samefacts.com&#x2F;who-started-the-war-on-drugs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samefacts.com&#x2F;who-started-the-war-on-drugs&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;...&quot;Enforcement must be coupled with a rational approach to the reclamation of the drug user himself,&quot; Nixon told Congress in 1971. &quot;We must rehabilitate the drug user if we are to eliminate drug abuse and all the antisocial activities that flow from drug abuse.&quot;<p>&gt;The numbers back this up. According to the federal government&#x27;s budget numbers for anti-drug programs, the &quot;demand&quot; side of the war on drugs (treatment, education, and prevention) consistently got more funding during Nixon&#x27;s time in office (1969 to 1974) than the &quot;supply&quot; side (law enforcement and interdiction).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;29&#x2F;11325750&#x2F;nixon-war-on-drugs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;29&#x2F;11325750&#x2F;nixon-war-on-drugs</a>')
