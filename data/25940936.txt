As a working class person, most of my friends did not finish highschool or go to college and I did but I hated the people there. My father skipped to grades and got a full scholarship to the University of Toronto quit and joined the Hells Angels and died at 40. I found my groove (my partner is a finnish physicist) but the ability to read and think fast in the context of female and working class can be hell - at least in one&#x27;s youth.')
