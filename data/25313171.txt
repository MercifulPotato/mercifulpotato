Some fabrics — such as tweed — are famously long-lasting, but they still wear out eventually.<p>The best thing you can do is buy quality clothing, take good care of it and repair it when necessary, before it wears out completely. That can extend the life of an item significantly, but not indefinitely.<p>Buy good quality wool, wool blends, thick cotton twill, heavy selvedge denim and similar fabrics. They&#x27;re durable and take repairs well. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with hemp, and linen is too fussy for me, but I&#x27;m not ruling them out.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind synthetic fibers, you can get some very light yet durable clothing. The drawback is that a lot of it will come from outdoor brands and look like it.')
