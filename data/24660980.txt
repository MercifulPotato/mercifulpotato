Your engagement with your employer is about how they value your labor output and how you value your time. That’s it. Unless a job has a clear business reason for being tied to a geographic location or externality, there is zero legitimate basis for an employer to factor your location in. If they are saying the market rate suddenly changed and they can hire a cheaper person from somewhere else, then thank them for the opportunity, wish them luck and hand in your resignation letter. You’ve already been delivering value in a way that makes them happy to pay your total comp. Merely switching geography has changed no part of that (unless they are saying they want to replace you, in which case, good luck to them).')
