I do have a general understanding of how a CPU works, and I do understand what preemptive multitasking operating systems do, but my understanding is mostly abstract. And, fwiw, I studied most of this by myself out of sheer curiosity.<p>I did graduate a university but the closest thing we had was using a custom CPU emulator, given by the teacher, to run programs, given by teacher, and tracing every step it takes. It was so tedious and boring (the thing ONLY accepted binary, too, hexadecimal would be too convenient I guess), I wrote my own emulator that took an assembly file as input and generated the paper as the output, you only had to add your name to it before printing and turning it in. It then took me 5 whole minutes to generate semester worth of those. Of course I got a passing grade. Still, no substantial understanding of CPU inner workings was gained during the process.')
