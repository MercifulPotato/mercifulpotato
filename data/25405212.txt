They pretend that it&#x27;s a network, and a server, and a virtual machine, and an operating system, but it isn&#x27;t any of these things -- you still need to provide all of them yourself.<p>It&#x27;s just a program that sits on top of all your &quot;real&quot; infrastructure, that then emulates its own shittier &quot;make believe&quot; infrastructure, where you&#x27;re expected to pay for shitty fake IPv4, shitty fake DNS, and are expected to write UDP applications in an esoteric programming language.<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>There is <i>absolutely nothing redeemable</i> here. Please just let this tire fire of a project die the lonely, obscure death it deserves already.')
