It was dry, factual, scientific... and now banned as coronavirus misinformation. Evidently his health is disputed by our social media overlords. They must know more than the doctor.<p>Today it was a ban on posting links to the stuff leaked off Hunter Biden&#x27;s hard drive. It confirms that Joe was well-involved in the Ukraine corruption. There is also a horrifying email that says in part: <i>&quot;We had assurances the PRC money would come first and we would build on that. Right now I don&#x27;t see that happening. If they want us in Beijing once a month and pitching this outside PRC we should be getting paid in advance just like every other team member thats getting a salary.&quot;</i><p>It seems that every day something major gets banned. It&#x27;s really distorting people&#x27;s view of reality. Even private messages are not immune.')
