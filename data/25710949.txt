No website that you post content to has to distribute that content for you if it doesn’t want to.  Twitter is not air.<p>That said, I don’t know what Facebook and Twitter should do, if there is such a thing as that.  I think Twitter could easily justify <i>not</i> blocking Trump, by making the argument that they are a communication service, and they don’t want to start editorializing, but clearly that is not their stance!  Facebook curates and bumps content up and down by its very nature, so Lord knows what it “should” do with itself.<p>We probably just shouldn’t have these giant monoliths.')
