I would expect a relocation bonus even if moving from a high cost of living area to a low cost of living area, if moving was requested by the company.<p>On the other hand, if I want to do something because it is convenient for me but does not affect my work in any way (i.e. change where I work from) I would not expect my compensation to change.')
