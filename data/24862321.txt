For example, everyone knows that &quot;taking a breath,&quot; helps your child to calm down. But we don&#x27;t often go further into breathing practices, partly because they start to bump up against spirituality, because we as Very Good Scientists are naturally skeptical and usually biased against that.<p>Mindfulness is another example that we&#x27;re just a little farther along with. It&#x27;s now becoming widely known that being mindful for 5-15 minutes a day will lower your stress levels or help you control emotions or rise in the corporate ladder or help with other sorts of problematic behavior. But what happens when you go further? 2500 years ago, people knew that meditating for 1-2 hours a day leads to dramatic, permanent, and wildly transformative changes to your perceptions of reality and your relationship with the sensate world. But words like &quot;awakening&quot; are spiritual mumbo-jumbo so we apply our natural scientific skepticism, largely ignore the deep parts, and do our society a disservice.<p>So on one hand, you&#x27;re right that we don&#x27;t just completely dismiss these things. But on the other hand, we do often dismiss the important parts.')
