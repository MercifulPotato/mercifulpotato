I found it roughly takes 2-3x additional time it takes to develop the same functionality in Node.js (with typescript). But it runs faster. If you want to write code that is probably not going to be thrown away it may be wise to invest the additional time in Go. However can&#x27;t recommend that for building experimental code&#x2F;APIs etc which are time bound and may&#x2F;can get replaced (or split into micro services) in future if it becomes massively successful..')
