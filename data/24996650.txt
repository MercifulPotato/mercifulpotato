Sure, we have 2<i></i>128 IPv6 addresses or so because nobody knows how internet infrastructure will look like in 30 years (maybe internet node virtualization is gone mad). But it&#x27;s my feeling that the IP address should only be an address and not that half-mixed anonymity-related thing.<p>See, a general problem I see with IPv6 and all the protocols around is their enormous complexity. As a hobbyist in the last decades, you could learn about IPv4 and DHCP in a couple of afternoons. It was simple the same way as HTTP1 was simple compared with HTTP2. Complexity means the learning curve is enormous and in the end only a fraction of experts will understand.<p>My personal opinion is that complexity in computing will evventually kill everything: security dies first, innovation comes last.<p>Sorry for this rant. I assume the IPv6 design was carefully crafted by gifted and highly skilled people. We&#x27;ll use it anyway, some day :-)')
