Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610324645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25718987, text='&gt; All you’re stating is that you have confirmation bias and don’t like seeing ideas you disagree with.<p>Well ideas that I think are factually wrong, yes. HN is the only place on the internet where I find myself regularly having to prove that Julian Assange isn&#x27;t necessarily a saint and that Donald Trump is corrupt.<p>Also, if (let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re right) it is merely confirmation bias - surely that means that we can infer that I have at least identified a difference, which given that I am an almost card-carrying capitalist should illuminate that I&#x27;m not marx-reading perpetual-protestor.<p>Hackernews doesn&#x27;t have a <i>partisan</i> right-wing (it&#x27;s poor terminology, but it&#x27;s getting late) bias, but there is an extremely contrarian streak in the bowels of almost any not-yet flagged thread involving politics. For example, the Parler thread is not flagged, the Capitol Attack thread was flagged almost immediately and then dang resurrected it.<p>I recognize by name quite a few people on this site, I&#x27;m able to read the room. After all I&#x27;m still here at least every day.<p>Also, Basic Income is not left-wing policy in any way at all unless your litmus test for that is caring about poor people at all - it&#x27;s effectively submitting to the free market which isn&#x27;t exactly sporting for most socialists.')
