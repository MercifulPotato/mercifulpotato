It&#x27;s is a societal study based on artificial rules created by man. It&#x27;s no more a &quot;science&quot; than a study of monopoly or minecraft. After all, the laws&#x2F;rules of monpoly or minecraft can be changed since they are man-made and not natural.<p>&gt; there are complex equations beyond most of our understanding behind the theory, just like youâ€™d find in physics or chemistry.<p>Except that in physics or chemistry, the complex equations are testable in nature and hence reproducible and testable. Nothing in economics is objectively testable. The better comparison would be to astrology or christian numeralology. Where people make arbitrary rules and within those rules they use &quot;numbers&quot; to create associations.')
