If I chose to move from my small house in WV to a condo in Pitt, i would not expect my employer to pay me more because of my choice.  If they required me to move to Pitt or I lose my job, I would expect some compensation.<p>Likewise, if I take a job and get X salary for that job, then move to a cheaper part of town I wouldn&#x27;t expect to take a pay cut.')
