Humans are piles of goo, each person is different and totally normal, healthy baseline values are frequently quite different for different people. There is no such thing as a &quot;normal&quot; person.<p>The negative effects of false positives can easily outweigh the benefits of early screenings. For example, an NHS study shows that PSA antigen testing for prostate cancer is actually net harmful. [1]<p>Of course this isn&#x27;t a blanket statement against testing in general, I&#x27;m just cautioning you against pre-judging the Dutch system as somehow less effective on the basis of &quot;lack of preventive care&quot; in general based on your personal experiences. It could well be that the other systems you participated in were less effective but attempting to placate anxious humans wanting to feel like they&#x27;re &#x27;doing something.&#x27;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;prostate-cancer-screening-can-do-harm-good&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;prostate-cancer-...</a>')
