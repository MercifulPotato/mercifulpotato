Also, as he acknowledged, they didn&#x27;t offer compilers, which is a biggie when it comes to CS.<p>He could also have done the same thing without paying thousands.<p>&gt; If you’re thinking about getting a Bachelor’s degree in CS, already have experience in the field, and live in the US&#x2F;Canada, you should seriously consider Western Governors University’s Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program.<p>If you already have experience in the field, why bother? I know it&#x27;s &quot;accredited&quot; but nobody is going to take that degree seriously.<p>If you are interested in the &quot;prestige&quot; of having a degree, why not just do it via a college near you. Most major colleges offer programs for working professionals or adults who want to earn a degree. And you can even network with professors&#x2F;TAs&#x2F;etc if you are inclined.')
