That seems like an important point.<p>The issue of data and inheritance is a mess though. My father passed away suddenly and unexpectedly a month ago, and I basically had to hack into his electronic devices so I could get his writings out (he was a writer) for my older brother to have as memories - and in the process, even though I tried to respect his privacy as much as possible, I could have seen things he might not have wanted me to.<p>We don&#x27;t even have photography albums or home videos like we used to, it&#x27;s all behind passwords and biometric security now.')
