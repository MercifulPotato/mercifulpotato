My guess is it would be approximately equivalent to what they already have now.<p>And, there a definite feature differences in how the kernels behave, so they will have to rewrite major sections of Windows to fall in line with the Linux way of doing things.<p>And on top of that they will have to support Wine, or their own equivalent of it. In order to make decades of Windows only applications work. Sure Wine works pretty decently now, but not at an acceptable level.<p>They appear to be working on getting Direct X to work on WSL, but not sure how that will work if its on raw Linux. I don&#x27;t think it does.<p>And Windows handles drivers completely differently than Linux. There was a thread here in the last few days about the AMD drivers being ~10% of the lines of code in the Linux kernel. There is all kinds of specialized hardware that take advantage of Windows drivers. Which would now probably need to all be in the Linux kernel.<p>And how about Active Directory? Thats a huge part of the Enterprise use of Windows. Need to translate all those features and controls over to Linux too.<p>So even if you save a few Engineers on the kernel dev directly, you probably have hundreds of new jobs to deal with the migration. If not thousands.')
