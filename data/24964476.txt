Saxon (the one you talk about)<p>2. BaseX (an XQuery 3.1 processor)<p>3. Xidel (implements many XQuery 3.1 features)<p>4. eXistdb<p>5. fonto-xpath (NodeJS)<p>6. frameless.io (JS, also XSL)<p>And these are the ones, which face the public internet. I think, Microsoft has an 2.x implementation, I am pretty sure, IBM and Oracle do so, as well.<p>Now, as for XSL-T, you are right: the easily available implementations are Saxon, but, as it seems, also frameless.io (which I just found out about a few minutes ago, so I may be wrong). But again, I guess, that big enterprise has their own solutions bundled.')
