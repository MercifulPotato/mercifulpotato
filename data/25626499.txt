Having a Mercedes says that you&#x27;re comfortable financially, and they&#x27;re &quot;dignified&quot;. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s what their marketing generally implies. Luxury is generally just a dog whistle for value signalling merchandise.<p>Ferrari does different value signalling. They imply wealth because of the cars performance, and they&#x27;re generally a much more obvious signal. They&#x27;re usually a bold color like red in the ads, and the body styles are distinctive. You could miss a Mercedes in a group of sedans; you&#x27;re not going to miss the Ferrari.<p>The private club brand, to me, is Rolls Royce. I would guess because I never see ads (and rarely see them in person), so my only references are pop culture where they&#x27;re associated with the ultra wealthy.')
