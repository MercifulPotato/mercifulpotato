They don&#x27;t float around in your body for years: they create immunity the same way the disease itself does. More or less: obviously you don&#x27;t get sick!<p>Which is great, I hadn&#x27;t been that sick in ten years, it was pretty awful. Please get vaccinated <i>if you haven&#x27;t gotten COVID</i>. If you have, well, maybe you want to do it just in case? I do not.<p>A lot of misinformation out there...')
