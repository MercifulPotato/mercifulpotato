As in, when he&#x27;ll fail, he&#x27;ll just try something else following his creativity and independent thinking, working hard and trying to move as fast as he can (although maintaining normal life to an extent, maybe weekly soccer and socializing a bit with friends and partner).<p>What are his chances of being a millionaire by the end of 5 year period? 50%? 90%? 20%? What do you think?')
