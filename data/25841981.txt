In the end it turned out to just a bunch of disorganized wannabes but the context was still genuinely worrying especially with reports of the police standing down to let the mob in, even if we cast aside the shrill theatrics that followed in the media.<p>In comparison, the BLM unrest seemed like it would predictably peter out fairly quickly without much in the way of concrete changes, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened.
