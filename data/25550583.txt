I&#x27;ve used nginx multiple times for this and it works really well. I was once working for a company and evaluated multiple softwares for live streaming and nginx even beat some of the paid offerings. \nThese days I just use YouTube&#x2F;Facebook to stream to private audiences. For personal streams that works really well. These are also better platforms for online casting since they provide much better discoverability compared to owncast instances.')
