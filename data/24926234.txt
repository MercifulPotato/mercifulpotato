I&#x27;m confident <i>my</i> risk of dying from acute appendicitis in a major city in an industrialised country with universal healthcare is negligible, but if I was in the middle of the Antarctic (actually I&#x27;d guess Amundsen-Scott has more than one medic, but not say the Russian base Vostok) and there is nobody qualified to operate? Not so much.<p>Also, the PR is very bad, and while ethically that&#x27;s no reason for a medic to recommend this surgery to their patient it might be enough reason for a government to make it policy anyway.')
