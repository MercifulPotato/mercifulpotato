Item(by='yazaddaruvala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607025698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293714, text='My speculation: the movie theater, like the non-movie theater (for distinction I&#x27;ll use &quot;play house&quot;), will always exist.<p>However, the density of movie theaters will decrease. Previously most small towns had a movie theater but not a play house. Similarly, movie theaters will likely only exist in the downtown or perhaps a large mall of a densely populated location.<p>Movie theaters will likely continue their trend to become more expensive, i.e. alcoholic drinks, food, etc. basically become a decent restaurant&#x2F;bar with an amazing AV experience.')
