Item(by='ROFISH', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610399568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736271, text='Without too much detail due to contracts&#x2F;NDA&#x2F;etc, slipping a release date is even worse of a bother for others down-chain also. There are planned times for manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, all that fun stuff for the physical versions of titles. All that would basically need to be re-dated from scratch. You can&#x27;t slip one week, you have to slip at least a month. More for platforms that don&#x27;t use standard disc formats which are not made locally. (Which hilariously, CP2077 already did slip a month before release.)<p>Even for digital games, there&#x27;s still approval processes where the first parties would have to test the game out. This process involves scheduling people for it; you can&#x27;t just go to the front of the line as there are other games that have been scheduled for certain slots. (Which hilariously, it was rumored that CP2077 was given the &#x27;don&#x27;t test, push live ASAP&#x27; treatment.)<p>At lastly, all payments from the platforms and retailers are based on the actual release date. Unless there&#x27;s a specific contract, games are not paid until months after release. Physical preorders don&#x27;t pay the developers, they just help with preventing over&#x2F;under stocking. (And digital preorders are... functionally worthless beyond the psychological value.) The release date starts the payment timer. When hurting for cash, releasing can start that timer.<p>The processes above can really benefit abusers who decide that &quot;making street-date&quot; is the most important thing above all other concerns.')
