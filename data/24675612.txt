Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=[24676593], score=None, time=1601769502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24673603, text='&gt;  Isn&#x27;t this generally highjacked by the timber industry to protect valuable &quot;product?&quot;<p>At least in some cases, the main restriction is environmental protections laws and liability concerns. You want to start a controlled burn? What&#x27;s the risk? What species live in the area? Are any endangered? Are you sure? Will anyone be hurt during this blaze? Have you filed the environmental impact statement, risk mitigation plan, incident management documents, and obtained approval from all relevant agencies? How much smoke will it generate? What&#x27;s going to be IN the smoke? What do you mean you don&#x27;t know the exact contents of the smoke; how can you get a permit for emitting smoke without knowing what in it? Etc.<p>In California in particular, controlled burns need approval from the local Air District, and they have to give approval on the day. It&#x27;s not unheard of for a planned, approved burn to be shut down at the last minute because the day is a bit too smoggy already. There&#x27;s always someone willing to pop up and argue against the controlled burn; local residents worried about safety, or even the American Lung Association worried about smoke inhalation. Also, the people in charge of starting burns can be held liable if they go wrong, but will not be held liable if they opt <i>not</i> to start a burn, and then disaster ensues.<p>It&#x27;s possible the timber industry is somewhere <i>behind</i> that, but we seem quite capable of hamstringing ourselves &quot;honestly&quot; too, so I&#x27;m not sure.<p>In any case, yes. California burns around 20k acres per year, but needs to be burning more like 1m acres per year, AND needs to burn a 20m acre backlog. Everyone is in agreement that this needs to happen, but (just like so many other Californian problems) there&#x27;s no obvious path forward. The system is setup at every level to stop this, and it has enormous inertia. Experts hope than in a few years, they might be able to get up to as high as 40k acres per year...which won&#x27;t even be a noticeable improvement. There&#x27;s no single villain causing an otherwise functioning system to fail; the system <i>is</i> the problem.<p>I found this article quite interesting: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;massivesci.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;megafire-california-climate-change-wildfire-controlled-burns-fire-management&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;massivesci.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;megafire-california-climate-...</a>')
