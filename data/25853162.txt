Of course once I was immersed in the field I discovered that many of those so-called &quot;stupid&quot; things were quite rational and even most of the ones that were the result of legitimate path dependence, and not really so stupid as to be worth changing.<p>I also learned that people in the field had already thought about this and the current state was a result of people trying to fix procedural&#x2F;cultural bugs.<p>Of course the residual of subtracting all those &quot;many&quot; things that turned out to be legit still left a few stupidities and tweaking a couple of them was enough to make a big difference to our startup.<p>Also: our own field (I&#x27;m back in computing) is full of path-dependent oddities and wholesale cargo cutting as well.  I think it&#x27;s human nature.')
