Item(by='will4274', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604351105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965785, text='&gt; the leader board of HN<p>Fwiw, the [hacker news guidelines](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>) ask that you avoid commenting on voting (like this one).<p>&gt; Please don&#x27;t comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.<p>This pattern - posting something controversial and breaking the rules - and then blaming it on people not liking the controversial thing you said - is not uncommon. Indeed, I frequently see comments to the effect of &quot;See Trump was right about the tech companies being monopolies but people here will downvote me because they hate Trump&quot; sitting at the bottom of every thread when I enable &quot;showdead&quot;.<p>In sum - if you want to get more votes (as you apparently care about votes) and for people to give your ideas more consideration - consider not self-sabotaging by pairing your ideas with a rule breaking comment.<p>Fwiw, this is the third time I&#x27;ve seen you bring up your rank on the HN leaderboard. It&#x27;s also the third time I&#x27;ve heard of the HN leaderboard. I&#x27;m not sure if somebody being ranked on HN makes me more or less likely to consider their argument - probably less, because it means they spend too much time on social media - but it&#x27;s not a strong effect in any case. Simply put - does literally anybody care about that leaderboard besides you?')
