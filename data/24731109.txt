What&#x27;s the difference between producing 1 mL or 1 gallon of water in terms of _verification_?<p>2) You can verify it in various ways, including obtaining back oxygen and hydrogen from water. You can measure the weight of the water you&#x27;ve used (and derive the number of molecules), and the weight of the gases you obtain (and again check that it matches what you&#x27;ve provided).<p>3) Sure, your sensors (eyes, ears, etc.) are not accurate&#x2F;fast enough to literally see two H2 molecules and one O2 molecule creating two H2O. If you feel that this in itself is enough to impede verification then we have an issue. You can always go back to a point where your eyes are enough to validate an hypothesis and build from there, so everything holds. But you seem to be asking that for _every_ scientific proof in our modern world, which is just mischievous.')
