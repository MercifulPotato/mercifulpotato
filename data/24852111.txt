They&#x27;ve given alternatives but they are just refusing to fix it, to the point of basically saying mozilla needs to fix the issue. What&#x27;s sad is a similar mechanism is used in their chrome extension. Someone even raised a working PR that the CTO wasn&#x27;t fully happy with, and asked for changes (which is fair), but the PR hasn&#x27;t moved since, so I&#x27;d have expected the Bitwarden employees to take it and fix it up.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous to still not have this fixed years later.<p>By contrast, I was a 1Password customer at the time this change got introduced, and they&#x27;d pushed out a fix not long after.<p>I will be trying to Linux client, and if it&#x27;s good enough, I&#x27;m certainly switch away.')
