I would absolutely tick that box, as would many other people, specifically because we don&#x27;t necessarily automatically trust whatever authority is &quot;deciding&quot; what is misinformation or not.<p>Instead, I would prefer to research an issue, by looking at multiple sides, and make a judgement, as opposed to having some minister of truth controlling what I am or am not allowed to read.<p>&gt; is being applied and the biases at play there.<p>But the point is, that if you don&#x27;t trust a certain group or source&#x27;s opinion on what &quot;misinformation&quot; is, then you could choose a different authority on that.<p>IE, the tags for what is or is not &quot;misinformation&quot;, would be community controlled, and you could pick which community or group to use as the &quot;source&quot; for this tag.')
