The media has confounded &quot;proof&quot; with &quot;evidence&quot;. Sworn affidavits are admissible as evidence. Whether their evidence proves their case or not is up to the courts. Claiming that these are unfounded allegations speaks to the point of my above comment.<p>There is a widely accepted precedent for not releasing all of the details of a pending court case before it is litigated.<p>The above are not partisan assertions.')
