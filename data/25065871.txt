Item(by='ab-dm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605149478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065026, text='My 15&quot; MBP (2019, 2.4 Ghz, 32 Gb, 560x 4 Gb) is probably the most disappointing machine I&#x27;ve ever owned. The keyboard is meh, the battery isn&#x27;t great and it&#x27;s no where near as performant or efficient as it should be for the price. My 5.7k AUD laptop shouldn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s taking off to Mars because Firefox with a few tabs has been open too long. Heaven forbid I try and compile or transpile anything.<p>These types of results make me hopeful for the future of Apple hardware. I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of OSX, but I was pretty sure this MBP would be the last Apple laptop I would buy. Looking forward to being wrong.')
