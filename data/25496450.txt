I think that at 90k you are not going to get many great candidates. And at 250k you risk spending a LOT more money and still not being able to successfully recruit people that are much better than the 125k people. It is not like all your 125k people are going to quit when you double salaries to make way for all the FAANG people who are looking to switch jobs for the same salary.')
