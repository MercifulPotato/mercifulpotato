Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601844978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680548, text='&gt; Any model that depends on intentional evil at every level is likely wrong.<p>This is unfounded (do you have any sort of backing for this ridiculously bold claim?), historically inaccurate (in nearly every generation, there&#x27;s at least one mass-murdering regime born), and isn&#x27;t actually relevant to the question (evil at every level discounts those who aren&#x27;t involved, those that are victims, and those that are powerless to stop the evil).<p>The rest of your comment is spot on. The unfortunate truth is that people who are elected have the skills required to be elected, not the skills required to lead. Our legislative system is designed to encourage childish bickering, which is attractive to people with old faces and childish personalities. The system is built around the idea that the president will be the &quot;adult in the room&quot; and apply a considered direction to the children to mediate their bickering; it seems that doesn&#x27;t work well.')
