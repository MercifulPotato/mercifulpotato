Nor that some people may be extremely happy with it. But me personally, for my most common use case (end-to-end monolithic web apps, complete with client and back-end) it feels like it places a higher cognitive burden than the alternatives, due to all the things we&#x27;re mentioning (eg, lack of an established ORM)<p>&gt; Comparing Django to NodeJS itself is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison<p>Well, yea, but that&#x27;s the point of my whole comment - Node could have a Django or Rails equivalent after ten years, don&#x27;t you think?<p>&gt; It seems like the biggest issue with the NodeJS ecosystem is that everyone wants to roll their own thing<p>Completely agree - it&#x27;s almost an ethos thing. Though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a conscious &quot;ethos&quot; or rather having to due with the ecosystem and developer population being disparate and disjointed - anarchical, maybe?<p>Again, not questioning that there are some really good devs out there that are deliberate and successful in rolling out their own thing. I also think however there&#x27;s a group of devs who <i>think</i> that they want to roll their own thing, until they have to face the consequences down the road and wish they hadn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; how deceptively easy it is to work with NodeJS<p>Yes, that&#x27;s a big point in my comment. To add: I have a formal education in software engineering but like many others had to pick up web dev on my own. I bought into the Node.js &quot;one language to rule them all&quot; hype, only to find a much steeper learning curve than I would have had otherwise (mainly due to the async model and the lack of a batteries-included framework), without much of a payoff for it.<p>I feel no regrets, my path has been what it&#x27;s been, I&#x27;ve learned a lot and I&#x27;m glad to have Node.js as an option in my toolbelt since it&#x27;s so prevalent and there are good use cases for it. But if I had to recommend a young dev where to start I&#x27;d probably point them elsewhere.<p>As for me going forward I see myself sticking to Django and exploring things like Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix, Swift, Go or F#, and only coming back to Node if the situation really calls for it or maybe, like I said previously, if there&#x27;s a batteries-included framework that reaches maturity.')
