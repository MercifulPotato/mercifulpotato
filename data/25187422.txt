Then later on the article states that one of the companies described itself as an ISP.<p>The story also questions why there is a GUI for running remote commands and why a device would need to scan for nearby networks. I can think of a few legitimate reasons for both but no reason a decent backdoor would have a server side backdoor GUI.<p>Just my opinion but I get the feeling this whole situation was created by IP theft in the form of firmware duplication. It seems these companies have used a very insecure firmware possibly made intentionally bad to trap or setup these Chinese manufacturers.<p>If these are in fact intentional backdoors they were made with an incredible amount of effort to look like sloppy 0day exploits.<p>I should add that I don&#x27;t doubt that these vulnerabilities are real, just the intent behind them.<p>If I was having my products manufactured in China, I might provide a similar bad firmware for the factory too, then patch the devices before providing them to my customers to prevent IP theft.')
