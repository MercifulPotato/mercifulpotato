We have DNS, email, and HTTP.  That&#x27;s a pretty capable set of distributed protocols that have been on those phones since the beginning.<p>The stores are not a problem here (although they are in other ways); rather, there is a lack of apps that people want to use, or perhaps a lack of people using those apps.<p>I use Riot (now Element), which uses the Matrix protocol across all my iDevices, and it runs just as well as on my Mac. but hardly anyone I know is on it. It&#x27;s much more private of a solution that WhatsApp, and although not as refined, it works pretty darn well for my use cases.')
