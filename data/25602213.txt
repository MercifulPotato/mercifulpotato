Once delivery companies began making a lot of money with courier services,  people created a story of exploitation and market manipulation.  The reality, however, is that food service providers want in on the action: the bill gives providers bargaining chips to negotiate getting a cut for services that they never offered before.  A consequence to this change is that while the restaurants do not face losses due to courier services, the courier services will lose as a result of the bill.  Courier services now have a legitimate claim against the state and restaurants.  It&#x27;s time to go to the Supreme Court.')
