However I tend to just use the Npgsql library directly with ADO.NET for performance which I often needed for my cases with Postgres. These days you can insert array objects, insert whole objects graphs, do batch inserts and create little helpers to read&#x2F;write sets with Npgsql&#x2F;PSQL directly; often much faster than using a higher level ORM. In my experience Postgres often would produce query plans that required a lot of SQL tuning&#x2F;rewriting in a different way to get right (e.g. loose index scan SQL to get latest entry per group). I just wrap the solution&#x2F;build with DB tests to make sure the SQL is covered well vs using the type provider. Tbh the amount of code (in lines) is mostly the same as well to do it vs a higher level framework - we did the comparison.')
