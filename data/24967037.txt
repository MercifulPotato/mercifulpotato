The i-devices are usually slightly ahead (okay, my MBP is 5 years old by now, but progress has been slower on the Mac side than on the iPhone side).<p>It might not just be about fillrate though, I&#x27;m also seeing much higher drawcall throughput with Metal on iOS devices versus running Metal on Macs with Intel GPU. I guess the entire graphics stack is much better optimized on iOS.')
