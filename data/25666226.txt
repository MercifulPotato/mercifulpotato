Compare to BLM where there were thousands of storm troopers, tanks, etc camped out before the similarly obviously publicized protests occurred. Here is a comparison photo of what they had in front of the monument before the LEGAL BLM protest this summer [1]<p>- the &#x27;resistance&#x27; was very weak at least at first. The videos of the &#x27;storming&#x27; didn&#x27;t show much resistance, no gas, no rubber bullets, no attempt to hold the line. here is a &#x27;selfie&#x27; [2] which to be fair doesn&#x27;t show cop actively participating, but does show him just standing there. There are some photos of guns drawn trying to protect the floor, obviously out numbered once they secured Members I understand completely retreating. But the main uniformed officers at the entrances didn&#x27;t act.<p>It&#x27;s a stark difference.\nMy story is that here in Denver I was gassed, before curfew, before an unlawful assembly was declared, during a peaceful protest this summer. They shot more than a few eyes out of their sockets with rubber bullets. A judge had to restrain the Denver police for their violence.<p>Compare to today it took a LONG time for them to deploy these same weapons, and it doesn&#x27;t even look like they used tear gas&#x2F;irritants at least in the first videos, just smoke; unlike what they gassed us with and those in Lafayette Park and across the country.<p>1 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s.abcnews.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;US&#x2F;national-guard-lincoln-memorial-1-abc-200602_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s.abcnews.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;US&#x2F;national-guard-lincoln-memor...</a>\n2 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bubbaprog&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346920198461419520" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bubbaprog&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346920198461419520</a>')
