Suddenly, you don&#x27;t need wait&#x2F;waitpid&#x2F;wait3&#x2F;wait4&#x2F;SIGCHLD or even PID 1. When the last process descriptor vanishes, the process itself can be purged from the process table.<p>And Win8 added nested jobs, so now you can basically have inescapable process groups with &quot;if the leader process dies, terminate all its children and grandchildren&quot; semantics. On Linux, I had to just give up and use Docker containers for this: some software simply insists on daemonizing itself too much, to the point that on receiving SIGTERM, it re-sends SIGTERM to everyone in its process group (including you, the unsuspecting parent. That was very &quot;funny&quot; to debug).<p>But of course, the downside of Windows is that the amount of legacy crap and weird quirks and incompatibilities is insane, even more than in x86. &quot;The Windows low-level APIs wouldn&#x27;t recognize &quot;general&quot; if it showed up in a uniform with stars on the shoulder.&quot; (c) njsmith')
