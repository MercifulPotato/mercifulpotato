I&#x27;ve started a couple of companies, I&#x27;ve worked for way more. And... I&#x27;m done. I mean completely burned out, hating on the industry, and really just wondering what I can do with my life.<p>I&#x27;m not with the mock-woke companies that lie to themselves. I&#x27;m done with the frat-boy companies. I&#x27;m done with people changing the world by making XYZ obsolete, or disrupting ABC. I&#x27;m done with companies pretending to do good or well, while in reality just being rent-seeking behemoths. I&#x27;m sick of watching our brightest pollute the world with ad tech. I&#x27;m just done.<p>Does anyone else feel this? Did you get out? What do you do now, and how do you reconcile the sheer difference in dollars?')
