The closer you move to moving data (instead of doing analysis), the more it becomes annoying.<p>On the other hand, current languages (such as python) lack support when it comes to data transformations. Even Scala, which is one of the better languages for this, has severe drawbacks compared to SQL.<p>Hopefully better type-systems will help us out in the long term, in particular those with dependent types or similar power to describe data relations.')
