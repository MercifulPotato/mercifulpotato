Item(by='dmitriid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603056854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24817514, text='&gt; In my experience letters A-Z doesn&#x27;t capture the whole gamut of utterances used in the language. Most languages use more sounds than 26 letters can capture.<p>It&#x27;s more than just sounds. Turkish and Romanian alphabets capture the sounds of Turkish and Romanian alphabets quite well.<p>But then...<p>In Turkish &quot;I will do something&quot; is written like this: &quot;Bir şey yapıcaǧım&quot;. And if you&#x27;re going for proper enunciation, that&#x27;s what you will say. In most situations most people will say &quot;Bi şey yapıcam&quot; (note the omission of &quot;r&quot; in &quot;Bir&quot; and &quot;ǧı&quot; in &quot;yapıcaǧım&quot;).<p>Do the letters correspond to the sounds? Yes. Does it help? Nope, people will not speak the way it&#x27;s written, because written rules describe a very specific rigid set of rules. And, for example, elisions and contractions [1] are very common in nearly every language and are often frowned upon in written texts (except for a small number of unavoidable ones).<p>And that&#x27;s before we go into the plethora of sounds between dialects and regional variations. For example, in Swedish, there&#x27;s a combination of letters, `sj`[3] that has at least <i>four</i> different pronunciations across Sweden. So, the word &quot;seven&quot;, &quot;sju&quot; will be pronounced with [ɕ] in one part of Sweden, with [ɧ], in a different part of Sweden and so on. It&#x27;s the same word, should it be spelled differently for each group of people?<p>And note, we&#x27;re just touching just 1% of 1% of the complexities of pronunciation :) And they rarely if ever can be captured in written text and rules for the written text.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elision" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elision</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Contraction_(grammar)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Contraction_(grammar)</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swedish_phonology#Fricatives" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swedish_phonology#Fricatives</a> Wikipedia has a full paragraph dedicated to this alone')
