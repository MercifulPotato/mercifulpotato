So there is one element that you have but I don&#x27;t, or the other way around.\nIn this case there is a very easy solution: just send the sum of all your elements. If it&#x27;s larger than the sum of the receiver&#x27;s element, the (absolute value of the) difference is exactly the element that one party has and the other doesn&#x27;t.<p>In a way, PinSketch is generalizing this &quot;send sum of your elements&quot; in such a way that it works for more than one difference.')
