That&#x27;s a bug that any kind of testing should have caught (two bugs, actually).<p>Also: Why does Vivado have to treat any little IP core I create like it&#x27;s some full-fledged library that exists independently of my main project? I just want to attach a 50-line HDL module to an AXI interconnect in the block diagram â€“ I don&#x27;t want to create a new project for this, ffs.')
