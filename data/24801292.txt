It is not a polished product, but I think the community would find the concept interesting: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getrumin.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getrumin.com&#x2F;</a><p>Rumin is a combination of free-form drawing (create page blocks anywhere on the Canvas) and a flexible knowledge representation (undirected connections, hierarchical collections, and backlinks).<p>I am going for a free-form and spatial medium like paper, with the ease of edit and retrieval of a digital format. \nThe way I currently use Rumin looks something like this:<p>- Always leave one Canvas tab open, and use it as my &quot;mission control&quot;: Brain dump, random thoughts, and journal entries go here. And I use a different Canvas for each thinking context or topic.<p>- Start a new Canvas for each research, brainstorming, or learning session.<p>- Hide the pages from the Canvas whenever I&#x27;m done to declutter. They can be re-inserted (via search, along with the connected blocks) in any Canvas.<p>- Use the search bar, &quot;related content&quot; section, and the &quot;fetch suggestions&quot; to retrieve existing thoughts and reuse my previous work<p>It also comes with an open source web clipper to capture content from web resources: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jhlyeung&#x2F;rumin-web-clipper" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jhlyeung&#x2F;rumin-web-clipper</a><p>And I plan on open sourcing more of the product in the coming weeks.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts, workflows, and use cases.')
