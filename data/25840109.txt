If you were to share an IPFS address such as &#x2F;ipfs&#x2F;QmbezGequPwcsWo8UL4wDF6a8hYwM1hmbzYv2mnKkEWaUp with someone, you would need to give the person a new link every time you update the content.<p>The InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) solves this issue by creating an address that can be updated.<p>A name in IPNS is the hash of a public key. It is associated with a record containing information about the hash it links to that is signed by the corresponding private key. New records can be signed and published at any time.<p>...<p>Alternatives to IPNS<p>IPNS is not the only way to create mutable addresses on IPFS. You can also use DNSLink, which is currently much faster than IPNS and also uses human-readable names. Other community members are exploring ways to use blockchains to store common name records.')
