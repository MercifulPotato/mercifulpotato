You can always distribute binaries with a liberal usage license.  And if your model is selling support, that might actually be helpful, since it&#x27;s even less practical for a 2nd or 3rd party to support software when they don&#x27;t have access to the source code, so you&#x27;d sell more support contracts<p>I think Amazon&#x27;s behavior may end up just harming open source, by punishing the idealism that leads companies to try to make commercialized open source business models work.')
