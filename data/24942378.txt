Maybe this isn&#x27;t the case on major huge libraries, but for your every day library, it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a rule where you have to write the worst docs that still look pretty and all there at first glance, but totally useless and frustrating time and time again. The docs usually feel smug in the way they make it seems so easy and then they don&#x27;t tell you how to do anything useful, like you are the one in the wrong for trying to use it for a real example or that you are an idiot because you can&#x27;t just infer how everything would work without docs and examples. You have to learn from StackOverflow issues to understand how to actually do anything. That&#x27;s my view. Maybe in general people just don&#x27;t remember anything with good docs, and only the bad examples.<p>I feel like my ambitions for doing anything quickly are destroyed time and time again after finding a library to help me do it easily and fast the docs are the same old garbage. And these are the top starred libraries for their purpose. &quot;How can this common thing to do on JS not have a huge, widely used and well document library that has existed for years?&quot;. It still blows my mind how after years and millions of people using it, so many libraries still have the worst docs.')
