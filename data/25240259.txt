One form has an economic locus,  one a political locus.  Either may be abused, and each feeds on and amplifies the other.<p>Government surveillance has vastly less capacity without commercial services, particularly those tracking:<p>- Strong signalling via payments: commerce, credit and debit payments, ecommerce, Amazon, Visa and Mastercard<p>- Location: mobile devices, tollpaying systems, facial recognition &#x2F; biosignatures, license plate scanners<p>- Interests: marketing databases, demographics, AI-based content analysis, magazine and newspaper subscrptions, television and video watch history, video rentals (among the very few privacy carve outs thanks to Soliciter Bob), and online reading &#x2F; views &#x2F; interactions data.<p>- Social relationships:  USPS postal covers, telecoms call records (dating to the 1980s), location data (corrolated with other individuals), email, social media friends and interactions<p>Corporations rely on powers of governments including:<p>- Courts<p>- Law<p>- The buying, selling, renting, borrowing, installation, or removal of legislators, executives, judges, and regulators<p>- Regulatory capture<p>- Law enforcement<p>- Military<p>The line that a government can kill or jail you whilst a corporation cannot is a fable long belied by history. \n Corporations (or straight-up criminal gangs, where differentiable) can and do act directly, or bend the government where necessary. Adam Smith&#x27;s notes on commercially operated garrisons, the history of the labour and environmental movements, oil and railroad companies, chemical industrry, and more, provide numerous examples.<p>Surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and manipulation are tools, features, and benefits accruing to the controlling actor of any informaation monopoly, regardless of how that actor is organised or aligned.  Not all abuse the power, but as Lord Acton notes, the temptation is strong.')
