I change my methods frequently (text files, notion, html, markdown, wiki, wordpress).<p>Lately I&#x27;ve slacked a bit and so a couple days ago I decided to simply write letters to myself. This is very, very easy. I don&#x27;t have to worry about how good it is, I&#x27;m only writing to myself. I also put a note in my calendar to go back and read my letters about once a month.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;ll expand letters into blog posts or small books. I&#x27;ve published several small books in the past, the most recent being my introduction to computer programming for absolute beginners, which is called &quot;Splash of Code by Joel Dare&quot;.')
