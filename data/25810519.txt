Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610890584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810095, text='&gt;Whilst I agree, recent trend to push for more BYOD where the device is owned by the contrators, employee or an external actor, but still allowed access and controlled by the enterprise does tend to blur the lines quite a bit, especially as most tooling has been lacking decent isolation between &quot;enterprise&quot; and &quot;private&quot; on the same device. MDM tooling tends to want to administer the whole device and apply the stricter &quot;enterprise&quot; policies, with a pinky promise that private life is going to be respected.<p>Which is why employees should either be given employer-owned devices or use device subsidies (as many companies provide) to pay for a device that&#x27;s only used for work purposes.<p>That companies attempt to hijack (and I mean that in both metaphorical and literal senses) personal devices for corporate purposes, aside from the obvious issues, it&#x27;s also terrible security policy.<p>That businesses do this is exploitative, unethical and insecure.  I suspect such businesses don&#x27;t really care about the first two, but should care about the third.<p>As an infosec&#x2F;infrastructure guy, I&#x27;d raise hell over such a policy -- because leaving aside the scumbaggery (I think I just coined a new word.  Good for me!), having personal devices connected to internal corporate resources (even with corporate MDM configurations) is literally <i>begging</i> to be compromised, for (hopefully) obvious reasons.')
