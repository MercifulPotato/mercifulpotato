PG isn&#x27;t looking at <i>everything</i> (such as &quot;earnestness&quot;) only through the prism of money. It&#x27;s a blog post with deliberately <i>limited scope</i>.<p>His first sentence sets the <i>context</i> for the rest of the essay: <i>&quot;Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance when we&#x27;re talking about _startups_.&quot;</i><p>Yes, we all know there can be <i>other activities</i> to also express earnestness such as creating art paintings, music, parenting, volunteering, teaching, etc. but he omits those and discusses it in relation to <i>startups</i> because... startups is what he often specializes in writing about.  It doesn&#x27;t look like mocking Europe to me.<p>I understand you want a more universal essay (measures of earnestness beyond startups) but that&#x27;s not necessary for PG&#x27;s blog audience.')
