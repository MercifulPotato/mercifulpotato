We needed to be connected with our team more often and simply because we were building new software from scratch and needed lots of communication to make the team’s consensus. But there were no ways to connect our team instantly. Zoom was for a scheduled meeting, and it was too formal. Slack was for written communication, which was not dynamic enough to bring everyone on the same page. We needed to be connected instantly to clear our issues, get feedback on new features, etc. So we started building one for our team. That is how Tappy was born, and we are still on a mission to make remote work communication even more efficient than offline communication.<p>Since most of us are working from home, communication has been the number one challenge for remote teams. We got more used to working from home and some of us already enjoy it. but a downside of remote work is that we can’t casually start a conversation to learn from each other the way we could in an office.<p>Tappy provides your team with a simple and quick way to break down communication barriers with our real-time communication software.<p>Tappy replicates the experience you get at your office with live status, one-click to talk.<p>We just opened our public beta service, and you guys are welcome to join to get early access.
