For most use cases it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>But take that minimalist-look bookshelf with a fern and 2 books and add a whole row of books and it will sag.<p>I had bookshelves made of actual wood, and they don&#x27;t sag (along the grain).  I guess because the wood was evolved to hold tons of tree in place vertically and horizontally.<p>But ikea also sells stronger stuff like metal shelves.  Just buy the appropriate stuff for the task.')
