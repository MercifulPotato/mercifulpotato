The two camps mapped quite nicely on the respective faculties as well (HUM&#x2F;STEM). I always thought juggling is one of these activities that really amplifies the introvert&#x2F;extrovert and people-oriented&#x2F;thing-oriented personality traits. Anyway, one of the two camps was really into site swaps and the other not at all.')
