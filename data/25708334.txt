Tesla was never able to make the original target price of $35,000 for the Model 3 and that is with the, ahem, streamlined interior and &quot;aero&quot; wheels.<p>With that being said, Tesla may need to try. With where their stock price is at they are going to need to keep increasing revenue YoY and the only way to do that is to expand into new markets and introduce new car models. There are only so many customers in the midsize luxury car and crossover market.')
