In those ones, sure, I agree that a respect for the principles of democracy means that the people could choose differently. But if you&#x27;ve come to the point of arguing, &quot;The real problem here is that anti-democratic policy X is being enacted with the support of the people,&quot; it&#x27;s worth taking a moment to ask if policy X actually is democratic, and if saying &quot;We should avoid policy X even if the people support it&quot; is the actual tyranny of the minority.')
