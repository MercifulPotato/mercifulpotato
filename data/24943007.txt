He&#x27;s extremely litigious from all accounts I&#x27;ve seen and it seems to be part and parcel of a carefully crafted and intimidating persona. Billy himself has no credibility to a lot of people, so why not throw a symbol front and center that holds weight for people. Just my opinion, don&#x27;t sue me Billy.')
