She&#x27;s claiming that Ted Cruz is actually trying to get her killed.<p>Ted Cruz would have to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he not only was not doing so, but that AOC actually knew, or reasonably should have known, he was not. Given that the specific notional basis for her accusations is her knowledge (and not only from public sources) of his involvement with the Jan. 6 insurrection, thatâ€™s probably not something he wants publicly litigated in a court of law, since it&#x27;s something he desperately wants to erase from the minds of everyone not actually sympathetic to the insurrection, while still staying on the good side of the pro-insurrectionists.')
