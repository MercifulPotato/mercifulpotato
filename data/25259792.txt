If you need nested tables, then you need a special-purpose format that allows for it--and it will very likely look more like a binary filesystem than a parseable text file.  If you don&#x27;t need nested tables, then escaping is unnecessary if the format uses delimiters which aren&#x27;t present in the data.  A lot of data includes newlines, some data includes tab characters, but only binary data would ever include the ASCII specified delimiters.<p>Don&#x27;t get caught in the CS trap of thinking you need a completely &quot;general purpose&quot; parser, when a slightly-less-than-completely-general parser will be significantly easier to write, simpler to understand and debug, and faster to execute.  And as mentioned above, if you do find yourself needing more than this parser, then you should be looking at non-parsing based approaches anyway.')
