I&#x27;m just legitimately curious, can you recommend a service <i>of similar visibility and quality</i> in the US where you can sell used junk (old game consoles, appliances, collectibles) without being a business? I still use eBay because as far as I know they&#x27;re still the best service in that segment of the market, but I&#x27;m open to other suggestions.<p>I have tried Craigslist, OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace (yuck) etc., but honestly the selling experience has been even worse than eBay. EBay skims 10% off the purchase price, but even listing at 20% <i>below</i> eBay selling price on other services leads to people lowballing you and then not showing up to get their stuff after you waited for them for an hour. At least with eBay if somebody flakes out I can just relist the item in a couple minutes and wait for it to end again.')
