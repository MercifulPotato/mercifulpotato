The ad industry thrived for thousands of years without ads that follow you everywhere.<p>Invasive targeting is only 20 years old, a blink in the history of advertising. If it was gone tomorrow these companies would just go back to targeting based on the ad placement rather than unique person viewing it. What we have now is the dystopian sci fi movie where ads shift as different people look at them.<p>If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dystopian, consider that every ad your coworkers see when you&#x27;re sharing your screen is based on the best targeting data advertisers can find. Your screen is disclosing your interests, wealth, medical history, kinks, etc to anyone looking at it. It&#x27;s fucked up.')
