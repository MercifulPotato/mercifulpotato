Certainly for professional-grade stuff you don&#x27;t want to be in that environment but it definitely works.<p>You&#x27;re right about the dev mode toggle, which is unfortunate. I&#x27;d like to see barriers like that go away, and it wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate on productivity hardware. I don&#x27;t have any expert inside information on this but I suspect it&#x27;s an absolute requirement from game studios that don&#x27;t want side-loaded apps being used to cheat or exfiltrate content - I think that shouldn&#x27;t require a hard reboot of the console but maybe it&#x27;s similar to the situation Riot has arrived at with Valorant where they demand full kernel-level control over your system from boot to determine whether you are trying to cheat at their games or not.')
