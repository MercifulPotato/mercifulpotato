You are essentially running all plugins in its own processes. As I stated in other comments, the performance is improved even with the losses coming from context switching. The effect is I am able to run much more plugins than without jBridge without Ableton having a breakdown and task manager shows better core saturation. I also stated I don&#x27;t care about latency - I run my projects at 1024 buffer plus plugins introduce their own delays, so sometimes it takes a couple of seconds to hear something after hitting play. That&#x27;s fine as long as the playback is uninterrupted. I am running very CPU heavy plugins and that bring Ableton to its knees. Other DAWs handle it miles better - especially Reaper. Unfortunately I cannot get used to the workflow in other DAWs so I have to use workarounds. \nI am not sure why people keep defending this flawed architecture. It&#x27;s what makes the Ableton community so toxic, but still better than Bitwigs though - if you dare to comment you dislike something about Bitwig you likely get crucified.')
