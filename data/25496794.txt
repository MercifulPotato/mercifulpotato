Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25499102], score=None, time=1608570138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25495779, text='I used U+2718 HEAVY BALLOT X and forgot that it’d be trashed.<p>On the double escaping thing, I thought of it earlier on and was careful to make sure it did the right thing, but then I transformed the code in such a way that that it ended up being read by the HTML parser again, and neglected to switch it to double escaping, which was rather careless of me. \\u0026 can be more briefly written as &amp;amp; (saving one character) or \\x26 (saving two). I suppose this bumps my 229 up to 235 (the first of the three ampersands will be parsed correctly unescaped), and brings closer the possibility that DOM methods rather than crazy HTML strings may be more suitable (I think it was ending up something like ten or fifteen characters cheaper this way, even with escaping the value this long way).<p>I’m not willing to use &lt;xmp&gt; because it leaves a plausible injection attack open. In fact, I’d probably exploit it with my very first TODO item, “fix &lt;xmp&gt;…&lt;&#x2F;xmp&gt; injection attack”!<p>I like the way you’re thinking on these things. Not many people think of things like the double encoding, and although I didn’t think of &lt;xmp&gt; this time, I’ve definitely thought of it before on other similar things (and used it for fun on hard-coded values, but rejected it if user input is involved).<p>----<p>Taking a tip from the original challenger’s solution, I’ve refined my not-using-serialised-HTML solution down to 209 characters, once you replace \\u2718 with the actual character which HN eats. Here presented with the necessary wrapping in a data: URI for convenience (&lt;body&gt; now being necessary):<p><pre><code>  data:text&#x2F;html;charset=utf-8,&lt;body&gt;&lt;script&gt;d=document;e=(p,e,c)=&gt;(p.append(e=d.createElement(e)),c&amp;&amp;e.append(c),e);x=e(f=e(b=d.body,&quot;form&quot;),&quot;input&quot;);f.onsubmit=i=&gt;(e(i=e(l,&quot;li&quot;,x.value+&quot; &quot;),&quot;button&quot;,&quot;\\u2718&quot;).onclick=_=&gt;i.remove(),x.value=&quot;&quot;,!1);l=e(b,&quot;ul&quot;)&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;</code></pre>')
