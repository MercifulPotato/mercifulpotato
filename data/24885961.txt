You are thus dependent on the window manager you want to use to implement it. I asked the maintainer of the window manager I would want to use whether they would accept a PR for something like that and they said no, they would not.<p>So, I would have to maintain a fork of my window manager and compositor to keep using something like easystroke under Wayland, instead of using a finished tool that hasn&#x27;t needed any significant maintenance in 7 years.
