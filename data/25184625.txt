In JS when you make a wat you can generally debug it and fix it incredibly easily. In C when you wat, well, good luck.<p>A linter and Typescript and the fact that the &quot;wat&quot; stuff is actually almost always marginal and not commonly ran into in practice means you actually almost never are spending time on wat-ness at all in TS, where in C, a huge amount of time is spent there.<p>There&#x27;s a vast gulf of productivity between TS and C (the former winning). TS is an incredibly smart choice for many things small and large. But yes, if you need a lot of low level hooks and incredible performance, don&#x27;t use it.')
