In what way does contextualizing and centering human agency and humanity change how these questions are asked and considered in ways unavailable to us today?<p>Because today, Google’s search algorithm is assumed to have maximum value among the pieces, and Google gets to capture far more value than the people who generate the training data for search.<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t we need to consider the humanity of the person making the query, who may not want what the human who controls a given website that was scraped by the humans at Google wants?<p>Oh, absolutely! The point is that would further lower the weight&#x2F;importance&#x2F;power we ought to allocate to Google’s algorithms. Again, prioritizing the human roles &amp; needs, rather than fetishizing the “AI”.')
