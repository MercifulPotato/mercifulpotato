What a weird false equivalence to try to suggest.<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s probably part of a real justification narrative for trusting things like QAnon and talk radio over the mainstream media.  If you do that, you at least have to put them on the same level, and if it&#x27;s too difficult to build up things like the first two, then you can always try tear down the latter (since it&#x27;s easier to cherry-pick enough stuff to make that passably believable: just set a very high bar then catalog the inevitable times one of the thousands of journalists didn&#x27;t live up to it over the last century).')
