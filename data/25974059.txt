Don&#x27;t punching, hammering or other biomechanic also benefit from this? I&#x27;m not arguing the anatomy, just the &quot;rock throwing&quot; part.<p>I mean, throwing a rock might come in handy from time to time.. but it seems insufficient to be a driving force.. to me.  Spears maybe.. We even have evidence of neanderthal spear making... but that&#x27;s 1.5m years later.<p>You can make a living with a spear. Feeding a family by hunting birds with rocks seems near impossible. Seems like much less of a game changer than clubs, spears, digging sticks, etc. I can imagine a population dependent enough on these to create evolutionary pressures.<p>This is not an educated opinion... just a layman&#x27;s speculation.<p>Meanwhile, I also suspect that hunting plays a bigger role than currently fashionable. Chimps are basically bound to live where figs grow. They need a variety of fig trees, because different varieties fruit at different times. No figs, no chimps. Their diet defines their range.<p>Most modern foraging cultures rely heavily on food plants that require processing: cooking, soaking, pounding, grinding.... We&#x27;re not very good at digesting plants. Even chimps aren&#x27;t great at it.<p>Assuming earlier ancestors were chimp-like, I think they had to have widened their diets beyond fruit... That means either meat or harder to digest vegetables.<p>Paranthropus (a divergent family of human-like species) <i>do</i> seem adapted to a wider vegetable diet. Their skull was crested, like a gorilla, to facilitate gnawing on uncooked roots, leaves &amp; such. Homo &amp; Australopithecines don&#x27;t have such features. It just doesn&#x27;t seem as likely that we evolved the ability to eat a wider vegetable range than chimps, and then regressed to a narrower range again.<p>The invention of fire is often referred to as &quot;an external digestive system.&quot; You don&#x27;t really need this for meat. Fresh meat is digestible. Even chimps can eat fresh meat, and we&#x27;re more carnivorous than chimps. I think cooking, and other processing methods reintroduced us to vegetarian diets.<p>It&#x27;s actually really surprising that we don&#x27;t know what these early species ate. For most animals, diet defines lifestyle. A species that hunts or scavenges for most of its diet is subject to totally different pressures than a fig eater.')
