Justin might be familiar to some podcast listeners as a host of <i>My Brother My Brother and Me</i> or <i>Adventure Zone</i> while Sydnee is an MD.<p>They go through medical topics each week and a big portion of the episodes is Sydnee recounting the medical history of whatever their topic is, often citing Greek or Egyptian origins of disease or related treatments; I always find that portion of the show fascinating.')
