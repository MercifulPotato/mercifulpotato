I think that&#x27;s Swift, or Obj-C&#x27;s way of to-string&#x27;ing a null?<p>I have a generational suffix on my name. I often include it, and quite often as the proper Unicode character, e.g., &quot;Ⅲ&quot;. (Assuming HN displays it after I post this, try to select it; that&#x27;s one character.) That wreaks a fair bit of havoc.<p>When I was in high-school, I took physics. I was assigned to room, say, 309, to a teacher whose name I didn&#x27;t recognize. But I knew the teacher in room 309, and she even taught physics. So, I approached her, and asked, &quot;I&#x27;ve been assigned &#x27;Ms. Stewart&#x27;, but it lists her as being in your room. Do you know what the correct room number is, Ms. Cook?&quot; Right room; it was her maiden name, of course.<p>In my company&#x27;s HR system, we have to note some contacts, for things like life insurance payouts. My fiancée is one. Then we transitioned to a new system, and the data from the old system was migrated over. Now she&#x27;s my &quot;fiancÃ©e&quot;. (And in a separate system, she&#x27;s a he, because there was no option for &quot;fiancée&quot;, only &quot;fiancé&quot;.) Similarly (and a long time ago) I had to fix a contact&#x2F;directory system when it escaped a &#x27;. E.g., it would emit &quot;Marie O\\&#x27;Conner&quot;. PHP magic quotes… <i>shudders</i><p>(Character encodings and anything outside of ASCII, in particular, are an unending fountain of bugs.)<p>Just today, Azure&#x27;s support system can&#x27;t handle (among <i>many</i> things) the outlandish characters of &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot;. Which is great fun, since it&#x27;s not like anyone would file a highly-technical support request with Azure… right?<p>The missing hour in the DST spring-forward and the duplicate one on the fall-back are great hunting grounds for bugs, too. E.g., Google Calendar has issues with them.<p>We have a git branch prefix at work that triggers a special CI action. Let&#x27;s call it &quot;branchprefix&#x2F;&quot;. Every now and then a dev will make a branch with &quot;BranchPrefix&#x2F;&quot; and the OS X machines all start having issues since OS X&#x27;s file hierarchy isn&#x27;t case sensitive. (We&#x27;ve also had issues w&#x2F; two files, same name different case. git supports it, but OS X can&#x27;t cope.)<p>(All the names in this post are changed from their originals, of course. But you get the idea.)')
