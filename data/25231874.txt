My employer applied for a H1B&#x2F;E3&#x2F;TN adjustment of status so that I could continue working after the OPT expiration. Unfortunately the I797 came in after the OPT expiration date. Not only that, the approval notice came in after the 60 day post OPT grace period (and I didn&#x27;t leave the US). So, I overstayed on my OPT visa, but I am currently in the US on a valid visa. Should I expect problems in the future?  Am I still accruing unlawful presence due to overstaying the OPT? Or does the clock stop once I receive the I797.')
