Surgery was my answer, but it&#x27;s only a partial one. It&#x27;s a soft tissue tumour, the surgeon didn&#x27;t expect to get all of it, and it&#x27;s growing back now. It&#x27;s been about seven years, and I expect I&#x27;ll need surgery again within seven more years to be able to do simple tasks like lift objects with that hand still.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not diet - but it&#x27;s like the old climate change joke. What if I switched to a better diet and a healthier lifestyle, for no good reason?')
