Then you listen again, and voila, you interpret the audio as Y.  You&#x27;ve been primed to hear Y, so your brain hears it.<p>When you&#x27;ve been primed by all your anti-establishment media sources to see fraud, then you think back to that time 3 weeks ago when you thought you overheard two coworkers at the mail-sorting center talking about &quot;post-dating the ballots&quot;.  Well, maybe they didn&#x27;t say &quot;ballots&quot; exactly... But it was &quot;post-date the fourth&quot;, and surely they meant &quot;November 4th&quot;, right?  I mean election day was the 3rd, and they weren&#x27;t trying to count late ballots, were they?  But what else could they have meant?  And they sure looked suspicious when I came over and interrupted them.  I mean they didn&#x27;t mention ballots again that whole conversation because I guess they were worried I would tell someone.<p>Reading through some of the affidavits and watching the interviews gives the impression that these are well-intentioned folks who just wanted to report something without understanding the context, and they&#x27;ve been primed for fraud.  Unfortunately, they get picked up by politicians and media figures who have a clear pro vote-rigging agenda, and get made a martyr for the cause by plastering their face all over OANN, Project VERITAS, etc.  It&#x27;s depressing to watch.<p>Edit:  For fun, here&#x27;s a tweet demonstrating the audio-priming example you can try for yourself!\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BrianRoemmele&#x2F;status&#x2F;1086436669413183488" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BrianRoemmele&#x2F;status&#x2F;1086436669413183488</a>')
