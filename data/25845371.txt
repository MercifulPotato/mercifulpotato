Lets say you had a service for something packaged as EAR. You would then have to log in to the dashboard, add the package and configure it manually. If something changed with the package, you would probably have to reinstall it in WAS, you couldn&#x27;t just pull the newest from git in your repo and be done. And if that needed any config changes, everyone on the team had to do the same locally and manually in the control panel. When you got multiple moving parts, you would spend more time bringing them in and configuring everything correctly than actually developing whatever you were supposed to.<p>But what I wasted most time on was certificates. Everything had to be signed and stuff, mostly self signed by randoms and more theater than security. Sooo many times stopped working because the certificate for some module expired, or the CAS was unknown and had to be manually loaded into everyone&#x27;s local install etc.')
