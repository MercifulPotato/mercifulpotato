Once your aquifer is empty, you must ship water in.  Or desalinate.  That&#x27;s more like the real cost.<p>With a species of fish, the replacement is incalculable.  But one thing is clear.  The price should increase rapidly as it becomes scarcer, preserving the incentive to keep the population viable.<p>That can&#x27;t happen if people just pay the cost of going out there and getting the fish.  The price has to reflect the value of the fish too.<p>If the right too harvest a population were a piece of property that could be bought and sold, the incentive to preserve the population would be stronger.<p>You might even see technologies that avoid taken pregnant females and that count how many males there are so you have enough of those too.')
