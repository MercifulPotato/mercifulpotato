It reminds me of the games I used to play when I was younger. I remember playing COD4 back in the day and &quot;strafing&quot; being an important part of the gameplay. Another thing that every pro player did was reload animation cancelling. It allowed one to rapid fire snipers.<p>COD4 also had serverside mod support where upon connecting to a dedicated server, the client could choose to download these mods from the server. It was crazy what the community was able to come up with.<p>These days... well, surprisingly not so much has changed.
