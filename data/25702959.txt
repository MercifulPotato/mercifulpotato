Complex solutions are used to insinuate that the engineers who implemented them are solving complex problems. This in turn improves their marketability by insinuating they&#x27;ve got the razzle dazzle and trendiness under their belt that justifies $500k a year.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s also not resume-driven development, at least not intentionally. Sometimes it&#x27;s because the engineers just want to work on overcomplicated shit. For example I have my personal blog running on half a dozen AWS features - S3, Athena, Cloudfront, Cloudwatch, Lambda, SNS, SES, ...<p>I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> any of that for a simple blog, and I write on it like once a year. And the site is still slow as shit (relatively) even though it&#x27;s static because I haven&#x27;t optimized the font and script loads to be non-blocking. But it was fun to set up!')
