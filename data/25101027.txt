I found that for embedded C++ to be successful, you need to have some good (excellent sometimes was harmful, but that&#x27;s a different topic) C++ _as well as_ good domain and optimization skills. It&#x27;s a combination that is more and more scarce. C++ tends to be used in domains where size and speed matter. You need to know what the compiler and machine will do with your code to be fast. And what&#x27;s more, only the domain knowledge will let you pick the right data structures to be fast and compact in the first place.<p>And there are a lot of foot guns around... ;-)')
