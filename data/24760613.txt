Those 2 months then are a mixture of intensive job training and social events.<p>By the end, all of the new hires have received plenty of training, had good conversations with managers&#x2F;leadership about what type of work is expected, and IMO most importantly, have had a chance to make very strong bonds with coworkers that then become your &quot;cohort&quot; for the next 1-2 years that you can ask questions about work, collaborate, commiserate, or even become friends outside of work. The strong bond developed over those 2 months is important because that &quot;cohort&quot; is then more likely to stay in contact even after splitting up to work remotely.<p>I went through such a training program at the beginning of my career and it was the best company onboarding experience I&#x27;ve been through, not only in terms of personally enjoying it, but also just from the perspective of setting me up for success at the company and in my career.')
