It is a language that provides structure and meaning to otherwise static content.<p>The web browser is the equivalent of a WinForms or WPF application that interprets the HTML content and turns it into a visual presentation. CSS and JavaScript basically came along to help web browsers better present HTML content in fancier ways. But at the end of the day, it isn&#x27;t a framework and HTML is still just structured content, if not bastardized to force a certain UI presentation.<p>You can&#x27;t have fancy web applications without a web browser, just like you can&#x27;t have a native desktop application without a GUI chrome framework. When you speak to the overall footprint of a web application, the web browser and the functionality it provides has to be taken into consideration, when comparing to native desktop applications.<p>It really comes down to the classic client&#x2F;server problem - How much functionality is the client going to handle vs. the server? There is always going to be a compromise of size&#x2F;complexity&#x2F;performance when off-loading to the client, among other concerns. It really doesn&#x27;t matter what the client technology is, Flash, SilverLight, WebAssembly, Java, etc., they all will run into that same basic structural design issue.')
