It doesn’t have to be avant-garde to be worthwhile. Let me relate a fun little story.<p>In my last place I had to clean behind my stove due to a particularly nasty culinary accident. Among the odd things I found there was a kinda odd acrylic painting of a banana. It’s strokes are rough and it has an almost sickly blueish greenish hue, kinda over exposed.<p>When I moved recently, I was thinking what will I do with the banana painting? But hey, it’s art, I’d rather have it and enjoy it’s unique oddity than throw it out.<p>Don’t let anyone put art up in an inaccessible ivory tower. A doodle on the back of an envelope can bring more joy than a acclaimed masterpiece when you’ve got a free attitude.')
