And certainly teaching with your background sounds like a strong possibility if it appeals.<p>More generally, I would say that the key would be to target roles and teams that cross the boundary between pure research and software engineering, which could vary from straight research software engineer roles - with say, &quot;machine learning&quot; or tech associated with data science (e.g. &quot;jupyter&quot;) as an example of what you might search for in key skills and keyword filters; or by generally investigating the support roles within academic institutions because that can be a backdoor way in. Naturally the closer the research to your specific experience the stronger your application would be.<p>One way outside of the normal job search platforms you can identify those gaps is to keep an eye on conferences (especially during the present time while they are online) and the communities they serve and (e.g. if you are a coder) the most widely used code libraries as referenced in academic papers; apart from giving you an idea of where your skills might plug a gap they offer scope for networking in the former case.<p>Sorry to be vague&#x2F;obvious or responding to a different question, but I don&#x27;t have specific examples to mind, this is just what I have seen actually working as a strategy into data science-related roles in similar institutions with people <i>without</i> your enhanced qualifications (stem phd and industry data science experience).')
