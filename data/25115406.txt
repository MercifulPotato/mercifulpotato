But instead we have news and social media shouting from the rooftops that everyone is going to die or have some nightmarish long-term effects.  All of which are no more significant than the risks people take every day on _purpose_.  Driving, hiking, swimming, socializing, getting drunk, etc.  Sure it&#x27;s communicable - we&#x27;ve been happily spreading communicable diseases for millennia that kill people.  Nature is cruel.  But don&#x27;t expect society to stop &quot;living&quot; to avoid dying.')
