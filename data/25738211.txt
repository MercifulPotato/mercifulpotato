But these tools don&#x27;t work for teams. Big tech companies that can afford dedicated platform teams tend to build self-service tools for developers on top of AWS &#x2F; Azure &#x2F; GCP to launch new services and manage environments. But smaller teams who can&#x27;t afford it are out of luck. If they have DevOps expertise in the team then they&#x27;ll write a lot of repetitive Terraform, and if they don&#x27;t they&#x27;ll often struggle for weeks learning all the AWS concepts and make lots of mistakes.<p>We thought this is wrong, and built Digger<p>Digger manages your cloud account, allows to create apps and microservices from templates (can be custom), generates and runs Terraform, and manages environments. So developers get modern Vercel-like experience while DevOps engineers still retain full control. Starting on AWS with Digger is just as simple as on Heroku, but cheaper and you get a future-proof stack with DevOps best practices.')
