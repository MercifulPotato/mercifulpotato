Most of them do the same stuff as the tools available 15-20 years ago (Microsoft Office, Skype, Moodle), only more clumsily&#x2F;slowly and with more dependencies.<p>If school administration were to save money using subsidized Chromebooks, they could save even more money by stubbornly remaining in the paper age. Teachers would be happier too, and students would at the very least be not worse off; I am even willing to say that they would be forced to learn analog skills that are desperately needed nowadays.<p>In short, I do not buy that it is lack of options that force schools to buy those products. It is the evil wizardry called &quot;Marketing&quot; that bewitch school administrators and prevent them to see the options in front of their noses.')
