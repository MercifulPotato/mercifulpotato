Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604918921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031229, text='&gt; VSCode always looks and feels like a webapp that runs locally.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s snappy, and the only thing that feels out of place is the different keyboard shortcuts on macOS and windows&#x2F;linux, but that&#x27;s what you get by integrating with your platform.<p>&gt; Give me menus, give me toolbars, give me rich visualisation. I don&#x27;t care about excuses for not being to take advantage of the hardware, or about how fast it is for a webapp. I want a native executable.<p>Vscode gives you menus, and I don&#x27;t see any technical limitation for vscode to provide native toolbars, except that usability-wise they are awful and a step-back from vscode&#x27;s use of its spotlight-like command line interface.<p>And hey, truthfully all of these issues are nit-picking, and meanwhile kate was not used as an example of anything worth having. That says a lot.')
