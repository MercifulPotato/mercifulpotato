Item(by='adamsea', descendants=None, kids=[25670666], score=None, time=1610023947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670136, text='&gt; My experience is that the stance the Democrats take is the opposite of the stance the Republicans take, and vice-versa. If one party flips on an issue, the other almost immediately flops.<p>I’m sorry but that is way too reductive. For one thing, there’s a bipartisan consensus (for better or worse) on a lot of foreign policy, which is a pretty huge area.<p>And, your comment obscures the meaningful differences in ideology between the groups of people each party represents. And the different interests of those groups.<p>The Democrats are far from perfect. But it’s not a “both sides equally bad” situation.<p>Well, maybe it is when it comes to corporate money in politics. But even there you see bipartisan consensus on the fringes, I think, plus iirc the Republicans were basically all about Citizens United.<p>But yeah money in politics is a big problem on both sides. To be fair, it’s been a big problem in all of politics throughout all recorded history.<p>Which doesn’t mean we can’t (and haven’t) made some progress.')
