Plain Old JavaScript Objects. Using a library such as Redux is a dumb way, but this is the community-embraced, herd-mentality way.<p>Redux is really just a pattern for business logic using POJO - you have a function that takes an update and returns the new state. The library itself is about a hundred lines.<p>&gt; Use Web Components. Using the flavor-of-the-month JavaScript libs for a large application that must live years or decades is not justifiable.<p>How is web components not just another flavor-of-the-month JavaScript library, and an unpopular one at that? Sure, it&#x27;s part of the browser instead of something you load externally, but I&#x27;m not sure that changes things in any meaningful way. You&#x27;re still tightly binding your code to something which may or may not remain popular.')
