Either you make the synthetic fuel at the exhaust stack of a fossil fuel plant (so you still have to burn fossil fuels) or you spend huge amounts of energy collecting CO2 from the air (is that even a proven process yet?)<p>Hydrogen has a straightforward and well understood process to make it from water. What&#x27;s the hydrocarbon equivalent?<p>Is there a better way to make synthetic fuels?')
