In fact, I find that programmers (and STEM people in general) tend to look down on remembering things since &quot;you can just Google it&quot;.<p>However, after working with some very smart people I have a newfound respect for memory. The problem with &quot;I&#x27;ll just Google it when I need it&quot; is that often great ideas and solutions are based on information that you remember, but you won&#x27;t get any of those ideas or come up with those solutions if the building blocks aren&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s like trying to build a house with half the foundation missing. Remembering things allows you to build new theories and solutions to problems that you could never come up with if you didn&#x27;t remember those things.')
