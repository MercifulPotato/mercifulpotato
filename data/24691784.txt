Item(by='porker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601930427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24691316, text='&gt; As an avid anti-ageist, in fact I&#x27;m rather disappointed about that last point. I&#x27;ve met many programmers at around or above my age that have gotten completely stuck into a tiny niche of experience and, even there, seem to not really have progressed much in terms of depth.<p>I&#x27;m the same age as you and consider this a narrow characterisation of an older programmer.<p>I know there are better younger programmers than me. I know that I&#x27;ve got suck with the same experience over and over, because as I got more senior, that&#x27;s what people wanted from me.<p>I also know that the breadth of other skills I bring is significantly more than a young programmer. I&#x27;ve had to master how to deal with management, seen projects fail for many different reasons, mentored juniors, pulled together international teams of programmers (with varying success - motivating certain nationalities is a skill I&#x27;ve yet to gain), architected projects, held the peace between junior programmers who saw everything in black and white, and continued to write code that was distinctly less buggy than others.<p>I am a programmer. One who needs to take a sabbatical and learn some new programming languages, but at heart I am someone who makes stuff happen by writing software. I like working with younger and older programmers (the oldest is in his early 60s); both keep me sharp and challenge my outlook.<p>But if you look at my resume, sure I&#x27;ve gotten completely stuck and haven&#x27;t progressed in terms of depth.')
