Price increases is not inflation. Price increases can be caused by inflation. Prices can remain nominally the same while money supply has increased.<p>&gt; So, do prices rise just because a certain amount of dollars were added to an economy ? No, certainly not. Which is why the money printing should only happen when the economy is dysfunctional.<p>The prices while having not risen nominally are still artificially inflated. A dysfunctional economy is not a real thing. It is just the economy. If you are referring to a recession, printing money during a recession arguably may not cause prices to rise nominally, but it artificially inflates them. During a recession prices typically go down due to falling demand. This is a good thing. It allows people who are suffering to enjoy lower prices. Recessions are a healing process for a previous period of misallocation of resources. Money printing only serves to exacerbate and extend the misallocation. As the period of misallocation is extended and exacerbated, the recession necessary to balance that is larger and more frightening.<p>We left the gold standard because we were afraid to deal with the recession from the spending of &#x27;60s and we&#x27;ve been afraid to deal with our issues ever since. One day we won&#x27;t have a choice. Tough times are ahead.')
