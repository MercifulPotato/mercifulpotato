Both for users and producers.</i><p>Because of the fragmentation of the phone market, specifically with-in even a single manufacturer&#x27;s sphere.<p>There was so much variation in screen size, CPU power, memory, keyboard layout even for (say) Nokia&#x27;s own line of products that Nokia&#x27;s own app store had to ask &quot;<i>which phone do you have?</i>&quot;. It was a non-uniform mess because the phones available pre-iPhone were a a non-uniform mess.<p>Apple&#x27;s iOS App Store was able to have a simple design because the iPhone(s) available had a simple design, and developers could write to a known quantity. When Apple changed screen size&#x2F;resolution&#x2F;density they ensured that scaling from older non-updated apps occurred in a reasonable manner.<p>To a certain extent this is still true with Android, as third-party manufacturers have spotty updates once hardware is released. Google used to have a public dashboard with the market share of each version, but now you have to go into the Android Studio to look at the minimum SDK cumulative market share:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;android-version-distribution-statistics-android-studio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;android-version-distribution-...</a><p>Their current dashboard has some data on screen capabilities, OpenGL, and Vulkan:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;dashboards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;dashboards</a><p>Meanwhile with iOS if you target iOS 12 you&#x27;ll get 94% of that market:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;app-store&#x2F;</a><p>If you need to worry about hardware capabilities, iOS 14 supports the iPhone 6S (released 2015) so that can be used a minimum (at least for &#x27;low-intensity&#x27; stuff, i.e., not-games).')
