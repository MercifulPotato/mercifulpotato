There are helpers for working with images that can generate multiple versions, transform to WebP and other stuff. This is where most of the optimization work goes I think.<p>&gt; Most of the time when I see the &quot;new hotness&quot; being advertised, there don&#x27;t really seem to be any specifics that tackle advanced use-cases so it&#x27;s difficult to accurately assess whether the technology is worth serious consideration<p>I&#x27;m also averse to &#x27;hotness&#x27; but at the same time, consideration should be given based on use case. I can&#x27;t talk for advanced use-cases with Next.JS but using it for the one off freelancing simple website gig, it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air.<p>There&#x27;s also a customer serving around 100.000 pregenerated web pages (simple stuff, catalog item with pictures, related items and people linked to it) and the speed is insane for navigating their internal catalogue :)')
