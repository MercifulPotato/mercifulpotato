If you need any complex logic, you have to use a for-loop. So -- when written by a developer with these perspectives -- a for-loop signals complicated iteration logic and a list comprehension signals simple iteration logic. But you could do either with both if you chose. So, it&#x27;s a style choice that can be used to convey meaning.')
