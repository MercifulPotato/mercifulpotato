Item(by='bregma', descendants=None, kids=[25969649], score=None, time=1612015688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968551, text='I don&#x27;t know about you, but where I live the government provides reasonably coherent and researched information on the therapeutic value of cannabinoids [0]. There are also government grants available for legitimate research in the field. Not to mention several subjurisdictions in which the governments hold the legal monopoly on sales and distribution of cannabis product.<p>It was edifying to read in senate committee reports, during the run-up to full nationwide legalization a few years ago, that no better treatment for anorexia and nausea due to anti-cancer chemotherapy has been found than THC, that CBD has clinically significant effects on certain kinds of epilepsy, that a combination of the two has been clinically demonstrated to slow the growth of certain neuromas, and that use of cannabis as an anti-anxiety drug is strongly contraindicated because of a marked rebound effect. All of these facts, and many others (like cannabis use with MS: no published study has shown any effect), footnoted and linked to published, peer-reviewed literature. Unfortunately I can no longer find the original report to the committee but I did find the official government communication (see [0]).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;health-canada&#x2F;services&#x2F;drugs-medication&#x2F;cannabis&#x2F;information-medical-practitioners&#x2F;information-health-care-professionals-cannabis-cannabinoids.html#a4.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canada.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;health-canada&#x2F;services&#x2F;drugs-medica...</a>')
