The former two are similar in flavor, probably exactly the same aside from amount of grounds used per cup of joe. French press is a bit stronger flavor, usually slightly more bitter as well. It can be slightly chalky, but if you&#x27;re picking grounds from your teeth you might be doing it wrong.<p>The moka pot is miles ahead of all the rest in terms of flavor and texture. It isn&#x27;t quite as creamy and rich as a good shot of espresso, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close for what it is. It&#x27;s certainly better than a mediocre espresso, like you might get at a drive-through coffee shack (could be my beans more than anything, hard to know for sure). There is a pressure buildup and a rapid extraction time with the moka pot that certainly changes the interaction between hot water and ground coffee. If you are picking grounds from your teeth with a moka pot you are 100% doing it wrong and probably ruining the coffee in the process.<p>I don&#x27;t bother with the chemex (isn&#x27;t this just a retro style of pour over?) and aeropress because I&#x27;m not really into gimmicks :)')
