In the case of Android, Google was terrified of being leaped or replaced in the shift to mobile, inflection points in the landscape are when monopolies in tech are at their most vulnerable. The parent&#x27;s point was not that search wasn&#x27;t already dominant, it&#x27;s that Chrome helps to protect that dominance.<p>Microsoft used the exact same tactic repeatedly. It&#x27;s one of the cornerstones of any dominant corporation, to build and leverage moats to keep competition at bay.')
