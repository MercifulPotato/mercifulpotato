It would be really great to have a verdict on it with an in depth reason of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot;.<p>I have considered studying physics myself to answer the question (free education FTW), but won&#x27;t have the time for another 3-4 years (unless I happen upon a hundred thousand euros or so to pay my living expenses during the 3-5 years of study). Paying an expert to do it seems reasonable.<p>Do free lance researchers exist?')
