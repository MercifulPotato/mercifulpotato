The carbon footprints of these are huge.  To then have the argument that we need to do something about climate change is so hypocritical.  Just do proper forest management and keep the climate change for a different topic is my opinion on it.  Because, if people really cared about global warming by lowering their usage of things, this is the wrong state to ever even come close to doing it.')
