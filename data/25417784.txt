Deployments must even be carried out using different accounts than those used to access internal services, for security and auditing purposes.<p>There are of course good reasons for this; accidents, malicious engineers, overzealous engineers, lost&#x2F;stolen equipment, risk avoidance, etc.<p>When you apply this rule, it makes for more process and perhaps slower response times to problems, but accidents or other internal-related issues mentioned above drop to zero.<p>Given how easy it is to destroy things these days with a single misplaced Kubernetes or Docker command, safeguards need to be put in place.<p>Let me tell you a little story from my experience;<p>I built myself a custom keyboard from a Numpad kit. I had gotten tired of typing so many docker commands in every day and I had the desire to build something. I built this little numpad into a full blown Docker control centre using QMK. A single key-press could deploy or destroy entire systems.<p>One day, something slid off of something else on my desk, onto said keyboard, pressing several of the keys while I happened to have an SSH session to a remote server in focus.<p>Suffice it to say, that little keyboard has never been seen since. On an unrelated topic, I don&#x27;t have SSH access to production systems.')
