In the extreme case, you won’t get shot by a cop for being old while arguably being black increases that probability.<p>But it’s not only race discrimination at play, there are other possible discriminations also more powerful than age, like gender, income or class.<p>So you put more weight to a discrimination that affects you the most because you probably don’t belong to other categories, hence the guess that you are a white male.<p>I am probably over reacting given the HN demographic and also because you did not do it in bad faith but just wanted to point it out.')
