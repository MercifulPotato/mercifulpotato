But yes, I do still feel that every year it still gets a lot better... but perhaps the &quot;massiveness&quot; is indeed decreasing.<p>The phone isn&#x27;t even how I ever choose to spend my free time; it&#x27;s a last resort. I am known at work as the curmudgeonly phone-hater, always astonished that people use their phone to say, order from Amazon or UberEats, or reply to an email — surely such tasks are better left until you are at a large-screen device with high-precision input devices! (I mainly read or listen to stuff with it.)<p>Nevertheless, I use my phone in the elevator, while waiting for a train, while waiting in any kind of line, while, uh, you know on the toilet, etc... even if relegated to garbage time, it&#x27;s still dozens of times per day.<p>I think it is even less that $5 per day — recently I buy the $1700 maxed out phone but usually sell it for $800 or so. So maybe $3 per day. Worth it, IMO.')
