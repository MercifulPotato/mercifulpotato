The author focused most of his article on the process of reading, and its long term neurological and physiological effects on the reader. In other words, he&#x27;s not so much saying that people don&#x27;t know enough, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;ve lost the ability to focus for long periods of time. It&#x27;s an attention deficit argument, not an illiteracy argument.<p>(I think the article is poorly argued and doesn&#x27;t support itself well; I also think it&#x27;s probably observing something that is worth continued study)')
