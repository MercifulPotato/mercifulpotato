That is of course the focal point of any code I write for this, and it’s very tricky. To perhaps give you a little more confidence that I might figure this out, I know it’s not as simple as forwarding midi data through WebRTC and playing it on receipt on the other end ;)<p>This gist of how I do it now is conceding to the fact that network latency exists and having a sort of buffer that allows midi note data to arrive out of order but be played back at the original timings (just delayed)')
