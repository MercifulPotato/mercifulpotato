This mitigates most of the potential downside to litigation, capping your exposure to a known (controllable) quantity.<p>But even then, it&#x27;s still a huge problem in Commonwealth countries. I&#x27;m more interested to know if it&#x27;s less of an issue in civil law jurisdictions like Germany.')
