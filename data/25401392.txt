If you buy a log aggregation platform like Splunk Cloud or Loggly the pricing is likely based on the quantity of data you ingest per day.<p>This can set up a weird incentive. If you are already close to the limit of your plan, you&#x27;ll find that engineers are discouraged from logging new things.<p>This can have a subtle effect on your culture. Engineers who don&#x27;t want to get into a budgeting conversation will end up avoiding using key tools, and this can cost you a lot of money in terms of invisible lost productivity.<p>Tools that charge per-head have a similar problem: if your analytics tool charges per head, your junior engineers won&#x27;t have access to this. This means you won&#x27;t build a culture where engineers use analytics to help make decisions.<p>This is a very tricky dynamic. On the one hand it&#x27;s clearly completely crazy to invest in building your own logging or analytics solutions - you should be spending engineering effort solving the problems that are unique to your company!<p>But on the other hand, there are significant, hard-to-measure hidden costs of vendors with billing mechanisms that affect your culture in negative ways.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution to this. It&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve encountered that makes the &quot;build v.s. buy&quot; decision a lot more subtle than it can first appear.')
