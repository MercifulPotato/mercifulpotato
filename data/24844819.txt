It would be a death blow for Mozilla if google was taken out of the running altogether, simply because then their BATNA would be DDG. It&#x27;s not clear if anti-trust action against google will affect Google&#x27;s ability to buy default traffic from Mozilla, which is why they haven&#x27;t taken a particularly strong position yet. Some forms of anti trust action could help Mozilla by bolstering competitors, but other types of actions could hurt Mozilla. It seems like a wait and see kind of thing.')
