Arguably it was long time ago and maybe the company changed, but I do not think I will ever use it, because there&#x27;s plenty of sites which fulfil my needs.<p>Problems for me with AirBnb (and their hosts) are:<p>- Pricing dark patterns. Fees balloon the price above the price of proper hotels.<p>- You can avoid cleaning fees, but then you will get filthy apartment for outrageous money. Even proper hostel would be better thing for your money then.<p>- No where to complain other than to airbnb itself, as hosts usually are not registered businesses.<p>All in all what I got from AirBnb is what they were creating - couchsurfing for money, but shittier. You pay price of a hotel, but get someones shitty couch, without socialisation, experience sharing, etc.')
