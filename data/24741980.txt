I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of a couple &#x27;Statistical Learning 101&#x27; courses. These courses go roughly as he describes it in his blog post: they first teach you how to multiply two matrices, then launch into linear and logistic regression, then classification via clustering, then decision trees and SVMs, then CNNs and deep learning. Along the way, they do a lecture or two on reinforcement learning and HMMs.<p>In the end, I ended up with a thin smear of half-baked knowledge in my head, where I stop understanding the math once we are half-way through the material.<p>So how to you achieve this level of deep&#x2F;intuitive understanding:<p>&gt; Without understanding the mathematical underpinnings of key models and techniques in full detail, students arenâ€™t able to quickly choose the right models for certain scenarios.<p>Does anyone have a good study plan with MOOCs and so on? If you have any practical advice, I would appreciate it!')
