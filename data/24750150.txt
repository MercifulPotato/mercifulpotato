The reader is assumed to be sufficiently intelligent to work out that day-old sushi was not actually exchanged in a quid-pro-quo. It is darkly comic but surely isn&#x27;t funny. The morally and ethically wanton ridculousness of it is what frames the image according to Taibi in his writing. He&#x27;s deeply aware of what is going on there, suggesing he isn&#x27;t is really missing the point totally.<p>Taibi does not write with a style I particularly like. Taibi&#x27;s politics are not my own. What he does is write masssive stories that are being ignored elsewhere. Wall street criminality. Russia-conspiracy theories discrediting media. Defence funding and contracting. There is always a campaign to discredit him becuase he upsets wealthy, corrupt assholes by shining a light on their behaviour. I wish journalists whose style I cared for more did that. I wish jouranlists whose politics are closer to my own did that. Taibi does do it and that alone is deeply, deeply impressive. We need a lot more of that with many different perspectives and different writing styles. I&#x27;ll happily start with Taibi because he&#x27;s doing it and support him totally that he actually does it.<p>I&#x27;m sticking up for Taibi even though I dislike his style and his politics because he&#x27;s a journalist practisising journalism and not a cheerleader who is playing an acting role of a journalist on tv. Journalism is to be encouraged. Unfair criticisms of journalism should be called out. Yours is such, be that intentionally or not.')
