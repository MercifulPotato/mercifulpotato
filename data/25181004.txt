I&#x27;ve even seen groupsets in boxes on the shelf at bike shops, priced higher than bikes on the showroom floor with that same groupset installed.<p>And somehow the bike retailers get furious at their own customers for seeking out the lower-priced options, instead of being furious with shimano for ripping them off.')
