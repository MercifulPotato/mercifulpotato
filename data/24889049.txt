For example maybe I&#x27;m using a library that provides a struct A. I can make another struct B that mocks that functionality for testing, and then everywhere in my code use an interface C that encapsulates A and B. That wouldn&#x27;t be possible if A had to explicitly declare that it implements C.<p>If you want to explicitly declare that you implement an interface.. just put it in the comments, or it&#x27;s common to see a line like this after a struct declaration:<p><pre><code>  var _ C = (*A)(nil);\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a way of asserting that A satisfies C.')
