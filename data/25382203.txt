Cities can and should be livable.<p>Strongtowns is a advocacy site and I don’t agree with everything. But they make a great point about inequity and hidden costs. In New York, for example, “cities” are responsible for all road maintenance... towns are not, and suburban towns get to have the state and county maintain major roads, as one example, and usually get more state aid dollars. Suburbs tend to drive up sewer and utility costs as well.<p>On the revenue side, the throwaway development of malls, etc 30 years ago killed urban commercial districts and left us with a bunch of declining junk as these facilities depreciate away.')
