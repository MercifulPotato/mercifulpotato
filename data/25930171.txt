A small dairy like the one above can only maintain so many animals at a time.<p>This is a dairy farm, so it should not be expected to abide by the ethics of vegan people. I posted the article, so I feel compelled to apologise if this was the impression it gives. For me it was obvious that the cows and the calves are eventually meat for eating.<p>Edit: Note that calves are normally killed for meat at a time between 12-18 weeks. The idea of this system is to avoid causing undue distress to the cows by taking away their calves too early. This is a valid concern as some people do not like to eat very young animals and are uncomfortable with the distress caused to cows separated from their calves immediately after birth, as is typical in industrial farming.')
