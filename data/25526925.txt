Thanks! For the curious, it is a real vt220, and I have it connected to Arch Linux (fully up to date, well, except for the hardware). It&#x27;s connected with a DB29-&gt;DB9 null modem cable I made from a breadboard, a bunch of jumper cables, and a DB9 header, which is in turn connected to a simple RS232 USB serial cable.')
