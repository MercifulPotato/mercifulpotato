(Docker, WSL, Vagrant etc...).<p>I&#x27;d like to invoke them with just (eg.) .&#x2F;dostuff.py - Python, Ruby etc... have absolutely no problem running files containing Win-style line-endings. The only issue is that &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env complains that it can&#x27;t find (eg.) &quot;python3\\n&quot;.<p>Yes, I know I could convert these files with dos2unix, and I also know that I can just invoke the interpreter explicitly - but I&#x27;m lazy, and this seems like such a trivial thing to solve that I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not been done already.<p>I&#x27;ve taken to actually recompiling &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env to strip trailing whitespace from the executable name - but there must be a better solution.')
