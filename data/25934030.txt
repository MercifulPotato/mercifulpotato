I think the challenge is more subtle, let me walk through a scenario.<p>100 shares exist, all owned by person A. They lend all the shares to a short-seller, who sells them to B. Then B lends 40 of those shares back to the short seller, who sells them to C.<p>Now 140% of existing shares are shorted. But 240 shares are &quot;owned&quot; in some sense. A &quot;owns&quot; 100 shares and B &quot;owns&quot; 100 shares and C &quot;owns&quot; 40 shares.<p>What&#x27;s not clear to me is which of these shares are available to be bought by the short seller. I assume you can&#x27;t sell your shares if they&#x27;re loaned out. So the short seller can first buy 40 shares from C and deliver to B. Then he has to buy 100 from B, including the shares he just delivered, and give them all to A.')
