They&#x27;re even cheaper than x86 servers.  (Though also slower, at least AWS&#x27;s version.)<p>Realistically, ARM is probably the future, and just needs something to push society in the direction of the future.  A lot of people use Macs, so this forces people to become interested in switching, which has some value.  Remember when the original iMac had USB instead of ADB ports?  Everyone was mad about it.  But USB was the future -- you can plug that iMac&#x27;s mouse into pretty much any computer you have and it still works.<p>(I&#x27;ve been wanting an ARM desktop for a while, but it seems there is trouble standardizing something like BIOS&#x2F;UEFI, and the CPUs you can buy are more expensive and slower than x86 alternatives.  I&#x27;m also not sure if anyone ever decided what the standard &quot;ARM&quot; configuration looks like... binary calling conventions, endianness, supported instructions?  But, if Apple can make a competitive ARM chip, so can others, and the standards will follow.  We&#x27;ll see!)')
