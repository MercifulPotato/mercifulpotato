Just cut out the sugar, move around, and eat more plants. &quot;<p>Too many people are still in thrall of the calories in - calories out principle.<p>It seems to appeal especially to nerds, the idea of reducing something as complex as metabolism into a simple accounting trick is just too attractive, and so is the idea that only &quot;unused, extra energy&quot; gets converted to body fat and that everything is question of raw willpower.<p>It is not so simple, if you live in a state of chronic hyperinsulinemia, you won&#x27;t be able to mobilize stored fat, it is just biochemically impossible, adipose cells just will not release any stored fat if insulin is high. Of course, then you start to be hungry, then you eat some &#x27;extra&#x27; calories even though you have ample fat reserves.<p>But the core of the problem isn&#x27;t willpower. It is inability of the human body to burn its own fat for consumption if insulin levels are chronically high.<p>Of course, that leads to weight gain. And one of the main culprits is sugar. Excessive amounts of sugar will mess with your insulin secretion and sensitivity.')
