Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605648886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127900, text='The free market has a tendency to optimize for profit, and fairly often short-term profit. Yes, that necessarily means companies must have customers willing to pay them, and so a certain amount of quality of product &amp; service must be present, but it does not optimize for everyone to own specific product even if everyone wants that product.<p>Saying the market can solve the problem of healthcare for everyone is a bit like saying it should be able to solve the problem of providing flagship-quality phones for everyone. But in fact, given the &quot;law&quot; of supply &amp; demand, a product like healthcare which is in demand by literally every single person, yet constrained by supply, the solution the market converges on is going to extract the most amount of money it can from however many customers can be served by the available supply.<p>Supply constraints are also one of the problems I would, given complete faith in market forces, expect the market to solve but it has not done that either. Market forces did not prevent or resolve the dumping of cancer-causing chemicals, or known cancer-causing product like cigarettes to be removed, or any number of other undesirable things whose costs end up being paid by society as a whole rather than a given individual(s) responsible for the problem. When the market fails to solve a problem, some other force needs to intervene.<p>Maybe a free market purist would say we didn&#x27;t give it long enough to solve these problems. I don&#x27;t believe that, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s true: Saying the market will eventually solve a problem, when human lives or suffering are at risk, is a bit like saying evolution will eventually solve a problem. It may be true, but the timescales involved are sufficiently long to render their eventual solution irrelevant to the people who die or suffer before it materializes.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to know the best way to do this, and perhaps my analysis above is incomplete or over-simplified, but the point stands that the market has not solved this problem, and does not show signs of doing so.')
