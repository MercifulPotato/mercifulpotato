Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611863761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25946210, text='There is a specific case where you start a sentence with &#x27;but&#x27;: when you want to give someone time to accept the previous statement before demolishing it. This is what we all know, and we all agree that we see it. But what we know is not right, and here&#x27;s why.<p>If a person is using And and But equally, they just like the mental pause between their statements. The period is more of an ellipsis. If your reader needs a mental pause before an And, before a second piece of information, maybe your information is too dense and you should free the new information to stand alone. Possibly in a new paragraph.<p>As in, &quot;The other thing that&#x27;s cool about this process is that it also does blah. Which is useful for these reasons...&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know how other people develop a theory of a system, but if you want to change mine, if <i>I</i> want to change mine, I have to &#x27;walk into it&#x27; see what&#x27;s wrong with it, deconstruct it and put it back together the new way. If you don&#x27;t bring me through this, I&#x27;m going to make you stop talking, back up, and walk me through it anyway. Otherwise your next best outcome is that later than night when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth I realize you&#x27;re right and we pick it back up tomorrow. If it&#x27;s in writing, I can only make you back up by skipping back a few paragraphs, or writing a response that you may or may see. If your proposal is too woo, I&#x27;ll just be writing you off entirely.')
