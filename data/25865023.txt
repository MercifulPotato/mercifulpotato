They are doing careful tuning of the motor inverter controls to minimize energy use from motors that aren&#x27;t under active load. Tesla refers to this as &quot;Torque Sleep&quot;<p>I imagine the process is basically tuning for the inverter output that minimizes power consumed as well as drag on the axle when the motor is not supplying active torque, or at least supplying less active torque than the other axle.')
