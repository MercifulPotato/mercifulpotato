Basically just an extra camera and a LIDAR sensor that nobody knows what to do with yet. Oh, and a shiny stainless-steel band around the edge.<p>I think what Apple has realized is that a certain subset of their customers will <i>always want the best model</i>, no matter how little sense the price makes compared to the regular model. For some people, it will always be a status symbol (or an enthusiast&#x27;s obsession). Or they&#x27;re of the economic class where $300 just doesn&#x27;t even register on their budget. As one reviewer put it, the 12 Pro is &quot;the shiny one&quot;, and for some people that&#x27;s all it takes.<p>What this amounts to is that these whales can subsidize things like the $400 SE model, which is an <i>incredible</i> value. And I&#x27;m completely fine with that arrangement personally.')
