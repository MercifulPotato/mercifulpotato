For your own classes and services, nothing is stopping you.  You can new up classes without DI all day long.  ASP.NET does layer on it&#x27;s things using DI, but it&#x27;s boilerplate built into templates.  For example, OOB you may use the built in UserManager to authenticate users and store their info in a db.  If you want to customize that and NOT use the built-in, you may have 10-20 lines to write in Startup.cs to inject a different UserManager or configure the built-in one differently.  I&#x27;ve never felt it was massive or wasted my time vs Node&#x2F;express work I&#x27;ve done.')
