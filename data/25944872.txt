When these clients lose money on GME <i>et al</i>, there will almost certainly be a class-action lawsuit for some fraction of their collective losses. And Robinhood&#x27;s lawyers will almost certainly recommend they settle. That is the risk, beyond margin lending and options settlement, they are seeking to mitigate.<p>(Also, when that money is lost, there is a decent chance Robinhood will be fined by half the regulators on this planet for inducing people to overtrade through its gameified interface or something like that.)')
