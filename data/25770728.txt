It works great if you&#x27;re on Android. Doesn&#x27;t have an iOS client though.<p>Nice thing about Syncthing is you can entirely configure what you are syncing and how. I literally press one button on my phone, it creates a backup, and that backup is sent to my server.<p>I would go as far to say that Android&#x27;s killer app <i>is</i> Syncthing. Yes, I&#x27;m putting this on the same level as iMessage for iOS. It&#x27;s that good. If I ever switch back to iPhone I will really miss it.')
