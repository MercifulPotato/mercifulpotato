Are not symmetries necessarily the transformations which conserve quantities, and the types of symmetry equivalent to the type of conservation?<p>Because Noether got a lot of respect for her work despite working (in a time of great sexism, no less!), I know that either I have totally misunderstood or this is a Columbus’ Egg [0] — but I am curious <i>which</i>, and if it isn’t a Columbus’ Egg, what I’ve misunderstood (assuming that sort of thing can even fit into a HN-sized reply and I’m not asking something that would normally be the conclusion of a final year degree level physics module).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Egg_of_Columbus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Egg_of_Columbus</a>')
