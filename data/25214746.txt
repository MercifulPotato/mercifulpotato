If eating animals and plants is the same, then isn&#x27;t eating non-human and human animals the same?<p>If you do have a moral problem with eating humans, then you probably have moral hierarchy - humans&#x27; lives are the most important, and every other life is less important.<p>Some vegetarians have a different moral hierarchy - animals&#x27; lives are most important, then plants&#x27; lives. You can value plants&#x27; lives, and treat plants with respect, and still decide that you&#x27;re morally okay with eating plants.')
