It&#x27;s not because &quot;resumes are not written in a programming language.&quot;<p>I personally grokked it when I was writing up some peer review. I thought I was making a compelling case: I showed where he had solved a tough problem, how he worked through problems, resolved it and thought I was establishing that the guy was on an upward trajectory.<p>My manager kicked it back and was trying to explain what he needed. We went back and forth, and finally he said, &quot;look, I&#x27;m going to be in a room full of other managers, and I need ammo to get Chris a promotion.&quot;<p>That was when it clicked. I had learned persuasive writing in an environment where it pays to spend a lot of time making your case. But on a promotion board, there might be a dozen managers trying to get a word in edgewise, so they need to make their case with simple, unambiguous facts.<p>So it&#x27;s a matter of it being a writing style that meets a specific need, and which engineers aren&#x27;t trained in.')
