There is no way an OS update can cause this (barring some massive Apple bug which is unlikely); more likely the device firmware mishandles some valid standard USB commands that older OSes didn&#x27;t issue.<p>In general, it&#x27;s quite common for USB device firmware to be of extremely poor quality; it&#x27;ll be tested and bugs fixed until it works with the target OSes and drivers, but no comprehensive testing of whether it can deal with all possible standard request patterns is done.')
