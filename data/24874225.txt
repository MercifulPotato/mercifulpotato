Legally correct means primarily correct with respect to the colour[0] of a thing. Technical correctness disregards colour entirely.<p>Absence of &quot;Download&quot; button on a site, or in a context menu, is not technically a technical measure, particularly when you can press F12 and poke around the Network tab to get to the same resource, all entirely a browser built-in process. But it legally is a technical measure, because the little obstacle carries a colour of &quot;intended to prevent downloads&quot;. That&#x27;s usually enough.<p>--<p>[0] - See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansuz.sooke.bc.ca&#x2F;entry&#x2F;23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansuz.sooke.bc.ca&#x2F;entry&#x2F;23</a> for detailed explanation of what &quot;colour&quot; is. In a rough tl;dr, colour as a concept is a blend of provenance and intent. Bits don&#x27;t really have colour, but the chain of events that made particular bits be what they are does have it. Law is in a large part an exercise of dealing with colour, but the concept lies entirely outside of computer science, so it fundamentally can&#x27;t enter it, and is thus usually ignored by the tech crowd. Colour is not data, and not metadata: it&#x27;s the causal context.')
