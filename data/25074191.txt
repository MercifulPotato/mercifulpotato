The OS has the virtualisation functions, but the Apple chips don&#x27;t have virtualisation support yet.&quot;</i><p>This is strangely a really big selling point for me as a habit breaker. I spent a good part of the release evening whining about the pitiful memory and the cost of the devices but I am regretting that on reflection. Why? Well I just spent two days arguing with problems with Microsoft&#x27;s fucked up shit show of mixed platform Windows containers and Docker which ultimately ended up in a completely hosed OS install. Every time I use some heavily marketed stack it turns into this mess eventually if not right away.<p>My conclusion is doing this on my main computer i.e. my portal to the universe is a functional risk so I&#x27;d rather do it somewhere completely different i.e. on a desktop PC hidden away somewhere or Amazon where I can nuke the whole universe and start again without losing access to essential services etc.<p>So perhaps I don&#x27;t need a virtualization equipped CPU after all for my computer? Forcing my hand in that direction may be a net gain.')
