Do you not realize that any current problems were caused by the current system?<p>&gt;So instead of trying to solve the problem of crushing student debt, we let people at 30-35 tank their credit score so they can never buy anything again.<p>Seriously. The inability to discharge debt is the primary source of crushing debt. Predatory lenders can turn you into a debt slave through student loans and you have zero recourse. Since student loans are guaranteed by the government it doesn&#x27;t matter to the lender whether you are able to pay the loan back or not. They can just give a $100k loan to someone who is 100% going to drop out. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be your fault. Universities are incentivized to spend money on student retention and basically zero money on actual education.<p>&gt;So we&#x27;re doing NOTHING for people 22-30, and we&#x27;re ruining the 30+ year old&#x27;s credit so they can&#x27;t actually buy a house. It doesn&#x27;t help anyone. That&#x27;s our point. It does nothing to solve any real problem, it just makes everything worse.<p>Except lenders are not going to hand out $100k loans willy nilly anymore. They will actually have to look at what and where you are studying. If students can discharge their debt then it&#x27;s possible for lenders to make losses and do you know what businesses hate the most? Damn losses. Those losses will have to be covered higher interest rates and do you know what happens when people are faced with greater interest rates? The maximum principal they can borrow shrinks and there will be no more infinite flood of money that inflates tuition costs year by year. What about people that can&#x27;t afford the loans? They can always choose a cheaper degree. If getting a CS, EE, civil engineering, law, medicine, whatever degree improves your employment chances so that you can pay off your loan without trouble the interest rates are going to be way down and thereby make it extremely obvious which degrees and schools are the most lucrative. You&#x27;ll be able to measure the quality of a college and its degrees by the interest rates the lenders charge and even in the worst case you can get rid of the loan trivially. Collges will be able to make money off of good education instead of just admitting as many students as possible by luring them in with an expensive lifestyle.<p>It&#x27;s funny how Americans keep telling me about the advantages of hire and fire and how it increases economic efficiency while simultaneously they have the most socialized private education industry on the entire planet which means they get none of the benefits of socialized education and none of the benefits of private education. Seriously your current system is so broken even abolishing it completely without a replacement would still lead to better outcomes than whatever crap you currently have.')
