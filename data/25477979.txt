In fact, the way you want it to behave here is all it does!<p>I&#x27;d argue if what you want is to do engineering, mocking this isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d want to do. You want to ensure your code works. And your test can tell you that it works, even if &quot;randrange&quot; works differently while maintaining the same signature after you update the module it came from.<p>If you&#x27;re doing software engineering for aviation for example, I doubt &quot;well, my tests using mocks passed, it&#x27;s just that the dependency broke it&#x27;s contract&quot; is a good enough excuse for a catastrophe.')
