It was at 321 before covid lockdowns started, which shifted my driving habits toward more less-efficient car trips.<p>Based on that I have a hard time believing that Tesla substantially exaggerates range. I reckon my single data point is probably worth at least as much as autocar.co.uk&#x27;s single data point based on a couple orders of magnitude less driving.')
