Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25682466], score=None, time=1610090841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682277, text='&gt; Basically, by fighting data caps, you&#x27;re demanding that a grandma who only checks their email once a day has to pay as much as a family of four who streams Netflix in 4K every waking hour of the day.<p>And there is a reason for that -- it costs about the same to provide that service.<p>Nearly the entire cost of operating an ISP is getting the wires on the pole, keeping them there against weather and drunk drivers, answering customer support phones, paying for staff and buildings and electricity etc. None of which costs any less for the person who uses 1&#x2F;1000th as much data.<p>Charging the amount actually attributable to additional data usage would cause the difference to be so small that basically everybody would just pick the unlimited plan so they don&#x27;t have to worry about it. But they don&#x27;t charge the actual cost, they charge more. Because the point is to suppress usage of Netflix et al (the main reason nearly anyone would exceed the cap) in favor of cable TV and zero-rated partners.')
