It&#x27;s a toy more than transportation. It gets me where I need to go but carrying more than one passenger is a pain. The windscreen fluid jet is poorly located and doesn&#x27;t get the whole windscreen when I need to get rid of dirt on the windshield. I have had to JB weld the gear shift knob back together.<p>It&#x27;s a completely impractical and inconvenient car. But I still love it because it&#x27;s fun to drive and it can, in fact, go pretty much anywhere.')
