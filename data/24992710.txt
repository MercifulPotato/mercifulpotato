The current system of government incentives&#x2F;mandates for employer-provided insurance in the US does that poorly and we&#x27;re rightly criticized for it.<p>But there are a dozen plausible alternatives that are all better, and &quot;Medicare for All&quot; isn&#x27;t even a particularly well thought-out one, because the existing Medicare system is premised on the continued existence of private insurance to do things like establish market prices. It&#x27;s also the moral equivalent of having healthcare policy done at the level of the EU rather than the individual member states, which tends to invite more corruption and waste since both of those are compounded by scale and deep pockets.<p>Which is the <i>real</i> problem with the US system as it is. The employer-provided system is largely created and regulated at the level of the whole US, and as a result there are some specific businesses who are making out like bandits under the status quo, and affordable healthcare is inherently inconsistent with those companies continuing to make three point six trillion dollars a year. So they lobby hard against anything that would actually fix it, no matter whose solution you choose.')
