This strongly implies that he knows which doors have goats.<p>Your alternative is different.  If the doors opened are truly selected randomly, then the odds are high that he would reveal a car, especially in the 1000-door version.  What are the odds that Monty could choose 998 doors randomly out of 1000 and NOT pick the one with the car?<p>If Monty doesn&#x27;t know where the car is, then you&#x27;re arguing with a completely different version of the game that could result in him opening the door with the car, so the strategy is going to be different.')
