I&#x27;ve never been able to deduct anything substantial, and I&#x27;ve had some pretty outrageous medical bills. (Cancer survivor.) And that phrase &quot;to the extent&quot; reads to me like it means any amount forgiven that doesn&#x27;t meet the threshold is considered income.<p>One year I was billed $40k for radiation. You know, a thing I needed or else I would&#x27;ve died. I managed to negotiate that down to $25k. (While having cancer!) You&#x27;d think that would meet the threshold for deduction, but there&#x27;s a catch: you can&#x27;t deduct the bill, you can only deduct what you&#x27;ve actually paid. So if you do a payment plan, which of course I did because how the hell else was I going to pay that, now that bill is spread out too much to be eligible for deduction.<p>The US medical system is fucked, full stop. We wouldn&#x27;t tolerate someone holding a gun to your head and saying &quot;I&#x27;ll put the gun away for $40k.&quot; And if you do manage to get treatment, now you&#x27;re trapped in a game with rules only slightly more complicated than Dungeons &amp; Dragons - and the DM is a sociopath.')
