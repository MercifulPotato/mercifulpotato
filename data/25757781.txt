What would this situation had looked like if the rioters had murdered a bunch of congresspeople? Would the Joint Chiefs be saying &quot;it&#x27;s a national emergency and Trump must stay President to calm things down&quot;?<p>I know there&#x27;s a tendency to valorize the military leadership, but given how politicized the general environment is (&amp; even moreso with Trump&#x27;s known penchant for selecting for yes-men), is it really that absurd to think about whether they&#x27;re doing some professional fence-sitting rather than trying to avoid polarization? It doesn&#x27;t take that much to come out right away and say &quot;an attack on the capitol is unacceptable &amp; anyone involved will be punished.
