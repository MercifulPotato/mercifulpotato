I think it&#x27;s really a team by team basis even within these companies.<p>It sucks, but I would highly suggest you study for leetcode interviews. There are many more companies that will leetcode you than not, and the numbers are growing. Many companies that did not leetcode candidates several years ago are now doing so.<p>It&#x27;s better to suck it up and play the game to maximize your chances, instead of trying to hunt the elusive white whale that is a great company that won&#x27;t leetcode you. At least if your intention is to target companies in one of the big US coastal tech hub cities (SFBA, Seattle, NYC, possibly a few others, and at least London if you&#x27;re in Europe).<p>Granted, some companies are doing away with leetcode interviews too (especially in the frontend), but they seem to be the exception, not the norm, and still rare.')
