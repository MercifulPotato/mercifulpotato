I&#x27;ve looked into this case a bit more in-depth to see what was going on. Although I can&#x27;t get into specifics, given the poster was kind enough to provide us with ticket IDs, I was able to look into this a bit further to see what actually triggered the account ban.<p>&gt; Discord bans me for using their official client<p>This statement is false, unfortunately - and our abuse detection flagged the account for using our API in ways that our official clients do not. In this case, there was indeed a 3rd party client involved. Although our rules and heuristics do not specifically target 3rd party clients, it does target things that &quot;don&#x27;t look like what our official client does&quot; which is very effective at targeting spambots that are constantly waging war against our platform - but has the unfortunate side-effect that using a 3rd party client in certain ways may lead to account termination.<p>In general, appealing the ban would lead to an unban (we&#x27;re humans after all, and we&#x27;re trying to stop spammers&#x2F;bad actors, and that&#x27;s what this system is meant to stop.) I am going to following up with our T&amp;S team to understand why this case saw such a rocky conclusion.')
