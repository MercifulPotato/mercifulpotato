My university gym had a bike with a screen. You would paddle in a virtual 3D world terrain. It wasn&#x27;t that immersive, kind of blocky. \nBut I used to have a 100 inch projector in my home theater, and a recumbent exercise bike. Totally immersive, and awesome playing games and working out in such a setup.')
