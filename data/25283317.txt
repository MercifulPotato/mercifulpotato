I have 4 of those little google pucks around the house that we used for various tasks and automations.  Now that we have a 1-year-old we almost never use them because I don&#x27;t want him learning the phrase &quot;ok google&quot;.<p>It sounded dumb enough for two adults to say it all day, but the convenience was worth it.  Having my little one start using the phrase to talk to things is definitely where I draw the line.<p>Besides, now that it tries to make suggestions after every other command all you really hear in my house in regards to them is &quot;hey google shut the fuck up and do what you&#x27;re told&quot;.  Unfortunately the stupid puck doesn&#x27;t allow you to interrupt the unsolicited FAQ any longer.<p>Come to think of it, I think I&#x27;m getting rid of most of these things this weekend.')
