They aren&#x27;t a substitute for a real OS as an app platform, and they should stop trying to become one. They&#x27;re for reading (hyper)text, writing text (including filling forms), and watching videos.<p>An aside: as someone who comes from Android app development and now makes a hobby project that includes a web interface, making the browser do what I want it to feels like I&#x27;m building a UI in a Word document, complete with macros. The ability to have this free-flowing text that isn&#x27;t contained in anything, this whole concept of &quot;inline elements&quot; still hurts my head. I&#x27;m too used to real UI frameworks where any text is only allowed to exist inside a TextView.')
