Trump’s entire brand is a strong man who will protect America from harm. Him and his family catching this disease reveals he can’t even protect himself or his family against the backdrop of 200,000 dead. The last thing he wants to be talking about it Covid. Now we are not only going to be talking about this non stop, for the next few news cycles we will be asked to hypothetically picture his VP as the next president. The last thing a nominee wants going into an election is the country picturing his running mate as his successor. Not to mention the fact that this derails his campaign rallies, derails the debate he desperately needs to do well at, and calls into question the timeline of his Supreme Court nomination as now the nominee as well as GOP senators are all potentially exposed.<p>This is a clusterfuck collapse for the campaign.')
