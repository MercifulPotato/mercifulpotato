And it&#x27;s kind of moot since the total amount of storage produced globally is still a fraction of what is necessary to make renewables feasible as a primary source of power.<p>Funny that you also fail to mention that although storage levels are very low, we are still very far from reaching the market penetration of requiring storage. Transitioning a world&#x27;s electric grid takes take, decades, plenty of time for storage to drop.')
