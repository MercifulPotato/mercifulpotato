It&#x27;s myspace being superceded by facebook maybe being eaten by tiktok that&#x27;s going to drive technological innovation in social media, not mastodon instances.<p>Of course it&#x27;s easy to cherry-pick, but you don&#x27;t need to cherry pick. You can look at the economic development in mature economies vs developing economies. This tendency towards consolidation and innovation occurs in every single one. That&#x27;s why South Korea and Japan have more large firms and are more productive than most of their Asian peers, it&#x27;s why China with its economic model has outgrown India, where the same process is occuring now (see Jio).')
