Big companies fuck their employees from time to time not because they are meanies, but because they think they will make money that way. If you offered all the companies a Faustian agreement of triplicating their earning but they have to support racism (with no other consequences) they will do it in a heartbeat.That&#x27;s why so irritating the magnificient coup they&#x27;ve made in the last 5-10 years to put themselves at the forefront of &quot;social issues&quot;, if they can control the discourse there is less chance that people will question all the bad stuff they do.')
