We wanted to provide the same security pattern that iPhone&#x27;s provide - 4 digit, 6 digit and alphanumeric.<p>iPhone 4&#x2F;6 digit passwords are secure because they require physical access to device, and they have anti-bruteforce mechanisms enforced by the security chip (eg. exponentially increasing timeouts after successive incorrect entries, &quot;wipe device after 10 failed attempts&quot;). Your SaaS solution provides none of that.')
