The same way people migrate now from California because of tax issues. I don&#x27;t understand what is the problem with computers doing facial recognition, at the end of the day it lands on some cop desk who can just look and see if there is real match, the same way he would have done if he had to browse through a folder manually. We did it for fingerprints, why not for faces? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand what is wrong with &quot;predictive&quot; policing, whenever there is an area ridden with crime the locals complain why there is no more police there. This is exactly what predictive policing is about. People just don&#x27;t want to deal with fact that there is more crime in black neighbourhoods. All those people who complain about it here will never go and live in those neighbourhoods because they do the same predictive algorithm in their minds but just based on prejudices rather than facts, they will not even live in a black neighbourhood even if there was no crime there, so now they complain about computers?')
