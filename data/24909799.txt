Right now they tell you “take these antibiotics for 10 days”. Instead they need a way to measure the infection and change the instruction to “take these antibiotics until this measurement is below 5”. This is a lot easier for patients to understand and follow vs a coarse “take this for 10 days” even though they feel better.<p>It’s 2020 and we have a lot of tools to track users across the Internet but we don’t have anything besides blood tests to figure out our health. It definitely seems like an industry ripe for disruption.')
