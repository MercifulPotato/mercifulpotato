This makes sense considering what&#x27;s at stake. China is suspected to engage in bioengineering for their soldiers and it&#x27;s not a stretch to speculate they also seek such synthetic advantages with their vast armies of engineers and scientists. This would lay fertile ground for secret breakthroughs in, e.g., QC.<p>I assume that both China and USA&#x2F;fyev seek to obtain secret radical advances in key areas such as QC. The urgency for adopting quantum resistant crypto suggests such concerns might be shared by powers that be. QC breakthroughs are unpredictable, so the smart move is to assume the enemy could make secret advances at any time.')
