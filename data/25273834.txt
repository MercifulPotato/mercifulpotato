All those flights that will no longer cross half the globe to get to NZ and the tourists who come and despoil the environment will save thousands of tons of CO2 emissions.<p>2- NZ can also give up dairy and sheep farming which leads to methane emissions which are a potent greenhouse gas. There is a glut of dairy products and NZ&#x27;s export will actually not be missed. NZ I think has the highest number of sheep&#x2F;cows to humans.<p>I am not optimistic that NZ will do any of that but rather wax virtuous about accounting moves like CO2 neutrality. I am genuinely curious if moves like CO2 neutrality actually accomplish anything. Opinions?')
