If someone would ask why you want to use another JS to use WASM, it is not a scripting language. AssemblyScript produces WASM binaries with minial runtimes so its WASM binary size is very small, even smaller than C outputs (with Emscripten) most of times.<p>So if you want to write a low-level WASM code in WebAssembly text format (WAT), it is probably a good idea to use AssemblyScript instead.')
