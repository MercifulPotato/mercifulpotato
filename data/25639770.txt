It&#x27;s not that these actors are merely celebrities among the film industry, but your mom and dad and friends actually have heard of them and their presence in a film is going to influence whether or not people turn out to see the film. You can get the most famous programmers together to build a product, and no one is going to buy that product on the basis of those programmers&#x27; celebrity <i>unless some segment of the software industry is the target audience for that product</i>.<p>To be quite clear (and likely this was your point, in which case I agree), if the film&#x2F;tv unions excluded actors, the effect would be pretty comparable. My friends and family aren&#x27;t going to see a film because Joe The Sound Guy worked on it just like they aren&#x27;t going to buy an app just because Collin The SRE worked on it (no matter how famous Joe and Collin are in their respective industries).')
