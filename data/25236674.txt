Only the extremes make a difference. That is, lower when extremely bad and a bit longer when extremely good.<p>According to the BLS, median tenure is 2.x years for those 25-34. For those 35-44, it&#x27;s 4.x years. Keeps going up with age, peaking at 10.x years starting in the 50s.<p>Not much seems to change it in a relevant way, maybe another many companies are blah in this regard: not worth the money&#x2F;time&#x2F;effort. Just mumble some BS to look good to the world, then repeat as the same dead company. The BS isn&#x27;t even mumbled to recruit, as it also doesn&#x27;t have any effect there.<p>The only ones in a position to be affected by such marketing are new grads, a group typically viewed as worthless and that have to take what they get. It&#x27;s all just air in the winds.')
