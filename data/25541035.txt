I imagine there is a high probability of more incidents like this happening between now and the inauguration, meant to target various infrastructure and &quot;big government&quot; components throughout the country. This attack screams anti-government militia with it&#x27;s technique, and we will see in the following days online chats emerging with all the planning details that will likely include someone that had some degree of &quot;insider information&quot; about the ATT facility.')
