For React, I did follow quite a few tutorials - from how to route through pages, to hooks to unit tests - but the process is quite slow (though I do enjoy it).<p>And then there&#x27;s setting up gitlab pipelines, docker images, deployments to AWS... it&#x27;s a lot for a one-man band with only a few hours to dedicate.<p>I&#x27;ll have a look at Netlify, maybe it could take some of the above away. Thanks for the suggestion!')
