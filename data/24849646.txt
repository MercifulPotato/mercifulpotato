It&#x27;s a great example where the theory doesn&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re working with real non-homo economicus agents, and I would argue hurts if you assume that people behave (or should) behave according to those concepts.<p>&gt;This is &quot;rational&quot; as in &quot;rational agent&quot; (utility-maximizing, or an agent that makes at least Pareto-optimal choices, or who plays to Nash or correlated equilibria)<p>...even worse. Go find me one of these perfect information people. I suppose you could collapse the stated preference and revealed preference superposition into observed preference to solve the equation.')
