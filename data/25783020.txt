Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25783208], score=None, time=1610660475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782840, text='&gt; When someone says “I watched people throw Molotov cocktails and shoot mortars at law enforcement”, the obvious implication is that we are talking about the type of military hardware pictured and described at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mortar_(weapon)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mortar_(weapon)</a> being used to intentionally injure or kill a group of people, not a toy version intended for making a celebratory burst of color being launched against the side of a building.<p>I…disagree.<p>If I heard “small arms and mortars”, I’d think of the military weapon. (Or “rockets and mortars”, without other context.)<p>If I hear “molotov cocktails and mortars”, though, I’d think of either the fireworks or some improvised device, but not miltary hardware unless there was some other contextual indication favoring the latter. While its obviously not <i>impossible</i> for a group to both be using Molotov cocktails <i>and</i> have access to military heavy weapons, that’s not really, to me, the normal association.')
