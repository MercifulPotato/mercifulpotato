These aren&#x27;t argument for why Trump would win. They were arguments for why Trump has some purchase. The reason Trump won was the elites go so sloppy they let him win, they let their garbage boogieman alternative become the choice because they were addicted to having that kind of creep as their opposition.<p>And Michael Moore&#x27;s argument in particular is crap among these. Homeless factory workers aren&#x27;t Trump&#x27;s base, family construction companies are his base - I see them regularly. The well-off but not college educated.')
