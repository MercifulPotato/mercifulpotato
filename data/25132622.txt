As the AnandTech review noted, the M1 bests even the Ryzen on some benchmarks and Ryzen beats it in others.<p>The point everyone conveniently seems to miss is <i>a new SoC for mobile devices running at 10-20 watts shouldn&#x27;t be in the same universe when it comes to performance with any Ryzen desktop processor</i>—but here we are.<p>It&#x27;s disingenuous to state the only reason M1 seems fast is because all Macs are using old, slow processors.<p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro ($2,799.00) comes with a 2.3GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.8GHz and for an additional $200, you can get it with a 2.4GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor, Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz.<p>And yet the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with it&#x27;s M1 processor blows them away when it comes to performance.<p>Here&#x27;s a direct quote from their extensive review of the M1-based Mac mini (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>):<p><i>The M1 undisputedly outperforms the core performance of everything Intel has to offer, and battles it with AMD’s new Zen3, winning some, losing some. And in the mobile space in particular, there doesn’t seem to be an equivalent in either ST or MT performance – at least within the same power budgets.</i>')
