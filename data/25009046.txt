Proof of Stake is a different and weaker model of consensus than Proof of Work, but one that seems practical enough for the real world. To address the two main criticisms in the paper, the FAQ seems to state that there are decent schemes to inject enough randomness to prevent stake grinding, and that Proof of Stake does have a &quot;weak subjectivity&quot; as a con, but that in the real world coordination on which block is real to get started on out of band isn&#x27;t too onerous. Asking a trusted friend or just looking at major forums or whatever would work to get started, and then after that you don&#x27;t need to keep trusting a third party. Trust on first use, kinda, which a lot of us use every day, SSHing into things, but this case is even better because your first trust can be to a friend or trusted party.<p>This seems like a very reasonable concession in order to not burn wild amounts of electricity and make the system much more sustainable.')
