It&#x27;s a rather complicated system, where you can freely assign up to 3 votes of your 93 votes to each candidate, can strike candidates from the list or simply vote for party lists.<p>Federal elections are way simpler, with just 2 votes. But often several elections are combined. But there are less elections overall in Germany, as we usually only vote for: city council, county council, state and federal parliaments, and finally EU parliament. 5 in total, most of them every 4 years, so on average 1.2 votings per year.')
