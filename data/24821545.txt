But the convention is that 12:00 PM is noon, and that 12:00 AM is midnight, right?<p>This is exactly backwards.<p>Consider 11 AM. What does the 11 signify? 11 hours  since midnight. 12 AM then should be 12 hours since midnight. &quot;But 12:30 AM would then be in the afternoon, which surely should be PM!&quot; Well, 12:30 AM would be 12 and a half hours after midnight just the same way that 11 AM is.<p>The REAL problem? Using 12 on the clock instead of 0. If we had 0 on the clock then 0 PM would be 0 hours past noon, the same way that 1 PM is 1 hour past noon. 0 AM would be 0 hours past midnight.<p>In fact, to make sense of whether noon is AM or PM in our current system, ask yourself: If we were to use 0 in place of 12, would AM or PM make sense?')
