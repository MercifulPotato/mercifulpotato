You know, I would even pay a bit extra if I could have the instrument in my hand today, and could inspect it myself before paying. But I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much more.<p>You&#x27;d be stupid not to get the instrument over the counter, unless the online deal offers more than a modest discount.<p>Not worth the return headaches if something is wrong: twisted neck, fret being out, bad wiring, cosmetic issue and whatnot.<p>Or is it a choice thing? People try in the store, but get something a bit different online, like a very similar model that the store didn&#x27;t have?')
