To me, doing non-work related things outside of working is what makes _both_ activities things fun.<p>Don&#x27;t be hard on yourself for not spending every waking minute of your life working, preparing for work, or feeling bad because you &quot;should&quot; be doing one of those two. That&#x27;s a very quick way get burned out.<p>YMMV, but in my experience, even if you want to optimize your life for doing the best work possible, not working all the time is a winning strategy!')
