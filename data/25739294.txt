Particularly in relation to the muted reactions in the mainstream media to an entire summer of riots and protests related to the death of George Floyd, under the collective banner of &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27;. These protests left at least 19 dead[1], and could cost the American economy up to $2 billion in insurance claims alone[2]. Not to mention enormous damage to small businesses and local economies, or the knock-on &#x27;Ferguson Effect&#x27;[3]. During these protests, amid calls to &#x27;defund the police&#x27;, actual anarchist groups took control of a small area in Seattle and declared it their own &#x27;Autonomous Zone&#x27;. They then repelled law enforcement from the area and extorted local businesses for protection until they were disbanded[4]. Not once did I hear anyone in the mainstream media, nor on this site, refer to them as &#x27;insurrectionists&#x27;. Even though they were insurrectionists by their own words. The amount of violence and property damage in the Capitol Hill raid event were paltry in comparison to the widespread looting and arson that occurred in BLM-related protests.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;jemimamcevoy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;14-days-of-protests-19-dead&#x2F;?sh=36cca2aa4de4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;jemimamcevoy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;08&#x2F;14-days...</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;16&#x2F;riots-following-george-floyds-death-could-cost-up-to-2b&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;16&#x2F;riots-following-george-floyds-...</a>\n[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ferguson_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ferguson_effect</a>\n[4]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;defund-police-seattle-protests.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;defund-police-seattle-...</a>')
