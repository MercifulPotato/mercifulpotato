When SNA appeared as an option it initially seemed quite fast, but didn&#x27;t take long to reveal it was also quite broken vs. UXA.<p>I used to explicitly use UXA but for the last 5-10 years simply using modesetting has been the way to go.<p>Personally I think you&#x27;re conflating Xorg and kernel driver issues.  Xorg is basically unmaintained in general now and unfortunately SNA was the last major development in that context for the Intel driver, and it was not good.')
