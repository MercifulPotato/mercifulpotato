This is not an inconsistent position and nor does it mean that a person who doesn&#x27;t want to use this new feature is dumb.<p>Do you have the same objection for anybody who carries a smartphone (i.e. literally billions of people worldwide)? They mostly offer the _exact same feature_ – does carrying a smartphone mean that none of those smartphone users are able to object to some privacy rules that they do not like? Obviously that would be ridiculous.')
