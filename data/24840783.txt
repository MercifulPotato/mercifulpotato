Hey, just charge your cracker-making competitors 2x the rent. Nobody can make crackers but you.<p>Or you own all the railways and charge your Oil pumping competitors more to transport Oil - you have an Oil monopoly.<p>Chrome is not a &#x27;money losing product&#x27; - it&#x27;s absolutely one of the most important products in Google&#x27;s portfolio - the surpluses are yielded elsewhere, in Search. Arguably same for Android.<p>If there were an &#x27;anti trust&#x27; case it would be to separate Search&#x2F;Chrome&#x2F;Android&#x2F;Cloud in the similar vein that Microsoft would ostensibly be separated from any app software.<p>Amazon uses AWS surpluses to &#x27;dump&#x27; on commercial distribution which is another weird one.<p><i>If</i> there is a case to concern over monopoly, it&#x27;s those.')
