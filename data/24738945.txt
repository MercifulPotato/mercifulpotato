It&#x27;s written for humour to make human existence feel absurd. They could have used the &quot;flesh&quot; to the same effect, although &quot;meat&quot; sounds a bit funnier.<p>You can imagine the individuals speaking are something exotic to us, like a &quot;hydrogen core cluster&quot; or an &quot;electron plasma&quot;, who clearly think meat is one of the least likely materials sentient life might be made from. The humour comes from making the reader think, &quot;huh, when you put it like that, humans are kind of absurd.&quot; Of course, this absurdity works largely because of our own human associations towards meat. Replace &quot;meat&quot; with &quot;cells&quot; and the humour fails.<p>Basically, descriptions like, &quot;they talk by flapping their meat at each other.&quot; sound funny by giving the reader a different perspective of &quot;talking&quot;.')
