Not just because everyone deserves to be paid, but more importantly, because they cause massive social inequality. Students who are well-off can afford to take unpaid internships. They get many opportunities riding on their wealth, resulting in students who are not well-off, who cannot afford to work for free, missing out.<p>Programs like these cause massive social inequality. They are how the old boys network continues to live.<p>Also, you totally need a labor lawyer. That page clearly shows that lambdaschool fails the test for an unpaid internship. Not only are you exposing yourself to a lawsuit, you are exposing anyone who participates in this program too.

Get experience for you students. As a fellow educator, I appreciate that and also understand how hard it is to arrange. But this is not the way.')
