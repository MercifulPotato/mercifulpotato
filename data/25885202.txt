There are very few &#x27;unlimited&#x27; days (think: major race series), the number of limited days goes up, the dB limits for the limited days come down.<p>If you want a laugh, do a Google Image search for &quot;laguna pipes&quot;, to see the elaborate contraptions people bolt to the back of their track cars to redirect exhaust noise away from the sound meter to keep them from blowing sound.<p>I&#x27;ve never had an issue, as the car I track is quiet and stock. But plenty of stock vehicles made in the past few decades are well past the limits already, and I feel the frustration of those who used to have a &quot;legal&quot; car, but keep getting tripped up by the lowering and lowering of sound limits.<p>Overall, I simply cannot fathom those who are annoyed by the sound of the track. It&#x27;s on a HUGE expanse of land. The complainers must be many hilltops away. I don&#x27;t doubt the sound carries for many miles, but it&#x27;s very much &quot;background noise I choose to be angered by and whine about&quot; versus actual nuisance.')
