Remember that washing in itself is not actually that hard on clothes (provided you select the right temperature and program and don&#x27;t use an old-fashioned top loader with an agitator), it&#x27;s the dryer that <i>really</i> kills clothes, with all the dry heat and agitation. Line dry your clothes and they&#x27;ll last much longer.<p>Another factor that may not be as relevant when working from home* is that general dust and dirt settles in and between the cotton fibers and act as abrasives. You can get a lot of that out by giving your jeans a vigorous shake out the window, but cotton is very absorbent and will hold on to dirt and grime, so it&#x27;s a losing battle. If you never wash them, the wear will accelerate and ruin the fabric, especially in folds and creases.<p>As an aside, some of the &quot;common knowledge&quot; around jeans actually <i>does</i> apply to wool clothes since unlike cotton, the wool fibers have a hydrophobic outer layer, so they will repel dirt. Hanging wool clothes overnight and giving them a shake the next morning is often more than enough to refresh them, cabin luggage-only travelers love merino wool t-shirts for this reason, they can be worn for several days before needing a wash, without developing odors.<p>* Are people wearing jeans when working from home? As long as I&#x27;m staying inside, I&#x27;m wearing comfy cotton pajama pants and a hoodie or a robe all day, it&#x27;s so comfortable. The real pants or jeans are only worn for going outside.')
