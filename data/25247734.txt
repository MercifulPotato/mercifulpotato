The often upvoted comments will be about how A will destroy B, B will destroy A or how they both are terrible companies based on anecdotes and lots of personal opinions.<p>You will often find that the 4th or 5th comment will have a sensible commentary on what that means for the market, the synergies, challenges, etc.<p>IMHO, the latter should be the upvoted comments because you&#x27;ll learn something and there&#x27;s a sensible discussion by knowledgeable people.<p>One solution is to put the burden on moderation to kind of super upvote those comments. But that doesn&#x27;t scale. Should HN have &quot;super upvoters&quot; (people whose upvotes add more than just 1 point to the comment)?')
