Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[25771856], score=None, time=1610595818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771464, text='&gt; it’s good to have a reminder that at the end of the day it’s not the borg.<p>The impression I always got was more like a  mid-to-late USSR than the Borg (in structure rather than efficacy, the USSR didn&#x27;t work, apple does). Everyone in the Borg is (supposed to be) identical, whereas Apple seems like a structure of lots of groups of often brilliant people working in seperate-but-equal subtrees, working under a (especially under Jobs) ideologically-inspired dictator from the top down. The way Apple are fairly reticent to document what they make partly informs the comparison.')
