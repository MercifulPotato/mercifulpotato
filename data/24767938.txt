It seems like a lot of countries have done poorly at communicating with their citizens and with each other regarding covid.<p>China didn&#x27;t shut down travel fast enough, but by the time things has started to appear and become concerning covid had already left China and was en route to Italy and the west coast of the US.  Once the nature of the disease and particularly the asymptomatic transmission stage became clear everyone needed to adjust.  To claim this is some fault of the Chinese government is pure BS.<p>As for pushing &#x27;malign&#x27; interest, you are entitled to your own opinions but that seems to be another unfounded value judgement that is just as easily dismissed as right-wing propaganda.')
