Item(by='NalNezumi', descendants=None, kids=[25766746, 25765329], score=None, time=1610557291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763863, text='&gt;&quot;Workaholics are people who usually work seven and more hours more than others per week.&quot;<p>&gt;&quot;Workaholism is also known as a behavioural disorder, which means the excessive involvement of the individual in work when an employer doesnâ€™t require or expect it.&quot;<p>&gt;&quot;The results show that high job demands at work are strongly associated with work addiction risk but the job control level does not play the same role.&quot;<p>In a first glance, the definition of Workaholism seems like something very culture&#x2F;country dependent. In places such as Japan with pressure to stay longer than your boss, working longer to &quot;show you&#x27;re working hard&quot;, a lot of people might be categorized as workaholic without actually being one.<p>What the model seems to <i>not</i> include is, and I think contributes way more to work related mental health issue is <i>emotional</i> investment in work. Too much emotional investment seems to lead to unreasonable stress when things are not going accordingly, while not helping much when things are going well. (Which is natural ofc, emotionally we remember negative events&#x2F;failure more. It being tied to our self-worth or something deeply emotional, is problematic though.)<p>I left my previous company because of this reason; the project wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, horribly mismanaged including unrealistic goal settings. But I&#x27;ve had this condition before on other jobs, but only on this one did I get so emotionally invested that I spent ridiculous over-time until burnout trying to make things (out of my control) work.<p>In retrospective, what made it all worse was that I liked my coworker a lot at my previous work, and seeing them work hard on other project while my project were going nowhere, made me more invested. The company-culture that made reaching out to others for feedback&#x2F;brain storm&#x2F;help hard, was also strong contributing factor.')
