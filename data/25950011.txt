I&#x27;m seeing a lot of rage in these threads. More than I&#x27;d expect. I understand not liking the hedge funds, and wanting to &quot;stick it to the man&quot; in some way, but it seems like more is going on here.<p><i>Nobody</i> is buying GME long at $400. The price is crazy. GameStop&#x27;s business is selling used hard copies and leaning into customer dissatisfaction.<p>It&#x27;s a clear bubble and people are going to be hurt when it pops. There should be some consumer protections, IMHO, because a bunch of people are amping up a price for lulz and hopes of timing things right, but not everyone can win that pyramid scheme.<p>What am I missing that is leading to the rage I&#x27;m seeing?')
