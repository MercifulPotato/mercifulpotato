Item(by='scarmig', descendants=None, kids=[25336326, 25335875], score=None, time=1607366693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334571, text='1) SF &amp; Valley: Education levels of the people here. You can get that in a couple other places--DC, NYC, Boston--but not too many others. Relatedly, two easily accessible world class universities are in the Bay Area: Boston beats us here, but we beat NYC and DC.<p>2) SF &amp; Valley: Diversity. Bay Area cities top the list of largest number of foreign born residents, with only LA and NYC being competitive.<p>3) SF &amp; Valley: Weather. LA beats us here, but SF trounces NYC, Boston, DC, and Seattle.<p>4) Just SF: Walkability and street life. SF is more walkable than most cities (the weather helps with that), and although it has shitty public transit options, it&#x27;s only shitty in comparison to places with actual good public transit, which more or less don&#x27;t exist in the US.<p>5) Just SF: Weirdness. Okay, SF has driven out most of the interesting weirdo and artistic crowds and replaced them with CrossFitting Burners. But there are still remnants of that culture, more so than most places except perhaps NYC.<p>6) SF &amp; Valley: Food. It&#x27;s mediocre in comparison to the scenes in LA and NYC. But it&#x27;s still worlds better than the rest of the country.<p>7) SF: Arts. Similar to food, it&#x27;s mediocre compared to LA and NYC. But it&#x27;s still worlds better than the rest of the country.<p>8) SF &amp; Valley: Nature. West Coast cities are all competitive here, as is Denver&#x2F;Boulder (though even they lack the beaches), but this is another place where East Coast cities fall short.<p>In the end, the only plausibly competitive cities on this scoring matrix are LA and NYC. LA sacrifices a lot of the walkability and weirdness of SF. NYC sacrifices the weather, and moving to NYC from SF isn&#x27;t going to get you of any the much vaunted coupon-cutting decrease in cost of living that everyone in these comments is so pumped about.<p>Just to be fair, I&#x27;ll also list disadvantages of SF:<p>1) Cost of living. &quot;No one is willing to pay that much to live in SF, it&#x27;s too expensive.&quot;<p>2) Dating scene for men.<p>3) Travel. Subjective, but East Coast cities are better situated for international travel than the West Coast.<p>4) Cleanliness. Yep, SF is an unhygienic shithole in many places.<p>5) Monoculture. Too many tech folks here, not enough diversity in industry.')
