The argument is that being forced to change careers can be - depending at which age it happens for a person - anything from taking away significant amounts of wealth to complete impossibility. When you change careers, you usually start at the bottom of the ladder. Past a certain point, such switch is not recoverable, and best you can hope is that <i>your children</i> will start a good career early and won&#x27;t be themselves forced to switch careers later on.<p>If automation didn&#x27;t involve pushing people into deep poverty, it wouldn&#x27;t have as much opposition.')
