Or maybe it&#x27;s the one with most publicity. In comparison, government&#x2F;ISP censorship seems to have died out and be pretty mild.  \nHowever, something like China&#x27;s censorship is much worse than social media.  \nI thought we luckily would be free of such, but I do consider Poland western, and Japan a reputable democracy. It is still dangerous because a threat we thought dead or dormant is still active.')
