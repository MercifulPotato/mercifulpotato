I do not feel that I am missing anything. So far can do anything I want.<p>2) What low performance? Depending on money spent desktops and laptops perform just fine. M1 is a good chip but new AMD is faster on single core and on multiple cores it will wipe the floor with M1. So far M1 is more power efficient. I am pretty sure given time AMD&#x2F;Intel will catch up to that if there is good ROI on that particular quality.')
