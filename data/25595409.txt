I find most similar systems are in the same ballpark in terms of being able to track what I care about.<p>Mainly:<p>- Is the ticket ready for me to work on? (Do I have the designs I need to work it?)<p>- Who is working on a given ticket right now?<p>- Am I done with a ticket?<p>- Is the ticket ready for QA?<p>- Did QA reject the ticket and I need to fix something on the ticket?<p>Pivotal does these things fairly well. There is also the obligatory pointing system, but the above is the bulk of what I care about. Pivotal also lets me create queries so I can zero in on the work which I&#x27;m doing as opposed to the entire project.')
