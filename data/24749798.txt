Additionally, all major commercial FPGAs have complex facilities for encrypting the bitstream that completely hides it&#x27;s contents.<p>So it may be possible, but the architecture of the FPGA is not documented, so you&#x27;d have to completely reverse engineer the bitstream format, and if the protection is enabled, that&#x27;d <i>still</i> get you nowhere.')
