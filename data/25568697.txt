Item(by='noxer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609240186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566005, text='&gt;XRP is centralized<p>Useless statement XRP is the token there is no definition what makes the token centralized or not. Half the tokens owned by one party? or maybe a quarter is enough already? Its a useless statement as there is no common definition. no one talks about token decentralization anyway. Its about the control over the network that should not be centralized.<p>&gt;the ledger is permissioned<p>This is factually wrong. Anyone can transact on the ledger there is no permission required form anyone and no one has the power to exclude someone.<p>&gt;so not just anyone can join the network in a meaningful way<p>Also factually wrong. You can &quot;join&quot; the network in any possible way (node&#x2F;full node&#x2F;validator&#x2F;participant&#x2F;developer&#x2F;you name it). You can change the code and send in you amendment. If 80% think is worth adding its added. If not its probably because the proposal was garbage not because someone has the power to block your amendment. So far there has been 1 amendment not supported by ripple that still reached the 80% support. Ripple could do absolutely nothing against that.<p>XRPs existence is also not determined by the USA. XRP would exist without ripple or the USA as long some people run the software it exists. Even if all would go offline it could be restarted any time.')
