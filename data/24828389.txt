I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s chronic, but it very well may be.<p>Some of my thoughts have already been shared by others, but I try not to push myself as much as I used to do. I still try to do things I enjoyed before such as light exercise, taking long walks, and hanging out with friends (carefully, obviously, because of COVID). I might not go for a long bike ride, it doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t stay active without stressing my body beyond what would cause symptoms to flare.<p>The more I can keep my mind of symptoms by working, spending time with family and friends, and moving around, the less depressed I am.<p>I also try to educate myself on my condition&#x2F;symptoms. I try not to diagnose myself or come to solid conclusions. However, I feel like having a greater knowledge of anatomy and physiology with regard to my situation aids in asking appropriate questions to my physicians and understanding their feedback.')
