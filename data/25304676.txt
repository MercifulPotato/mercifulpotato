We&#x27;re considering whether and how to expose it.<p>&gt; I wonder how many devs will spawn tasks using the default executor and then wonder why things aren&#x27;t working out so well? Will there be tooling to help identify such issues?<p>What those issues would actually be, in practice, is still unclear, hence our reluctance to expose forced preemption. People rely on OS time-sharing (what you call preemption) <i>inside</i> applications far less than they think. No scheduling algorithm can make a program that requires more processing resources than available to run well.')
