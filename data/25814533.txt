I rarely need just one component and 5 displays at $20 is serious. If you want to sell a device, a $20 can easily kill your profit margin.<p>I am talking about direct from China and potentially selling products because if you just limit the discussion to single component hobby use then no amount is really too high. Why not $40? $80? You only need one, right?')
