Don&#x27;t like any of them enough to have ever voted.<p>I find many of my positions represented in the American mainstream but not by any (viable) parties domestically.<p>Also a big reason for the fragmentation of parties is simply how rigid they are internally. Most political parties in Europe are governed like private companies. Few have primaries and when they do they tend to be fairly limited. When there&#x27;s infighting between major players the simplest thing to do is often to just setup a new party. There&#x27;s not much of a culture of political affiliation or involvement. Just because you might have identified with some party doesn&#x27;t give you much of a platform to advocate for anything internally. If you don&#x27;t like it you need to find a new one.')
