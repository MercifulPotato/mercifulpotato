So forget those ultra small 256 bytes or less RAM systems.<p>Mid-sized systems (say 16 kB+ RAM), I think you&#x27;d still mostly run directly from ROM. Any RAM is probably needed for other use.<p>Larger systems with ARM M0 core (or better) and 64 kB+ RAM have a ton of CPU power and typically plenty of other resources as well.<p>Perhaps there are people who need to deal with mask ROMs, but do those need to be that small either in 2020? Or penny pincher cases where you just can&#x27;t have an extra I2C EEPROM &#x2F; flash chip and your target uC doesn&#x27;t have enough flash storage.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>In any case, LZ-family compressors (like LZ4) have served me well so far.<p>Edit: That LZSA mentioned in other comment(s) looks cool. Regardless, a small niche of applications where you&#x27;d need this in the first place.')
