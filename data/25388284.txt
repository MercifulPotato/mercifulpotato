Other than perhaps latency, if software was truly better in previous decades, you can just run old software on new hardware [1] and get the best of both worlds. Given infinite time, you could probably find a way to boot directly into some kind of hypervisor that runs RiscOS or whatever full-screen. While also running LVM underneath it for online backups. Oops, a new software feature.<p>It&#x27;s related to my pet peeve about Gemini: You can just choose to do all the stuff Gemini does with your own safe subset of HTTPS. If you have the political power and dev hours to maintain Gemini, you can also just maintain HTTP&#x2F;1.1 with TLS.<p>Running Acorn hardware won&#x27;t fix software bloat created by anyone but yourself, and running Gemini won&#x27;t fix HTTP bloat created by anyone but yourself. Might as well run good software on good hardware, instead of running bad protocols or bad hardware out of spite.<p>[1] I&#x27;m on the young end of millennials, so my nostalgia is for Windows XP. But there&#x27;s a valley for retro nostalgia - It&#x27;s okay to use modern Linux, because you need security patches. It&#x27;s okay to use Windows 10 because your employer forces it. It&#x27;s okay to run an Amiga or RiscOS ironically, because it&#x27;s cool and funny. But Windows XP? No! Evil security hazard! Deprecation means the software became bad overnight! Why won&#x27;t you upgrade??')
