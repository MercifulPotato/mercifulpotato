So these discussions usually go in circles.<p>i am aware of three definitions of consciousness, used often without clarity:<p>a&#x2F; consciousness = intelligence. By this definition, a lot of AI has some level of consciousness<p>b&#x2F; conciouness = being awake and alert. A lot of studies for instance that compare MRI of alert vs unconscious humans focus on this aspect.<p>c&#x2F; consciousness the way we humans experience the sense of self awareness (&quot;watching a movie from inside&quot;, etc). This must be more than an illusion because for instance right now I am writing about it so that &quot;sense&quot; is affecting my actions. But how do you even define or test for it?<p>It&#x27;s likely you have a lot of (a) without (c), and you could have a lot of (c) with little (a). We can test for (a) but not for (c), so for now it&#x27;s all philosophical speculation.<p>Until we can define and test for (c), I don&#x27;t see much progress being made here.')
