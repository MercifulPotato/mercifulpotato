Those who own it can ensure people buy on their marketplace, and companies that want to sell to these consumers must pay a fee. Amazon can&#x27;t reasonably compete with google or apple in the &quot;voice agent on the smartphone&quot; segment until some antitrust forces those to offer a choice of agents, so they do the smart thing: push hard for a quasi monopoly on ambient microphones.<p>Over time there could be an antitrust to tell Amazon they must open <i>&quot;their&quot;</i> voice agent infrastructure for the competition, and they will use this <i>&quot;investment&quot;</i> as an argument why that would be unfair to them. Even if, they will rather add an API limited to accredited competition instead of giving consumers root on the hardware.<p>The whole concept is hostile to the consumer by design: imagine a keyboard would include a non-replaceable typing agent that can only type on websites that are partners with the keyboard manufacturer (as in &quot;buy the skill for your keyboard to type on HN&quot;) and all your inputs are first sent to the manufacturers servers. Hey you get auto-complete and the keyboard is cheap. That is the state of voice agents.')
