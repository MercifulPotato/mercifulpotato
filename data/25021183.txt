They see all his flaws, and think that it makes Trump more human, and therefore a better president. They think Biden lacks &quot;energy&quot;, and don&#x27;t understand how anyone could want to vote for him.<p>Both sides are voting &quot;correctly&quot; according to their own criteria, which is why they&#x27;re both so incredibly bewildered by how the other side votes. The disconnect isn&#x27;t because one side is &quot;better&quot; at picking than the other using shared criteria, it&#x27;s because both sides are using different criteria completely.')
