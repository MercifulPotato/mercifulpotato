This is counter the  tradition of what is &quot;normal&quot; for a Green party in other countries. their ultra conservative approach gobbles up previous FPÖ voters that are disillusioned with the Ibiza scandal and the crowd that screams &quot;ban burkas&quot; or are obsessed with foreigners not &quot;integrating themselves properly&quot; especially brown people (it&#x27;s ok to live there as a native English speaker you will never feel any of it).<p>Austria is the most West of all the Eastern EU countries so a lot of things that are not normal in Western Europe are so in Austria. The right is cosying up to Putin (who often gets invited to private events like weddings by Austrian politicians) and as close to Russia as Poland is to the US. Many Austrian high-end properties from skiing resorts to Vienna is in the hands of Russians, ... there is a good reason Austrian secret service was dropped as an ally to share information with from other FVEY-allied countries: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-austria-security-idUSKCN1RL2CM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-austria-security-idUSKCN1...</a>')
