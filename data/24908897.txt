I have NEVER had a phone that quickly and easily pairs with our car stereos.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s because I use android phones.  I&#x27;m convinced the manufacturers test with iphones and say &quot;yep, works perfect&quot; and call it a day.<p>In one car, we have an aftermarket JBL stereo; it typically takes about 30-45 seconds to pair. Unacceptable, but better than the stereo in the CX-9 -- with that one, it&#x27;s typically about 3-4 minutes before I can hear any audio.  30 seconds of searching for the phone, and then like 2-3 minutes of limbo where it&#x27;s doing god-knows-what telling me it can&#x27;t play audio while it transfers phone data.  Surely my contact list doesn&#x27;t take that long to sync?<p>Quite often, I get a &quot;ghost&quot; connection, where the phone indicates it&#x27;s connnected, and the car stereo does, too.  Audio applications are playing, and the time is advancing, but no audio is coming out.  Usually takes about 2-3 disconnect&#x2F;reconnect cycles to correct it.<p>Paired to an Amazon Echo, my phone disconnects every time the music pauses; this is a new problem.<p>For a while, my Sony STR-DN1050 connected so well that I could just select it on my phone, and it would power up the receiver, select the Bluetooth input, and connect within 3 seconds.  Then one day, it just stopped working that way, and I have to power up the receiver and manually select the Bluetooth input before trying to connect.<p>About once every couple of months, I have to REBOOT the phone in order to get pairing to work.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this erratic and pitiful performance on a wide variety of android phones, from low-end to high end: Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, Galaxy S8, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, Moto G6, Moto G7.  Over nearly a decade, it just never gets better.')
