It&#x27;s done to be as painful as possible while being legal to make the user hate the experience and blame the law, not the implementation.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the EU cracks down on dark pattern implementations, malicious compliance (as another comment mentioned) very likely goes against the spirit of the law. The ad-tech industry is quite powerful so I think this will drag on for a while.<p>While it drags out, I&#x27;ve been stubborn. Always refusing all cookies when I can&#x27;t zap the cookie banner&#x2F;blocker with uBlock. The most pain I can take is setting about 20 toggles. There are some implementations creating hundreds of lines of opt-outs, some where you have to opt-out vendor by vendor on their own website. Those are the ones where I close the page and forget about the content. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle and my data.<p>I wasn&#x27;t such an advocate for data privacy half a decade ago, I was aware about it and how it could be used, just had never seen it, not necessarily in action at the time, but being debated on corridors.<p>The unethical proposals I heard in meetings or by the coffee machines on how to extract&#x2F;transform&#x2F;identify through amassing data were quite alarming. Not because they were blatant bad but that the collective way of talking about it completely disregarded the end user.<p>GDPR really changed that talk internally, it&#x27;s been a massive effort and a pain in the ass sometimes but I do value the spirit of it. Could it be the wrong approach? Or too heavy-handed? Misapplied? And so many other still unknown problems? Yes, I do think there are too much uncertainty in how this pans out on the long term. I do deeply appreciate the effort though from the EP and the EU in putting this into the public eye, we should have been having this discussion quite some years ago...<p>There are still tons of open questions and discussions to be had on data privacy laws, I feel the pain of having an increased workload because of it but it should become cost of business. Protection of your customers&#x27; data, its usage and their privacy should be a cost of business for companies depending on that. Level the game, create some mechanisms to help smaller companies be bootstrapped with this mindset and with guidelines and best practices for a quick ramp up.<p>It can be a cost of business for large enterprises, smaller companies might need help to not be overburden if these laws get too complex.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m too revolutionary.')
