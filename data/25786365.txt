I&#x27;m also building SwanLove (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swan.love" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swan.love</a>), a dating website based on Linkedin and movies preferences (and later books preferences).<p>Later there will be a cross-functionality between them. For example, you can create a private group to share salaries. In the group you can like (romantically) people. Finally, there will be a feature to predict the salary from Linkedin profile.<p>In SwanLove, in the future, you can link your accomplishments from other websites based on API. If you were a runner, you could show that you have joined marathons in SwanLove by connecting through API to a running website. So you could show off your physical fitness. Other than running, you could show your chess elo rating to show off your intelligence.')
