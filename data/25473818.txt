That&#x27;s horrible for them, of course, but the broader implication is that they may not be uniquely incompetent.  How many other internet security companies are... let&#x27;s say less than fully trustworthy with your own organization&#x27;s security?  It may be time to review your exposure to your security partner&#x27;s failings.<p>Second, there are organizations who genuinely need security.  This is important to them because they need to figure out if they were compromised, and how to recover if they were.<p>Third, it&#x27;s important because it reveals the level of skill, persistence, and just <i>obsessiveness</i> that you&#x27;re up against when you try to keep a set of computers secure.')
