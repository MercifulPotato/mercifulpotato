They should be renamed `Discover &lt;programming language&gt; in 5 minutes`. Replace the verb Discover by Introduce or something similar if you like.<p>There is a lot of difference between learning a new programming language and discovering one.<p>You will not learn any programming language in 5 minutes.<p>This introduction to Go is quite nice, though.')
