Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612194748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989656, text='The results and conclusions here are rather interesting:<p>&gt; Results<p>&gt; After adjustment for covariates, the habitual use of vitamin D supplements was significantly associated with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 infection (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45â€“0.97; P = 0.034). Circulating vitamin D levels at baseline or genetically predicted vitamin D levels were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection. The association between the use of vitamin D supplements and the risk of COVID-19 infection did not vary according to the different levels of circulating or genetically predicted vitamin D (P-interactions = 0.75 and 0.74, respectively).<p>&gt; Conclusions<p>&gt; Our findings suggest that habitual use of vitamin D supplements is related to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inverse association is due to residual confounding or selection bias. Further clinical trials are needed to verify these results.<p>I&#x27;m a little puzzled why <i>taking</i> vitamin D supplements was associated with lower risk of COVID infection, but vitamin D <i>levels</i> were not.  This suggests that vitamin D might not do anything as a post-infection intervention.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that this was a prospective study, meaning people were enrolled before they became sick.  So, they&#x27;re not just using data from sick people to correlate vitamin D levels with outcomes like many other studies have done.')
