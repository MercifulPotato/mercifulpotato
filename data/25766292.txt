Which happens to be friend of Harry Reid, is interested in UFOs and has donated money to Reid&#x27;s campaigns (what a coincidence!)<p>But the program was secret. Because, you know, aliens. And national security. Until its existence was revealed in 2017 - the year Reid retired from politics.<p>I remember thinking how blatant and ingenious this corruption scheme was when I first heard of it. He gave money to his friends and even when it&#x27;s publicly known nobody associates it with corruption because of &quot;aliens&quot;')
