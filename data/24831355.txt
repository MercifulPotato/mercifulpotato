Good requires an hour or two per day, of deliberate and focused practice.  People don&#x27;t play Ã©tudes for fun.  Excellence requires several hours per day.  Even Itzhak Perlman describes his practice regimen as tedious, and I once heard him say that he practices while watching TV, to alleviate the boredom.  Paganini, on the other hand, played all day to forestall his father&#x27;s physical abuse.<p>I was &quot;good,&quot; for a time, but pursuit of excellence never met my cost benefit analysis')
