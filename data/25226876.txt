But since programming has so far restricted attempts at credentialism-gatekeeping and even unionising, I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>&gt; IMO you can already see this happening to Ruby, and Rust. Increasing attention to making low level languages more palatable.<p>Or viewed in reverse, attempts to make higher level languages faster.<p>One way to do that is to make sure that the levels of abstraction that exists in the language don&#x27;t leave much of a trace at runtime.  Ie compile the abstractions away.<p>That&#x27;s more straightforward with more statically typed languages.  But the excellent work done on JavaScript engines shows that given enough resources to throw at the problem, being &#x27;slow&#x27; or &#x27;fast&#x27; is not a property of languages but of implementations.  (But the language definitely has an influence on how much implementation effort you need.)')
