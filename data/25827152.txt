But Zoom and similar video software is the only reason a lot of people still have jobs, or can see the faces of their family and friends. That&#x27;s a lot more concrete and important than the &quot;event boundaries&quot; and other hand-wavy psychology theory the author complains about.<p>Imagine if this pandemic had happened in 1990, or even 2000. The web would have been nonexistent (in 1990) or quite young (in 2000). There was not much video conferencing software available, and most people didn&#x27;t have broadband anyway. Many more people would have been unable to do their jobs from home than is the case today, so many more would have been unemployed.<p>Let&#x27;s invert the article and talk about all the technological solutions that have improved life during the pandemic:<p>- Video conferencing saves jobs, make remote learning possible, and enables people to see the faces of their friends and family.<p>- Delivery services make it easier for people to quarantine at home and avoid risking exposure in grocery stores and restaurants. They also help keep many restaurants in business, as most restaurants do not have (and cannot afford) their own staff of drivers.<p>- Streaming services help people stay sane while cooped up at home.<p>Throughout the pandemic, a lot of tech products that people used to criticize as useless have proven very useful.')
