Somehow waiting 2 hours more per trip is completely unacceptable but causing pollution that makes people ill even when it is completely unnecessary is somehow very acceptable.<p>People will imagine impossible technology to save those 8 hours per year and then pretend that they deserve this impossible technology. Think about how impossible it is to solve climate change with CO2 polluting cars. Meanwhile waiting for your EV to charge up 4 times a year is the worst and climate change is considered the lesser evil.')
