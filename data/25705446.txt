They don&#x27;t always get it right?!  They are literally there to ensure you get it wrong!  They really are.  They are part of the governance structure - they will not tell you the way out of this situation, or give you good information.<p>All I would say, is that you need to ensure that you act on what you know.  Not on what you believe.  Verify everything you accept as true or discard or assume it but be prepared to be corrected if you get better information.  And if it turns out that you don&#x27;t know a whole lot - that is fine!  At least you&#x27;re not acting incorrectly and causing problems!<p>At the end of the day if you are acting on stuff that you don&#x27;t know, you can inadvertently cause more harm, even though you mean well.  You can be manipulated (easily) to go along with the crowd.<p>All the best.')
