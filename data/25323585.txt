They are playing fast and loose with lives, understanding that, once the wildfire rages through, causing an unprecedented loss of life, the remaining population will be genetically predisposed against the virus.<p>The other side is playing fast and loose with regulations in the way you just described, because of the tremendous potential loss of life if we do not.<p>I don&#x27;t pretend these are the same, but they do have similarities. And I believe the healthy thing to do is to come to grips with that as a people and have a public conversation about it.')
