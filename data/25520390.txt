A real-life recommendation engine is written and deployed as part of a business plan.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that <i>all</i> recommendation engines deployed by for-profit companies have some element of recommending things that drive more revenue for the company. The question is, how much does end user give up, in terms of getting actually interesting recommendations vs being recommended something that is more profitable for the company, in exchange for getting things of interest to their attention.<p>I&#x27;ve seen enough to be convinced, anecdotally, that YouTube&#x27;s recommendation engine is heavily skewed towards revenue-driving.
