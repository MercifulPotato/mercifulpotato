So the high ISP is mostly lost to  higher dead mass requirements.<p>If (when) Starship proves it can be fully refueled in-orbit, it obviates every potential advantage of Nuclear Thermal rockets. Starship will be able to make 90 day trips to Mars, carry heavy payloads in excess of 100 tons to the Martian or lunar surfaces, and do this all without requiring specialized landers and with zero radiation and other regulatory concerns.')
