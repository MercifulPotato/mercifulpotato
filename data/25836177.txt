I find that I am mentally fresh even after working long into the evening just because I don&#x27;t have the dread of making the arduous commute.<p>I&#x27;d gladly work longer hours if it meant permanent WFH. Employer gets more efficient worked hours from me, I don&#x27;t have to waste 2-3 hours&#x2F;day on a stupid bus&#x2F;subway commute. My employer is traditional conservative enough (bank) that permanent or majority WFH is a nonstarter though.<p>Reducing the commute is not possible without paying significantly more for housing (and probably still resulting in a smaller and crappier place).')
