I just switched to a new area (big data) one year ago for instance and had no problem finding a job. Maybe it&#x27;s because I live in Europe and in the USA things are different, who knows.<p>But there is one thing though that can make switching jobs more difficult for senior developers, and that is the salary. Chances are that when you&#x27;re older you are supporting kids, a house, or you just have become used to a higher standard of living. So you will probably look for a higher salary in a new job and yes, that limits your opportunities.')
