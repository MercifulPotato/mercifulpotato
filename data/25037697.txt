Not just offer a veggie burger for &quot;poor liberals and vegetarians&quot; who have nothing else to eat at McDonalds.<p>I really hope they don&#x27;t screw this up by producing a crappy Costco-quality veggie burger. Impossible and Beyond are doing great on the taste front, Burger King already engaged Impossible, and I&#x27;m not sure how much research it will take McDonald&#x27;s to catch up.')
