We use them fairly commonly as dedicated voip links, or for PRI phone systems where the customer insists on avoiding voip. Also in some places they are about the best connectivity you can get when the only alternatives are way oversold dsl or trying to aim a wisp antenna though some trees to catch a signal bounced off a mountainside. And, if you have the means, (and ILEC cabling facilities), the circuits can be bonded together to arbitrary numbers. So, yeah, it&#x27;s slow. But it&#x27;s better than nothing. That said I fully expect Starlink to take that ultra-rural business in the coming year or two.')
