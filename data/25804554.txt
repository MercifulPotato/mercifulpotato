Energy is being produced&#x2F;generated somewhere to prop up the demand created by the system you put in place, and your network congestion adversely effects everyone else. Don&#x27;t let the &quot;transparency&quot; of the network lull you into Tragedy of the Commons behavioral patterns. Act with intention. If you find your thing is overwhelming your own capacity to handle traffic, either implement rate modulation capability, or restructure your program to mitigate whatever is creating the problem.<p>Just because there are selfish. a-holes who think the internet is an infinite resource intended solely for their own enjoyment, convenience and exploitation, does not mean it is okay for everyone to act that way.
