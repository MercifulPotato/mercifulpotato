This means it should never connect to any machine other than the developer machine.<p>Just to help with the postmortem:<p>1) “localhost” is just a loopback to whatever machine you’re on<p>2) the user and pw are pulled from config<p>So someone was running this from the production server or had the production DB mapped to localhost and ran it with a production config for some reason (working with prod data maybe). The hard coding to localhost will only ensure that it works for the machine it’s called on - in this case the prod server.<p>Things you might do to avoid this in the future include a wide spread of things, the main recommendations I’d have are:<p>1) only put production artifacts on prod<p>2) limit developer access to prod data<p>Best of luck')
