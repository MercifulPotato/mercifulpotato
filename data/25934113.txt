And you&#x27;d have to have a lot of simultaneous http requests for it to help at all.<p>But I&#x27;m with you on trying to batch this with your JS should not be a browser thing or even a built in standard library JS function.<p>One could do it themselves - maybe graphQl kind of this idea of more complex queries + maybe just throw the requests you want to make into an array and when it hits length = 5 send them all at once. But I don&#x27;t see how that would help response times at all.')
