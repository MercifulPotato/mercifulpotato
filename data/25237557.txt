The fact I&#x27;ve seen about 3 chess related submissions on HN recently, where I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing one before, suggests it does.<p>I used to enjoy a game of chess back in the day, although I was never very good. And I always imagined myself playing chess with a remote opponent by post when I was a dusty old man [as featured in a few period dramas].<p>It&#x27;s a shame that the advent of the internet has simultaneously increased your chances of finding someone to play with remotely but, at the same time, [for me anyway] pretty much removed all inclination to do so, as I&#x27;d never be sure my opponent wasn&#x27;t just putting the moves into a computer and playing whatever it told him to play.')
