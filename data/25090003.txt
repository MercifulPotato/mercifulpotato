We learned to treat diseases. We learned how to control plagues. We learned to control maternal and infant mortality. We learned to fly. We learned to go to space. We learned to tame and control nature for our benefit.<p>Uh, go us? We also invest far more in weapons, fighting, and potential fighting, than any other single one of the above. We invented nuclear weapons and build a hundred thousand of them, and the primary purpose of going to space was to feed tech into rockets to deliver them anywhere on Earth in 40 minutes. We pioneered genocide and now we are working on perfecting ecocide.<p>Science and technology are only as good as the ends to which they are directed. That so far is primarily war and making money. But that&#x27;s redundant. War is about making money, too.')
