The picture is swollen bellies and the story in people&#x27;s minds is &quot;crop failure&quot; or &quot;civil or natural disaster&quot;, to which the logical solution would be &quot;send food&quot;.<p>... because the natural next question to ask if it is a distribution failure and food is just sitting in warehouses and people are starving is: &quot;why doesn&#x27;t their government sort it out?&quot;.<p>If the solution is to give people cash, there are awkward questions like &quot;who are the importers and suppliers who will be collecting all this cash?&quot; and the inevitable conclusion that &quot;this is just government corruption with extra steps&quot;.<p>To be clear, I think if one is to &quot;give well&quot; then doing it in an evidence-based way that will provide the most benefit is best. But I think it sets off a chain of questions that makes giving more morally complicated for many donors.')
