Item(by='gvb', descendants=None, kids=[25050723, 25047681], score=None, time=1605021172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046482, text='There is nothing inherently special about Taiwan for chip manufacturing. Theoretically, Europe and the US can (and do, to some extent) challenge TSMC and China aspires to do so too.<p>The fundamental problem is that it is extraordinarily expensive to build a state of the art chip fab and it is extraordinarily difficult to make start of the art chips (process technology in the 7nm node range). The technology is heavily patented and, what isn&#x27;t patented, is tightly controlled as trade secrets by fabs.<p>TSMC[1] started as a contract fab house with competent, but not state of the art, fab capabilities. Over time and with immense investments, they have become a leading (arguably <i>the</i> leading) fab. Intel is on par (arguably) or has fallen slightly behind TSMC in terms of state of the art fab capabilities. Global Foundries[2] (made up of former IBM foundries[3], Motorola foundries, and others, acquired by AMD and subsequently spun out) has fallen behind in terms of state of the art (e.g. 7nm nodes). Europe also has quite a few competent, but not state of the art, foundaries.<p>There are a ton of fabs that were state of the art but have not been upgraded - they are quietly fabbing billions of chips that don&#x27;t need smaller geometry fab nodes and cannot justify the expense of moving to more state of the art fabs. &quot;Moving&quot; to a new fab node technology requires a significant redesign of the chip and would require requalifying, both of which are very expensive.<p>Ref:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_semiconductor_fabricat...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TSMC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TSMC</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GlobalFoundries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GlobalFoundries</a><p>[3] Trivia: IBM <i>paid</i> Global Foundries to acquire their (IBM&#x27;s) chip foundries.')
