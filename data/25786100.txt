You can just plug it into your computer and download the data. There exist a number of open source tools. I&#x27;ve only used GPXSee for looking at the GPS data, which actually let me see &quot;correct&quot; swimming distance data where Garmin was using some algorithm that didn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>I mostly use the web ui but loading the data into one of the open source offline tools is on my to-do list. There&#x27;s actually some analytics&#x2F;reports I want to generate that Garmin doesn&#x27;t provide, so I might end up doing it purely to write some reports.<p>(Although the peace of mind I would get knowing that I could pull the plug on my Garmin account whenever I want would be nice.)<p>Though it isn&#x27;t perfect. When Garmin had the outage last year I unpaired my phone which actually reset some of the configuration I had done on the watch, which was really annoying.')
