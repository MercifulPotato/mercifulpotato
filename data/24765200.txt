Subjectively, I feel the following about it: after over 2 decades of being extremely buggy and extremely ugly, KDE has became a culmination of desktop PC GUI design, the best I&#x27;ve experienced so far (tiling WMs can be better in certain tasks and settings but not universally).<p>Manjaro with recent KDE provides me what I call &quot;a lot like Mac but way better&quot; experience (surely, there are aspects in which Mac or any other system is better, I just don&#x27;t know which particular).<p>And it has made a great replacement once Ubuntu lost its Unity (right at the moment it became polished enough).<p>The only disappointing part are the plasmoids - I could make a lot of use of some desktop widgets but it&#x27;s pain to find useful plasmoids and make them work, making your own plasmoids seems complicated.<p>In fact I&#x27;d be comfortable with a generic terminal plasmoid (with a read-only mode option) and a generic browser (just display a specific URL, refresh periodically, basic HTML support is enough) plasmoid but it seems too much hassle to build them. I just wonder why these are not available OOTB.<p>More (and easy) hackability could also make KDE even cooler.<p>UPDATE (some more things I&#x27;d like to be fixed just came to my mind as I had a cup of tea):<p>KDE still has not reached the Unity level of the Mac-like global menu (D-BUS menu) support: some apps which worked with Unity global menu perfectly (and also work on Mac) still won&#x27;t work with the global menu in KDE. I had to fall-back to the &quot;Windows way&quot; of having menus in every window to maintain uniform experience among different apps - too many apps left the global menu bar empty. This isn&#x27;t a particularly serious problem though. Unity&#x27;s facility of searching through menu items was also insanely cool and should be ported (as we have the D-BUS menu anyway).<p>I want to completely disable clipboard management so it wouldn&#x27;t remember clipboard history (which is a security issue) and wouldn&#x27;t clear the clipboard as soon as I close the window (extremely inconvenient - I often want to open a window just to copy something, close it and paste that somewhere else). But I could never find how.<p>I don&#x27;t want tray messages to pop-up as soon as I start copying files. I&#x27;m not even sure I want them when the process finishes (perhaps there is a less annoying way to know it&#x27;s done).<p>I&#x27;d like an option for Yakuake to actually replace Konsole so whenever I click &quot;open terminal here&quot; (preferably - in any app) it would open a new tab in Yakuake.<p>That&#x27;s all the improvements to make KDE effectively perfect IMHO.')
