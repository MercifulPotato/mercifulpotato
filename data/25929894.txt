WSB has been pushing GME for months. Then things got heated with them and the major shorts, it brought more attention to it, and GME shot up quite a bit. That amplified the story even more, which brought it more demand for GME. That cycle has just continued, building more and more interest each time.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the story has come close to reaching its peak yet either. I suspect there will start to be some major headlines still this week, which will bring in more speculative interest.<p>Then, at some point, the story fizzles. The gains stop and the price will collapse. It&#x27;s going to be an interesting week or so watching this all play out.')
