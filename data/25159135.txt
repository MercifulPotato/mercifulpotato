I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re talking about pepole having their own machine or processing the results in the cloud though. It seems like the underlying test - a few sensors exposed to a urine sample is something you could provide in a thousand different ways (test via mail, routine tests during doctors check ups) without waving yours and going &quot;WooooOOoOOoo Clloooudddd&quot; - although maybe that&#x27;s the sort of thing you need to do to impress Dyson.')
