In one paragraph, it is “self or family member”, but in the next paragraph, it becomes &quot;50 per cent of respondents in urban Rajasthan admitted to practising untouchability&quot;. This is the same kind of yellow journalism that in the US lead to prominent figures touting &quot;one in five women on college campuses is raped&quot;. There is no epidemic of rape in US college campuses either.<p>I asked you how often you get asked for your caste, which you did not answer. I have a few very visibly brahmin colleagues. When we work together, they don&#x27;t discriminate against any of my colleagues or me. When we go for team outings, they don&#x27;t go to restaurant kitchens and ask the cooks and waiters for their caste, and more often than not, the restaurant serves meat.')
