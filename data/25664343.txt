But then, WhatsApp isn&#x27;t that good compared to Telegram either. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t use WhatsApp at all if various communities wouldn&#x27;t host there group-chats I belong to. So I don&#x27;t think usability has that much to do with your ability to switch. And supposed &quot;security&quot; has almost nothing to do with it whatsoever.<p>So I personally don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll keep fighting for my privacy and stuff or if I&#x27;m going to give up now. I don&#x27;t want to, but I honestly don&#x27;t imagine how on Feb08 I will be telling people who aren&#x27;t my close friends or co-workers, but communication with whom is really valuable to me, that I refuse to join any WhatsApp group chats anymore, so they will have to notify me about anything important (important to me, in he first place!) personally via SMS, Telegram, email, whatever. Especially now, when people are forced to communicate remotely and stuff gets cancelled&#x2F;renewed&#x2F;delayed because of another round of idiotic government regulations, so if I&#x27;ll fall out of these communities, I&#x27;m pretty much left in the vacuum and won&#x27;t know about anything that happens.')
