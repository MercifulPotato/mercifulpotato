Fix the 1-2 frequencies where it&#x27;s just way too loud.<p>The fiddly and free route: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roomeqwizard.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roomeqwizard.com&#x2F;</a> (search for tutorials on that) and than for windows there is &quot;Equalizer APO&quot; to load it. Use the best mic you have, in a really bad room even an sm57 will do wonders.<p>The more expensive and easy route: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sonarworks.com&#x2F;reference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sonarworks.com&#x2F;reference</a> with a measuring mic (they are not that expensive).<p>I think the worse your room and speakers are the more this helps (I lived an a square tube, now in a better shaped room the effect is much less noticeable). For me it really cleans up the otherwise muddy lows. I can recommend boosting them afterwards for a more hi-fi sound, really neutral doesn&#x27;t have the punch you might be used to :).<p>Disclaimer: this will be worse than the perfect physical setup. You can fix some things in software, but there will be losses and it and only fix one point in your room really well. It&#x27;s also a hassle to change EQ settings when you change to headphones.')
