Terminus House is social housing (no-one&#x27;s arguing that it&#x27;s not, and that it&#x27;s not bad), what they&#x27;re describing in SF is different as it&#x27;s commercial, and certainly at least medium-grade private housing.<p>Whether or not the free market has caused the use of private companies to provide project style social housing on the fringes of cities (short answer: of course it has) is somewhat irrelevant compared with converting city-centre commercial property into private accommodation.<p>&gt;&gt; sounds like the residents were placed in this building by government<p>&gt; council didn&#x27;t &#x27;choose&#x27; to put people there<p>Again, your response isn&#x27;t to the point being made really - no-ones really arguing against your point. Just because they didn&#x27;t have any real alternative doesn&#x27;t invalidate the point that they did it.')
