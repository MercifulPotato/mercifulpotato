But there are also those of us with exactly the opposite needs.<p>Until this current health crisis forced remote work on a large scale, those of us who thrive in solitude were forced to work harder to do our jobs well despite the extra social demands.  Now many of us can breathe and are more productive, more balanced, and happier.<p>Let the extroverts have smaller offices, and let us introverts work remotely.  I can be quite social, I can perform music on stage, and I can genuinely interact with other humans face to face and leave everyone feeling enriched.  But after all those things, I&#x27;m exhausted and need low stimulus recovery.  I may be in the minority, but I believe it is a larger minority than people might expect.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m tired of hearing one-sided stories of how &quot;everyone wants to come back to work!&quot;  No, we do not all want to come back to the office.<p>In fact, I will going forward only accept remote positions.  There will thankfully be more of them as companies are recognizing that remote can work and that reduced office costs are good for the bottom line.')
