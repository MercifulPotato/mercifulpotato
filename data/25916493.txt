Equivalent sites I looked at did not cite studies, frequently depending on an argument from theory. For example, one quoting an optometrist: &quot;&#x27;Your actual prescription is based on the anatomy of the eye: the front curve of the cornea, the refractive power of the intraocular lens, and the length of the eyeball.&#x27; And peering through spectacles wonâ€™t change that anatomy&quot;.<p>But this study shows that at least the kind of glasses one wears can change the progression of myopia, so arguments from theory are unconvincing to me: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;22161388&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;22161388&#x2F;</a><p>I have no idea what the actual truth is here. It seems like a variety of opinions abound, although everybody seems to agree the phenomenon of <i>feeling</i> like things are worse when you&#x27;ve recently worn glasses is real. So in this case I&#x27;ll continue go with what works for me: generally not wearing glasses except when driving, which is the only place it makes a practical difference for me.')
