California had frequently elected Republican governors (including one who went on to become president), had house delegations that were majority Republican for stretches of time, and except for Johnson&#x27;s win in 1964 CA was a solid batch of electors for the Republican presidential candidate up until Clinton.<p>CA was a Republican state from the late 19th century up until the 1990s.')
