Item(by='standevbob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608738255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25518390, text='Yes, we regularly use Stan&#x27;s MCMC to fit relatively simple time-series regression models or item-response theory type models with 10^5 parameters and 10^6 rows of data on a desktop computer.  It can take a day, though.  It&#x27;s much faster with variational inference, but that can be less stable and it doesn&#x27;t give you the same uncertainty quantification because of the way the KL-divergence is ordered in the objective.<p>Stan can parallelize multiple chains and it can parallelize the density&#x2F;gradient calculations in a single chain.   But for the latter to be efficient, the chunks being parallelized need to be compute intensive, like you might get in a pharmacometric compartment model where you might have to solve a bunch of differential equations for each of thousands of patients in a clinical trial.')
