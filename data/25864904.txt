Item(by='telotortium', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611266003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25861431, text='&quot;x more than y&quot; means &quot;y + x&quot; - a sum. &quot;x% more than y&quot; means &quot;y + x% = y + y×(x÷100)&quot; and &quot;x%  less than y&quot; means &quot;y - x% = y - y×(x÷100)&quot;.<p>To me, &quot;x times more than y&quot; means the same as &quot;x times as much as y&quot; only &quot;y×x&quot; and &quot;x times less than y&quot; means &quot;y÷x&quot;. I guess this might seem ambiguous if you bracket the expression like &quot;x times (more than) y&quot;, but in practice it&#x27;s bracketed like &quot;x (times more than) y&quot;.<p>(Native American English speaker)')
