Not with Rosetta.  Instead, the guest OS will have to provide its own translation (such as windows&#x2F;arm&#x27;s current x86-&gt;arm64 or upcoming x86_64-&gt;arm64 feature).  I&#x27;m not familiar if there is any usable high performance x86_64-&gt;arm translation available for linux.<p>Docker w&#x2F; arm images:  needs some work to be able to work on mac&#x2F;arm virtualization, but it&#x27;s coming.<p>Docker w&#x2F; arm linux kernel + x86 userland images:  Any translation solution would be found within the linux guestOS, not macOS.  I don&#x27;t know if any candidates exist.  Maybe qemu?<p>Docker w&#x2F; full x86 image (incl. kernel): I don&#x27;t think this is possible?')
