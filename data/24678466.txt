Now that most of the available land is covered in large-plot, low-density housing, they kind of realized the money train has reached its destination and they now have to maintain all of this infrastructure.<p>The same mayor (Hazel McCallion) was re-elected over and over for forty years, and so the same kind of thinking was perpetuated over that time period because no fresh thinking was introduced and things basically ran on inertia. She is often labelled the &quot;Queen of Sprawl&quot;.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;toronto&#x2F;how-hazel-mccallion-learned-a-thing-or-two-about-sprawl&#x2F;article21412631&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;toronto&#x2F;how-hazel-mccal...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;DpKKp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;DpKKp</a><p>There are of course some plots left, and over the past few years they&#x27;ve been building medium-density townhomes, as well as more and more mid- and high-rise towers.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insauga.com&#x2F;is-hazel-mccallion-wrong-on-this-huge-issue-in-mississauga" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insauga.com&#x2F;is-hazel-mccallion-wrong-on-this-hug...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torontostoreys.com&#x2F;issue-of-the-year-mississauga&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torontostoreys.com&#x2F;issue-of-the-year-mississauga&#x2F;</a>')
