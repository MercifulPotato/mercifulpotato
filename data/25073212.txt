Seems like every page I visit these days blocks the content until I disable it, if it&#x27;s not an outright paywall. I think I spend more time disabling my ad blocker temporarily than I save by not loading ads in the first place.<p>Do others find that ad blockers actually still work well?<p>Meanwhile, reader mode in Safari will generally hide every ad on the page. It doesn&#x27;t help with the privacy or battery life or security benefits that ad blockers provide, but in terms of just the user experience, at this point at least for me it&#x27;s far superior to using an ad blocker. So I&#x27;ve been using safari more and more just for this.<p>Edit: Why am I getting downvoted? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m violating any guidelines or saying anything inflammatory here, just curious about other people&#x27;s experiences using ad blockers.')
