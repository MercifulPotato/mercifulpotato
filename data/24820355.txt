The second generation may be up and running by 2023 [2].<p>There&#x27;s an interesting paper [3] about building 40,000 Sorek style plants to sequester excess water in arid areas and avoid problems with sea level rise. Without any savings at scale, this would be around 20 trillion dollars, but that&#x27;s clearly cheaper than building infrastructure to protect coasts around the world, with the side benefit of creating jobs and food in areas that are in the most need.<p>I&#x27;ve been working (in the script-writing sense) on a narrative around EarthStations -- molten salt solar towers powering desal plants and green tech manufacturing, surrounded by highly efficient farms, and further out in the ring, forests that eat the desert. Since they are located on coasts, all the infrastructure can be delivered by ships, and all the goods created easily shipped out once they are up and running.<p>One big technical problem is what to do with the brine -- I&#x27;m not sure how much could go into molten salt heat storage. But they could serve as an engine to keep sea levels stable.<p>This is a longwinded way of saying I think the project in Egypt is a good example of the terraforming we need to be doing instead of dreaming about for a planet like Mars. Even though it is small scale, turning deserts into forests is pretty impressive, and something we need to do learn how to do well to fight climate change.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;israel-proves-the-desalination-era-is-here&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;israel-proves-the...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.globes.co.il&#x2F;en&#x2F;article-ide-wins-sorek-2-desalination-tender-after-us-pressure-1001330178" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.globes.co.il&#x2F;en&#x2F;article-ide-wins-sorek-2-desalina...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f1000research.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-889" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f1000research.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;5-889</a>')
