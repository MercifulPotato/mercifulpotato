E.g.,<p>* normalized 128 byte message content size<p>* defaults to sending all messages during a one-hour window each day<p>* no acks until next one-hour sending window<p>That&#x27;s quite ascetic. But I think you get certain privacy properties that way which aren&#x27;t otherwise possible. It would interesting to see if there are practical uses for those properties.<p>Edit: Oops, forgot:<p>* when the client is opened, fill a 128-byte buffer with random garbage. When the one-hour send window arrives, if no message has been set in the UI then send the garbage (and reset the buffer to new garbage).<p>Again, super crude but this PIR is a kind of brute-force approach anyway.')
