Heck, you might almost call that science!<p>Right now, there aren&#x27;t additional results and you can&#x27;t easily reproduce them because the machines aren&#x27;t wide spread or available. But we can take the track record and reputation of the site and application and use that to value the integrity of the published benchmarks to be &#x27;likely correct&#x27;.')
