Except for the times HN has gone down, I&#x27;ve never seen it take 5-10 seconds just to load the front page or any of the comment threads. I&#x27;m assuming it has something to do with so many users checking out this thread, which is pretty amazing for a Friday night.<p>(viewing HN in logged out mode is much faster thanks to the caching)')
