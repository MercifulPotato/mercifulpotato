Three topics no college had any current or relevant courses on at the time.<p>Dell was right to steer people towards operating systems that give users freedom. A subset of those users will take advantage of that freedom to learn far more about technology than their coursework will cover.<p>Will that make them different? Will being different require them to solve more problems themselves and rely less on others? Yes and Yes.<p>That is a feature, not a bug.')
