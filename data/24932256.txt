I&#x27;m not convinced that CoCs are valuable. Even without the explicit language, you can still kick out people who behave badly. (IMO) The CoCs are just there to try to make a political statement about which groups of people they support and to justify groupthink.<p>Anyways, to those people that believe there are a few minor slippages in what the CoC was intended for. I have been banned from a public slack group for a CoC:<p>It was from the Confluent slack group after they ran a contest&#x2F;game for their Kafka Summit conference. They did the virtual points system which could be traded for branded swag. I earned the points needed. They informed people that the swag was limited first come first serve, and they said they&#x27;d announce the store.<p>Well at least half of the people didn&#x27;t get the email notifying about the store, half did and made their orders. There was no formal communication from Confluent, other than &quot;we&#x27;re working on it.&quot; 2 days went by, people were asking on #kafka-summit, we were given bad suggestions (by Confluent) about how to auth into the store. Then I got a letter from the store that &quot;sorry you didn&#x27;t participate and you&#x27;re not eligible.&quot;<p>No notice about this from Confluent, so I ended up posting &quot;I just got this letter WTF, @conferenceorgs&quot;. That prompted them being more concerned about &quot;me swearing at their staff&quot;. Also I mentioned &quot;I figure I&#x27;m going to already get banned so I&#x27;ll say it: This makes Confluent look sh_tty&quot; ... a few minutes later CoC banned by Tim Berglund [the head of dev adv at confluent].')
