Sharing this site I hacked together over the weekend--I wanted to send my friends crypto for Christmas this year but couldn&#x27;t find a good solution, so I made my own!<p>The site is essentially a multi-currency paper wallet generator. All keys are generated locally on your computer and are never sent out (you can verify this by monitoring your network requests, or turning your wifi off once you load the website and turning it back on once you&#x27;ve closed the site).<p>All you need to do is pick a theme for the card, add the cryptocurrencies you want, and optionally add a message. From there, you can print it out or send a shareable link. The links themselves contain all the information needed the render the card--again, private keys are never collected or stored.<p>Hope you enjoy! Maybe this&#x27;ll be useful if you&#x27;re looking for that last-minute gift ;) Happy to answer any questions here or on twitter @iamtonypeng!')
