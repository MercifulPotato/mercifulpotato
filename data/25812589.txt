Item(by='spijdar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610904079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809792, text='Looking briefly at ebay, the 5500 XT goes for around 250-300 USD, while the WX2100 goes for around 50-70 USD.<p>And the 5500 XT has a TDP of 130 watts, vs 25 watts for the WX2100. The WX2100 is also smaller, and doesn&#x27;t require additional power from the PSU, running entirely off the PCIe slot power.<p>Not that I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s great for gaming. But I&#x27;m running it on a IBM POWER processor which can&#x27;t really play x86 games anyway, just open-source and java games (it can tank minecraft at 4k pretty nicely). It lacks an on-board accelerated GPU too, so going without isn&#x27;t really an option.<p>I agree almost everyone should probably just get a better gaming card, but for the price this thing runs a 4k monitor great, has good video en&#x2F;decoders, and a cool blue exterior ;)')
