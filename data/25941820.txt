This is the first time netizens capitalize on hedge fund short favorites and it has been surprisingly easy to cause an absolute catastrophy in the order of billion losses for them. I heard Melvin Capital may even have gone bankrupt?<p>I spent all night going through many of those threads, and I have to say they are ready to join Bitcoin once the SEC cracks down on them and freezes their Robinhood accounts and possibly even their bank accounts linked to Robinhood.<p>If Melvin does go down it will be its own success, but now they&#x27;re going full vigilante investor mode, and putting money in BB, AMC etc... this won&#x27;t stop unless the State intervenes and could set a precedent and as you say create a &#x27;watershed moment.&#x27;<p>It won&#x27;t be long until they realize what the long con really is: central bank based fiat currency that created these boom-bust cycles in the first place.<p>I initially mocked them when I heard about them taking GME to its recent rise, and still kind of do as WSB is a joke even by their own admission; but that doesn&#x27;t mean it cannot create positive change. After all comedians just use humour in their jokes to highlight and poke fun of some of Society&#x27;s most absurd aspects with varying levels of success in reforming it.<p>Dave Chappelle&#x27;s latest monolouge at SNL after the election highlighted this very well.')
