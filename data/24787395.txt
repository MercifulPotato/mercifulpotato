When you access this with &quot;ARG&quot; you will log the information in the docker history, visible to all. Use &quot;--secret&quot; or use the ARG in an intermediate build stage which doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s history preserved, then copy any necessary files form the intermediate image to your file image manually.<p>A perfect example of this would be passing your NPM_TOKEN to install company scope packages.')
