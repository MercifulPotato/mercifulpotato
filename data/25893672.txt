Capitalism just needs to get nudged into a direction and the solutions will be a product of markets.<p>To elaborate my point, through government subsidies: \n- American has seen massive production of food (so much that we waste an insane amount every year)\n- Massive creation with minimal resources (via petrol innovation; even if y&#x27;all don&#x27;t like it, it was an easy win for society and we&#x27;re living with the second order effects)\n- Vehicle fuel efficient rise\n- Green revolution is almost profitable without government subsidies.<p>I&#x27;m not an economist but the game theory does seem to playout in such a way, for the past century, to confirm &#x27;we&#x27;ll find a way, given a nudge in the right direction&#x27;.')
