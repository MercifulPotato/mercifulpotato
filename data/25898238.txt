If you like strong espressos, prepare to experience a different drink altogether. Try not to overdose on coffee, it will be tasty but it still has the same amount of caffeine.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t know pickles would be such a delicacy (the taste was completely unexpected and funny as far as a specific taste can make you laugh).<p>It&#x27;s a great way to get a boost in taste and sweetness in many foods (without the increase in sugar), but you&#x27;ll have to find out what your new you likes.<p>I very much recommend trying it out at least once.')
