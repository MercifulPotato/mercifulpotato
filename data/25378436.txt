That said, how we frame our problems influences how we think about solutions - how we solve a water infrastructure crisis is very different from a water scarcity crisis.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s technically no such thing as peak oil either, but there is a point where it becomes economically infeasible to produce more oil<p>Peak oil is the point when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached, after which it is expected to enter terminal decline. Peak oil is most certainly real, and likely in the near future. Oil is an energy source and it takes energy to extract it - eventually you will hit a point where it takes more than a barrel of oil to produce a barrel of oil. Further, oil is destroyed when used, and it takes more energy to recreate it than you get from using it, so there is no sense in replenishing it. Conversely, you don&#x27;t need to spend water to get water, nor does it cease to exist when you consume it. You can replenish a region&#x27;s water supplies indefinitely.<p>&gt; The problem with new cities is generally trying to move employment. Unless there is a specific reason to move employers tend to like clusters of other employers. Most planned cities without a specific employment reason either fail or become big suburbs.<p>If the companies won&#x27;t move, tax them enough to build the infrastructure to support their employees. Either you&#x27;ll have no problem getting them to relocate, or there will be no need to.<p>&gt; Making it easier to move to other countries is not exactly within the realm of possibility, given that India is not in control of how the US makes legislation and pressure would pretty much result in backlash that would probably make the situation worse, not better.<p>1) The US is not the only country to move to, or even the best option\n2) The US is a nation of immigrants which could most certainly be convinced to take immigrants from India with the proper incentive structure\n3) As an emerging powerhouse, the assumption India has no negotiating leverage and is simply at the mercy of other nations seems extremely unfounded<p>As someone descended from poor subsistence farmers who moved to the other side of the planet to avoid famine, I am extremely skeptical of the claim that millions of people will just sit back and wait to die of dehydration as the water supplies dwindle. History is a long tale of people migrating to greener pastures when they are available and making pastures greener when they are not, and I see no reason that this time around will be any different.')
