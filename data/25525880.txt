That is probably the worst downside of async, it splits the ecosystem. Reqwest probably tries to offer both choices by hiding one behind the other (although what you describe sounds excessive - running a single task with tokio&#x27;s single-threaded executor is actually quite lightweight).<p>That split between &quot;sync&quot; and &quot;async&quot; was always there, for networking libraries. E.g. on C&#x2F;C++ you find libs that run on libevent, or Boost.Asio, or other varieties, and they don&#x27;t mix, so you end up spawning a seperate thread - exactly the same thing.<p>And this is, IMHO, how we should see Tokio + async: as a more ergonomic libevent.')
