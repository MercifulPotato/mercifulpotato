Files are plaintext markdown and most of our users are using dropbox&#x2F;nextcloud setup.<p>That being said, Dendron lets you publish your notes as static sites (eg. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dendron.so" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dendron.so</a> is just published using notes) and we&#x27;ll be expanding this feature to do private hosting of notes with limited editing capabilities later in December')
