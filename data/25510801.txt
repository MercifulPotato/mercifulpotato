I think it&#x27;s just perspective mismatch; If I can emulate another person&#x27;s perspective in my head, I can anticipate their decisions (and reasoning), so I can decide if they are being reasonable.<p>However if I can&#x27;t understand their perspective, I have a very hard time in understanding and judging their reasonableness (because I&#x27;m basing my judgement solely off of my own experiences and memories that are similar to their circumstances).<p>This lack of understanding translates to seeing a lack of credibility in them. &quot;Maybe if they were more like me, they&#x27;d make more sense, be more reasonable&quot;. This type of thinking is common in most types of prejudice.<p>It&#x27;s why young people write off older people: &quot;They&#x27;re too older to remember what it&#x27;s like being my age, or to understand how things are now&quot;.<p>Why the opposite occurs: &quot;They&#x27;re still too young to understand how life works yet&quot;.<p>Why people of very different cultures tend to be prejudiced: &quot;Their kind are ignorant of how the world works&quot;, and the opposite: &quot;They&#x27;ve never been through what I&#x27;ve been through, they don&#x27;t understand me or mine&quot;.<p>All of these statements evaluate down to: &quot;If they were more like me, they would be reasonable&quot;. Which is of course true, if &quot;they&quot; were more like &quot;you&quot;, their systems of reasoning and value be more similar to yours, and vice versa.')
