He has no evidence of anything and even states so plainly. It is purely conjecture that Hunter Biden’s big mouth statements <i>might</i> be connected to impropriety, with utterly no proof.<p>Then it turns into a comically bad diatribe about bias in the press.<p>Greenwald over the past 4 years has become an insufferable troll. This article adds nothing new in any way, and given the wildly unjustified harm it could do to an impending election, it is beyond doubt that the Intercept editorial decision not to run this was the right decision.')
