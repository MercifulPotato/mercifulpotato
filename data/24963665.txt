Socialist societies even in their very crude stages in the 20th centuries led to outcomes that were average or slightly above average, while fascists openly admitted that they would cause cataclysmic war and attempt to kill hundreds of millions of people. One can delude themselves in order to justify pursuing their interests at the expense of the vast majority, that doesn&#x27;t make it true. And this is known to be true.<p>If you lie to yourself to convince yourself to support fascism, you are a fascist.<p>Finally, I think you might like to investigate what tautologies and sophism are, because so far you&#x27;ve called for both when they obviously aren&#x27;t true. Restating the situation to draw it into a before then non-accepted and crucial consequence is not redundant to the conversation.')
