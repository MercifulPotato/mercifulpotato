Is the difference between bad grades, and exceptional grades, a good reason to set a kid up with Lambo-grade back-up as far as resources and access to capital?<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty natural, if your resources are exceptional, to treat that as extending to your immediate family. Therefore it doesn&#x27;t matter what grades the kid gets because there is nothing they can possibly do that&#x27;s more important than being your kid, and so they&#x27;ll automatically be your kid and have access to the resources of your family unit.<p>I don&#x27;t see a special moral dispensation for, &#x27;this kid APPLIED himself and therefore it&#x27;s okay that he never had to worry&#x27;.')
