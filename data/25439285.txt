But if you said, &quot;We&#x27;ll cap it at $200k for 5,000 servers&quot; then it gets more interesting.<p>The exceptions are if they&#x27;re in a NewRelic or Splunk-type $$$$ deal:<p>1) they might save money by migrating or<p>2) they might use the lower cost to re-negotiate their Cadillac deals.<p>If you&#x27;ve used Cloudwatch at a medium or large-scale metrics and alerting, please post a comment how that worked out. I find their features&#x2F;graphs too minimal, but I&#x27;ve never been forced to make it work as the sole metrics&#x2F;monitoring&#x2F;alerting tool.<p>(New managers always parrot, &quot;Let&#x27;s just use Cloudwatch!&quot; their first month on the job, but then reality sinks in and any existing monitoring solution is by far the least of their problems. My favorite question to ask is, &quot;So how do we migrate these existing dashboards that everybody uses? Ever done that?&quot; followed by icy silence.)')
