Don&#x27;t really see anything wrong with somebody signing up and immediately creating a PR.<p>I realize GitHub is one of the most popular choices out there but the activity stream is already social mediaesque enough for my taste. There&#x27;s other ways to tackle this, DO could make their marketing stunt opt-in and GH could respond to the people wanting to add friction to their repo&#x27;s workflows in a way that provides value, without crippling the general user experience.')
