He once said something to me along the lines of &quot;if you want to make the perfect sculpture, don&#x27;t try to make the perfect sculpture. Instead make lots of sculptures, until you make the perfect sculpture.&quot; - which I tend to agree with.<p>His advice had more to do with enjoying the process instead of stressing about the end goal, which I quite liked.<p>In the context of software, I think that being prolific is certainly key, but it also helps to study the masters. I&#x27;ve learnt some pretty cool lessons reading the source code of popular OSS applications for example.')
