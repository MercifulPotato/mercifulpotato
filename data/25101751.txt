After years of short term gigs and constant moving I decided to give up that lifestyle.  In late 2019  I moved to a place with family, got a corporate job, and attempted to develop a feeling of community.  I was well on my way of forming new friendships and strengthening family ties when covid hit.  Now, making friends is much harder and less satisfying.  It’s harder to cultivate a feeling of community.  My family is, in my opinion, reckless when it comes to covid so I don’t see them.  All of my attempts to mitigate my depression came from improving social ties, and now it feels like that’s an impossible thing to do.  On the other side, I’m use to isolation and loads of digital-only social contact, so 2020 doesn’t feel much different than 2018.')
