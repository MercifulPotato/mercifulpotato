Makes me wonder if even YAML could be brought to heel ...<p>There was a moment in the web&#x27;s history where we were trying to figure out how to make XML, HTML, RSS, and &#x27;microformats&#x27; all play well together. Next to that were a million authors of WordPress themes who thought &#x27;semantics&#x27; was academic rubbish, and just wanted to make the web into another word processor. We got OWL, RDF triples, and no-one paid attention, and just carried on farming complexity.<p>The cries for simplification are more the result of the tooling, build chains, etc., in my mind than the core tech of HTML, CSS, JS. I&#x27;m just concerned that we redouble the complexity by inventing new abstractions to wrap the old.')
