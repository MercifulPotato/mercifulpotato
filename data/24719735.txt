If I want a quick, fast and dirty language , Rust doesn&#x27;t fit the role.<p>I really do love how C# gives me the ability to hack things together quickly, with still stopping me from doing things which simply won&#x27;t work. Flutter takes this even a step further with the dynamic keyword( C# has dynamics too , but they aren&#x27;t as robust ). I can write function calls with dynamics which is great for prototyping. Eventually bad things will happen if you use dynamics in every single call , but it helps me get started.<p>I definitely understand why many software developers see this as a dumbing down of software engineering, which I would attribute the downvotes to.')
