Especially unforeseen reactions that take several years to appear.<p>As much as you trust each of the (5?) vaccines, you yourself can not know for certainty.. there is some doubt.  You may judge that that uncertainty and risk is minimal and well worth taking the vaccine, another completely rational person may decide that it is not worth the risk.<p>The point of my post was that there is real and legitimate risk, be it ever so small.  Anyone who pretends there is zero risk to the vaccine is misrepresenting the truth and doing a disservice in the effort of persuading rational adults that vaccine delivery is being lead in an honest and forthright way.')
