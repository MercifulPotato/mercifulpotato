Most of us don&#x27;t work in product companies but rather as consultants or in IT enterprise environments. In such contexts the real objective of software development is often the improvement of a process that is enabled by the software. As such the cons of bad software are not immediatly clear to any management layer above the first. Sometimes even the first layer of management doesn&#x27;t really care until they get the process improvement they want. If the new software produces an increase of 30% in sales then the fact that it is badly written is just of secondary importance: the objective has been met. \nThe fact that bad software quality will hurt maintanance in the mid-long term is often too far in the future for anybody to really care.<p>As software engineers I have seen that we usually make two mistakes in these cases. We focus only on our craft without taking into consideration the real business objectives of the customer and what he really cares about. We introduce unnecessary complexity just for the sake of it, often adding unnecessary abstractions. In a few words we often make the sin of believing that software is the objective while in most of the cases there is a business objective for which software is just the enabler and because of that we lose focus on what is the right thing to do.<p>In software product companies code is part of the final product and code quality directly impacts costs and the core business of the company.')
