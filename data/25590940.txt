If I&#x27;m getting close to the edge of a lane, it&#x27;s intentional and often for safety; having the car try to interfere with that is counter-productive. I wouldn&#x27;t call it comparable to Tesla&#x27;s autopilot though, as it only intervened in steering when you neared the edge of the lane. I guess you could just let it pinball down the road like that, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to attempt it. Maybe other cars do it better.<p>Adaptive cruise on the other hand is great, but all modern cars have that.<p>The real issue though is that it&#x27;s harder to remain alert when the car is effectively doing everything for you... until it doesn&#x27;t.')
