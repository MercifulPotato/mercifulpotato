Warren Buffet famously said, “I try to invest in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.”<p>Institutionalized management rewards a set of skills that are not the ones that create growth, which is sort of the point. They find growth and then &quot;manage,&quot; it on behalf of other people who &quot;manage&quot; money. It&#x27;s the classic principal-agent problem, where managers as a class have enriched themselves at the expense of owners like pensioners, savers, entrepreneurs, and taxpayers.<p>IMO, the whole managerial problem is caused by a mix of high and complex tax regimes, and low interest rates. The former is a make work policy for a clerical worker class, and the latter means banks become the cultural and political centre of everything. It causes the economic shift from making things people want, to doing things nobody wants.')
