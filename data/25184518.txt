I ended up resetting Firefox back to the defaults to un-set all those options I made a list of.<p>That&#x27;s not a comment on Firefox of course; the sad state of the web currently is that in order to prove we&#x27;re not a bot we seemingly have to give up our privacy (via relentless fingerprinting) OR your time (through hugely wasteful reCaptcha, and to a lesser extent hCaptcha fills).')
