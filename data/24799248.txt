So when we started building, &quot;local-first&quot; was a strong differentiator for us and became a core philosophy for the company. For the app we have, 95% of functionality works perfectly well offine (except some features that need third party API interaction that we&#x27;ve not found a clean way to set up so far).<p>Sure, it&#x27;s so much easier to write a webapp and then add a webview on top of it and call it a &quot;mobile app&quot;, but the effort (syncing data which can be edited in multiple places in an local-first world is a crazy engineering challenge) that goes into building a local-first app really pays dividends in the longer run.')
