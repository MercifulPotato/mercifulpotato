However, this had to be done now because Facebook needs to allow time to make the transition and ask UK users if they agree to the terms again now they are separate from the EU.<p>They can&#x27;t wait to do this because as soon as either the UK or EU changes their laws (may happen in a month, may not for years), the terms would no longer be valid for one set of users. Facebook would end up in a situation where its terms are invalid for millions of users potentially for months.')
