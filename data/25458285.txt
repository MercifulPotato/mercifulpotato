They are really just spoiled kids who used to have power over their parents. Now they enter the big world and keep doing what they&#x27;ve been always doing: throwing tantrums and yelling silly demands at their parents. But other adults don&#x27;t care, so the spoiled kids get ignored and then shown the door. Now they are stunned: they don&#x27;t understand why the world doesn&#x27;t work the way they thought it should work.')
