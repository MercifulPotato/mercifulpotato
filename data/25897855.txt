African-Americans speak a very distinct English language, and while they follow &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; religion, many still retain roots to African elements in their rites (ever been to a black funeral in some parts of the South?). Their cultural food is also heavily distinct, although it is partly influenced by Anglo-Saxon food. They don&#x27;t have the same sensibilities as Anglo-Saxons because of their culture, but more because of religion, just like many Southerners. &quot;Anglo-Saxon sensibilities and cultural norms on.... &quot; is also something that&#x27;s very distinct across the US and the world - there&#x27;s a lot of difficulty in breaking down the barriers of race and sexual orientation in the US, while all other Anglo-Saxon countries broke them down way back. Latin countries such as France or Spain have broken down many strict rules many years ago, while they still continue in most of Latin America.<p>Honestly you sound like someone who has had very little interaction with the African American community, while doing a lot of grandstanding for them from your plantation home. There are just so many things you&#x27;ll  find different right in upon interaction. As a simple question, why are African American names so unique and not Anglo-Saxon names or African names?')
