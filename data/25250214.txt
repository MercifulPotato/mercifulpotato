What assumptions does it make for a metric, what is the equivalent of parallel transport, Lie brackets, how does it represent gradients (and other things that are naturally 1-forms), etc., etc.?<p>All the treatments I&#x27;ve seen jump in to manipulation without really going in to the axioms used. That paper seems to do a lot better at fitting it together, so I&#x27;ll certainly read it, thanks.')
