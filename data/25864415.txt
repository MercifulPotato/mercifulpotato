Since every dollar matters for them, being able to scale down to a minimal infrastructure between spikes is key to their survival.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t understand this point. For €40 a month with Hetzner you&#x27;ll get an i7 with 64GB RAM and 2x512 SSD that will easily handle any traffic spike (we&#x27;re talking about a website, right?). €40 is not a lot of money, even for a non profit, and especially for one experiencing a huge spike after being mentioned in the news.<p>On the contrary, I would advise against AWS here as they&#x27;re completely unpredictable. You can be charged any amount, and the costs only partly depend on you. Developers have been demanding hard caps for over a decade to no avail.')
