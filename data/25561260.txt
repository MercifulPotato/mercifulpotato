It has one source and it relies on rain and snow falling in one single particular place. Therefore SFPUC has to treat its supply as limited in a way that an aquifer system that&#x27;s effectively a closed loop doesn&#x27;t need to worry about. SF&#x27;s wastewater does not recharge its water supply in any predictable way.')
