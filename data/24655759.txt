The fact that you or I disagree with some historians about the proper balance between accuracy and relatability does not mean we should denigrate the study of history. I tend to agree with you that exposing more people to history is a higher priority than painstaking color accuracy, but I also believe that there is plenty of room for the kinds of historians that care more about accurate documentation than about public outreach.')
