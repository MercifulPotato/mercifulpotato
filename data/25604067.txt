More importantly, it is now clear that China follows US steps in ensuring a level of cultural hegemony enjoyed by US for some time. Although, they seem to apply it more deliberately. I am not convinced that is good for a world in general. That path they chose is the path Russian communists would have loved to have taken if they had the tools China now has ( and yes, we provided those tools ).<p>US, despite certain misgivings, seems to have been a net good for the world ( not completely unlike Roman empire ). I am not certain China is, but have yet to see how it all plays out. Now, there are circles in US, that absolutely love China and the power the government wields there ( something along the lines of &#x27;if only we could have US and China-like control, we would be all set&#x27; mindset ).<p>In short, I agree with you, we, as a species, should have a really hard discussion over what comes next. In a lot of ways, this is a turning point. I am not sure, we are ready to have that discussion.')
