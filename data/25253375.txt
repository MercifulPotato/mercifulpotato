I watched <i>a lot</i> of movies in the English original with English subtitles over the past years, and because of that, I am now used to be able to understand movie conversations 100%. Whenever I watch a movie in my native language (without subtitles), I sometimes have to pause and replay a scene to fully understand the dialogue. Sometimes it is virtually impossible, as the actor just mumbles a few syllables. When I ask other people watching with me what the actor just said exactly, they usually also don&#x27;t have a clue, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother them. Usually, the answer is something like &quot;he certainly meant A, because B just did C, and now he is excepting D&quot;.')
