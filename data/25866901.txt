Lin Wood calling for Pence&#x27;s execution) in a movement that reality showed was a real and not theoretical threat (c.f. the mob chanting &quot;Hang Mike Pence!&quot; in the rotunda).<p>I really, genuinely, truly don&#x27;t understand why people insist on understanding this only in the context of partisan censorship.  Parler had been around for years, uncensored.  Almost all it&#x27;s major accounts had history on Twitter for years before that (often having been kicked off for similarly violent content, btw).<p>If Big Tech really, truly wanted to censor conservative opinions for partisan benefit... why did they wait until months after the presidential election to do it?')
