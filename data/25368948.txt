It bordered upon comedy.<p>For those who doubt you, I ask them to ponder the following:<p>Put on a &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hat and walk through downtown Chicago, San Francisco, Ann Arbor, or Cambridge before or after election day 2016 (or 2020). Now, put on a &quot;I&#x27;m With Her&quot; or &quot;Biden&#x2F;Harris 2020&quot; shirt and walk through Provo, Fort Worth, or Pensacola before or after election day. In which scenario are you more like to be yelled at and&#x2F;or physically attacked?')
