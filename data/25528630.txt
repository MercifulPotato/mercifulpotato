I had a piano teacher when I was young and that person put me off piano for the next 45 years or so. A <i>good</i> teacher will help you, a not so good teacher may well cause you to lose interest.<p>Right now I&#x27;m practicing on my own, when I want, without a set schedule and without the goal of getting good enough to satisfy my - nonexistent - teacher.<p>Likely a good teacher would help. But good teachers cost money, have their own schedules to keep and their goals may not overlap with mine. So this time around I&#x27;m taking it as slow or as fast as I want, when I want, learning pieces that are probably way above my level but that keep me motivated because I like to play them.<p>If at some point I feel that I hit a plateau then I might go for a teacher for a while with the express goal of getting unstuck.<p>Finally, not everybody learns in the same way and not everybody has your budget. I love learning by doing, not by being told how to do it and there is as sense of pride in learning a skill by yourself instead of having it handed down, it also allows you to develop your own style rather than to become a carbon copy of what your teacher considers to be &#x27;proper&#x27;. There is room for all of this and yours as well but I don&#x27;t like the way you are all over this thread proclaiming the &#x27;one true way&#x27;, there are as many ways as there are people and what works for one person could easily be someone else&#x27;s nightmare. It would be nice if you at least acknowledged that you have not taken into account the goal of whoever you have in mind as your hypothetical piano student and that not everybody will fit that image.<p>We agree that there are not shortcuts and that there is no magic method, but I think everybody that is somewhat serious about any instrument would agree on that.')
