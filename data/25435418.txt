Writers (e.g. in the atlantic) like to say that our time is less like 1984 and more like brave new world in that all the noise that is allowed through free speech leads to bad results (trump, brexit, anti-social media etc.) that are not necessarily better than what the EU is trying to avert with its free speech agenda. \nI&#x27;d argue some regulation is necessary since the popularity contests that thrive within the current media environment do not lead to enlightened people (since it&#x27;s not necessarily the smartest&#x2F;most empathetic argument that wins&#x2F;gets all the attention). However, it&#x27;s a slippery road, that&#x27;s for sure (and you CAN deconstruct my arguments in that way) - but let&#x27;s be honest: allowing ALL free speech and letting the loudmouth that makes fun about the out-group win all the arguments is not a solution either.')
