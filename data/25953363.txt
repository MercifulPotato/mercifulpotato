However, if you pay attention, most the complexity of modern UI development is accidental, not fundamental.<p>Figma already has &quot;auto-layout&quot;, which is essentially flexbox. Imagine a world where your designer just builds your whole app with in Figma with flexbox-like constraints, then they hand off to your developer who just writes a couple of snippets code to wire it up to a database and makes sure the elements are configured to be SEO friendly.<p>IMO developers dramatically underestimate the power of GUI tools to usurp their role because we think in terms of such low level tools.')
