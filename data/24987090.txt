I&#x27;ve barely printed more than 12 pages but it doesn&#x27;t care about the long idling (currently working on disconnecting power when not in use). It prints full-duplex pages with no hardware margin in A4. The color is on par with all the color printers I&#x27;ve used in my life.<p>The replacement toner is 20€. Why would I ever touch anything else?')
