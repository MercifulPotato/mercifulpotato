Here&#x27;s an interesting quote about what you&#x27;re talking about:<p><i>An appraisal of the building, done last year by Cushman &amp; Wakefield for the Hudson’s Bay Company, valued the nearly 100-year-old building at $0 if it were to be leased back to the company.<p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield found with a little more than $91 million in upgrades, the building’s value would increase to $8 million if leased to a single tenant.<p>With a little more than $111 million in improvements that value would jump to just shy of $10.8 million if leased to multiple tenants.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;7493539&#x2F;downtown-winnipeg-hudsons-bay-closed-for-good&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;7493539&#x2F;downtown-winnipeg-hudsons...</a>')
