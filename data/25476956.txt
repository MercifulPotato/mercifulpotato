Item(by='Mediterraneo10', descendants=None, kids=[25477000, 25477406], score=None, time=1608380103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476784, text='&gt; WHat happened to the guardian?<p>In the aftermath of the Assange and Snowden stories, it was found that 1) hard-hitting investigative journalism can alienate government officials on which newspapers depend for more ordinary scoops, and potentially bring hassles from law enforcement, and 2) the big money to be made today in the advertising-based market is &quot;snackable content&quot; and stoking the culture wars. Consequently, <i>The Guardian</i> has become less and less distinguishable from other online newspapers.<p>What always irks me is when someone on a forum comments that an article at <i>The Guardian</i> is intentionally furthering some crafty and intricate left-wing, working-class, Marxist, etc. mission. While <i>The Guardian</i> was founded as a socially-engaged newspaper for the working classes, the last decade-plus has seen an exodus of anyone attached to that 150-year-old tradition. Sincere political beliefs and idealism just donâ€™t keep a newspaper going in our modern internet era.')
