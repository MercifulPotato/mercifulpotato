They don&#x27;t manifest by some abstract science.<p>&gt;<i>Those models are science separate from how science is practiced as a human social endeavor.</i><p>It&#x27;s the opposite.<p>Those models were built not &quot;separate from how science is practiced as a human social endeavor&quot; but exactly by people practicing science as a human social endeavor. And they were shaped by exactly the things you say they were not: who built them, what credentials they had, their beliefs and imperfections (e.g. lack of statistics knowledge), etc.<p>For example, if the scientists (actual persons) creating a model is greedy, they can create a model that advances their financials (rather than science) by optimizing for grants or publicity or &quot;fancy results&quot; or sponsors, against accuracy.<p>One might still agree, sure, but the model can still be verified independently of those bias and personal faults etc.<p>But that would be wrong too. Because there&#x27;s no abstract verification. Verification also happens by actual people, as an actual process, and prone to the same issues: slopiness, greed, shallow peers merely linking to a paper they don&#x27;t understand well, ideological biases, simply not caring, and so on.<p>They&#x27;re not the abstract idea of science.<p>&gt;<i>If the experts are basing their expertise on models with a good predictive track record</i><p>Even that is not some fool-proof criterium.<p>Because you can always either make the model vague enough or shape, manipulate, skew, explain away the subsequent measurements enough to get a &quot;good predictive track record&quot;. It&#x27;s much easier in science than it is in sports bets where a team either wins or doesn&#x27;t.<p>See, the verification of those predictions also happens by humans (with all the above issues).')
