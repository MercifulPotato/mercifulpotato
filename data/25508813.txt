Item(by='aerostable_slug', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608658332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507725, text='Interesting topic for a research project: create a bill outlining&#x2F;condensing application which takes the final text as input and enables legislators to quickly get the gist of the high points and skip over narrative text, formatting, even penalties (perhaps color code those or something) â€” there would be lots of opportunities for the creative presentation of the material to suit various legislator&#x27;s needs &amp;&#x2F;or preferences.<p>I could even see clever presentations like a pie chart illustrating how much of a bill is actually related to the topic at hand. That would make a fantastic tool for an opposition member to use in order to illustrate the absurdities of these omnibus bills.')
