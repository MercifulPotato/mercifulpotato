Or should I say “tried to read” because their texts are unreadable to put it mildly. They kill mathematics by removing the beauty of it and instead provide dry and boring texts that could be read by robots. Please don’t try to understand mathematics by reading Bourbaki texts. This is not what mathematics is about.')
