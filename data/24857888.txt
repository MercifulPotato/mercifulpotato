The deeper issue is the lack of application knowledge. Being able to code in COBOL is the first step. The really hard part is understanding what an application does.</i><p>We techies - programmers as well as business folks in tech - love to think that a programmer&#x27;s most valuable skills are their knowledge of programming languages. It isn&#x27;t, and never was. You can learn a programming language from a book, and practice it virtually anywhere. Domain knowledge, such as understanding the rules of a bureaucracy or a regulatory regime, can usually only be acquired through <i>years</i> of on-the-job training.<p>If there&#x27;s a COBOL angle to this, it&#x27;s what they highlight in the next paragraph: Tight coupling within COBOL monoliths, which is probably more a result of their age than their implementation language, has made it impossible for someone with less-than-extensive knowledge of the system they&#x27;re working in to be able to work efficiently and effectively. I&#x27;m not sure what the solution to that problem is, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to be a programming language.')
