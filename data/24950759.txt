The most annoying discussions in my experience go something like this:<p>&quot;Why aren&#x27;t you coming to the company party?&quot;<p>&quot;Because that would likely exacerbate my chronic headache and I might be unable to work for several days.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh wow, is it that bad? Have you tried acupuncture? My cousin had a headache and that really helped...&quot; And a few minutes later: &quot;Come on, the party will be fun, how bad could it be?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve learned to manage my condition well enough that people generally don&#x27;t notice any problems. I&#x27;ve probably tried any remedies you can come up with, and so far the best way to cope is to live a boring life and go to bed at the same time every night after a peaceful evening. But because I&#x27;m not writhing in pain during the conversation, some people seem to think that I&#x27;m just coming up with excuses to not come to their party or whatever they are asking me to do.')
