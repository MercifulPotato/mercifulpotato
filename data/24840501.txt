If the syntax doesn&#x27;t communicate intent, it suggests a usability limitation.<p>frankmcsherry said:<p>&gt; Naming things is hard.<p>Agreed.  Hence point about readability being a personal thing.  In this case though, look again at the comment and the line of code.  I&#x27;d suggest that very few people, on reading the code without the comment, would guess that it was creating a new dataflow computation.<p>&gt; In this case, the command does not create a new dataflow, it creates a new timely dataflow computation<p>Good point, thanks for the correction.')
