Pay is below market average, and their job involves dealing with legacy Java and COBOL codebases. The Java part is OK, but they find COBOL very painful to work with. They are also required to do unpaid overtime due to hard deadlines.<p>On the other hand, a few of us went on to work for startups all over the country, and if you compare our careers ever since, they are like night and day. We can switch jobs easily due to having marketable skills (COBOL is a dead end outside a few companies) and we are making twice as much without working overtime.')
