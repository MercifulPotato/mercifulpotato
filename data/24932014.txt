But maybe that&#x27;s precisely why the phenomenon remains unexplained because we have to think a bit outside the box.<p>Fluid dynamics is complicated (Navier-Stokes still has a 1 million prize attached to it), surface wave propagation is complicated but when you include the effects of the seabed it&#x27;s even more complicated. A lot of non-linear behavior pops out which always brings very nasty math.<p>I&#x27;m more on the side that this is not the explanation but I wouldn&#x27;t bet too much on it.')
