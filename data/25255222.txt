And these &#x27;non-human&#x27; moves could be the first&#x2F;second&#x2F;third best moves according to the engine. You&#x27;d have to have to have decent understanding of the game to realize what moves aren&#x27;t going to blow your cover. I am confident over the long run anti-cheating software could pick this up in most cases. But also what are the incentives for someone to cheat at online chess over the long run? It wouldn&#x27;t be that interesting for more than a couple days to get a quick thrill of beating a bunch of people in my opinion.')
