Nothing stops one from using Kafka topic in a fashion similar to a queue but even then, the way this would have been done differs significantly.<p>Very simplified: in a queue, an available message is picked up by a consumer and must be acked &#x2F; nacked within a certain period of time. If message is acked, it is considered processed and may be chosen to be removed, depending on the queue semantics. If nacked, it becomes available for reprocessing. Multiple consumers may be processing messages at completely different offsets and a failure of processing at an early offset does not prevent other consumers advancing the queue.<p>In a commit log, if the consumer is not able to process the message, it has to keep retrying that one message until it can be processed OR ignore failure and publish the message back to the log at a new offset for future reprocessing. Regardless of that, any other consumer (or group) has its own view of the world so two consumers (or consumer groups) will process all messages from the topic.<p>The semantics are completely different.')
