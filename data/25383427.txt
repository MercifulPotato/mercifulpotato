It&#x27;s been distracting me and I want my real life back. I&#x27;ll just try to wrap up the bits I find interesting.<p>&gt; But if you mean, would I spot Blair if I didn&#x27;t know them?<p>That&#x27;s more or less what I mean, but also, would you, on top of that, expect me to spot the same thing?<p>&gt; Do you think this means I&#x27;m reading their gender expression?<p>I don&#x27;t think that logically follows, and I certainly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to convince you of that.<p>I think I have a chance of convincing you that the argument you gave in the paragraph starting with &quot;What people who harp on pronouns miss is&quot; in the comment at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25379317" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25379317</a> is a bad argument for the claim that pronouns (should?) refer to biological sex rather than gender. So I&#x27;m shooting for that. (But not for convincing you that the conclusion is wrong.)<p>I think the Blaire White across a room scenario suggests that pronouns are more useful in a referential sense if they&#x27;re used in a way that aligns with gender presentation (assuming a person&#x27;s gender presentation falls neatly into male or female) than if they&#x27;re used in a way that aligns with biological sex, in the case where those things differ. So if you&#x27;re really just optimizing for referential usefulness when you&#x27;re using &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;, I don&#x27;t think &quot;biological sex&quot; is where you&#x27;re going to land. I think you&#x27;re going to land closer to &quot;gender&quot;, and even closer to &quot;gender presentation&quot;. These things align for most people, so usually it doesn&#x27;t matter, but in the cases where it matters I expect &quot;biological sex&quot; to be less referentially useful pretty often.<p>I also don&#x27;t think the Blaire White scenario is unusual. I know a handful of trans people in person, and the same applies to them, i.e. if you were to point someone who looks like one of them out of a room and use a pronoun to help me know which person you&#x27;re talking about, the pronoun that matches their gender identity would do a better job than the pronoun that matches their biological sex.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me, i.e. I don&#x27;t think most people are much more prone to &#x27;seeing&#x27; someone&#x27;s true biological sex in this kind of scenario than I am.<p>&gt; Doesn&#x27;t that implicitly assume that there are only two gender expressions then?<p>Sort of. I think &quot;that thing that you see and also expect me to see that makes you choose which of &#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she&#x27; you would use if you want to be referentially useful when pointing out a person across the room&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite capture what &quot;gender presentation&quot; is either. (Hence the hedge with &quot;if anything&quot; in my earlier comment.) I just think that thing lines up with &quot;gender presentation&quot; a lot better than it lines up with &quot;biological sex&quot; in the cases where those differ.<p>&gt; It brings up the question of how one would be expected to recognize &#x27;Moon Gender&#x27; at all.<p>Taking it seriously, in real life, for people with Moon Gender (or whatever outside-the-binary gender identity you want to substitute)? I don&#x27;t think one <i>is</i> expected to just recognize it based on presentation. Hence, the practice of being explicit about preferred pronouns in circles that care about about this.')
