Security researches sell their exploits on the dark web until bug bounties rise to the same or higher prices as the dark web will pay.<p>It&#x27;s crazy that they can find a bug that would cost Instagram 1M+, yet payouts are in the thousands or maybe tens of thousands if you&#x27;re super lucky.<p>I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s illegal to sell exploits.  Using them is obviously illegal, but is the transfer of knowledge for money illegal?  I.e. I&#x27;m not allowed to build an M16, but presumably I could by the schematics for one if I wanted (I&#x27;ve never tried, but I can&#x27;t imagine possession of them is illegal since they make posters of it and what not).')
