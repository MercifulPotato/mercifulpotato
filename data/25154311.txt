Item(by='naravara', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605819726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25154056, text='&gt; Thatâ€™s a feature, not a problem.<p>It can be both. In the dying days of several community forums I was on, I noticed the conversation got more and more centered around links people were finding on Reddit or Digg. That was my first inkling that the days of bulletin board style forums were numbered. These sites are like genetic algorithms for surfacing content people want to discuss. So even when they want to discuss it with closer people than the firehose of Reddit, they&#x27;re bringing up the same links and content.<p>It&#x27;s only a matter of time, though, before people prefer to just go to the source. And that kills the forum traffic.')
