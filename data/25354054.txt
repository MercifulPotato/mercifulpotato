This is a downvote worthy perspective because it reflects the truth of the situation while countering the narrative from the media.<p>Grand gestures by politicians seeking re-election and an opportunity to assert their authority is <i>shoving</i> people into poverty and the largest mental health crisis we&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>In March, lockdowns and temporary restrictions were appropriate because we had no idea of what we were dealing with.
