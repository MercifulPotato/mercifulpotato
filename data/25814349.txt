There&#x27;s the big freeze, the big rip, the big crunch... all manner of ideas. Then there is the universe itself. Well what is that? What about multiverses etc?<p>Just to take one such theory emerging from heat death ideas. Once the fundamental touchstones of mass and structure disappear, scale also disappears. The infinitely large universe becomes physically identical to an infinitesimal one, and is reborn in a new Big Bang â€” with all the mass and energy of the previous universe once again jammed together into a tiny space.<p>These sort of cyclic cosmology ideas are held by prominent physicists including the recent Nobel prize winner, Roger Penrose.<p>Like all us, I have no idea what is true but its hardly a closed subject.')
