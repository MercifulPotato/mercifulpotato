That was sufficiently counterintuitive that some mathematicians rejected it at first, until they warmed to the idea.<p>Your circular dependencies are metacircular rather than circular.  That corresponds to circular if you can prove that truths in the system and its metasystem are equivalent, but that&#x27;s often not so easy to show <i>rigourously</i>.  (In other words, so you can be really really sure you haven&#x27;t missed a subtle loophole).  It&#x27;s tempting to assume they are equivalent by intuition, but that assumption isn&#x27;t correct for all logic systems.<p>Like many good theorems, the core idea is simple once explained.<p>GÃµdel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem required the axioms and logical deduction rules of the arithmetical logic used at the time to be encoded using that very same arithmetic, and to prove that&#x27;s possible, that it works, and it&#x27;s consistent.  That takes some rigour.  Until it was done, it wasn&#x27;t obvious you could definitely prove that it works, because system-metasystem relationships often have some subtle twist.<p>My favourite example of a subtle twist like that is Skolem&#x27;s Paradox.  Which relates back to diagonalization, and shows that maybe countability and uncountability aren&#x27;t so simple after all.')
