In the end, we want to build the best UX possible (we realized it&#x27;s one of the value prop of our product), and we felt that going native would be better mid &amp; long term because at some point, you hit a threshold with those react native&#x2F;hybrid and it makes more time to polish things out.<p>Also right when we started (in Feb), we had to implement Apple Sign-in, and the UX around it for React native or Hybrid framework was absolutely terrible.<p>In the end, I still think it was a good choice: while we compromise and make people wait a bit more for Android, it gave our (small) team a lot more focus. We learn and make mistakes on one platform, iterate faster on it, and once we feel comfortable with what we&#x27;ve done on iOS, we&#x27;ll roll it out to Android (which we plan to do in Jan&#x2F;Feb next year).')
