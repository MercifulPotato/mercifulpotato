Non-logged-in pages can be cached aggressively server side. When you are logged in much more has to be done dynamically.<p>The fact that non-logged-in pages are still loading fast is testament to the fact that the HN devs have done their job properly with implementing caching.<p>In the bad old days it would be slow for everyone whether logged in or not. In general I mean. I have only been on HN since 2009 and have been logged in (other accounts in the past, changed name) pretty much always so I don&#x27;t know when HN got good at caching. I would kind of sort of expect that HN was actually like that from the beginning, given that pg came from having used Lisp in production at Viaweb and they got a lot of experience there early at how to do things fast (in terms of time to implement) and presumably proper (since they were able to compete with others).')
