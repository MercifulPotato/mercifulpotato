Complaints to upper management appear to go on deaf ears, or with ridiculous responses (like: well we saw one of you on your cellphone so you&#x27;re not really busy).&quot;<p>&quot;And when we&#x27;ve asked for direct support for retaining customers (using their sales language), our team was told &quot;just make less mistakes&quot;.&quot;<p>Wow, that&#x27;s literally Dilbert-level of bad management. My condolences. Where I work (a large international corp.), the two or three levels of management above me are fairly reasonable and in touch with everyday reality. I guess I&#x27;m lucky.')
