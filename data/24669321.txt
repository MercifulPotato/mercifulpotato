The time complexity is only O(1) if we ignore the cost of the hash function, which is really O(log N) because it needs to process at least log N bits. However, by that reasoning even an array lookup is O(log N) because an array lookup requires adding an offset to a base address and the addition function may require O(log N) operations to calculate.<p>According to some brief googling it appears that some (most?) sources avoid this problem by simply defining &quot;elementary operations&quot; to be O(1). A constant number of elementary options would also be O(1) by that definition. That is probably what is meant by those who say that a hash lookup is O(1).')
