And that usually there are only &quot;blockers&quot; that stops you from being great?<p>Let me give an analogy. If you&#x27;re paid to play basketball wouldn&#x27;t you know what makes a great basketball player? If you&#x27;re playing pro basketball, you can be a great basketball player. The only reason why you can;t be great is because there are certain things outside of playing basketball that you have to worry about.<p>I guess i&#x27;m asking cause it&#x27;s kinda annoying when people tell me what makes a great engineer. Anyone I know who has been doing this a few years knows what makes a great engineer. It doesn&#x27;t mean they want to be a great engineer because the trade-offs arent just worth it')
