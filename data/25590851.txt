Have you ever lived in a developing country? If you have, you&#x27;d know how little people can subsist on and continue to work.<p>In fact, without welfare, and programs like SSDI - which when it started in the 1950s, accepted only 200,000 people as a result of strict eligibility requirements, and has since grown into a massive social welfare program with over 10 million beneficiaries - far more people would be applying for the jobs offered by Walmart.')
