It&#x27;s hard to believe that even decades of practice would get this reliable, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a stage magician rely on it in a routine.<p>For comparison, the other method (where the coin rotates about its vertical axis) is something you can learn to do tolerably well in a few minutes, and to do very well after a month or two at most.  The motion of the coin will look perfect, and you can even get the &quot;ding!&quot; noise of a real flip.  The only giveaway is the hand position; a real flip is done with the thumb under the coin, and this trick (for me, anyway) requires the thumb to be on top.<p>Source: taught myself to do this many years ago.  I&#x27;m not a magician and have never used it to win money, I just use this to settle arguments between my kids.')
