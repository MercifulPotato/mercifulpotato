Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608425696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482665, text='&gt; The leftist desire to redistribute wealth (which I think is strongly misplaced and immoral) will become irrelevant once we achieve a certain level of abundance that is unlike anything we are accustomed to today.<p>What even is wealth if such abundance exists? I think you may misunderstand the left’s goal of redistribution. It isn’t about divvying scarcity equally, it’s about sharing and enabling the bounty you seem to be describing.<p>&gt; It will be like wanting to redistribute oxygen or dirt -- two resources so abundant they are essentially free.<p>But not all oxygen or dirt is equal. Some people experience a greater abundance of safe, clean air and rich, profitable soil. They tend to be the same people who experience a greater abundance generally.')
