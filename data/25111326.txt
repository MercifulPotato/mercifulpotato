It is more of an international clan, strong conections with the outside of EU. They have Russian, Israeli and American connections. They use Romanian sites because the villages are hidden deep inside the forests of the Carpathian mountains. I&#x27;m surprised that they could find them. A huge success of British, Italian and Romanian authorities. The question here is who sponsored the hit? I want to say that the Clamparu clan is not your average &quot;hit and run&quot; heist makers, they specialize in extremely well thought out heists. Very, very expensive. They are also known for being extremely clean, I can&#x27;t recall somebody ever getting injured or killed in one of their hits. As described by The Guardian, they used 13m ropes to climb down and they successfully dodged the alarm sensors. Gives me some Uncharted vibes, lol.')
