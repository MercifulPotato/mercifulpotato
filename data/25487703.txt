To think you can shape people&#x27;s watching behavior towards second-rate content is to be confused about how people actually spend their scarce time. Sure, people can use help finding things they like, but how were these large yet new creators discovered in the first place? Clearly there are mechanisms for rising to the top in each category... but perhaps there is just too much stickiness at the top?<p>Realistically, the largest creators are the most valuable to the places where content is consumed, so it&#x27;s in the platforms&#x27; interest to keep them big and keep them being watched. These means less burden on content review. If 90% of view time goes to 1% of producers, content review a challenge. If 90% of views go to 10% of producers, now content review is a disaster. This &quot;brand-safe&quot; content is taken extremely seriously right now and it&#x27;s not the time platforms will do anything except double down on this.<p>edited: for typos')
