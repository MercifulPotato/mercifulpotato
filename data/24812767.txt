I think I made it clear that I admire his optimism, and think it worthy of admiration :-)<p>&gt; some of Zamenhof’s views can be shocking today.<p>That&#x27;s fine, having admiration for his work and those views of his that I feel have merit don&#x27;t mean I need to accept absolutely everything the man believed.<p>&gt; Those super-idealistic Esperantists who praised Zamenhof and banged on about world peace, were seen as weirdos and a target of mockery.<p>That may well be true, but this feels like an ad-hominem argument: &quot;the cool kids are so over Esperanto and world peace. You want to be cool, don&#x27;t you?&quot;<p>You have critiques of Esperanto and maybe even the idealism that I find endearing. That&#x27;s fine. Those critiques are valid. I still maintain Zamenhof added more to the world than the critics.')
