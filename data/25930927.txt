I want to be able to take any disk and mount it on any computer, possible using a USB adaptor.<p>There is no need for instant synchronization. When I upload pictures to the photo album, I wait a couple of days before deleting them from the camera.<p>I set up a screensaver on a desktop to display random pictures from the NAS backup.\nWe like to see the pictures that way but it also have the advantage that we notice when the NAS is not working and I do check that I see a recent picture once in a while.<p>I now make certain that I use photo album software that organize pictures using directories and filenames. I once had a crash and recovered the actual photos but not the database with tags, names etc. So I had to name all pictures again.')
