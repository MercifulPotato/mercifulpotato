Using a park road. I guess the shortest route between 2 points is up and over the mountain.<p>2nd time we were in Sicily and at some point we ended up driving through a golf course, and a herd of goats. It was super strange.<p>There was also a 3rd incidence in Malta. The route was down a walking path. The road got narrower and eventual just wide enough for 2 humans.')
