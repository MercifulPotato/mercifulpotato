Obviously CARB is a corrupt money grab shithshow but the idea that you don&#x27;t really care what people do so long as the cars aren&#x27;t belching pollution is well thought out.<p>I get that not seeing shitboxes with rusty fenders makes everyone feel warm and fuzzy inside but mechanical failure simply isn&#x27;t a common source of accidents compared to everything else and inspection programs can only do so much to address it.')
