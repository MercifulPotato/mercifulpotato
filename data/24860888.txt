Item(by='SamBam', descendants=None, kids=[24863599], score=None, time=1603388910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859682, text='I&#x27;m trying it out, and it does look nicer.<p>A few unasked for comments&#x2F;questions:<p>1. I&#x27;m worried about committing to a closed system. I see you have an export, but at first glance it seems to make an unreadable .mochi file. A csv would be nice. Could I ever export back to Anki or something if I stopped using this?<p>2. Will you support other card types besides front&#x2F;back?<p>3. I miss Anki&#x27;s database view. Your deck view supports a &quot;list&quot; as well as &quot;grid,&quot; but the list items are very tall, and I can&#x27;t see any other columns.<p>4. Your &quot;forgotten&quot; multiplier works very differently from Anki&#x27;s, I believe -- I <i>think</i> they just reset you to zero, right? This seems potentially very cool and potentially a big difference between the two apps. (In an attempt to split the difference between the two systems, I&#x27;m trying out 0.3 instead of 0.5.) Do you have any research showing this works?')
