I&#x27;ve had Nvidia, AMD, Intel and Matrox graphic cards, sometimes on Intel other on AMD, so I&#x27;ve known tearing ... But that have been fixed for me with the introduction of double buffering and GL compositor. Waaaayyy before Wayland even existed. So that argument does not really fly with. Granted, internally those combo are ugly and clunky. And Wayland might have a cleaner design.<p><i>But</i> in the vast majority of cases, X11 implementations have worked for the end user. It certainly did for me. Wayland does not. I&#x27;ve never managed to have it working smoothly for me !<p>As a user (like in a user story you could say), I don&#x27;t care that the Wayland protocol does not cover X11 protocol, I want my screengrabber and my video to just work. And if it is &quot;cross-platform&#x2F;desktop&quot; the better. As a user I do not want a different set of bugs because I use a Gtk screengrabber and a Qt video editor and the Wayland team decided it was not in their scope to handle it. IMHO, sadly, it ends up in nobody&#x27;s scope and&#x2F;or in code duplication.')
