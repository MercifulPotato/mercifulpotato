We were going to a state park for a hike. It was a 2 hr ride for which I was wearing my sunglasses but forgot. As we came out of the car to start the hike, I spent 5 minutes searching for my sunglasses in my backpack until my friend asked what I was searching for .... Maybe I should be saying &quot;sunglasses on&quot; from now on')
