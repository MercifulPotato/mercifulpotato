Though ideally MS funds a Manhattan project for rewriting the most popular apps using their SxD and CxC tooling.<p>Singularity was on the right track, but they let it languish and die for some reason, when instead they could be rebuilding an entire secure&#x2F;correct ecosystem with Singularity as the focal point, and commercializing it with enterprise support, and selling it to governments and large enterprises with significant security concerns.<p>I wonder why this hasn&#x27;t happened yet.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secure_by_design" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Secure_by_design</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us-cert.cisa.gov&#x2F;bsi&#x2F;articles&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;sdlc-process&#x2F;correctness-by-construction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us-cert.cisa.gov&#x2F;bsi&#x2F;articles&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;sdlc-process...</a>')
