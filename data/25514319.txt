Which would really mean every current and potential institution in the US would be at risk from asymmetrical shadowy maneuvering.<p>i.e. if there truly were folks pulling Epstein’s strings through the CIA&#x2F;Mossad&#x2F;etc., then they will do anything to preserve and expand their capabilities including tolerating a boundless amount of corruption within academia. Since it’s very likely they’ve already been intimidating federal judges, offing journalists, undermining NIST, undermining the NSF, etc., disrupting newMIT would be peanuts compared to that.<p>If all that turns out to be the case, the US won’t be able to support such a genuine organization without very powerful backers to shield it behind-the-scenes. Maybe if all the influential tech folks combined and really were motivated to resist those sorts of influences.<p>For complete protection from a motivated Epstein+ level of intrigue from Washington, I can only think of Russia and China, which aren’t very promising either. They can hardly be expected to be more open to intellectual freedom this century, in practice, unless there were some geopolitical goals they could achieve through it.<p>That leaves only a decentralized and anonymous option if you want to be able to completely ignore political maneuvering.\nPerhaps some sort of blockchain+ combined with some sort of trust network scoring to make anonymity workable.<p>A neutral middle power option with a minimal amount of careful maneuvering is also possible. Though of course Canada&#x2F;Australia&#x2F;Japan&#x2F;Norway&#x2F;Switzerland&#x2F;etc. are not immune to these things, they certainly increase the bar, at least from forces outside their borders, such that with only a bit of precaution and vigilance situations like this can be avoided without calling in favors from power brokers. As middle sized countries they don’t have nearly as motivation to play these shadow games themselves.<p>In all likelihood a newMIT based in the US would need some seriously powerful backers to run proactive interference if the wrong crowd really wants to undermine it. Which suggests why current MIT may have fallen into the quagmire they’re in. In this light the decision makers at MIT, of those at any of the big research schools, are tragic actors; they have no hope without playing the same game, or reforming the whole of society.')
