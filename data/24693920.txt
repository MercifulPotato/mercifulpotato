No amount of education or indoctrination overrides that. (Fun fact, in some countries, escaping from jail is not illegal&#x2F;punishable - assuming you don&#x27;t commit other crimes in the act. Because, once again, we as society recognise that it&#x27;s human nature to seek freedom and it cannot be overriden, therefore punishing it achieves nothing.<p>Ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter if you think a parent driving to work tired is acceptable or not, because we already know that they absolutely will. The only question is how do you mitigate the damage of driving to work tired, and whether your mitigation strategy is a net benefit or net loss to society.<p>&#x27;Make it compulsory for cars to detect sleeping&#x2F;unconscious&#x2F;seizing&#x2F;microsleeping driver and pull over&#x27; is an infinitely better strategy in every regard imaginable compared to &#x27;ban up to 50% of the population from driving&#x27;. And note that only one of those 4 situations would be avoidable with a ban, the other 3 can strike at any time with no warning or history.')
