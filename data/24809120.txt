If you&#x27;ve called a solar company to get an estimate recently, they have full 3-D LIDAR maps of your house from orbit.  They can map out the trees down to the branch level and then model how much sunlight will hit a given spot on your roof if you trim them.  I was on the phone with a sales rep from LG yesterday and it was a bit surreal: I knew she was looking at a satellite image of my house, so I was like &quot;We&#x27;re planning to cut that whole branch off the middle tree that&#x27;s shading the south roof of our house, and we&#x27;re going to thin the branches of the corner tree&quot; and she could follow along.<p>Much of this is also available to private citizens on Google Maps too - my home is not visible from the street, so when we were buying it, we used the satellite imagery to determine how big a back yard it had, how much parking was available, roughly how big the decks were, and we could even see the previous owner&#x27;s patio furniture.')
