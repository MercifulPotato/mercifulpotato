Undoing a single-line change, for instance. I dislike large pull requests, let alone commits that introduce a half dozen different changes.<p>Sure, if you’re really disciplined you can produce small commits without staging, by committing as you go along, but you’re breaking flow every time you commit in this style.<p>I say all this because I would love a CLI that has half-way sane handling of (e.g.) restoring staged, deleted files; doesn’t conflate restoring files with switching branches; has consistency of flags between commands (such as commit vs stash message); etc., etc. I should try gitless ;)')
