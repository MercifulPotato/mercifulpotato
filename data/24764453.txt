To give China preference in trade is to accept all that China is doing and will do. What would it take to say, no. From Hong Kong to treatment Uighurs and their threat towards Taiwan. The world as a whole needs to step back from trade with China as a whole.<p>As for NATO , the EU has long has the technical means to do away with the need but they don&#x27;t want to pay for it. How much do you value your security? Getting rid of NATO would be the first step in probably forcing the American government rethink its military spending; sadly the percentage of the US budget going there decreases by small percentages overall letting politicians on both sides claim they have reduced spending. Even halving the US defense budget won&#x27;t solve the US deficit issues.')
