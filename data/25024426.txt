That seems pretty rude.<p>Did not mean it that way, my apologies. It was meant to be an hyperbole<p>&gt;They are prosecuted.<p>You were suggesting not conducting an audit so they could not be prosecuted if we don&#x27;t know who they are<p>&gt;Not every registered voter votes, but by and large people register to vote because they intend to vote, so it&#x27;s infeasible for a systematic effort to submit fraudulent ballots to avoid colliding with the real votes of the people being impersonated.<p>From what I have seen, only ~65% of registered voters usually vote. I am not convinced that impersonating part of that 35% is infeasible. There are also other ways to manipulate votes than to submit a ballot and hope the person does not vote, e.g. you could collude with UPS to lose ballots, buy votes, replace valid ballots&#x2F;votes, etc.<p>EDIT: Take Wisconsin as an example. There is a 20k difference between the two candidates. 20k is ~0.6% of the 3.2m voters that voted (whereas the parent post stated 10k which is a very small signal)')
