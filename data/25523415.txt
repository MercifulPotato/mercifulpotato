If Amazon starts sacking workers trying to unionize they&#x27;ll just burn down more buildings, cause millions more dollars in damage to major US cities, riot for a few more months, block traffic for months, fight with any law enforcement that tries to stop them, and essentially bully&#x2F;coerce&#x2F;intimidate the population and local governments into enacting laws and ordinances to give them what they want. (They then call themselves the good guys and use the media their political ideology has near complete control over to paint their actions in a good light).')
