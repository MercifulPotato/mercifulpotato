I&#x27;ve seen this before in a couple of git-related and other applications but personally never understood why one would pick this over date&#x2F;hour. Is this a cultural thing? Do some people actually find this better (from the point of conveying timestamp information)? My main problem with it, apart from not having a high resolution, is that it usually just leads to me trying to calculate the actual date from it because that just works for me, being used to it. Same with e.g. Thunar: to me it&#x27;s maddening that it defaults to displaying &#x27;today&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;saturday&#x27; <i>and</i> then mixes that with plain dates for timestamps older than a week (or so). Can be me, but this is just so confusing and harder to parse?')
