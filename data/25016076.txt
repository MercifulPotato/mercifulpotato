Item(by='patja', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604767110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014859, text='The legacy definition of spam is any unwanted email, or &quot;unsolicited commercial email&quot;<p>But in the context of social media, what does spam mean?  It isn&#x27;t email.  And an awful lot of it is simply self-promotion or commercial promotion.<p>And many FB groups and the like are permissive when it comes to posts that are really advertisements, or are just one person&#x27;s definition of &quot;off topic.&quot;  And there are mechanisms for reporting content as &quot;spam&quot;, but what does that even mean when it isn&#x27;t an email?<p>I&#x27;ve found that many people have redefined the term &quot;spam&quot; as repetitive content, not unwanted&#x2F;unsolicited content.  I guess this comes from gamer&#x2F;chat culture where there is talk of &quot;spamming the jump button&quot; or &quot;spamming the chat&quot; where it isn&#x27;t the content that is remarkable, it is the repetition.  You can kind of see where it comes from as most email spammers are quite repetitive and indiscriminate.  But a spam email can be just one, and that definition doesn&#x27;t seem to fly in the inherently noisy social media context.<p>I was just struck by this evolution of the term spam when I tried reporting some (unwanted by me) commercial self-promotion on social media, only to be told that it wasn&#x27;t spam at all because the poster only posted it once.  I guess a lot of it comes down to how territorial and defensive people are about their email inbox vs. social media feed.')
