Even language-learning resources like dictionaries tend to assume that the user is able to read and write.<p>On the other hand, if you just want to visit as a tourist, you could do that without any knowledge of the language, just relying on English signage in touristy areas and Google Translate for simple conversations. It might detract a bit from the experience if you visit an old temple and can&#x27;t read the inscriptions, but then again most Chinese people can&#x27;t read the Manchu inscriptions on Qing dynasty buildings and still enjoy visiting them.<p>But if you want to stay longer or want to travel off the beaten path, not being able to read and write can be a real hassle. Fortunately, 4000 different characters isn&#x27;t actually that much. You probably know tens of thousands of English words you learned over the course of a few decades. If you learn five to ten new characters per day, you can reach 4000 in a year or two. The hardest part of language learning is actually doing that little bit of daily practice.<p>When I started learning Chinese, I used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.ankiweb.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.ankiweb.net&#x2F;</a> with the Chinese support addon and added five flashcards every day (not always new characters, most words have characters in common) then worked through the scheduled number of reviews, using a notebook for writing practice. After two years, I moved to China as an exchange student and was able to get around fine, even though I still had a lot to learn. Sometime later my notebook was completely filled with writing practice, at which point I decided it wasn&#x27;t really necessary anymore.<p>If that much grinding turns you off, try applying it to something you enjoy. E.g. pick a pop song you like but don&#x27;t yet understand, get the lyrics and work through them word by word. Or watch a drama with target-language subtitles and keep your ears and eyes primed to notice common words. (Although those might not always be the most useful, e.g. the protagonists&#x27; names are probably not something you need to remember.)<p>But I don&#x27;t know what has made you struggle with language learning in the past, so maybe that advice is not at all useful to you.')
