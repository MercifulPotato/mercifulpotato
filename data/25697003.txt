If Mastodon.social wants to remove some accounts, they also can do that. However, others can run their own Mastodon instances if they want to do, and on Android there is sideloading possible at least, so you can still install it (or other programs) if you want it, even though Google does not want it on the Google Play.<p>So, I think that it isn&#x27;t too much problem (at this time).<p>(Although I do think that their policy should be amended if needed, so that apps which do not connect to a specific server should be allowed if the servers containing content they do not want are not preset. This way, you can still have them, although you will have to enter the server names by yourself if you want to access ones that the App Store disallowed.)')
