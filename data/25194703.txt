Recall that you can take over planets by either bombarding them with your ships, resulting in the death of the entire planetary population, or sending in troopships carrying your own population, resulting in the death of the some or all planetary population and&#x2F;or some or all your own population committed to the assault.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if more than a handful of players ever even gave the act a moment&#x27;s thought before ordering the attack and I don&#x27;t recall the ethics ever being brought up in any review or analysis.')
