It&#x27;s a coffeemaker and it may not produce the same quality coffee with other beans but it&#x27;s perfectly capable of producing coffee from any beans you feed it.<p>That said, Apple has no incentive to work towards enabling this. Both Apple&#x27;s profit and customer&#x27;s expectation are in the vertical integration that Apple provides.<p>(I&#x27;m not in anyway saying iOS is not restrictive or that they shouldn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s no pressing reason for them to work towards achieving it.)')
