The gift was the new Microsoft Age of Empires 3 definitive edition game.  I&#x27;m in Australia.  It was simply impossible to buy this as a gift.<p>In the 1990&#x27;s the go-to gift was the compact disc.  Everyone loved getting music as a present and everyone gave music.  Now how often is music given as a gift?  I&#x27;d guess a very very small amount - it&#x27;s not easy to do, esepcially given cross platform issues between Android and iOS.<p>Same with books - books used to be the other go-to gift.  Again I tried to give a friend an audiobook that I liked - I couldn&#x27;t work out how to do it - he is on Android and I am on iOS.  Books as gifts used to be absolutely gigantic.<p>Giving digital stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to provide the giver and givee with the same sense of tangible exchange.<p>PC Games, books, music all used to be huge gift categories.  The digital transformation seems to have left gift giving behind.')
