Similarly effective chemical weapons that can kill tens of thousands of people when released over a populated area are relatively cheap to construct.  If they where on sale you can bet people would buy them as artwork if nothing else.<p>So sure, people can do plenty of mildly dangerous things, but it’s hard to find something significantly more destructive than intentionally setting off a few hundred fires out west.  That’s the kind of thing a homeless person could pull off with a backpack and 30$ worth of supplies.')
