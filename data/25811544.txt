I somehow lost the adapter. Bought another one. Then bought a dual A&#x2F;C USB thumb drive. I&#x27;m getting along, but would appreciate at least one USB-A port.<p>I am also a photographer, and miss the SD port. But I realize that&#x27;s kinda niche, and can understand it going away. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see cameras move away from SD cards eventually anyway.')
