This seems high and &quot;student-facing&quot; is padding the numbers. &quot;Customer Success&quot; people are technically student-facing but not instructors, and number of instructors per student is the most important number that matters for quality<p>&gt; This studentâ€™s frustration comes from a series of changes we made simultaneously<p>Do not make changes to ongoing cohorts<p>&gt; Some students see it as one more thing distracting them from writing more code, and believe the only thing that will determine their career success is ability to write code<p>Isn&#x27;t this something a school would be able to educate on?
