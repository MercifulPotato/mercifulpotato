The article focuses on that item and does not itemise the fate of the others.<p>* Adding a tracking device to a returned new product is tantamount to damage.  If such a device is detected during returns processing, anyone with half a brain should immediately presume a malicious actor and have the item very carefully and securely assessed for disposal.<p>* Did not verify that the tracking device remained within the bag.<p>* &quot;30-40 percent of online purchases are returned&quot; what absolute hoopsla. I&#x27;ve worked in online commerce and this is off by an order of magnitude. A very few segments (e.g. shoes) may approach such return rates.<p>This crap is why journalism is in such disrepute.')
