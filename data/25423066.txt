Admittedly, I am used to the world where these services basically define social media. I think I am a bit too old to be in the demographic TikTok seems to be appealing to.<p>Still, Facebook and Twitter just have way more content and users than porn websites, and it’s going to be easier to fly under the radar. Twitter accounts with fewer than 500 followers are basically invisible.<p>Of course, banning pornography really does <i>roughly</i> solve this problem, but it’s a pretty nuclear solution... (I would prefer a world where we’re less weird about erotic content, not more. I get why it’s complicated, but I still think we can do better.)')
