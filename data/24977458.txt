If you sincerely think this is any worse than the situation with &quot;regular PCs,&quot; go look for the disk that came with your PC with the source code for your BIOS ROM.<p>(This is an aggravating one, since there are plenty of PCs in the world that could use a microcode patch via the BIOS right now)<p>&gt; Proprietary GFX hardware which needs paid for codes to use (see comment earlier about Malaysia).<p>More open source code is available for more GPU functionality on the Pi than is available for the Nvidia graphics cards I&#x27;ve used for decades. That&#x27;s not saying much, given how bad Nvidia is about this stuff, and how anemic the Pi GPU really is, but I&#x27;m not the one making these crazy comparisons.<p>It&#x27;s like this with every aspect of this comparison. You need to be unaware of anything about how PCs are put together to buy it for a minute. PCs are full of proprietary stuff.')
