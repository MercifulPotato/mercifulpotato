Batteries prices are falling. PV is already incredibly cheap and getting cheaper. Coal is becoming increasingly uncompetitive. Nuclear is making a comeback, also thanks to US entrepreneurs.<p>Science, Capitalism and entrepreneurship will be the unstoppable force that will solve our energy crisis, if western governments let them.<p>Africa, India and China will be the biggest factors going forward.<p>UPDATE: To be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing for laissez-faire capitalism. Government incentives are required to develop markets, as Germany did with PV, and US does with EV. My point is that the US being part of the Climate Accord or not won&#x27;t matter much, the move away from coal and ICE cars is inevitable due to already existing market forces. A bigger lever would be to de-regulate nuclear where it makes sense, as that is where the biggest cost lie.')
