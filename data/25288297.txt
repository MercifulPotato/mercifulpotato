Your financial situation shouldn&#x27;t dictate your ability to avoid unnecessary waste.<p>In my opinion, the move should be towards normalising reusable containers (where practical). Where I am, there are some more &quot;specialist&quot; shops who are doing great work in this area, but it&#x27;s not mainstream and is often more expensive than just going to the supermarket.')
