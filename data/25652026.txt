Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609885435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641527, text='I know of the history of the term &quot;waterfall&quot;. I&#x27;ve also heard people say &quot;we use waterfall&quot;, meaning (though they might not know it), something more like Rocye&#x27;s modified waterfall model. But what I rarely get from agile people is a discussion of what is &quot;agile&quot; vs. other approaches. I came of age as a developer in the 1990s, strongly influenced by McConnell&#x27;s &quot;Rapid Development&quot;, which describes a dozen different development styles. RAD of course was one of the influences of the Agile movement, but I never understood what &quot;agile&quot; meant, and the manifesto still doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, leaving me to think it&#x27;s tied to issues that come up in large software development projects, while my career has all been in small to mid-size projects with &lt;200 people years of effort.<p>You&#x27;ve provided some excellent commentary.<p>With the current pandemic and two preschoolers home from school, I simply don&#x27;t have the time to follow your links and give them due thought and consideration.<p>Probably the fundamental blocking point is that I am self-employed, working with at most a small group of people for consulting&#x2F;contract work. As such, I simply don&#x27;t have the experience that would help me really understand how these issues affect things.<p>I will keep this page open, and read those links more thoroughly at some point, but probably not until after massive vaccination and re-opening of libraries, museums, and other places to burn off pre-schooler energy and attention needs.')
