But most are not fundamental effects, they are emergent.<p>When you go into smaller length and timescales, these quantization effects kind of lose or change their meaning.<p>So an electron doesn&#x27;t instantaneously change between &quot;shells&quot; in an atom upon reception of a photon if you look closely enough, there are indeed smooth intermediary states and maybe the researchers are saying they detected subtleties in these states (I didn&#x27;t read the original research article yet).')
