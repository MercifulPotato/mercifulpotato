I find hard to believe you really needed&#x2F;wanted a citation on what I stated just to equiparate my post to a citation request on a sentientness scale <i>on a different comment</i>. I’ve read Hofstader and I know some of the origins of these scales and their are based on all but true scientific method.<p>That aside, how can we expect to treat animals better than we treat ourselves? And that’s why veganism without ethics is just another form of consumerism. It’s late at night and I will fail to provide citation, but you can google how quinoa prices skyrocketed when became part of the superfood&#x2F;healthy eating&#x2F;vegan culture of rich populations, and what this meant for the locals that used to grow it and eat it.<p>I say the above (the google it part) without trying to be offensive and with an olive branch, looking forward to go deeper in this reflections.')
