I had a bunch of updates forced on me last night that restarted <i>my</i> computer without permission and caused me to lose work. This morning, while in a conference call, I needed to fiddle with my sound settings (in the atrocious Settings app) to get my microphone and camera to work since the update dropped all my sound configurations. Actually, that app doesn&#x27;t expose the listen to device settings I need so I must run mmsys.cpl. Then, later this evening, I came back from dinner and found that the computer restarted itself again causing me to lose more work. I&#x27;m not a Microsoft hater, but they are totally dropping the ball here. These updates have gotten insane. Have we reached a point where this is acceptable? I came back a month or so ago and found all my default apps had been reset and an Edge icon had been pinned to my taskbar. Tonight, while I&#x27;m trying to again figure out how to disable updates, I went into the Registry Editor (see photo), and it really hit me--this is amateur hour. It&#x27;s not just that screenshot that looks ridiculous, it&#x27;s everything. Windows has no consistency at any level anymore. It&#x27;s almost like everyone who worked on the earlier versions has died. It&#x27;s very sad. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has grown increasingly frustrated or has any predictions on what this will lead to.')
