I think I wasted like a year doing the wrong things and strongly considered quitting during that period.<p>Then I figured that just as I got rather vague direction on what I should do, there also wasn&#x27;t anyone telling me what I should not do. So I started doing things in the intersection of being interesting and beneficial for the product.<p>So my advice would be: If there&#x27;s no concrete problem to solve, find one that you like and be glad that you were given the freedom to do so.')
