Often tools are brought in to make something easier or solve some problem but nobody seems to be thinking about the huge cost that this entails in terms of keeping all of these moving parts working. I think staying with older and more solid stuff that is not in a rapid flux of so-called improvement is often a much more pleasant experience. I think the barrier for introducing some new kind of tooling should be much higher than it often is in practice.')
