It is just &quot;split&quot; function, which is present in every language and very easy to use. When I use it, I usually add a check to writer that there is no newlines or tabs in data, and assert if this is not the case.<p>You use this tsv with Unix tools like &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;paste&quot;, and ad-hoc scripts.<p>There is also &quot;tsv&quot; as defined by excel, which has quoting and stuff. It is basically a dialect of CSV (Python even uses the same module to read it), and has all the disadvantages of CSV. Avoid it.')
