OP is worse, because he can’t even acknowledge the value that Spotify brings to hundreds of millions of people. Implicit is the claim that they’re only using it because they don’t know any better. If they were as intelligent as OP they would use Winamp and share songs manually.<p>Clearly this was my intent, and I&#x27;m glad you appreciate the intelligence of my remarks.<p>The substance of my argument isn&#x27;t to point out that WinAmp should have a 50 billion dollar market cap instead of Spotify. It&#x27;s an observation that the trends in our industry are disappointing because they favor lock-in, simple interfaces for non-power users, monopoly, and consolidation.<p>You get &quot;sharing&quot; with a whole lot of bad.<p>A hypothetical &quot;good&quot; company could provide much more than what Spotify does and in the same breath not monopolize all the podcasters or prevent data export. But why do that when you can capture 90% of the market, hold them completely captive, and not do these things which take effort or risk your stranglehold?<p>I dislike the future we found ourselves in. There was a lot of promise, I suppose wholly imagined, that never panned out.<p>I&#x27;m angry because I imagine better. This shit sucks.')
