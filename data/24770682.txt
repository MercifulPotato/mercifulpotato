No one bats an eye when a company bumps your salary up if you move to NYC or SF yet if they bump it down when you move out surely that&#x27;s the same thing right? Obviously there are edge cases but as a general principle that seems logical to me. Ofc it depends on how much each bump is etc. but on the surface a paycut while moving somewhere with lower cost of living doesn&#x27;t seem radical to me.')
