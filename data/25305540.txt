On three separate jobs (small tasks, few hours to couple of days) I was told, after asking some questions, &quot;stop bugging me and just write the damn thing&quot;.<p>I would probably not ask any questions on any new task of that sort and just randomly pick something. To be honest, that might not even be intrinsically bad - the client can always change their mind even if I write exactly what they wanted, so &quot;write something and show it to me&quot; is probably a good idea.')
