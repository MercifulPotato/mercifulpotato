Think if this happened to &quot;your&quot; candidate:<p>- There&#x27;s no doubt that Twitter and Facebook has been uncritically spreading false rumors about Trump only to turn right around and supress the H.Biden leaks, even after it was clear at least some of the juicy mails was cryptographically verified. If Twitter had been posting a warning everytime someone pretended the &quot;fine folks on both sides&quot; hoax then they would have been in a better position now. Same if they had come up with the rule against hacked materials when Trumps tax papers supposedly leaked.<p>- Ballot collections<p>- Sweeping changes to election laws<p>etc etc.<p>I dislike Trump, but it is hard to not get some sympathy for someone who has managed to get a number of really fantastic peace deals, have finally started to improve lives of people in the midwest - without hurting the coasts - and yet is hounded by almost every mainstream media outlet.')
