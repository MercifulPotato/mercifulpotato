Their wool flannel shirts and field shirts are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, as are their worker wool pants, and they have enough merino clothing to layer for any weather.<p>Aside from the own brands, they often get very good surplus winter gear in, like thick Swiss knitted wool sweaters, Czech parkas, Finnish wool pants and so on.<p>My current winter outerwear workhorses are a Czech parka and a pair of Finnish M65 wool pants, total cost less than â‚¬50. With long johns and a woolen sweater underneath, I have yet to encounter winter weather that would make me uncomfortable.')
