Synonyms are not exactly synonyms; the more complex word can convey a substantially different idea in subtle ways. When speaking, we are forced to reach for simple words to keep up with the real-time pace of conservation. This restriction to the same few words homogenizes verbal semantics and limits our abilities to express nuanced ideas with speech. The very advantage of writing is that we don&#x27;t have to write like we speak, and can instead take a minute to consider whether &quot;berate&quot; or &quot;accost&quot; or &quot;chide&quot; or &quot;admonish&quot; best communicates our ideas. Like all freedoms, this advantage is double-edged and gives writers the chance to bury their prose with flowery language, but I should hope that we can rise to that challenge and write more precisely than we speak.')
