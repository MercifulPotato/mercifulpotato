Item(by='ja27', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608560127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492537, text='2 years ago I went from a 2011 MBP to a used i7 2015 15&quot; MBP and it was a great machine. I liked the ports and it was really handy to stash a 400GB microSD in the slot for more space. I upgraded the stock SSD to an NVMe and it really made a difference.<p>I went to the i9 16&quot; MBP a year ago and yeah it&#x27;s new and shiny and faster but not a world-changer. Managing to skip the butterfly keyboard was the big win. The better speakers are surprisingly the best feature upgrade from the 2015 to 2019.<p>Except for the lure of the M1 Macs, a used i7 15&quot; 2015 MacBook Pro is probably the best bang for the buck in the Apple world.')
