For example is caviar really that nice to deserve its price? At some places in soviet union caviar was cheaper than sugar and people used to trade it for lemons (because citrus was rarer). Scarcity makes things attractive.<p>Fugu is one of those. Requires a highly skilled cook to prepare it and is only available at very few restaurants.')
