Item(by='jdeibele', descendants=None, kids=[24942318], score=None, time=1603909530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920006, text='To chime in: The local newspaper went from being delivered 7 days a week as a folded newspaper to being delivered 4 days a week in a tabloid form that&#x27;s about 60% the size of the old format.<p>We cancelled then, and probably a lot of other people did, too.<p>We recently subscribed for 1 year as a gesture to &quot;save our local newspaper&quot;.  As part of that, we get the Sunday paper for free.  Our last one is still in the plastic wrapper just inside the door.  4 days after we got it, none of us (2 parents, 2 high school students, 1 college student) have bothered to open it.<p>Our local paper is part of the Advance chain.  Their website is terrible and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be updated very often.   Probably they have some sort of PDF format that is hard to use or even worse a custom app that basically acts as a magnifying glass on a small section of the page.<p>What I want from a local paper: local stuff.  I don&#x27;t care about their opinion on national issues and The NY Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, etc. are just a click away.<p>In another universe, newspapers could have capitalized on the fact that they had &lt;subscribers&gt; by making free online ads, discussion forums, etc.   Yes, there&#x27;d be some moderation issues but it&#x27;s a lot easier if you&#x27;ve got paying customers.   Don&#x27;t want to subscribe?  Can&#x27;t comment.  Can&#x27;t post an ad.  Maybe can&#x27;t respond to an ad.<p>They pissed that all away by making their content free.  Now their content is basically worthless and there&#x27;s nowhere for them to go.')
