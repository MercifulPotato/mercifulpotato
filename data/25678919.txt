Apple previously indicated that the M1 Macs boot using a derivative of the iPhone&#x2F;iPad boot procedure. There&#x27;s a reasonable chance it&#x27;ll still have something like the EFI buffer allocation mechanism, but it&#x27;ll not be using a mainline standard. While it sucks that Apple ditched EFI, the good news is that it&#x27;s probably reasonably well understood since Linux has already been booted on an iPhone 7 using Checkra1n [1] (and apparently with framebuffer support too!).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tuxphones.com&#x2F;iphone-7-now-boots-postmarketos-linux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tuxphones.com&#x2F;iphone-7-now-boots-postmarketos-linux&#x2F;</a>')
