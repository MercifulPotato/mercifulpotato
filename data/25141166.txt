Some I look at and think &quot;That looks like shit!&quot; Some I look at and think &quot;I don&#x27;t see the point.&quot; Some I look at and think &quot;Wish I&#x27;d thought of that.&quot; But every single one of them, the shit ones, the pointless ones, the really neat ones, they all have value. Massive learning opportunities, the fact you published something, the fact you experimented. I cannot commend you enough for what you have achieved.<p>I get involved in &quot;weekend projects&quot; (sometimes they go a little longer than a weekend), and I find that without the pressure to deliver something useful it lets me explore whimsical ideas and learning opportunities I don&#x27;t get in my day job.')
