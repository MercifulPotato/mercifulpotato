I left in 2015 then came back and left for good in 2016.<p>On one hand, no other bank has tried so hard to make financial responsibility a first-class citizen\nin their mobile and web apps. They made setting aside money and budgeting expenses very, very\nseamless to do. I wish other consumer banks learned from what Simple was trying to accomplish.\nSimple also had the most pleasing and tech-forward mobile and web apps of any consumer bank; it was\na step above everything else. Lastly, Simple&#x27;s customer service was unrivaled. Being able to use a\nchat platform that didn&#x27;t suck _and_ get connected with a human within five minutes was not possible\nelsewhere back then.<p>On the other hand, some of Simple&#x27;s business decisions were...frustrating.<p>It took me _over five days_ for them to replace a lost card. Most banks can replace overnight for an\nadditional fee; Simple didn&#x27;t even give you that option. This was pretty frustrating given that they\nencourage you to use their card for everything.<p>I couldn&#x27;t pay a bill larger than $3,000 one time (which was ironic given that I was paying off a\ncredit card). I don&#x27;t remember why, but I remember thinking &quot;this is dumb; any bank would process\nthis payment no questions asked.&quot; Trying to pay this bill through Simple was a massive exercise in\nfrustration.<p>I actually encountered _multiple_ bill pay failures with Simple. Paid bills would never get funds\ndisbursed. Payments would show up multiple times in my ledger. The worst of the failures I\nexperienced happened when I paid one of my student loans but found out _days_ later that the payment\nactually never went out due to a &quot;technical error.&quot; This caused me to miss a payment and eat a late\nfee. I actually landed up speaking to their CEO at the time about it over the phone; he gave me $50\nas an apology consolation, which I thought was cool.<p>They also didn&#x27;t support eChecks, which meant that every payment I made would take _at least_ three\ndays to clear through ACH. I remember being very relieved when I switched to Chase and could process\npayments in 24 hours.<p>I&#x27;m _still_ salty about a failed database migration they performed which took out their backend ATM\nservices while I was on vacation. Couldn&#x27;t get money out or move money in for a day or two. This\nwould _never_ happen with a bigger bank, and even if it did, they have brick-and-mortars as a\nfallback.<p>After BBVA pseudo-acquired them and their legendarily-prompt service went south, I switched over to\nChase and never looked back. After Simple removed their Bill Pay feature, I wondered why they just\ndidn&#x27;t get fully-acquihired or something.')
