There&#x27;s no way around it because someone will just deny someone else&#x27;s reality and substitute their own.<p>With intellectual honesty, the following can&#x27;t be disputed:<p>* &quot;A few riots&quot; is actually hundreds of riots over the longest sustained period of civil unrest in American history (besides the civil war). Here&#x27;s a geographical chart of all protests and riots from May 2020 to August 2020: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acleddata.com&#x2F;acleddatanew&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;Political-Violence-Demonstrations-Strategic-Developments-in-the-US-24-May-22-August-2020.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acleddata.com&#x2F;acleddatanew&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;0...</a><p>* For the people living in Portland, Seattle, New York, and other major cities the rioters were&#x2F;are a threatening presence.

What kind of information would it take to change your mind? Would that even be possible? Is this cherry picking?<p>I think on a forum like Hacker News we might actually get to the bottom of this particular point. But that&#x27;s only because Hacker News isn&#x27;t social media - it&#x27;s a community based around tech, and it&#x27;s heavily moderated. That changes the audience that will see our argument, and the entire dynamic of the dialogue.<p>I&#x27;m not here to argue about the riots or left&#x2F;right politics. I&#x27;m just trying to show you that you are capable of being wrong, so stop trying to argue the politics and try to tackle the problem of how to end fragmentation.')
