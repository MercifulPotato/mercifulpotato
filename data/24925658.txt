I was using hyperinflation a bit hyperbolically, but the point still stands. One potential interpretation for the the appreciation of bitcoin vs. USD (which, I should add, is the longest its ever been over 10K&#x2F;btc spot) over the last few weeks is a reaction to the ongoing attempts to jumpstart the various economies of the world that have been put on life support since the start of the pandemic.<p>Obviously bitcoin and USD don&#x27;t have equal demand curves, but compare the supply curves: stable vs. arbitrary. If you&#x27;re comparing two assets, they don&#x27;t necessarily need to have equivalent instantaneous demand functions - that seems a bit specious.')
