I believe the problem is some people are understanding the complexity in a wrong way. Coding isn&#x27;t complex (and today it is much more true than it used to be) because of some natural complexity of coding itself. Rather it is because it strives to express complex ideas. And whichever language (visual, textual) is used to express complex ideas it has to be at least as complex as those ideas themselves. I personally found that having a formal language is often easier to express complex ideas compared to any visual tool I have seen. One place where these tools can shine would be probably trivial apps. Maybe that&#x27;s the point...')
