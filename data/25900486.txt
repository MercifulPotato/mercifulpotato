Tesla has a seriously absurd advantage here: they can observe millions of drivers and see when the human drivers do things differently than their self driving software would have, and capture the data from those events. They&#x27;ve had this advantage for many years, and yet, they still don&#x27;t seem to be performing that much better (if at all) than competitors.')
