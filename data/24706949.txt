I had seen similar cases here of hunters claiming that there are too much wildboars so they must be granted a special permit to hunt more out of season. Cameras at the same time don&#x27;t show the wildpigcalipse that newspapers claim<p>... but if is legal in US, is legal. Definitely unwise in any case.<p>If this is a concern in some areas, just a small stone wall around the kids&#x27;s playing area would deter the pigs to enter. They do not jump very well.')
