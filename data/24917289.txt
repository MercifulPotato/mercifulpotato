And Google seized the opportunity here. Most of the times, the AMP site is faster, there is real value added for the end user, and Google used that positive experience to sneak in their stuff. It would never have happened if sites were fast to begin with.<p>Like I always say about AMP, there are two parts to it: some sort of enforced guidelines that ensure your pages are fast. This is the good part. And there is Google stuff. But you know what, AMP is open source, so take the code, strip off the Google parts and you have a website that is even faster, and independent. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never seen done, and yet, that&#x27;s probably the best for the end user.<p>Instead, most website owners who complain about AMP do it for the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons. They want to load up their site with 10 different trackers, popups and other annoyances. They don&#x27;t care about your privacy or going through Google servers, in fact, they most likely already have Google tracking and ads enabled in their non-AMP site.<p>That&#x27;s the saddest part, because of years of laziness and overzealous marketing, AMP is actually good for users.')
