You determined it wasn&#x27;t worth it, so don&#x27;t be surprised if there&#x27;s an outcome you don&#x27;t like.<p>I read terms quite often and have flatly refused to use services because of them, or in some cases told them in writing I don&#x27;t accept a problematic clause (for whatever that&#x27;s worth).  It&#x27;s a real pain and I typically have very little bargaining power.<p>Maybe if the world wasn&#x27;t full of people who simply don&#x27;t care we could effect some change here.')
