My understanding also is that people had largely changed their opinions on whether killing Jews was actual murder by the time Hitler got around to setting up his final solution. For example, there was never a point, during Hitler&#x27;s reign, where a political opposition strongly opposed to killing Jews controlled all branches of the government. (This did happen with the Republicans in 2016, and they did not stop abortion at that time, though it was within their power to do so.)<p>I would also just note that there are policies that have been clearly demonstrated to reduce the number of abortions, but they require a small amount of spending. I struggle to believe that someone who believes abortion is literal murder would shrink from providing e.g. free contraceptives, given the alternative. Yet Republicans tend to be opposed to these things, certainly at the legislative level. The behavior and voting patterns just don&#x27;t support the claim, IMO.')
