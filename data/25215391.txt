I demanded they give me an actual reason and reinstate my account.</i><p>A tip for nerds like me: In situations like this, try to act like a real person. Support people <i>especially</i> have to deal with endless streams of annoyed, angry, or abusive people who will treat them like dirt. Anyone who&#x27;s worked in a grocery store, etc will know what I mean.<p>Something like &quot;Hey, thanks for looking into this, but I am very confused -- It seems like I was banned due to a software glitch. Would you mind double checking why I was banned?&quot;<p>Boom, you&#x27;ve turned it from an unhappy angry interaction into a mystery they might be inclined to pursue. I&#x27;ve seen this technique work wonders.<p>And sure, you could argue that it&#x27;s their job, so this shouldn&#x27;t matter. But it seems to matter a lot, at least in my experience.')
