In terms of performance, that is a tricky one, since it can feel personal. It requires a empathetic manager to get right. Maybe a tool CAN help?<p>&gt; more importantly, use it to give constructive criticism to help them grow incrementally<p>I&#x27;m all for sensitive conversations to be f2f. I can see potential use as a forum for someone who is explicitly requesting feedback.
