Because of the character limitation, the writing on Twitter has a wooden cadence.<p>TWEET 4&#x2F;7: The best thing Twitter could do for writers is give them some way to go beyond the standard character limit within the core platform.<p>TWEET 5&#x2F;7: The limit doesn&#x27;t need to be lifted entirely; maybe anything beyond the limit can be hidden by default, but with an option to reveal it.<p>TWEET 6&#x2F;7: Restricting how writers write can sometimes encourage better writing.  But Twitter is one of the largest communications platforms in the world, and it&#x27;s got to reckon with that.<p>TWEET 7&#x2F;7: Imagine if, instead of a char limit, you could only write rhyming couplets!  It would be fun as a niche site, but not as a site used to communicate breaking news and longer, more thoughtful writing.<p>COUPLET 1&#x2F;1: Twitter&#x27;s a major communications hub, like it or not.  Its restrictions on writing are a big blind spot.')
