Police unions, like the ones in Wisconsin, supported Gov. Walker so he conveniently didn’t break them. That’s corrupt in my opinion and unprincipled.<p>You have begun to see labor movements distance themselves from police unions. I’d expect at some point it will be politically acceptable for Democrats in places like Wisconsin to strike back at them, which I’d support. So long as the other unions in the public sector are broken too.<p>No public sector should be able to unionize. If these groups want to lobby then fine. Lobbying, although corrupt in many ways, does not beholden tax payers to corrupt contracts.')
