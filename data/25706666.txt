I had been doing some occasional bouldering for a couple months before that, but starting lifting, then starting more seriously (3 times a week at least, plus miscellaneous training on off days) has really been life changing. I am so much more energised, feel so much <i>healthier</i> (whatever that means) overall. I&#x27;m pretty happy I started early, but can&#x27;t stop wishing I had started even earlier.<p>I recommend the HN crowd especially to give bouldering a try. It&#x27;s climbing with a higher emphasis on power and puzzle-solving. Incredibly addicting, has a great feedback and gratification loop!')
