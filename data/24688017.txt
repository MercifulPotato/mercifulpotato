I admire the heck out of his accomplishments but he seems like maybe not such a great person.  Not sure he’d be an interesting dinner guest.  All the anti-social stuff of a top sportsman but in a position where he simply doesn’t age out of it and have to be a normal person.  Not a bad guy, per se, but not someone who’s life you want your to emulate.<p>Very interesting read, especially about the dynamics.  Winning teams have a focus, they don’t run well by committees (look at Ferrari) the difference between a championship and average season is often in the margins and the spaces between the “rules.”')
