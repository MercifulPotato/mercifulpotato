Who knows if they&#x27;ll fix it, but it&#x27;s not worth making a big deal over, because you weren&#x27;t <i>really</i> wanting to run 2k threads on mac os anyway, because it would suck, even if it did work.<p>From the other message on the thread; it looks like too many threads is causing a watchdog timer to fail, leading to the panic.')
