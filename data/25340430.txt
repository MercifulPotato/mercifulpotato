If you are ordered to allow the police to seize some of your property, and you refuse, force will be escalated within the limits of the law until you the property is taken.  That is a <i>good</i> thing.  If the police show up at your house with a warrant, COMPLY WITH THEM.  You aren&#x27;t going to win a physical battle against them because, again, they have an ultimate monopoly on violence and the only way to change that is going to be the creation of a new state.')
