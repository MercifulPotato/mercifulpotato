Commits get their own preview URLs and branches get their own dedicated alias. Had a quick look at their pricing as well and the main difference is the Cloudflare free plan is limited to 500 builds per month as opposed to Netlify&#x27;s 300 build _minutes_ per month and that Cloudflare offer unlimited bandwidth instead of 100GB per month. I am excited to start using this.')
