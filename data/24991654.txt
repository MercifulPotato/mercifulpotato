It&#x27;s jaded, but it&#x27;s best to assume that a &quot;corporation&#x27;s best interest&quot; equates to what makes them the most money; nothing more, nothing less.  And of course, it&#x27;s to make more money for ownership that already has money.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the point of corporate vs public best interest is &quot;unconditional&quot;, but we skew way too far to the corporate side than is good for our society')
