A few Government incentives, both financial and for instance the ability to use dedicated bus lanes (now discontinued in Oslo I think?) majorly helped.<p>One of the large issues around uptake is simply infrastructure. Here in Ireland, it is still patchy at best. We had an EV (Nissan) from around 2016 but gave it up in 2020 as there was simply too much anxiety around out of service public chargers and lack of backup. Range anxiety is definitely possible to overcome, but it requires the state to back it up with resources: Norway has most definitively done this.<p>Final thought: no surprise that ID.3 is making inroads in a huge way on sales. It&#x27;s a sweet spot of a good car at an attainable price that looks, for want of a better word, &#x27;normal&#x27;. Some EVs seem to be designed &#x27;differently&#x27; almost for the sake of it - and while some will love that, it ends up adding another hurdle for a certain segment of the market I believe.')
