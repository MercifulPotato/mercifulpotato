Gvim isn&#x27;t quite there but close. This fictional editor should still be usable by anyone in a terminal but should be used like vscode as a standalone tool and yet very, very low resource, low fuss. There just isnt such an editor. Vim itself is just too hard for a beginner. It took me far too many years to know it and Im still learning years later...but I&#x27;m hooked now and struggle to edit text using the mouse, end, home, delete, enter, tab and ctrl-chords. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone but more as a fun learning project; an esoteric plaything with real-world applications that give you a bit of an edge oftentimes.')
