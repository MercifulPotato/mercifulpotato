I agree that they&#x27;re competitors in certain respects, insofar as they&#x27;re both electric vehicles and both have their price spread constrained by the cost of batteries. But they don&#x27;t <i>directly compete</i> with the same audience. A more reasonable direct competitor to the ID.3 is the Renault Zoe or Peugeot e-208. A more reasonable direct competitor to the Model 3 is the Polestar 2.<p>The Model 3 and ID.3 are a full size class apart and have wildly different driving character. In BMW parlance it&#x27;s M340i vs 120i. In Mercedes parlance it&#x27;s C43 vs A200.<p>It is too early to assess the relative build quality of the ID.3, though obviously VW do have strong form here and Tesla have weak form. But from a construction standpoint it&#x27;s worth noting that the ID.3 is cheaply made, well below the standard of even the VW Golf. Despite the price tag, it&#x27;s an economy car through and through.')
