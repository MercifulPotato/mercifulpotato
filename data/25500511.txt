Item(by='woodruffw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608590211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500334, text='&gt; In places with free street parking (or public lots), I suspect the population is sparse enough that the added land cost for parting isn&#x27;t a big deal, most people have cars, and most people support having parking.<p>This is not true in Manhattan, which (to my knowledge) is the most densely populated borough in the most densely populated city in the US. Almost all street parking in Manhattan is free, with <i>small</i> carve-outs for meters on high-traffic blocks.<p>The city also has a semi-official policy of allowing commercial traffic to ignore parking laws[1]. In practice, that means trucks parked on <i>sidewalks</i>, with pedestrians exposed to car traffic on the streets.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyc.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;delivery-companies-pressure-city-hall-to-let-them-keep-violating-law-without-penalty&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyc.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;delivery-companies-pr...</a>')
