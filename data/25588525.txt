And then we need the IRS to publicly scare employers into erring on the side of calling workers employees.<p>I fought a misclassification with a former employer. I was able to get a ruling from the IRS, but the employer never really faced any real punishment, even though it was in writing that he was playing tax games.<p>I think what it comes down to is that almost no one knows how to dispute it or that they even can dispute. And many employers will immediately get rid of you if you try.')
