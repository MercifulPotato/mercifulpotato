If it doesn&#x27;t sound like an online program (e.g. University of Phoenix) I doubt most would notice.<p>But then again, I never see resumes until someone asks me to do a phone screening. Even then, I kinda glance at them enough to figure out which set of questions to pull out.<p>So I guess that decision is made well before me. Getting to the actual phone&#x2F;in-person interview is the challenging part. I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s often more about who you know than anything else.')
