It is neutered and using it is painful to use unless you pay for professional help. They bundle everything in a virtual machine file (!!) and not standard Docker containers. The whole thing is horribly put together. I spent half a day trying to get it up and running and it was a nightmare.<p>ERPs and MRPs are in a weird uncanny valley. 99% of the audience that need to use it are not programmers. Open sourcing is nice but largely only helpful to people that are going to forkit and improve it, not end users. Also, ERP is the brains of your business. If it goes down and has problems, your business comes to a halt. It needs to be rock solid and most businesses don&#x27;t want to deal with this type of thing - happy to pay $300&#x2F;month for small business ERP from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft or other platforms. I am complaining but its better than nothing, the fact that theyve put their code out for free is commendable.')
