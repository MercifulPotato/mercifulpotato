You&#x27;ll note that in other parts of the comments in this thread we actually got into some details about things like counter party risk and why trading platforms have aggregate risks to manage, but we didn&#x27;t manage to have that conversation in this part of the thread becuase the level of argument was pretty much just &quot;I won&#x27;t address the point you&#x27;re making I&#x27;ll call you names and then call you stupid&quot;.<p>Well fine, by the sounds of it, you&#x27;re the sort of person who also makes those Rust threads unbearable by commenting despite having never worked with or near Rust but calling people names because they have experience and have formed opinions. Let&#x27;s just put it this way, the way the HN commentary has come across right now is like a guy in a bar telling your about a horse you should place a bet on. That&#x27;s the level we&#x27;re at, and that&#x27;s why I talk about the mass hysteria as the more relevant point, because your average Joe has no business reasoning about dynamics of stock prices of fairly illiquid crappy retail stocks.')
