The problem with assuming any particular distribution for the attackers is that they tend to constantly update their attacks as password trends evolve.<p>Random password, picked uniformly from strings up to 1000 characters? Almost certainly at least 900 characters, extremely strong. Probability of picking &quot;password&quot;? Less than the probability you&#x27;re currently hallucinating, or that there&#x27;s a bug in your code, or that an attacker guesses your password by pure chance.<p>You can&#x27;t show that particular string isn&#x27;t easy to guess- perhaps it follows a common pattern of humans spamming &quot;random&quot; keypresses with far lower entropy than one would expect. Can I show that I could guess something without seeing it beforehand? Probably not. Don&#x27;t settle for &quot;I couldn&#x27;t guess this password&quot; when you can get &quot;No one can guess this password&quot;.')
