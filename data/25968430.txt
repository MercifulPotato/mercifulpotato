I&#x27;d swear that I didn&#x27;t click the button in their full screen &quot;upsell&quot; page in the middle of the checkout process.. but yet money gone and only half refund. Their customer contact details is hidden so deep, that it took me 10 minutes to find out. Finally contacted them and got the remaining amount as store credit. Experiences like these puts me further of amazon. Now think about the definition of good UX.')
