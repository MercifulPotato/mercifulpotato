Normal distributions have support on all real numbers, which would imply that negative frequencies have nonzero probability. That is strange. Perhaps the underlying mechanism is more faithfully modeled by another distribution with nonnegative support, but due to the central limit theorem it is well-approximated by a normal distribution.')
