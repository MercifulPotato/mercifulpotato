It was an unmitigated mess, and the talent attrition was immediate. Management was chaos. They had told us that the acquisition was primarily for Gilt&#x27;s tech and talent, but post acquisition they had zero clue what to do with us. Political infighting between HBC management and pushback from Gilt management that stayed created an environment where little got done. Existing HBC projects, though incredibly outdated, costly, and hard to maintain, were given priority. Proposals and work to improve existing HBC properties were quickly shot down by HBC staff. The indecision and political infighting doomed Gilt further, and they unloaded the property to Gilt&#x27;s main competitor Rue La La two years later for a massive loss. Friends that were still around have told me that HBC lost over $100 million on the deal, and reporting backed that up [1].<p>This development and their continued decline does not surprise me in the least, based upon what I witnessed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;rue-la-la-buys-online-flash-sale-rival-gilt-2018-06-04" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;rue-la-la-buys-online-flas...</a>')
