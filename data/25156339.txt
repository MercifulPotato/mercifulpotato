But then video makers could fight back by using AI to compare it with the original without ads and distributing cue lists automatically downloadable by browsers extensions telling the player to skip from A to B to hide the ad. then Google would fight back again by making the ad embedding random at each play, so that cue lists wouldn&#x27;t work anymore, or disabling skipping within the ad segment, and so on. It will never end.<p>It is pretty clear that Google is attempting to monetize everything down to the spaces between zeros and ones, changing their own rules when it suits them, and won&#x27;t stop before anything. This is extremely unprofessional; I wouldn&#x27;t rely on them for anything serious.')
