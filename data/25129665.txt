Currently they say they have no plans to do so [0], but what if it takes off?<p>When you are an API customer you are supposed to honor all the actions that a user takes on their tweets (delete them from your in-house datastore if it&#x27;s deleted from Twitter, for instance) but it&#x27;s weakly&#x2F;not enforced by Twitter.<p>If they start putting stuff that&#x27;s inherently ephemeral into the API feed then how will they deal with making customers not just persist it anyway? Or maybe analytics for Fleets will only be provided by Twitter, which would be a bit of a slap to their API customers but at least Twitter can enforce the rules around the content.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twittercommunity.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;will-twitter-api-support-fleets&#x2F;145710&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twittercommunity.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;will-twitter-api-support-flee...</a>')
