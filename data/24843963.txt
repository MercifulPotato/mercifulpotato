I&#x27;ve also discussed candidates with fellows developers and have heard &quot;that&#x27;s not a full-stack developer&quot; more times than I can count, which leads to &quot;I&#x27;m not sure they know what they are talking about.&quot;<p>The point of my response is to say, if something isn&#x27;t working, change the formula.
