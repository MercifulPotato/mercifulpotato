Some will shine like you wouldn&#x27;t believe, if given the chance, and some would, at best, be crappy employees. I doubt there would be a problem with workplace violence, with most, but it&#x27;s entirely possible that you could end up with a &quot;dud.&quot;<p>In short, each case needs to be handled on an individual basis, with careful, extensive human interaction. Lots of &quot;tell me a story&quot; interviews. Coding tests are likely to be useless.<p>Since that kind of employee search seems to be a thing of the past, in our industry, it can be tough for these folks to get in the door. This woman went to bat for her friend. There&#x27;s not a whole lot of folks willing to do that.<p>BTW: The US is horrible for that kind of thing. Even a small misdemeanor can be a scarlet letter for life. I knew a guy that was busted in [an Ivy-League] college for pot (a misdemeanor), and pursued a career in banking. Even a quarter-century later, that bust followed him, and stunted his chances (he was real good).<p>One of the most intelligent people I ever met (and I have met a <i>lot</i> of <i>really</i> smart people) was a violent felon that went away at 17, and was profoundly twisted by the experience. He was never able to readjust properly. That marvelous intellect was never able to benefit us.')
