This can be done many different ways by combining data sources. You could automate it with algorithms and maybe some machine learning, but it&#x27;d also be pretty trivial for a dedicated human to do it.<p>Browser fingerprint, mac address, software versions, browsing behavior (https doesn&#x27;t hide URLs), access times, <i>and application hashes</i> will all help narrow down that search.<p>Maybe your university requires you to install some special software (like one of those locked down browsers for exams), and the attacker knows an approximate range of time when you installed it based on your exam schedule. They could narrow their search by intercepting OCSP requests and filtering for application hashes that match the specific version of the software you most likely downloaded, based on the time you most likely downloaded it.')
