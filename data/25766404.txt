It is purely up to the parties of the contract to determine if the other breached it. The remedies of that breach are specifically covered in the contract itself.<p>Nothing needs to be &quot;proven in court, before playing any such cards.&quot; It needs to be asserted. Once asserted, there may be a cure period (the licensee might have 30 days to remedy the problem, otherwise the contract terminates).<p>The party may disagree, and could negotiate different remedies or timelines - again, no court is required here. However, if they can&#x27;t come to terms, then they can pursue this in contract court.<p>Be aware that I&#x27;m not defending, or justifying, or taking a position on any of this. It&#x27;s just how it is. If you don&#x27;t like it, then work on reforming tort and contract law as opposed to stating on Hacker News that the basis of most worldwide commerce is &quot;nonsensical.&quot;')
