Item(by='linuxftw', descendants=None, kids=[25362892], score=None, time=1607540576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362584, text='In the case of ballots, each ballot should have a recorded chain of custody, so it&#x27;s actually not &#x27;impossible&#x27; to prove something didn&#x27;t happen.  If the accusations are &quot;There are a bunch of ballots that were entered into the counts without proper chain of custody&quot; that can be easily proven or disproven.<p>If the accusation is &quot;Signatures were required to be verified and bipartisan representatives were legally supposed to witness the process&quot; which apparently is the case in many jurisdictions, that too would be easy to prove or disprove.  There will be records associated with those observations and chain of custody records of those ballots.<p>Unfortunately, some ballot envelopes have already been &#x27;thrown away&#x27; so they cannot be audited to see if counts match, to see how many ballots were indeed signed (sometimes a witness is required), or be able to be verified against other controls (such as numbering, ensuring the name on the ballot matches who it was sent to, etc).<p>The law says you must hold an election, and exactly what steps you need to take to hold such an election.  If you didn&#x27;t follow the steps, there wasn&#x27;t a lawful election.  That&#x27;s more or less what some of the lawsuits are about.<p>Are these claims &#x27;baseless&#x27;?  I don&#x27;t think so.  There&#x27;s no shortage of sworn affidavits and statements from election officials about how the processes weren&#x27;t followed.  There&#x27;s also court cases (such as in Georgia) where the executive branch possibly unlawfully struck an agreement with Democrats to relax certain requirements.<p>The only remaining question is, how heavily should this evidence be weighed, and is it enough to affect the outcome of the process.  TBD.')
