If yes, they are an end-user. If not, they are a managed service provider.<p>There is no ambiguity in this case, they are offering the exact same elasticsearch API.<p>But this is not even the point. I&#x27;m not interested in the legal distinctions here at all, thats for the lawyers to delineate in more detail. The point is that Amazon are practically throwing away a huge business opportunity that would also encourage more FOSS to be built in a sustainable way (&quot;app store&quot; &#x2F; &quot;managed service store&quot;) for some short term gain, by throwing companies such as MongoDB and Elastic under the bus.')
