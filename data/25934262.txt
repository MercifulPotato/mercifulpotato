They are content to do things that make it appear to be addressing a problem but not doing things that would actually address those problems.  For instance, upper class people rarely advocate for changing the way k-12 schools are funded.  They rarely advocate for increasing the pay and resources of public defenders.  They rarely advocate for reforming a justice system that caters to those who can afford a lawyer and crushes those who can’t.<p>The obsession with race by the political class gets lower class whites to lose focus on real reform that would benefit everyone.  So instead of saying why can’t poor people afford justice they have their attention shifted on the crimes committed by POC and the need for more cops and harsh penalties and whatnot. Instead of saying we need better pay, better health and child care the focus is on welfare deadbeats.  This list goes on.<p>The focus on a large numbers of issues in the U.S. is about race rather than about class.  News media and whatnot fuel this because fear sells.  It’s gets more viewers to talk about out of control black kids terrorizing whites than it is to talk about school reform, prison reform, culture reform, etc.')
