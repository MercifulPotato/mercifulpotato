It&#x27;s easier to protect against carnivores than to build a cost-effective carnivore. You need to pay 2 cards to have species that can eat another species (one for Carnivore trait, one more for +1 size), but only 1 card to negate it with size increase. In my experience buidling a carnivore involves walking a thin line. It&#x27;s quite easy for other players to counter you and your animal will go completely extinct. In natural world animals can still prey on eggs, juvenile or sick individuals. Evolution is a bit binary.')
