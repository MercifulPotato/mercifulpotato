This is a little better than Chromebooks and a little worse than Apple computers.<p>My iPhone 5s received a system software update a few days ago. I was not expecting support for iOS 12.<p>&gt; Before Windows 10, Microsoft usually supported each version of Windows for about three to five years.<p>Fact is that Windows lasts a really long time. While I realize that corporate support contracts are a different world, Windows XP lasted forever.<p>Is 3 to 5 years of updates a reasonable expectation? What do people expect from (for example) Wal Mart laptops?')
