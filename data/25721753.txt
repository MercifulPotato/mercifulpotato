Even if these these businesses &quot;conspired&quot; to do this, that&#x27;s still not a conspiracy in a legal sense, which is about an agreement to commit an actual crime.  As it&#x27;s not a crime to end business relationships with an entity (which btw almost certainly has been in violation of TOS), no amount of prior coordination would make this a conspiracy.  It&#x27;s not illegal to conspire to do something that&#x27;s otherwise perfectly legal.')
