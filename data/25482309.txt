Spain, France, and Italy have all done badly, but Germany and Portugal have <i>much</i> better outcomes than the UK.<p>The point about test and trace plus limited lockdowns is that you can play whack-a-mole with clusters, which does a far better job of preventing transmission than anything short of a vaccine.<p>Countries with aggressive test and trace and compulsory self-isolation have done best of all - and with limited economic damage.<p>None of this should be rocket science, but apparently it&#x27;s not a priority for the UK government which has <i>literally</i> used a deadly pandemic as an excuse to hand out billions of pounds of public cash to mates, cronies, and party donors. With no expectation of any effective service provision in return.<p><i>Literally.</i> That is not exaggeration in any way.
