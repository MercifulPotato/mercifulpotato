Even though the fuel is cheap, you are (in a financial sense) &#x27;burning&#x27; the reactor, which is expensive and must be bought up front.  We don&#x27;t know for sure how it will work out, but none of the predictions I&#x27;ve seen show fusion producing dramatically lower cost of electricity.')
