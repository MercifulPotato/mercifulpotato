You probably didn&#x27;t worry too much about it, because it didn&#x27;t cost you anything. You didn&#x27;t treat it that carefully.<p>Compare that to something you bought for yourself, that you had to work hard for. You probably took a lot of care for it. You probably really paid attention to ensure it didn&#x27;t break.<p>I feel like this is the mentality difference. Something free = no value = we can treat it badly. Something not free = it has value = we are more careful with it.<p>The nicest customers I have for my Saas product are also the ones who have the largest accounts. The ones that pay $15 a month for a single user on the cheapest account are always the ones asking for a list of like 50 new features to be implemented yesterday or &quot;the product just isn&#x27;t gonna work for us&quot;.
