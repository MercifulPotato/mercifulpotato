The same consistency that means they aren&#x27;t vulnerable to as much random variation as a human driver could also become a weakness. Yes, a drunk or some idiot on their phone or an unwitting patsy whose drink was spiked at the bar can cause a fatal crash. But they can&#x27;t simultaneously cause 500,000 fatal crashes by doing the exact same stupid thing 500,000 times at once or by being the victim of the exact same crime 500,000 times at once.')
