We had free speech but we weren&#x27;t prepared for unedited, viral free speech. We weren&#x27;t prepared for cameras in every ordinary person&#x27;s hands. We also weren&#x27;t prepared for our free speech to be archived and searchable forever.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to blame the symptoms of social media for the issues we have. But the internet, video quality bandwidth, smartphones, and social media together have combined to dramatically change who publishes and who finds it over the last 10-15 years.<p>In my mind, it is going to take us time to adapt, maybe a couple generations. Things will be difficult during that time but I hope we don&#x27;t make regressive changes in our values based on what is fundamentally (in my opinion) an issue adapting our approach to free speech to the rapid advancement of publishing technology.<p>EDIT: &quot;most people are not equipped to understand what is reasonable&quot; -&gt; This is the kind of dramatic conclusion I don&#x27;t think we should be drawing.')
