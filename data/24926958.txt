I was bullied a lot as a kid.<p>It is sad what happened to you, and&#x2F;but these are two different things.<p>Bullying is being applied but a mindless person&#x2F;group who don&#x27;t understand what-is-what and are just being mean because they don&#x27;t know better&#x2F;they haven&#x27;t been taught better. Kinda like a kid acting like an ass, just because its parents&#x2F;teachers never taught them better.<p>Criticism is a process applied by people with knowledge on the matter that are trying to improve you&#x2F;something (like a parent who will criticize&#x2F;assess&#x2F;judge the actions of their kids to make them become better&#x2F;greater humans)(great in the meaning of greatness&#x2F;richness&#x2F;betterment, not Alexander the &#x27;Great&#x27;).')
