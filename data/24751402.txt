(abreviations can definitively be overdone though)<p>I agree that code should strive to require little context to understand, but there is a trade-off. In some sense: if the name encodes the <i></i>whole<i></i> context there&#x27;s no need for the name in the first place:<p><pre><code>     function area(widthOfBox, heightOfBox) { return widthOfBox * heightOfBox; }\n\n     widthOfBox_times_heightOfBox = area(widthOfBox, heightOfBox)\n</code></pre>\nI began to write the above as a volume function of the box we&#x27;ve been talking about, but realized I don&#x27;t really know what kind of box it is. Then I realized it might be a 2d box, not a 3d box? But then the names doesn&#x27;t really makes sense? (I guess measurementOfBottomFrontSideOfBox, etc. was omitted for brevity)<p>So even this crucial information is missing from the names and require context. Which isn&#x27;t necessarily that bad, since in any real scenario it would likely be included in the minimum-viable-context.')
