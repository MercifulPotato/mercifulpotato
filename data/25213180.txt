It&#x27;s like a cavemen saying &quot;Yep, we are done. We made fire ourselves, what else could there possibly be?&quot;<p>I mean we did a whole 200 years of scientific research. Of course, there is little else to discover. Humans are smart after all.<p>There are only a &quot;few&quot; obvious questions left:<p>* Can we generate a black-hole? If so how? If not, where is the proof?<p>* Can we move faster than light? If so how? If not, where is the proof?<p>* Are wormholes real? If so how? If not, where is the proof?<p>* Can we travel backwards in time and if so, how do we do it?<p>* Where did the universe come from?<p>* What is outside of the universe? I.e. where does it expand into?<p>* Are there other universes? Where is the evidence? Can we build a machine to go there? How do we build this machine?<p>* Can we prevent the sun from dying?<p>* Or let&#x27;s start with the basics. How can we predict the weather of tomorrow <i>reliably</i>? How can we prevent our earth from becoming uninhabitable?<p>* Is the silicon really the best we can do for computers?<p>But sure, we are done with physics. Let&#x27;s just bathe in our glory and praise ourselves as gods lol.<p>Humans are experts at forgetting that &quot;Mathematics does not proof anything outside of mathematics&quot;. All we have are models. Are we at the end of our models? Perhaps? But all that means is that we need better models and perhaps even different mathematics.')
