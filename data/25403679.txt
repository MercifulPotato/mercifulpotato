It&#x27;s pretty easy to construct test examples, &quot;Bob Smith must pay 2x tax&quot;, or &quot;Black people can&#x27;t do X&quot;.<p>The supreme court doesn&#x27;t make a law unconstitutional. It already was or wasn&#x27;t. They provide notice to the system that the law will now be seen as unconstitutional or not.<p>If they get it wrong (lets say we know because another SC overrules them in the future) it doesn&#x27;t change the constitutionality of the law, just whether it&#x27;s enforceable or not during those periods.')
