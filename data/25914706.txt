This helps in cases where demand is greater than supply.<p>The entire system is automated - the required time frames are so quick that you don&#x27;t have time for humans to be involved. By the time we&#x27;re aware that an event has occurred, we&#x27;ve already reduced demand on the grid.<p>Handling high frequency events where supply is greater than demand is tricker. Sites that have long running generation can be instructed to shut down their generation, but large-scale batteries are probably the best solution in these cases. They can be switched quickly to start charging (if they have spare capacity).<p>As you&#x27;ve identified, one potential issue is that you can end up over-responding to the event and move from a low frequency event to a high frequency event.<p>The way we do in in Ireland is that our response is proportional to the frequency nadir. Not everything is tripped off at the same time.<p>As other posters have noted, the actual frequency deviations that occurred are not that big. 49.7 Hz is not that low compared to normal grid frequency. In fact, some of our systems wouldn&#x27;t even activate at this level. They would see it, but wouldn&#x27;t trip off any loads.')
