We just come to not expect it, but that doesn&#x27;t make consumer vs server something that inherently justifies &quot;more difficult to setup&quot;.<p>Second, because the &quot;spend 1 hour to add an account on an iPad (and during an outtage at that)&quot; is far from the common behavior of the iPad, to be representative of some inherent issue with it.<p>So, it&#x27;s more like &quot;I had a quite unlikely and unrepresentative experience with an iPad and it put me off from such devices, whereas I tolerate the same far more often from servers and desktop machines and don&#x27;t think twice about it&quot;.<p>Which, put that way, is much less potent than &quot;that damned iPad and Apple&#x27;s walled garden wasted 1 hour of my life, I&#x27;m never going back to those&quot;, isn&#x27;t it?')
