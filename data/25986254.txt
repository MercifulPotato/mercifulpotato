I got discouraged as I didn’t have the time&#x2F;resources to work on it further&#x2F;make more content for it&#x2F;other products came out like Microsoft Soundscape etc that I thought were basically similar in some ways... Essentially it was spatial audio coupled with common game engine audio functionality and location&#x2F;orientation tracking... I’d be very happy if anyone out there could find a use for it&#x2F;was interested. I thought about uploading it to GitHub&#x2F;sim., but being an audio designer&#x2F;musician primarily I was a bit hesitant about the quality of my efforts... did work though when tested at the time...')
