If you were making 200k in SF (for many, that is low), that is a 60k pay cut. If we assume 30k was a &quot;real&quot; adjustment, that is a 30k difference in spendable income. That feels like a demotion.<p>We also know that many large-ticket items in life do not adjust for &quot;cost of living&quot; in the area that you live. College tuition, medical expenses, etc.<p>Over just a couple years that 30k&#x2F;year difference is an entire college education for a child.')
