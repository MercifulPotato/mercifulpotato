It&#x27;s a community.<p>People don&#x27;t want to &quot;switch&quot;. They don&#x27;t want to host software. They don&#x27;t want to register for a bunch of different communities.<p>They just want to click &quot;Join&quot; and build relationships. Or click &quot;Create&quot; to create one. You can&#x27;t just try to solve chat and protocols (IRCv3), you need to solve community.<p>I certainly agree with what you&#x27;re saying. But so far our attempts at decentralized social systems are clearly early on in the experimentation process, to put it the nicest way possible. Open protocols are a great idea, but that is the easy part that we like to fixate on. The hard part is a compelling experience that people will want to use so that you have people to chat with.<p>And so far we&#x27;re still trying to figure out what that solution looks like.')
