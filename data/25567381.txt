Even if it has promise in today&#x27;s marketplace, by the time you get the project completed solar&#x2F;wind will have dropped in price 50% or more.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason that nuclear projects should only be in research for another 10 years. Once the solar&#x2F;wind hockey stick plateaus, then you have a rational target for these other alternative energy projects to pursue.')
