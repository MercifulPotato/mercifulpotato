Item(by='ReactiveJelly', descendants=None, kids=[24884165, 24884102], score=None, time=1603603463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881476, text='&gt; the idea that Git provides what a blockchain does.<p>Because Git is a Merkle DAG and blockchain is a Merkle chain. (I think that&#x27;s the word)<p>So, although it would be ugly, you could store data in Git as a linear series of commits and get the same public or private ledger.<p>&gt; whoever is provisioning the Git repository (most likely us) would also have the ability to change read&#x2F;write permissions<p>But if your clients who don&#x27;t trust you are monitoring the repo, and you do something like a `push --force`, they would see the hashes change.<p>&gt; But we use a public blockchain for a reason.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to guess the reasons:<p>1. If the public ledger is watched by 100 other people, it&#x27;s much harder to roll back an event than if it&#x27;s only watched by a few clients who might not notice if you post an event and then immediately revoke it.<p>2. Since the public ledger gets a lot more traffic, its clock is more accurate. With a private ledger (Like the Git hack) you could still use the latest Bitcoin hash to prove &quot;Commit B is made after Time A&quot;, but the window for &quot;Commit B is made before Time C&quot; is very large.<p>Honestly, my problem with blockchain is just the word &quot;blockchain&quot;. I love public notarized ledgers. But I don&#x27;t want to buy something that&#x27;s riding off the hype of Bitcoin and buzzwords, and I don&#x27;t want to sell that to people.<p>I need an audit log for something at work and I&#x27;m trying to figure out if this is useful. If it is, I would never tell my boss that someone called it blockchain. Non-programmers will think it&#x27;s unbreakable Hollywood magic crypto.')
