But it is very possible you can build an API in your favorite programming language to deal with the bots,  keeping in mind the asynchronous nature of the thing -- your agent is potentially both a server and a client in multiple domains and very similar things might happen if you push the letter &#x27;k&#x27; or if they sent you a message.<p>The chat service cannot really encrypt or sign messages other than via HTTPS in the web browser:  the client is in your physical possession and you can use the debugger and other tools to give up any secrets it contains or just re-write the Javascript to do exactly what you want.<p>If it were a hassle you might &quot;join &#x27;em rather than beat them&quot; by using a real web browser or simulation of a real web browser.<p>There are scripting APIs for Windows &amp; Mac,  and APIs for handicapped accessibility,  a headless Chrome browser that is built to be scripted.')
