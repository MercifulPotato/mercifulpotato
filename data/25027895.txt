There are other ways like having one device hog bandwidth in a slowly modulated fashion, and have the other device pick up on that modulation in streamed data.<p>This isn&#x27;t related to the parent comments and I highly doubt any major apps actually implement this but just pointing out that such a side channel attack is possible.')
