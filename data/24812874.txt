That&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s getting back in to NZ that&#x27;s the issue.<p>There will come a point where lives will be sacrificed in order to get economies going again. It&#x27;s harsh, but true.<p>Has NZ&#x27;s economy escaped unscathed? I&#x27;d imaging that tourism is quite a large part of their GDP; but if I as a tourist have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival there&#x27;s really not much point in visiting NZ at all.<p>Once the rest of the world starts operating again, vaccine or not, NZ will have to follow and relax their isolation. They&#x27;re hoping that by the time that comes there&#x27;ll be a vaccine or better treatments. But there&#x27;s no guarantee of that.
