Truth be told, very few people are capable of much past mimicking and repeating what already exists. ...<p>&gt; No, given the proper &quot;freedom&quot; to be &quot;earnest&quot; you wouldn&#x27;t be the next Picasso or Steve Jobs.<p>There&#x27;s a premise here that unless you are Picasso or Steve Jobs, you have nothing to contribute - and that if you aren&#x27;t changing the world in a significant way, you are mediocre. People change themselves, their families, their communities, their friends and neighbors lives - most of what we get from the world is in those micro, personal interactions. Friends have done infinitely more for me than Jobs or Picasso.<p>There&#x27;s also an assumption that &quot;very few people are capable of much past mimicking and repeating what already exists&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t at all match my experience of people.<p>I find that almost everyone has much to offer, but you need to give them space and confidence to be earnest. You need to listen, and each one has so much to tell - perspectives that open up new worlds. If your attitude is the one you describe, it&#x27;s self-fulfilling.<p>So this should be good news to you. Why is it important to you to advocate for bad news?')
