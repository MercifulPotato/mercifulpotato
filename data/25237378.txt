But only because that&#x27;s the only program around for doing that calculation. As soon as someone else reads a paper on the subject and makes an alternate program for that math, my program is no longer GPL?<p>I don&#x27;t really see the problem.  You are saying that if you change your dependency to a non-GPL program, then you are no longer GPL.  The answer to your question is simply &quot;yes&quot;.<p>We are not talking about patents here, but copyright.  If someone comes up with an alternative implementation with a different license, you are perfectly free to start using it instead, what&#x27;s the issue?')
