Some pictures may loop - but that is because we need to compare some conditions to the same &quot;base&quot; condition (e.g. size asymmetry from a C-Cup breast compared to an A-Cup and a B-Cup breast...so those two pairs are different, but the &quot;base&quot; of a C-Cup appears twice.\nThe study is designed that way so that we are able to cover every important breast condition in one survey.\nI hope that explanation helps - thank you very much again for your support!')
