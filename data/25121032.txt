The SCP wiki is a memetic attentional infohazard designed by [REDACTED] to destabilise and capture the productivity of curious and&#x2F;or creative individuals and channel it towards a currently unknown goal.

Early warning signs of contamination by the SCP wiki include: procrastination with regard to less interesting work; signing up for an account in order to &quot;write a fun log entry&quot; (particularly in respect of SCPs 914 and 682); difficulty sleeping &quot;because you&#x27;re not sure if this should be Euclid or Keter&quot;; referring to the Doctor but qualifying this as &quot;Gears or Kondraki.
