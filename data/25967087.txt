Item(by='kosievdmerwe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611991942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964513, text='&gt; If you&#x27;ve never heard of dynamic programming there&#x27;s absolutely no way you&#x27;re going to come up with that in an hour.<p>Dynamic programming problems are really terrible for interview signal though.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s mostly an aha moment or two trying to realize the relationship between the elements. Not really lots of signal there.<p>Secondly, the code is trivial in 99% of cases. Just set up an initial (likely multidimensional) array, some for loops to iterate in the right order and then apply the formula. Returning the right array element at the end.<p>Also terrible signal, since the initial fizzbuzz question during phone screens or whatever should&#x27;ve caught an inability to code.<p>That said, yeah, the algorithms bit of interviews are the bits that are scary to me, since they&#x27;re the biggest dice rolls. Everything else just has normal levels of unexpected events that you learn to deal with during your job. However, I write proper algorithms once or twice year and, even then, just trivial ones.')
