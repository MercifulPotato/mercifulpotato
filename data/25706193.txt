You know, the government run by a president who directly incited all this &quot;hang mike pence&quot; stuff, right from Twitter itself?<p>While the rioting was happening, the president tweeted &quot;Mike Pence didn&#x27;t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!&quot; And his lawyer tweeted &quot;[Pence] will face execution by firing squad. He is a coward &amp; will sing like a bird &amp; confess ALL.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if those are the people we want making these decisions.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t like any of this. I want to live in a world where we don&#x27;t have to decide between the government and large companies, neither of which I particularly like. But alas, here we are... and currently, Twitter is the one on the side of &quot;not lynching the VP&quot;, so I guess I&#x27;m on their side.')
