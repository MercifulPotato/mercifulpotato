I beg you to reassess yourself. don&#x27;t make people wade through such mudslinging. please. there&#x27;s so few better ideas anywhere, &amp; so much heaped up, so much muck you rake us take through. please don&#x27;t keep doing this horrible negative thing. it&#x27;s so unjust &amp; so brutally harsh.<p>&gt; jsx is a retarded idea because it adds an abstraction over something brutally simple(html).<p>what programming languages do it better?<p>one of reacts greatest boons, it&#x27;s greatest innovations, in my mind, is that it gave up the cargo cult special purpose templating languages that we had for almost two decades assumed we needed. it brought the key sensibility of php to javascript: that there was no need, no gain, by treating html as something special. it should be dealt with in the language, in the code.<p>if you have other places that have done a good job of being ripe for building html directly, without intermediation, as you seem to be a proponent of, let me&#x2F;us know. jax seems intimately closer to me to what you purport to ask for than almost any other language that has come before! your words are a vexing contradiction.<p>&gt; Ok routing library, now make an http request please without involving more dependencies....<p>please stop being TERRIFIED of code. many routing libraries with dependencies aren tiny. stop panicking that there is code. react router v6 for example is 2.9kb. why so afraid bro?<p>this is actually why the web is good. because there are many many many problems, but they are decoupled and a 2kB library builds a wonderful magical consistent &amp; complete happy environment that proposes a good way of tackling the issues. you have to bring some architecture in but anyone can invent that architecture, the web platform is in opinionated (&quot;principle of least power&quot; x10,000,000), and the solutions tend towards tiny.<p>redux is 2kB with dependencies as well.')
