Please see the videos of the poll workers running ballots at the State Farm Arena in Detroit after they kicked out the poll challengers from the room.

Why hasn&#x27;t any of the Dominion Voting Systems &lt;or&gt; Smartmatic executives been willing to comply to subpoenas to testify?<p>3. Why did voting stop on Tuesday night? Historically, vote counting has continued non-stop; even with the Gore-Florida fiasco.<p>That should be sufficient to pique anyone&#x27;s attention that there&#x27;s something funny business happening.')
