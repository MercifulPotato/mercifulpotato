Spending ~$50 on a city car to have it for a day out of the city has made the barrier so high.<p>But having calculated cost of owning a car (parking, insurance, repairs, deprecation, gas etc) I have realized I could do that every weekend all year, and still probably come out ahead. Even if comparing to buying a used car. So here&#x27;s to hoping I will be better at doing it this winter.')
