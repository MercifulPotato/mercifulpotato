They are supposed to be exactly that, [&lt;whitespace&gt;a] and [a&lt;whitespace&gt;]. I assure you, I&#x27;ve encountered many situations, where whitespace at the beginning or the end of the value is actually meaningful for reasons you (creator of the app) have no control over.<p>&gt; Why should JSON never be used for configuration<p>Many reasons, actually, but the most important (IMO) being that original JSON specification doesn&#x27;t support comments, nor most actual parser implementations do. Configuration file that doesn&#x27;t support comments is trash and causes very real inconvenience for users. Using additional key values for comments (even if such atrocity doesn&#x27;t bother you conceptually) isn&#x27;t a solution in many cases (for example, when your intention is to comment out a list item).')
