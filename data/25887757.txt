This is a small window into that I think, and you can see that they&#x27;re likely using internal &#x27;Blaze&#x27; Python rules and rely on the maintenance of compatibility with the open-source Bazel rules. `py_library` is used in `tree&#x2F;BUILD`, but it is not loaded explicitly as is expected with Bazel these days; the rule definition is loaded by Bazel implicitly.')
