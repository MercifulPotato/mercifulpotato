Thus you tend to see that the best unions for workers tend to be in large, established, highly profitable firms with little to no competition. A prime example are the American automakers before the 1980s when foreign competition kicked in. Working on the GM assembly line in 1970 was a <i>very</i> good job.<p>However Amazon is barely profitable as it currently stands. Since there&#x27;s essentially no room for lower profitability. The only give is either higher consumer prices or deadweight loss, i.e. fewer customer and therefore fewer (but higher-paid) employees. That might not necessarily be a bad thing, especially to the extent that the average Amazon customer is wealthier than the average Amazon warehouse worker. But given Amazon&#x27;s extremely thin profit margins, I don&#x27;t really see anyway that consumers won&#x27;t end up paying for the sizable bulk of the unionization costs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;001979399204600110" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;001979399204600...</a>')
