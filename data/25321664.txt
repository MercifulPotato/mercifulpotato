Philosophical training can help them to be more questioning and see their own assumptions where they might be blind to them otherwise.  So this too makes philosophy useful to science (or at least the ideals of science that so many aspire to).<p>Next, philosophy, like math, is useful for training the mind.  You can become a more rigorous thinker by studying philosophy -- this I believe is one reason that people with a philosophy degree are the ones most commonly admitted to law school.<p>Philosophy could also expand your mind or your horizons, and let you see things from another perspective that you otherwise might have been blind to.  That&#x27;s been one of its most valuable uses for me.')
