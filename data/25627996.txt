Goodbye muting, etc because again: filtering the content risks making you a publisher. Goodbye spam filtering, that makes you a publisher.<p>No small company could afford this, so would necessarily remove all comment sections, etc.<p>It&#x27;s questionable whether wikipedia could have any kind of restrictions on what people could say or do in articles.')
