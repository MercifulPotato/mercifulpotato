It&#x27;s a little annoying because OneDrive reads through your Word documents and tells you that you actually can&#x27;t save that file here, because it has some external font or macro inside it. I like that Dropbox and Box don&#x27;t look inside your files and I really hope Microsoft copies that feature soon.')
