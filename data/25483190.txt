I troubleshooted some issues with bounces earlier this year and both users in question were using Migadu - they had ended up with the unusually strict &quot;p=reject&quot; DMARC policy. Every time they sent an email to the list I was on, my account would (correctly) trigger a bounce and after several of these incidents _my_ subscription would be removed from the mailing list for too many bounces. I&#x27;m not even sure whose fault this situation is, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.')
