Item(by='jhgg', descendants=None, kids=[24827281, 24826508], score=None, time=1603115279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825737, text='I&#x27;m sensing a trend in the replies here, which is that this was too low a pay out, perhaps we should have a discussion about what is a worthy payout, because we based this off of what we saw other companies paying out.<p>Our bug bounty page on H1 (invite only currently) lists critical vulnerabilities at $3,000 for a bounty, we decided to up the pay-out to $5,000 for the thorough report on the exploit - even though the vulnerability was not in our code, we paid extra (from our perspective...) because the vulnerability did after all ship in our software.<p>I compared this to similar payouts for RCE&#x27;s, for example, slack paid out $1750 for a similar RCE earlier this year, due to lack of context isolation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerone.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;783877" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerone.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;783877</a>) - although this did get published after we paid bounty - so it did not influence our decision.<p>Clearly there is some discussion to be had about what is fair. For context (which might be missing), this was not a 0-click drive-by RCE, and to exploit involved 4-clicks you had to be sent the embed, (1) click the &quot;play&quot; button to launch the iframe [we never load iframes with 0click], (2) click play within sketch-fab to load the 3d model, (3) click a small &quot;1&quot;, and then (4) click a &quot;+&quot; in the tooltip that pops up in order to trigger the exploit. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has prior art or opinions on what would be a more appropriate bounty?')
