Unfortunately, the people have not only abetted that, but often demanded it; see the recent demands to enshrine extant ISPs as government-chartered monopolies (i.e., utilities) rather than remove the anti-competitive regulations that have fomented high costs and poor service.<p>As for bailouts, there too the people have long been convinced that the government needs to &quot;fix&quot; the market. Unsurprisingly, the means by which these &quot;fixes&quot; occur happens to benefit the ruling class (politicians and corporate executives) and big firms, giving them a competitive advantage over would-be competitors, and thereby growing ever bigger.')
