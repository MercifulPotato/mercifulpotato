I own a 17 year old Volvo XC wagon and a 16 year old Toyota Camry. Volvo I bought 13 years ago from a 96 year old gent who&#x27;s family had taken away the keys. Bought it sight-unseen on Craiglist for $9000. I&#x27;d put it up against any modern SUV for looks and functionality (except smartphone integration). The Toyota was $4500 and had 30K miles.<p>The Volvo heads to the shop on Wednesday. I&#x27;m concerned that I&#x27;m in for an expensive bill from the mechanic (~$1000) for various ailments. Never an easy analysis on a car with a KBB value of like $2500. But on the other hand, I&#x27;m driving a $40K car.<p>Another benefit of second used car is that if friends and family come to visit, they have a car to use.')
