Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25749714], score=None, time=1610467526, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747222, text='Element was a group of ex-consultants and a bunch of AI researchers with no market, no product plan.<p>They were going to do some &#x27;consulting&#x27; type work, and then ostensibly use the results of that to come up with product offers.<p>The obvious fallibility in that is:<p>1) The companies they are working with will not give up their data and allow them to be used in Element Products. No way. In some cases, maybe for a fee, but in most cases it&#x27;s not even viable.<p>2) Making viable products is <i>really hard</i>. You don&#x27;t &#x27;start with AI and then pick a field&#x27;. You need to understand the industry, the channels, develop relationships, develop a brand etc. and have something that&#x27;s really hot.<p>Element eventually launched a handful of bland, generic off-the-shelf style AI products for image recognition and a few other things, each one a little bit interesting but ironically none of them worthy of really being a startup on their own.<p>3) Consultants and Researchers are not Startup types. Of course they can be, but not by default. Definitely some ex-Phds and ex-consultants could launch a great company, but otherwise hiring a bunch of them for big salaries and putting them in a room is not how startups form.<p>They work really hard, they are really smart, but they&#x27;re not generally very good at finding seams and opening new markets.<p>4) Generally the way it&#x27;s done is &#x27;start small&#x27; and when there is &#x27;product market fit&#x27; you scale. So Element didn&#x27;t fit that model. They took on $100&#x27;s of millions before any kind of product-market-fit and ran around in circles burning it.<p>It would have been nicer to start with a team of 10, find resonance, then start to pull in the talent.<p>But in some situations, raising $150M with government and institutional backers is easier than raising from traditional VC directly. Like a big government backed initiative with all the flair, PR, announcements.<p>The CEO of Element was literally on a public Zoom with the PM of Canada recently.<p>That kind of company.')
