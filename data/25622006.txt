Item(by='tpoacher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609684843, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620796, text='I did all my work and wrote my entire biomedical engineering (specifically medical image analysis) thesis on octave.<p>In the beginning I had started with matlab because my lab mostly used matlab functions. Obviously it&#x27;s not that I couldn&#x27;t finish my work on matlab, but I found octave nicer to use, better publication-quality graphs, very friendly open-source community, submitted bugs typically fixed within a couple of days (which was not the case when I submitted bugs in matlab, of which I had reported plenty, particularly when it came to misbehaving graphics), interesting outlooks from studying its source code, ability to keep or distribute my code in the absence of a prohibitive matlab licence, etc.<p>It is probably true that it is not necessarily as quick as matlab or julia these days, however there is a big red flag when one looks at &quot;benchmarks&quot; online, which is typically that these are used in such contrived ways that a proper octave user would probably not consider as good octave code. (I remember this was also true of julia&#x27;s benchmarks against python for instance).<p>Octave in fact is very powerful. Not to mention that to the serious user, much of its power comes from its incredibly powerful interface to its vast library of open-source c++-implemented functions.<p>As for the why octave and not python (or any other X) question ... honestly, I don&#x27;t know. E.g. why Linux and not Windows? Honestly, both are fine. But, without having an explicit list of arguments, I just find linux is more enjoyable and gets out of my way, whereas on windows I find myself having to do extra steps and double-check things at every turn. Well, somehow, I have the same vibe when working on octave vs python or julia. But that&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t enjoy those other languages too. To me it just feels Octave is just ... nicer and gets out of your way somehow. It&#x27;s definitely my language of choice for quickly trying ideas out.')
