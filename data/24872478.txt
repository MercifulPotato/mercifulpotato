The kind of response I was trying to illicit from the parent comment. The parent commentor had one quote and a one word response that did little to expand the discourse here.<p>The scare text you are referring to:<p>&gt; grand solar minimum:\na period during which solar activity diminishes, resulting in drastic climatic and geophysical changes to our planet. These include increased galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), seismic activity, and volcanism; the latter often results in a global reduction in temperatures (see &quot;the year without a summer&quot; -- and much more on the IAF wiki).<p>A piece from NASA(not technically a reputable study as you asked):<p>&gt; But if such a Grand Solar Minimum occurred, how big of an effect might it have? In terms of climate forcing – a factor that could push the climate in a particular direction – solar scientists estimate it would be about -0.1 W&#x2F;m2, the same impact of about three years of current carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration growth.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climate.nasa.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2953&#x2F;there-is-no-impending-mini-ice-age&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climate.nasa.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2953&#x2F;there-is-no-impending-min...</a><p>I think three years of climate forcing offset is a &quot;drastic climatic and geophysical change&quot;. However it would be difficult to link GCRs, seismic activity, and volcanism to it.<p>From the Discord TOS:<p>&gt; The Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
