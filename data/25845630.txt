Comparing Julia to the mess that is eg python environments, this seems loads better. And I think it’s a reasonable state for something where your deps might not be in the language. Maybe specifying things in a more nix-like way would be better but I think it’s pretty good as is and doesn’t pollute your system with random installations')
