As if things just can&#x27;t be that way, there must be a repeatable, reproducible recipe that someone else could follow, and if they did, they would get the same results as Ramanujan.<p>Oh, there is an easy recipe : just emulate the universe as it was back then and observe Ramanujan. As we know, having a recipe doesn’t mean we have the resources to implement it.<p>There are several movies on Ramanujan as well as biographic books. Apart from the tragic path of is life, these material also depict him not only as gifted but as a compulsively working his maths. So that’s no wonder he would even dream about it. And of course, you can model that as the result of unconscious thoughts throwing the result of problems that were fed to the mind during awaken time.<p>So, the magic recipe is practice, practice, and practice even more.<p>&gt; I think maybe because it flies in the face of everyone that claims 10x developers are not possible.<p>On what metrics? The ability to be able to throw impressive &quot;magical&quot; code and being able to work efficiently with the rest of a team will not necessarily come together, for example.<p>&gt;  Or that some people are just genetically gifted and there&#x27;s nothing you could possibly do that would get you within a hundred yards of them no matter how much hard work you put in, or how good your teachers were, etc.<p>“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.” is generally attributed to Oscar Wilde.<p>Every life is genetically gifted, but not all lives encounter the environment that enables to thrives this gift – unfortunately.<p>Also no one is perfect. Many aspect of human life are not only dependent on how performant you are individually, so being really &quot;too ahead&quot; can be actually a severe handicap – at least if it doesn’t come with equal excellence into convincing other to trust you. And so depression is not something you can expect to be out of the realm of gifted evoked here.')
