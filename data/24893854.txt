Sure, laptops are portable, but that&#x27;s all that can be said for them.<p>When you&#x27;ve set up your laptop to be ergonomic to use, it&#x27;s as portable as a desktop, so that one thing it did well, it turns out, it couldn&#x27;t even do that.<p>Laptops are portable, when you REALLY need to be able to compute at some different place than usual.<p>They&#x27;re expensive and even then, still underspecced compared to desktops..<p>My desktop has 20 tib of storage and 64 gib ram, has a 5 ghz cpu and it runs silently most of the time, I can&#x27;t even buy a laptop with those specs, if I could it&#x27;d be super expensive and noisy or frequency throttling.<p>This is unfortunately going away a bit, but I still have many more upgrade options for a desktop. Now everything is USB but with the right adapters, I can still use those weird ISA cards I&#x27;ve got hanging around, I can still read 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot; floppies, and CDs and ZIP. (and yes, the &quot;easy&quot; way to read those disks is using a isa floppy controller on a USB to ISA adapter).<p>Also, I guess I just don&#x27;t need to move around that much, but when I do, I have a second-hand I7 machine with 16 gib memory that runs linux off of an SSD reasonably well, if I need &quot;performance&quot;..\nIf I only need connectivity, I&#x27;m using a this small blue HP StreamBook 11 that I bought for around $200 years ago, it also runs Linux well enough, but it&#x27;s pretty much limited to running a terminal and ssh.')
