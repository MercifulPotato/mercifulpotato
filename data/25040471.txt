I think of Electron chat apps, and how JIRA pages take 15 seconds to load, all the while the UI is glitching and twitching and daring you to click early[0]. And the only reason it&#x27;s allowed to continue is because very large and complicated processes have been built on top of them.<p>[0] (What I want to know is, how do these lazy-load UIs know I&#x27;m about to click before I do?
