Take for example, the New Yorker, which curates short stories and poetry not written by their own authors&#x2F;editors. If they were to publish something inciting violence or otherwise illegal&#x2F;immoral, they can&#x27;t just throw their hands in the air and say &quot;it wasn&#x27;t me!&quot;, legally nor socially.<p>Besides, I&#x27;m talking mostly on a social aspect rather than a legal one. I&#x27;m not a lawyer. But too often do we give Facebook a pass since it doesn&#x27;t make the content, it only curates it. The curation is automated at a massive scale by AIs, and is done for each user, every day, but it is still undeniably curation.<p>An example of a platform is if the user does their own curation. E.g. old Instagram. You got everything posted by everyone you follow, in chronological order. Now Instagram will change the feed order and time-delay&#x2F;shadowban posts, making it, in my view, a publisher. Your SMS example is a platform since you chose to have your SMS&#x27;s sorted by time.')
