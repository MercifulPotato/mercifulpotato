The actual points are discarded points<p># Linux is more stable and reliable.<p>I&#x27;ve reinstalled Windows so many times, never reinstalled Linux. System is separate from the user, I can remove <i>all</i> user configurations and it would work like new.<p># Linux is more secure and private.<p>I have so many packages, they are free and safe. I&#x27;ve tried Windows recently, have to install software from the web. It is scary.<p>No telemetry by default. I send package statistics, have install it myself:<p><pre><code>    # pacman -S pkgstats\n</code></pre>\n# Linux is faster and less bloated<p>There are many communities, some run Destkop Environments, I run quite minimal setup, boot to graphical environment takes 100MB RAM. Old netbook is router&#x2F;NAS, 1GB is plenty.<p># Linux is more flexible and customizable.<p>Primary reason I&#x27;ve switched. So many options, it is awesome! GNOME, KDE, XFCE, OpenBox, wmii, dwm, xmonad. Entire distributions — Ubuntu, Arch, Nix and many more.<p># Linux gives you more control over your computer.<p>There was liberating feeling — my computer is just a hardware. Never felt it with Windows, it always had its own way. You know, some people kick their computers in rage. That has gone.<p>Linux has a great driver support for supported hardware, it is like complaining about hackintosh. Windows adopting command line and package management tools. Yes, had to stop gaming, that&#x27;s changing with Proton. I find Windows UI atrocious, my desktop for comparison:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sergeykish.com&#x2F;side-by-side-no-decorations.png" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sergeykish.com&#x2F;side-by-side-no-decorations.png</a><p>multiple workspaces, no decorations, not even browser scroll bar. I&#x27;d like to have universal solution for sticky headers.<p>And, maybe, the most valuable — Linux is getting better while Windows and macOS getting worse. Telemetry, advertisement, walled garden, executable restrictions, firewall bypass, proprietary hardware — scandal after scandal. While on the Linux side — AMD GPU, Wayland, Flatpak, Steam Proton, web applications, better than ever laptops support.')
