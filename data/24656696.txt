Anti money laundering laws are basically there to stop people doing things the US doesn&#x27;t like. So if enforcing them means (say) less terrorist attacks GREAT! But the same laws are used much more frequently to try and enforce drug prohibition. That&#x27;s meh at best in my opinion. And occasionally you see the US use them to prevent countries like Iran buying medical supplies in a pandemic. That&#x27;s pretty shitty.<p>I&#x27;d give the US more points for enforcement (which you are correct is strongly pursued) if I thought the laws being enforced were less self serving in the first place...')
