The media has always censored information that can&#x27;t be verified.<p>If that was the case, we wouldn&#x27;t have been involved in any wars in the past few decades.<p>&gt; Nytimes doesn&#x27;t publish articles about flat earth theory.<p>Of course not because lies about &quot;flat earth&quot; doesn&#x27;t serve their interests. But lies&#x2F;propaganda about &quot;incubator babies&quot;&#x2F;nayirah testimony and yellowcake to start wars serves their interests.<p>Tons of unverified nonsense gets published. And tons of truth gets censored. Media, like the nytimes, are in the business of propaganda. They exist to sell wars and benefit the elite, not to peddle nonsense like &quot;flat earth theory&quot;.<p>If a topic is important (nationally&#x2F;geopolitically) and it&#x27;s in a newspaper, you can be sure it&#x27;s pretty much nonsense. The more respected the news agency, the more likely it is a lie.')
