I can bet that all the hosting providers have more algorithm based lock of account than gmail has. I have myself been locked out of digitalocean once and the support won&#x27;t tell me the reason. I know one other person at least who has been locked out of AWS. Almost everyone I know uses Google account and I don&#x27;t know anyone who has been locked out.<p>So I think unless you own all the data in a server you physically control(not feasible for most), you are more safe with Google than hosting it with another provider. Also Google&#x27;s server is more secure than you can ever achieve.')
