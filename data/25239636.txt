If Kinesis&#x27; frontend does too, then it&#x27;s surprising that the threads created by a frontend service would exceed the OS limit. This tells three possibilities: 1. Kinesis did not impose a max thread count in their app, which is a gross omission; 2. Or there was a resource leak in their code. 3. Each of their frontend instances stored all the placement information of backend servers, which means their frontend was not scalable by backend size.')
