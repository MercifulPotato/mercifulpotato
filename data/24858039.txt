It is a false argument to say that if I didn&#x27;t pay tax things could be cheaper eg. if I break the law I can get a cheaper iPhone.<p>Getting caught for breaking the law is a stochastic system, but the expected value is lower than most people think.<p>Edit: How far are people willing to take this? Should we share an article saying someone got a free iPhone by buying a machine gun and stealing a truck full of iPhones? Where is the efficient frontier of breaking the law vs cheaper goods?')
