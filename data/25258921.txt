At least the rule of law is followed to a much higher degree in Indonesia (except for Aceh).<p>And is the Dutch-Roman system a perfect legal system to be followed by their former subjects? Sometimes the folks on this site are laughable. Those provisions exist because the rules of that period, and of the former colonial power are barely applicable in any part. In fact, India and Singapore are some countries that still suffer from the imposition of outdated British laws under an &quot;Anglo-Roman&quot; legal system (eg: the sedition laws which can be used to silence any opposition). Colonial laws were very different from the laws imposed in the home countries. And very discriminatory too. Of course, if they&#x27;re going to directly port the legal system (to maintain a semblance of order during transition), they might also incorporate caveats so that BS laws can be revised.')
