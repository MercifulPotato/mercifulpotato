I recently switched back to Windows after deciding I wanted to play around with VR development (and honestly, get back into gaming) and was horrified to see a notice telling me my computer was going to reboot itself in one minute, with no way to abort.<p>I was right in the middle of something, and my first instinct was to Google how to stop the damn reboot. Of course, my computer was already rebooting by then.<p>I now know to turn on the setting to postpone updates for a month. But wow, I can&#x27;t believe such unbelievably hostile UX is the out of the box experience.<p>(Also, side note, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how robust and hassle free the Windows experience has otherwise become. I may even prefer this laptop to my MacBook, which I never thought I&#x27;d find myself thinking in a million years.)')
