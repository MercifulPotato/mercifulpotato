One of the great things about Latex (or raw tex) is that you can simply type it into a buffer.  No need to mouse around to select text or anything like that.  Hard to find anything really more usable than that.<p>Back in 1984 I wrote a small WYSIWYG editor at PARC that outputted primitive LaTex. Fortunately LaTeX was quite early stage and that little project went nowhere.  But one of the lessons was that semantic markup was much easier to do by just typing rather than trying to infer it context, while -driven changes meant people usually just changed font and size and erased the semantic anyway.  This has been borne out by Word.<p>Edit: added bit starting “But one of...” to explain my comment')
