Item(by='BIackSwan', descendants=None, kids=[24799550], score=None, time=1602842924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799189, text='Thanks for your reply.<p>1. The cost for a setup and maintenance is $2M for an entire Tier 1 city in India - that&#x27;s peanuts compared to the revenue you will generate if the general public starts using the network and pays for it. You can self fund this to a large scale.<p>2. Wifi Dabba as an entity controls this infrastructure and that entity also controls the software that powers the infrastructure. The PoP is not an independent entity working in a decentralized matter. If the Indian govt says Wifi Dabba as an entity has to shut down - it can easily do so without any problems and the network goes down with it. So its hard to agree that this solution is truly decentralized.<p>3. There was some weird calculation error on $13.2M figure. I fixed it - sorry about that.<p>4. That I understand, but my question isn&#x27;t about the legitimacy of the fundraise.<p>Apart from point #2 - my original question is not addressed.<p>Have you explored and ruled out traditional forms of financial instruments? If yes - why? \nIf not - why not do that first for 1 or 2 cities and then the model can be flipped into public retail investment&#x2F;franchise model at a later point once you prove a successful rollout on a city scale.')
