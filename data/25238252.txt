We had stocked up what seemed like a lot of food, but after 3 weeks it started to feel really tight. Online grocery delivery wasn’t handling the load, so we just had to wait. In retrospect, our neighbors would have helped — but this was the early days of Covid and we felt like pushing through was the way to go.<p>Eventually the online grocery systems adapted - just in time for us. But it made me rethink our pantry. As a fan of Marie Kondo, we don’t have a lot of clutter in our home — and we had applied that level of minimalism to our food as well. But given we live in earthquake country, having an extended supply of food on hand isn’t hoarding — it’s a responsible thing to do.<p>It made me think about resiliency — how a resilient society stems from the household. A family that can get through a few weeks of a disaster on their own helps spare resources for more dire cases.<p>It also made me think about my grandparents’ basement. It was full of mason jars like the ones described in the article. They had tons of food down there — olives, pasta, beans, etc — much of which was grown in their garden. Like so many WWII era families, they had a victory garden — one they kept over the years.<p>At the end of the day, I feel a deeper connection with my grandparents’ generation than my own parents’. They lived through a depression, conflict — they had a stronger sense of how precarious society can be. My parents maybe experienced some of that — but they also lived through a boom time where American optimism knew no bounds.<p>Anyway, makes sense people are buying mason jars. Some things are timeless. The demand will fade, but some of us will hold onto this year for the rest of our lives.')
