I usually find I can understand a map quicker than a loop, because a map requires that the code be simpler in most cases.<p>Obviously in the trivial case though a loop is very easy to understand. The trivial case usually, in my experience, involves iterating through the entirety of an array though anyway, in which case the map is usually more concise.<p>YMMV! :)')
