I see Fukushima as an example of being curiously diligent in one area, and negligent in another, perhaps because rather than have a &quot;culture&quot; of safety it was simply legislation driven, such that standards dropped as soon as there was a gap&#x2F;oversight in the legislation. To clarify - as safe as the plant was, it was not in a safe chosen location. Concerns were raised, and ignored. legislation covered the building and operation of the plant, not diligence in planning its location.<p>security is somewhat weakest-link - it doesn&#x27;t matter if your doors are metal with strong locks if there are large windows without bars. Fukushima was always unsafe, just conditional on a relatively rare event - by the same measure the unstable warehouse cargo that exploded in Beirut was always unsafe, even if it existed for nearly 7 years.')
