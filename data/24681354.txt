I know there&#x27;s some appeal in some of the integration and multi-room features, but there are plenty of platforms offering those features in a wired format with far more flexibility and choice.  I feel like even if I had an infinite budget, something like Sonos doesn&#x27;t feel like a great solution.<p>The higher-end you&#x27;re going on audio, the more static things become.  Yeah, you might take your iPhone dock or Bluetooth speaker and move it around, but if you spend $1000 on speakers (or 10k on building a listening room), you&#x27;re gonna want the speakers in the sweet spot and left there.  If I&#x27;m working with that constraints, why is having a wireless smart speaker I have to tether to a phone or hub any better than if I had just ran speaker wire to a receiver?  Especially since it still has to be wired for power.<p>At least I know my amplifier isn&#x27;t spying on me or monetizing my endless appetite for Rise Against. Because it was built in 1980 but still sounds as good as anything in the same price class today.')
