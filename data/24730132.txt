The perspective is different and the colors are wrong.<p>It is even less real after it went through lossy compression. The whole point of a lossy compression is to remove details that you perceive as unimportant. For example, leaves on a tree may look like a greeny mess, but that&#x27;s fine, from afar, you don&#x27;t make a difference.<p>Using neural networks for compression is far from being a new concept, and the result is not more or less real than any other technique. It is just that Nvidia implementation is really good at keeping the most important details in a small size.<p>If you want a more &quot;real&quot; image, you can just use the AI as a predictor and use the remaining bits to encode the difference, like in a traditional MPEG-style codec.')
