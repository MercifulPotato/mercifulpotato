The Haskell version is <i>much</i> more constrained, though: it only maps between Haskell types, and it’s parametric (iow completely generic), not just any old mapping.<p>While in C++, a functor is a <i>completely</i> different thing: an object that can be called like a function. It’s thus equivalent to a closure, where the object fields are the captured values. And that sounds like the description being used here.')
