It&#x27;s already been demonstrated that this stuff can topple countries, and I see no reason why the U.S. would be an exception. Acknowledge these platforms for what they are: information weapons. The management at these corporations cannot compete with nation-state level adversaries intent on waging an information war and that is clearly what we have been up against for at least the last two years. Someone is screwing with the U.S., and they&#x27;re using social media to do it.')
