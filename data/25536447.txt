Modern AAA games have terabytes of assets. p4 has handled this. git, has not. p4 also manages the fact that unlike source code you often can&#x27;t merge certain assets so you need networked access controls (as in A can&#x27;t edit this now because B is edit it).<p>Note I love git, but I don&#x27;t know any big game studios using it. Some indies get by because their games are smaller but even then it can be a pain.')
