No. I said it looks like someone who just got a new tool fucking around with it, and that it looks much like what <i>everyone</i> who just got a copy of Deluxe Paint 2 tended to create. You make some patterns, you pick up some chunks of art and drag them around as brushes, you do some perspective fills. All this needs is some color cycling and it’s hit all the cliches of “I just got Deluxe Paint”.<p>And thanks for trying to turn this into a personal argument by dissing my own work. Very classy. I’d think someone swiping the name of a dead Expressionist would be all for my animation-influenced distortions or anatomy in the name of expressiveness, but whatever.')
