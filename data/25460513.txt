Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[25461054], score=None, time=1608239659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459054, text='I don&#x27;t think diffs are the &quot;natural&quot; object - if you talk to someone who isn&#x27;t using an automated version control system but still doing revision control, what they have is &quot;Resume 12-1-2020.doc,&quot; &quot;Resume 12-2-2020.doc,&quot; &quot;Resume reviewed by Joe.doc,&quot; &quot;Resume for Contoso final.doc,&quot; &quot;Resume for Contoso final final USE THIS VERSION.doc,&quot; etc.<p>Those are snapshots of individual versions of the files, not diffs.<p>Or think about your favorite wiki (Wikipedia or your corporate wiki) - if you hit the &quot;History&quot; page, what you see is a list of the versions of the page, and then some UI to compare any two given versions. While there&#x27;s a button for computing a diff between any version and the previous, that&#x27;s not what it appears to treat as the natural object.<p>Diffs are an emergent object when you have some mechanism to automatically create them and apply them. (This is generally a programmatic mechanism, but there have long been cases where the mechanism is manual effort - think laws that amend other laws by saying &quot;After section 3 insert... and remove section 5&quot;.) But the ultimate goal is to produce a version of the file.<p>If you want a diff management system, play around with quilt, which treats diffs (patch files) as the first-class object. Just about everyone I know who&#x27;s tried using quilt for more than the tiniest amount of work vastly prefers just importing the applied patches into git and working with them in git. This is largely because quilt is empirically much <i>more</i> leaky - it&#x27;s very sensitive to the current state of your directory, because a diff is a second-class object which requires something to be applied to in order to make sense, and it&#x27;s too easy for the contents of your directory to not quite line up.<p>(Put another way - there&#x27;s a reason we call it &quot;version control&quot; &#x2F; &quot;revision control&quot;. The thing it tracks is versions&#x2F;revisions, which are concrete instances of the file in time. Quilt is a patch management system, and very few people are interested in those.)')
