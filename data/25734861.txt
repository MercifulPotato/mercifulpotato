You have to read between the lines and ignore his history of being anti-riots and go for a bad faith interreption to even consider him having called for what happened.<p>Flipside,<p>How many celebrities were calling for the death of the maga hat kit? They got away with it.<p>Iranian&#x27;s Khamanei has outright called for jews to be exterminated. Various other middle eastern leaders have called for gays to be killed. They are outright double standards.<p>Regardless, it was very clear Trump was to be banned. At the end of the day it&#x27;s very interesting how all these tech companies came together to ban not trump but vast array of their supporters. So far the known count for Twitter is &gt;200,000 trump supporters.<p>At all 200,000 inciting violence? Does the USA really have that many people looking to overthrow the government?<p>&gt;They&#x27;re being dropped by AWS, Apple, Google etc because they allow, even encourages its users to conspire to commit violence and assassinate public officials.<p>So the entire platform is to be removed because of some content. More specifically, if someone wants to destroy a platform, they need only have bots spam comments and therefore the platform goes offline?<p>&gt;The main reasons its users went to Parler in the first place is because they weren&#x27;t allowed to do that on twitter and reddit.<p>No, that&#x27;s not accurate at all. there were millions of users on parler. Many of which weren&#x27;t even american nor care what was going on.<p>This is at best a rationalization for shutting down the platform.')
