Wuhan airport was closed[2], and Chinese <i>did</i> stop all travel out of Wuhan[3]. There are many reports of people escaping the lockdown that night, but it doesn&#x27;t seem this was some Chinese policy - more that events were moving fast.<p>It&#x27;s your country&#x27;s responsibility who enters its borders. The Trump administration moved fairly quickly and closed borders to Wuhan by Feb 2, which was earlier than South Korea (but later than many countries).<p>I don&#x27;t think many would fault that part of the US response, but it isn&#x27;t exactly clear what people think China was hiding in this period - remember this was the time when people were seeing pictures of the lockdown in Wuhan. Countries can make their own judgement about the severity.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;20&#x2F;coronavirus-spreads-to-beijing-as-china-confirms-new-cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;20&#x2F;coronavirus-sp...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Hubei" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.gov.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;chief-medical-officers-update-on-novel-coronavirus-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.gov.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;chief-medical-officers-update...</a>')
