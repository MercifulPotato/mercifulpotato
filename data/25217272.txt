Item(by='mnl', descendants=None, kids=[25217312], score=None, time=1606370088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208491, text='The fact that we already know an awful lot of Physics doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re any closer to even think about it. A few broad examples not in Applied Physics next:<p>We don&#x27;t have a working and then fully boring computationally detailed theory of quantum gravity. We have candidates for BSM physics and BSM facts such as neutrino masses but we don&#x27;t have a BSM SM. We have a 120 orders of magnitude problem with the cosmological constant. We don&#x27;t know what this stuff that we call dark matter which shows up pretty much everywhere is. We don&#x27;t have an actual mechanism for inflation. We don&#x27;t even have hope for maths department rigorous QFT any time soon.<p>And then there&#x27;s stuff like nuclear physics which is dark and full of models even when you know it&#x27;s all somehow QCD, whose confinement problem isn&#x27;t solved yet.<p>But then apparently people preach on the Internets that philosophical interpretations of QM are the real problems and some other people preach to their choir that spending money on actual experiments by actual particle physicists asking to do them for getting data that would help is a scientific waste unless you afterwards match somebody else&#x27;s theory paper published beforehand.<p>I would happily contemplate the end of musing about the future of fundamental Physics so we all could focus on the meat and potatoes of Physics, which is maybe a less fun and a bit more technical endeavour but also surely a more productive one.')
