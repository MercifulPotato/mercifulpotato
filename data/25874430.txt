We tend to keep things. And I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the value proposition  of even that early-adopter tech. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more to EV ownership than just range and battery life. Ten years later, I can hardly wait for our next vehicle that we&#x27;ll drive the wheels off of...and it <i>will</i> be electric.<p>EDIT: and if you can get the oil pan off a modern car without removing the engine or at least undoing the mounts and $STUFF so it can be jacked up (thereby cancelling any &quot;in an afternoon&quot; of changing crank bearings), you&#x27;re a better mechanic than I ever was (and I used to do it for a living).')
