Yes, the debt could be eliminated and replaced with constant money printing, but this would eliminate that important market signal.<p>By pinning rates low as the Fed has done, that signal has been disrupted, and that is probably why we&#x27;ve seen repeated financial bubbles and panics. Also, it runs the risk of money being diverted to projects that only make sense because the risk-free rate of return is so low that extremely risky ventures seem &quot;worth it.&quot;')
