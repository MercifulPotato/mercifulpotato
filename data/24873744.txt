I have gone through years of formal ear training, the closest techniques I&#x27;ve seen to true perfect pitch were exercises for audio engineers to recognize frequency ranges (iirc, pioneered at University of Michigan a few decades ago). But even that doesn&#x27;t give you perfect pitch, it gives you a strong intuition.<p>In conservatories and other classical schools, they teach relative pitch recognition using the same techniques that have been used for centuries because pitch is so subjective. When I did it, they even used different keys to force the kids with perfect pitch and synesthesia (they gravitate towards music schools) to learn their intervals.')
