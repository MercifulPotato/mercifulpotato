This article being about “how to not be a follower” in itself is at odds with that, and as such it entices heavy scrutinizing from the audience.<p>In a way, it’s incredibly difficult to establish whether or not this article is conforming to existing ideas or not, when there’s such a large group of people that typically agrees with pg’s thinking. This in itself may trigger a southpark-esque response, “I’m such a non-conformist I’m not conforming to you non-conformists!”')
