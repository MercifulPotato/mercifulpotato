The team applies high-throughput selection and screening to engineer recombinant viruses that enable more efficient and selective gene transfer to defined cell types in the CNS. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to develop treatments for psychiatric disorders by supporting hypothesis testing in a variety of model systems.<p>Additionally, we are developing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidcg.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidcg.org</a>, a platform for analyzing mutations in emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains in a location and date-specific manner. Tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will be crucial in developing&#x2F;adapting diagnostics, evaluating policy interventions through tracking the spread of specific SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and monitoring the effectiveness of vaccines&#x2F;therapeutics as they are implemented over the next few years.<p>We are looking for a software engineer (entry-level ok) with high attention to detail and a passion for developing tools to aid with the current COVID-19 pandemic and to advance gene therapy development. This position will be adding features to the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidcg.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidcg.org</a> application, as well as developing internal tooling to process, analyze, and visualize sequencing data from over 100 million virus variants.<p>Experience with web development, React, and python data science libraries (pandas, numpy, etc) is ideal but not required. Biology experience is preferred, but not required. We are an interdisciplinary team of biologists and computational scientists, and aim to grow our trainees to find future success in the field of computational biology.<p>Please contact vector-engineering@broadinstitute.org with a cover letter and resume, or ask me questions directly at chena@broadinstitute.org')
