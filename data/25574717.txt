It&#x27;s a good idea even if they have been vaccinated until community spread is way down.<p>&gt; secondly there&#x27;s no evidence the vaccine will stop that type of transmission.<p>Why do you say that?  The vaccine should trigger a strong immune response which should keep most people from getting infected.  That&#x27;s my assumption anyways.<p>Seems like the multi-prong approach here is the most helpful anyways. Vaccine + testing + masks to eliminate spread as much as possible in vulnerable communities.')
