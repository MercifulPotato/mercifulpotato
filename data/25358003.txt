Instead of creating the right environment to get a chain reaction started if your control rods end up in the wrong place. Drop the magnet field and it all collapses.<p>Even if you lose control of it with the magnet field on the quantity is limited, tokamaks can only sustain bursts before going unstable. Wendelstein like designs would also be limited by the quantity contained.<p>If everything goes completely wrong you simply end up with a dirty bomb from the neutron bombarded core material and an initial burst of radiation. Sure not amazing but not a meltdown releasing vast quantities of heavy radioactive decay materials which can leach into the environment. Remember, fission is messy, it&#x27;s not a chemical reaction where A+B = C. You get a spread of materials and energies, as seen by the Z number here. [0]<p>Essentially, you can at any point do an unsafe abort which might damage something or if everything aligns it&#x27;s no more than a dirty bomb, but you will never lose control. Your Swiss cheese model needs to have far fewer and simpler layers compared to fission, vastly bringing at least those costs down.<p>I&#x27;m still betting on renewables for the near future, but my guess is at least harnessing fusion will have a place for projects with extremely specific goals in the 50-100 year timescale.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;6&#x2F;68&#x2F;ThermalFissionYield.svg&#x2F;2560px-ThermalFissionYield.svg.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;thumb&#x2F;6&#x2F;68&#x2F;Th...</a>')
