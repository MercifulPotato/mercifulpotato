The current prime minister of India, who is a self made in every way possible is not upper caste and the President is a Dalit. They both belong to the ruling Hindu right BJP.<p>The opposition, Congress, which is secular left, has been dominated by Brahmins including the Gandhi family. For all the anti Brahmin nonsense spewed by the Congress, they could have remedied it by the Gandhi&#x27;s stepping aside instead of ruling India for 40 year out of its 70 directly and another 10 by proxy in the 2000. Ironically even the politburo of Indian communist parties are dominated by Brahmins.<p>Just step aside!')
