Item(by='slacka', descendants=None, kids=[25946324], score=None, time=1611852773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936297, text='&gt; the creepy neighbor kid to do something on my guest network that will get me a visit from the cops<p>Think about it. Honestly, what are the odds of that? I&#x27;m sure the last time I got in my car (to get a coffee) it was 100x more risky than that (actually it was snowing, make it 1000x). And so what? They show up, I&#x27;d tell pull open their phones and connect to my network. I did nothing wrong, have at it wasting my tax dollars. After all is said and done in that 1-in-a-million incident, still less of my life wasted with than if I bothered with annoying WiFi passwords over these decades.<p>Your comment reminds me of my friends and family who keep their kids locked up (pre-COVID), depriving them of the opportunity to learn independence that I had growing up. Just like when I was a kid, there is no crime in my neighbor and yet people act like their kid will have a 10% chance of being kidnapped if they let him go to the local convenience store, when in reality the odds are closer to 1 in 100 million. Social media or local news has screwed up our society&#x27;s ability to calculate risk&#x2F;rewards.')
