The we that have dominion are certain genes, for which the humans are mere vehicles. These genes are just as old as the mushroom genes.<p>And this gene cluster is aiming to master the rock that is the Earth through modifying other gene clusters. And you can&#x27;t stop it. Because through modification it grows stronger and more able. And it has rallied the memome and the hologenome to its cause. This cause requires no convincing because only winners get to play the next round. Change is inevitable. Understanding is overrated. Control does not require it.<p>Transformation Theology has subsumed this world. You live in an ether floating in it. You cannot choose the path of no change. No such path exists.')
