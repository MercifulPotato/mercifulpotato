Reading it made me relate 90% to even the small issues (honking, respecting pedestrians on <i>pedestrian crossings</i> and so on).<p>I think it&#x27;s more of a common theme to unequal and impoverished countries where enforcement of law is tenuous at best and people don&#x27;t trust others. If trust collapses everyone only cares about themselves and their loved ones, if bribing a police officer will help your kid to get out of a DUI... So be it, you will be considered an idiot if you don&#x27;t do what the rest of society does, whatever small corruption or abuse that is. Because people know they will get away with it so why hinder yourself for such a thing as moral and values?<p>I know it&#x27;s a very broad generalisation of huge societies, unfortunately it&#x27;s my experience growing up in Brazil and why I can&#x27;t ever live there again.')
