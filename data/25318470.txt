Like the bond market is saturated that seems the opposite of true. This also claims theres been a high inflation but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true either based on any metric.<p>I think the one thing is clear and I agree with is taxes increases capital outflow. But my biggest issue is with the central premise that is taken at face value. That the government needs more money. I don&#x27;t think it does. The US government especially has far to much money and waste most of it.<p>So I&#x27;d say instead of trying to find sneaky ways of taking more of the citizen money maybe incentive it to be use to create more opportunities. Instead of taking from some to give to other incentive opportunities so those who have will willingly give opportunities to those who don&#x27;t')
