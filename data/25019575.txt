The US constitution obviously wasn&#x27;t designed with 300M people and 50 states in-mind, but it&#x27;s larger and more diverse than South Korea, so it probably needs to be governed differently. It&#x27;s like how having states in Singapore would be silly, just at a different scale. I do think what system of elected government makes the most sense for a given country based on size, population density, population concentration, and other factors is actually an interesting question.')
