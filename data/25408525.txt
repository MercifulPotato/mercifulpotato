You might be able to do something with boolean short-circuit operators but it&#x27;s debatable if that that is better than the if statement.<p>In React, if you are using JSX, they don&#x27;t have &quot;if&quot; statements within the markup they just use the boolean short-circuit (&amp;&amp;) operator.<p>For more ML style languages that support pattern matching, it is often easier to express solutions that way than with traditional if statements.  In those situations I would say that &quot;if&quot; is less desirable in terms of expressive power and code readability.<p>Also, &quot;if &#x2F; else&quot; only supports 2 cases, with pattern matching you can have an arbitrary amount of cases.<p>Without pattern matching, expressing more than 2 cases becomes a combination of nested if statements combined with &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and &quot;||&quot; expressions.  This makes it much harder to read and write.')
