They have the product validated, conducted some pilots and are now into the revenue and growth phase.\nThe founders don&#x27;t have enough knowledge&#x2F;experience about software development.\nInitial they hired developers who could create a working system but without any systematic organisation and practises like testing or code reviews.\nI joined a few months back and seen the code-base get uglier day by day and all I have done till now is ask people about technical documentation for every feature&#x2F;fix they code, writing tests and following proper branch structure in git so as to merge the code with a peer review.\nBut nothing such has been happening and I am afraid, we will reach a stage where making changes to existing code will ensue lot of side effects.\nIt is my responsibility now to make sure these processes are setup and followed by all the devs. Given that its a small team of 7-8 devs, it should be easy to enforce these practises but that hasn&#x27;t been the case.\nHow do I go about it? How do I make sure that business execs don&#x27;t pressurise the tech people enough to cut corners and flung the process?\nAs a not so experienced developer, what are other things I should focus on?\nAnd is it possible to implement this without taking a hit to productivity?')
