While communication is somewhat important for juniors, but usually the technical aspects are even more missing. It is when you have technical aspects down when the other aspects start to matter more.<p>Also, juniors are not in political situations where the other  aspects matter all that much. Generally, they find themselves in simply political situations. As long as they are not downright toxic, it is ok.')
