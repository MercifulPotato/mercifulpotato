MacBook failure, car issues, lots of dental re-work, multiple flights cancelled and the airlines are yet to issue a refund, plans had to be postponed and then changed completely, and then a family serious health issue. On hindsight, I think this year was a huge net positive as it let me re-evalute lots of stuff in my life.<p>Now to the good parts.<p>- This was the best year financially. This is also the year I made 0 income but financial assets and trades made me over six-figures in profit. Despite lots of unexpected expenses and losses; I&#x27;m wealthier than ever even adjusting for real inflation.<p>- I setup my own custom-built desktop and got to learn a lot about Linux. I have a fully customizable OS now, and albeit I do miss a few things about OS X; productivity wise, I&#x27;m way more productive. (now planning to buy the new Zen 3 and setting a new powerful desktop).<p>- There is lots of nature around you to discover. When travel was open, you are tempted to try new countries. But my guess is that any country of medium size has lots of places where you can find mind-blowing views. I did lots of biking&#x2F;discovering this year (100-200km near me).<p>- I did significant progress in Rust. I finally got around to modern web development: Github action, CI&#x2F;CD, Terraform&#x2F;Consul, React, Static Sites, etc... I also made significant progress in some projects I&#x27;m working on despite the multiple breakdowns I had this year. Somehow some stuff got done.<p>- I did some writing to my blog, and lots of writing that is yet to get published. I relatively succeeded in having a routine for health, learning and work.<p>Looking for 2021.')
