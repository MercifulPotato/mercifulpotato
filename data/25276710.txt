QA can&#x27;t find all defects without somehow testing every conceivable scenario without knowing every conceivable scenario, and code review can only catch defects if at least one reviewer is able to somehow know that specific methods make an exploit possible. Given that the exact code of underlying methods used may not be known to code reviewers, or that a reviewer might simply not know the full potential use cases for new code at the time of review, it is entirely understandable that defects and resulting exploits happen.<p>This is why researchers like the OP exist. They find exploits and report them to the manufacturer (hopefully) before they can be used. The fact that this is an effective way of protecting us is also why major software companies offer bug&#x2F;exploit bounties to researchers.<p>To demand that all possible exploits of this nature never find their way into production builds is to demand perfection from humans. There is too much to know and think about, and definitely too many unknowns about the future, to make such a fantasy possible while still meeting release deadlines. We software developers often have a hard enough time just meeting feature and documentation deadlines, and adding more people just makes organizing your efforts more complex and difficult which then requires even more people until you reach the point that the scope of organizing your development teams is financially impossible.')
