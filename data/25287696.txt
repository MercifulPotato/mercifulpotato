Are there concrete examples where drugs have been discovered from protein folding structures? What are the biggest ones?\n2. Is there machinery that already exists to take in 3D protein structures and create drugs? or is this yet another issue?\n3. How does folding of a protein in the current state impacting the use of the protein when it is used? Presumably these proteins are similar to polymers where they are not super rigid in all environments, how does the environment effect the protein folding?')
