Anyone who disputes it has their thumb on the scale in one way or another, consciously or unconsciously.<p>Could you elaborate on the actual argument for why this is the case. On the surface it seems like the opposite of what you are claiming can just as easily be true depending on the situation. For example take a widely used utility lib such as lodash or jQuery. In your scenario there are two options:<p>1. Use lodash via a package manager and rely on the lodash team to fix bugs, write tests, and add new useful utilities over time.<p>2. Fork lodash and take on the maintenance burden yourself. You are responsible for keeping up with security vulnerabilities and making patches. You are responsible for writing high quality tests for the parts of your code that diverge for the original.<p>Think about how much ramp up time is required for new hires to become familiar with a company&#x27;s codebase. Why would you ever want to devote that amount of time to maintaining code that for the vast majority of businesses is already &quot;good enough&quot;. For some companies the engineers working on the open source project may even be more competent than the resources available in house. Sure there may be edge cases were performance or security is absolutely paramount, and in those this approach may make sense, but not for the majority of generic CRUD apps.<p>I would have a very tough time trying convince a competent manager that it is beneficial to devote so many man hours to this task rather than to business logic, new app features, etc.')
