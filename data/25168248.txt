Things like Thunderbolt connecting to a docking station with multiple monitors just works out of the box.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s been perfect. The touchpad on this thing isn&#x27;t great. I&#x27;ve had issues with sporadic jumping of the pointer when touching it with two fingers. I replaced the touchpad which did not have any effect. The funny thing is that the problem has been slowing going away over the months. I have never tested it on Windows, so I wouldn&#x27;t know if there is a hardware problem.<p>The reason I was mentioning this is because I wanted to give some credit to Lenovo support. I fully expected them to tell me to test on Windows before replacing the touchpad but they were happy to tell me they supported Linux and me showing the issue in Arch Linux was enough for them to replace it.')
