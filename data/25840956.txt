I do think the EC needs a lot of restructuring but I feel like most of the responses I&#x27;m getting are still reducing it to the dichotomy and applying positions to me that I don&#x27;t hold. All I&#x27;ve stated is that the EC is broken so keeping it as is isn&#x27;t a great solution and I don&#x27;t think going to purely a popular vote is a good solution either. But there&#x27;s a lot in between there and limiting ourselves to only those two solutions is a bit insane.')
