What I can do is persuade people who can do it for me. In many cases, then, my time and effort is best spent on recruiting the folks who are good at explaining to others. In my experience most of these people can smell bullshit coming a mile away, and so if the first &#x27;fact&#x27; out of my mouth is reproachable, I&#x27;ve already put them on the defensive.<p>I often hear, &quot;we should be doing better than second and third world countries, so I&#x27;ll list them too&quot;, that&#x27;s a dangerous gambit. You&#x27;re effectively appealing to nationalism and&#x2F;or racism - we can&#x27;t let &#x27;those people&#x27; beat us. It&#x27;s ugly, and if you have to stoop to that, is it really worth winning? It&#x27;s no good living forever if you can&#x27;t live with yourself.')
