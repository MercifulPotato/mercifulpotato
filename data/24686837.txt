However the last one I signed was quite restricted in that it was for 12 months and only listed 4 direct competitors. Normally the companies lawyer tries for more and your lawyer tells them to get real.<p>If you don&#x27;t sign the agreement I suspect a lot of the time you&#x27;ll just have to do gardening leave for the rest of your contract. Also don&#x27;t forget if you were a director you still have a fiducary duty to the company once you&#x27;ve left.<p>What I&#x27;m slightly unclear about is how practical this is for sales folks where this is an expectation they will steal prospects or existing clients. I suspect you might only bother with lawyers if it looks like they are poaching from your existing clients.<p>In the UK non-competes in my view for engineering staff are basically unenforcable, IP theft is much more likely to succeed (and I&#x27;ve been involved in a direct copyright theft case).<p>24&#x2F;7 IP ownership is enforcable but my experience is that most places don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re not going to be a direct competitor. I always feel it&#x27;s worth getting that in writing  though, my current contract limits this to areas of the companies business. Our corporate lawyer limited this when we had to sign a new contract post a takeover (it was a bit broad and could have covered things like photographs of your kids). Also I have in the past asked if I&#x27;m contributing to open source as part of my work as like things to be clear.<p>IP rights is probably the one area I check in a new contract and usually it&#x27;s fairly easy to get agreement for some minor changes.')
