Even if you crack it, or manage to make a hole in it, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get <i>through</i> it, and certainly difficult to make a hole big enough for a person to fit through.<p>The side windows are made out of tempered glass, also known as safety glass, which when broken shatters into tiny pieces rather than large shards. However, it&#x27;s really difficult to break. Blunt force often won&#x27;t do it: you need quite a lot of force concentrated on a very small area. This is why glass breakers have quite sharp points and are often made of tungsten: it allows the to focus the force so that the glass will break on impact.<p>It&#x27;s possible the officers involved simply didn&#x27;t have anything suitable for breaking the glass, and very likely that the occupants didn&#x27;t.<p>(Which reminds me: I&#x27;ve been meaning to put glass breakers in the door pockets of my car for ages. Must do that.)')
