That could be:<p>* an anime character printed with a thermal receipt printer\n* a 4x6 card with an information graphic I rendered with CSS Grid\n* a shutterfly envelope to family in New England,  etc.<p>most of the time I am starting with an image somebody else made,  but there is a lot of judgement involved with fitting the image to paper and process -- it is a bridge between the world of digital images that I work and play in and the real world.<p>I go through printers the way rock stars go through guitars and what to do with the e-Waste is already part of the product.<p>I am amazed the the HP Officejet 6600 which just failed on me -- despite the expensive ink,  the quality of the work it could do is astonishing.<p>It stopped picking up paper because something (like a little plastic gear) broke in the drive chain for the pick roller.  To be fair all the rollers looked pretty worn -- the printer had been heavily used by a college professor.  It&#x27;s possible we could have fixed it but considering the cost of the next ink refill,  I chose to get another printer.<p>If I were going to salvage the old printer I think I would go for the stepper motors,  which would be great for robotics and other mechatronic projects.<p>---<p>I badly want to hack an inkjet printer to print white ink onto transparencies and then put it into a second printer to take a PNG with alpha like<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:793Nihilego.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:793Nihilego.png</a><p>and make a sticker that could go in a window.  Commercial kits to do this cost about as much as a good DSLR lens and they are a business expense to people who are making large quantities of swag.<p>It&#x27;s a good market case for the &quot;open source 2d printer&quot; however.  It&#x27;s one thing to get white ink compatible with the printer,  it&#x27;s another thing to get the transfer function between  &quot;75% transparent&quot; and a certain amount of ink into the printer&#x27;s brain.')
