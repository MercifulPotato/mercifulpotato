Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605892204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159933, text='&gt; In case of Artificial leather it refers clearly not to lab grown animal skin but to a completely different product that just tries to emulate leather.<p>Because lab-grown animal skin is not on the market (as far as I know), so artificial implies that it&#x27;s fake. If it were, though, and at least roughly as common as fake leather. I&#x27;m sure no-one would try to refer to it as natural. It would still be artificial, and artificial would cease to imply it being fake.<p>If people choose to refer to fake leather as artificial leather, it&#x27;s because artificial, real leather was hardly in the realm of the imaginable. Many would refer to it as impossible or at least as an act against God.<p>&gt; So the word is used in different contexts.<p>What&#x27;s being used in different contexts is the word &quot;leather&quot; to refer to both real and fake leather.<p>&quot;Artificial&quot; is <i>always</i> used to refer to the non-natural, the man-made. I can&#x27;t think of any case where it&#x27;s used differently.')
