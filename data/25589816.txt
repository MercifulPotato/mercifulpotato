AS3 is one of my favorite programming languages I&#x27;ve ever worked with, but Flash wasn&#x27;t just a programming language. The display tree (put simply: game engine) was baked into the runtime, which made it very very easy to make games. The tight coupling between art (movieclips created in Flash the program) and code (AS3 written in FlashDevelop or notepad) made for very fast iteration compared to today&#x27;s highly siloed environments (make art in W. animate in X. export with Y. hand off to developers working in Z).<p>The amount of hoops you have to jump through to run something interactive in Unity is mind-boggling by comparison (without even talking about sharing that thing with another human on another computer). Processing was also pretty good at the first bit, but it wasn&#x27;t as tuned to games and sharing your stuff was pretty awful (java applets).<p>Just because I &lt;3 Flash doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t have security problems, though.  I wish someone had bought the tech off of Adobe and turned it into a gaming platform a-la Steam with proper input support.')
