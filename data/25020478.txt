Don’t forget that Obama’s “blue wall” states are smaller than average and benefit from the EC. And they’re historically quite progressive economically. Obama in fact had a structural EC advantage in 2012: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;did-democrats-get-lucky-in-the-electoral-college&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;did-democrats-get-lucky...</a><p>&gt; In fact, Mr. Obama would probably have won the Electoral College even if the popular vote had slightly favored Mitt Romney.<p>&gt; If all states had shifted toward Mr. Romney by 5.3 percentage points, Mr. Obama would still have won Colorado and therefore the Electoral College — despite losing the national popular vote by 1.5 points.<p>Losing the upper Midwest produces an EC disadvantage for Democrats, but that’s not an impediment to a traditional progressive candidate in the Sanders mold.<p>Moreover, the EC gives an average of a few point advantage one way or the other. It’s not enough for a “much more progressive” candidate. You can see this by looking at the House popular vote, which is proportional (and not affected by gerrymandering). Republicans regularly win the House popular vote: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;chat-blue-wave-1.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;chat-...</a>')
