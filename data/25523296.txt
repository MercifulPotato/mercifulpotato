C is widely accepted as being deeply unsafe language, and C++ has inherited those traits, and is still working on plugging the weaknesses some 35 years later.<p>Of course you can do things like bounds checking manually in C, and run with all sorts of warnings enabled, and you can use static code analyzers that uncover entie classes of bugs, but the whole point is to never get that far in the first place.<p>I worked with Borland&#x27;s Pascal dialect for 10+ years, and it offered a great deal of protections while still allowing you to use unsafe constructs when you needed to get close to the metal (e.g. pointer arithmetic and even embedded assembly code). But &quot;safe by default&quot; solves a lot of problems.')
