He cut me off. &quot;That&#x27;s not the way the world really works anymore,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&#x27;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#x27;re studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we&#x27;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#x27;s how things will sort out. We&#x27;re history&#x27;s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;faith-certainty-...</a>')
