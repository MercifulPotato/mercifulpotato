Taking a trip from Europe to California is a good way to basically double my carbon footprint for the year.<p>Aviation is also fairly unique in that we don&#x27;t know how to make it climate neutral. Even burning synfuel made from renewables won&#x27;t be enough, because adding emissions higher in the atmosphere has a stronger warming effect. And we just don&#x27;t know how to make all-electric long distance planes yet.')
