As I read the PinSketch setup, it looks like it would actually need the full bit size of the set members, so for SHA-256 you need the full 256 bits per set member. So while PinSketch would only need O(symmetric_difference_between_sets), the element size factor is ~25 times larger?<p>And also, in the example from the minisketch readme, it looks A still needs to send the full sketch (not just the symdiff) in the first message, right?<p>In other words, there are a bunch of trade-offs here that might very much depend on your application?')
