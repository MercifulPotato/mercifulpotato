Companies serving nontechnical users should make repudiation the default, because if given the choice most users would prefer it to be the default.<p>In the particular case of Google releasing its DKIM keys, I think I would need more context. What kind of repudiation property do users expect when sending emails over GMail? Is non-repudiability currently used by users for legal or business purposes? Probably the way to do it would be to announce a particular date maybe a year into the future that the private keys would be released.')
