Or are you just expressing outrage and disgust?<p>Because right now, people accused of terrorism can be held in Guantanamo without habeas corpus. They are also subject to inclusion on government &quot;kill lists&quot;[1] with no opportunity for judicial review.  The executive branch is claiming powers it has not had since the time of absolute monarchy.  We should carefully consider any proposal to expand the meaning of the word &quot;terrorism&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m outraged too, but I think these criminals should be afforded full due process rights.  At both the investigatory stage and the trial stage.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;legal-issues&#x2F;us-invokes-state-secrets-privilege-to-block-american-journalists-challenge-to-alleged-spot-on-drone-kill-list&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;15580b88-dee9-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;legal-issues&#x2F;us-invokes...</a>')
