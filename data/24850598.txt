You can agree or disagree with me about whether or not evidence is sufficient, that&#x27;s fine. But you&#x27;re still missing that someone tried to claim that evidence for Not-A was actually somehow evidence for A, which is simply not how anything works.<p>Can A and Not-A both be true? Sure, maybe, it&#x27;s possible. But evidence for Not-A is <i>not</i> therefore magically evidence for A.')
