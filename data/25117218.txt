They spent ages experimenting with various ways of tweaking garbage collection in Java, using different GCs, tweaking settings, etc.  They even spent time experimenting with manual memory allocation, but found that to be extremely painful and somewhat fragile.<p>In the end they found that all they really needed to do was just produce less garbage, which was their ultimate &quot;well duh!&quot; revelation.  They spent time looking at what was actually producing the garbage, and how they could avoid it.  Got rid of a lot of standard coding patterns from their code in favour of new patterns that reduced object allocation, and away went all their problems.')
