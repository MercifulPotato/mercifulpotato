Of course I can try do this in my living room, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the same effect for me personally.<p>I have meetings at awkward hours which kind of makes me feel like I&#x27;m kind of permanently attached to my work. Before hand, there was work time, and home time, work stayed at work, often including my work laptop.')
