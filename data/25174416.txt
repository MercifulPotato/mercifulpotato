Of course I can try do this in my living room, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the same effect for me personally.<p>I have meetings at awkward hours which kind of makes me feel like I&#x27;m kind of permanently attached to my work. Before hand, there was work time, and home time, work stayed at work, often including my work laptop.<p>Also this statement kind of bugged me: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand how someone can work longer hours unwillingly when it&#x27;s entirely in your control.&quot;, if you have a job that allows you to 100% dictate your hours, never having to deal with unexpected problems, outages, personnel issues, then congratulations. It&#x27;s not a reality for everyone.')
