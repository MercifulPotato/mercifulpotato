It&#x27;s  just letting my phone display stuff on my screen, but not running Android.  I could run Maps, play spotify as a I drive, and if I had root on my phone I could also play youtube videos for my kids :)<p>I have to wonder, is having Android in my car going to lead to a situation where I&#x27;m stuck with some old, insecure version of Android, just like my shitty Verizon phone which they never bothered to upgrade from Oreo?  Because if that&#x27;s the case, no thank you.')
