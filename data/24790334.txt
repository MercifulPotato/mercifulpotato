I mean, what would the purpose of that symbolism be, you have to make a nose in any case if you&#x27;re sculpting a statue to give a resting place for a spirit. It makes way more sense that, the mouth being closed, the breath enters and exits the nose. To make the statue uninhabitable by the spirit, you break the nose off. So that&#x27;s the theory put forth by an egyptologist. Everyone in this thread is just offering what they heard somewhere.')
