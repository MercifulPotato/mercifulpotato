You don&#x27;t get back out of jail after that one.<p>But even for the people committing less violence than that, and who in turn eventually get released, they only <i>stay</i> released if they <i>stay</i> non-violent. Otherwise they&#x27;re right back to jail.<p>&gt; I hate to pull a godwin, but &quot;let&#x27;s throw the insurrectionists in jail and that&#x27;s the end of that&quot; hasn&#x27;t worked out well historically. Let&#x27;s just hope none of them writes a book while doing their time.<p>So now we&#x27;re abandoning even the premise of free speech?<p>If people are engaged in violence you put them in jail. If people are non-violently saying dumb things and you don&#x27;t agree with them, you say your thing too.')
