Linus will never accept a radical departure from his own design.<p>We definitely also need new ways to <i>talk</i> about these ideas (or I&#x2F;we just need to learn them!). Object orientation is a philistine way to group concepts that have matrices of complexity. For example, there are distinctly different functions of code that most languages I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t provide a syntactic way to express. How can I explain to someone that this part of the code is one part of an ordered set of operations tied to a variety of states influenced by a variety of functions, while some other code is idempotent and stateless? And can&#x27;t our compilers take advantage of this to connect the pieces for the developer?')
