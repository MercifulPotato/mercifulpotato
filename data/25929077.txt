Software is &quot;always new&quot; but it often shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>I work for an engineering services firm that does mostly embedded systems. I push hard for reuse, basing our work on standard platforms, etc. Unfortunately, client needs vary so much -- one client might need a wearable, another wants a large system that is mounted on a skid, another needs something to sit on a desktop, all with hugely different feature sets -- that it&#x27;s difficult to find a small set of devices that we can reuse. So one of our big problems is that we&#x27;re very often bidding on a project that uses a device, or a technology we&#x27;ve never seen before and that&#x27;s where the uncertainty comes in.<p>Patterns certainly help, higher-level languages would definitely help (I&#x27;m the only one in the organization programming small processors in C++, everyone else is only comfortable with C), but that&#x27;s a slow, risky change.')
