Item(by='finder83', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606352470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212718, text='Anti-abortion person here, this is just my view&#x2F;opinion.<p>Well, my first thought was &quot;this isn&#x27;t no kill, it&#x27;s just chicken abortion&quot;. They&#x27;re still killing chickens regardless. Maybe there&#x27;s someone for whom this makes a difference; I&#x27;m not one of them.<p>But yeah...it&#x27;s not human, and I eat chicken anyway. Religiously I am against human abortion because there is a sanctity in human life that does not apply to animals. In Christianity, humans are made in the image of God, are the only ones who contain a spirit, and are the only ones for whom there is a mandate in the Old Testament that if a human is murdered, then the one who murdered them should be put to death. That&#x27;s not to say that animals are worthless in any way, and animal life is protected in other ways.<p>Purposelessly killing animals bothers me too, in that it&#x27;s wasteful and we should be better stewards of life in general.<p>It feels that this article is rather disingenuous based on the title though.')
