I just saw it as confirmation. Trump by the way did call for people to march to the capitol in language that at least made those idiots feel as if they’d been told to do what they did, and Giuliani was even more explicit with his “trial by combat” comments. I have no way of knowing if they intended it to go that far, but they certainly should not be surprised. If Trump is not a stupid man then he ought to understand the mindset of that bunch.<p>I am also well aware of how words like fascist, communist, etc are just tossed around. In this case I mean it precisely. Steve Bannon’s favorite philosopher is Julius Evola and Trump is surrounded by and beloved by doctrinaire race nationalists and fascists. Neo-Nazis and similar ideologues are almost universal in their fanatical support of him.<p>Fascism is an ideology that has to be fought at all costs, and Greenwald if anything gives cover and support to it. I have never seen him write anything critical of Trump or actual Nazis like Bannon and Steven Miller. Instead he attacks the other side at opportune times, and while I am not overjoyed about the existing Democratic Party they are at least not fascists.<p>By the way I think the same thing about authoritarian communism, but last I checked a Leninist did not occupy the White House and there are no Bolsheviks wearing Stalin apologist shirts storming the capital. If there were I’d be saying communist, not fascist.')
