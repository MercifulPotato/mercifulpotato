Typically a concept like this is explored by a team of 6-10 engineers over the course of 3-6 months, and they may work on multiple projects simultaneously.<p>Even if the project doesn&#x27;t move past the concept phase, there can still be developments along the way that make it into other projects. Further, if a concept is abandoned because it is not technically feasible, identifying that it can&#x27;t be done also identifies the limits of what currently can be done, which is good for determining research goals.<p>The cost of such a project should also be compared to the alternative: it&#x27;s much cheaper to work through a design on paper and finding it&#x27;s a dead end than to commit to something without that evaluation and find out 80% of the way through building it that it&#x27;s a dead end.')
