They have a REST API and you can also receive data over websockets via their polygon.io integration if you have a brokerage account.<p>Tradier lets you trade stocks and options. Tradier option trading is commission free if you have a subscription, otherwise there is a small commission per trade. They have an API for market data over REST API and websockets.<p>TD Ameritrade has an API and tda-api python package makes it easier to use, but not easy to paper trade with it for testing.<p>You can also use an unofficial Robinhood package like robin_stocks, but Robinhood doesn&#x27;t officially support any of this.<p>Interactive Brokers supports the most instruments, including many currencies, futures, etc, but you will pay a small monthly fee for historical and real time data, plus commissions. I recommend the ib_insync package to make their API easier to use.<p>Self promo: I have a YouTube channel that is focused on this topic:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;parttimelarry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;parttimelarry</a>')
