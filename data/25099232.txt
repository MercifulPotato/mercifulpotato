This works absolutely great.<p>For 3D work I use Blender.<p>But for graphical work I agree that there are still alternatives missing.<p>Figma is a very good alternative for Sketch. Scribus is a good alternative for Indesign. Krita is very good for concept art. But that&#x27;s about it.<p>Inscape is a good alternative for Illustrator, but only if you work in RGB.<p>Gimp can do what Photoshop can but it will take you 3 times as long.<p>But for me the trade-offs work. I want to own my computer so I choose to work in Gimp instead of Photoshop. I also started to design websites directly with CSS. And I switched from 3DsMax to Blender (which isn&#x27;t a trade-off anymore).<p>The choice is yours.')
