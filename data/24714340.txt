And you say it works for you! Try to structure your involvement in discussions so you can prepare more. Some suggestions:<p>Anticipate things that will come up in a particular meeting&#x2F;conversation and write your thoughts down beforehand.<p>When you feel really strongly about something in a conversation, don&#x27;t start throwing arguments at the wall. Instead, describe your high-level concerns as succinctly as possible, and ask for an opportunity to get your thoughts together and email or discuss the next day.<p>Pay attention to recurring themes, and write about them, the next time they come up you&#x27;ll have cogent points to make.<p>These won&#x27;t work all the time. I suggest trying to move the needle on a few things you care about.')
