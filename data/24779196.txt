There&#x27;s nowhere else to go there. It&#x27;s very satisfying.<p>It&#x27;s not an incomplete show like, the Santa Clarita Diet, for example (which I&#x27;m still mad at Netflix for cancelling, it was just getting really good and ended on a cliffhanger).<p>If The Good Place was &#x27;cancelled&#x27; (which I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t), they were at least told in advance of the 4th season and were given the full season to finish its story.')
