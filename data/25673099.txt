Now people seem to rely on social media to give them the same experience.  When challenged too much people just pull up stakes to insulate themselves: voat, parler, and private facebook groups are only three recent examples.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if whoever replaces Ajit Pai holds a different view on public intercourse over the airwaves.<p>Edit: Well as some people have pointed out, Fox News would have been exempt from the Fairness Doctrine as a cable network, i.e. it doesn&#x27;t use the public spectrum.<p>As Wikipedia says &quot;The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.&quot;  So my personal view that Fox (among others) is responsible for a) exposing millions to fact-free content without opposing views and b) people got used to that and don&#x27;t like it when it&#x27;s challenged created the bubble we have today. I&#x27;m wrong that the Fairness Doctrine would have prevented Fox, although it might have prevented talk radio.')
