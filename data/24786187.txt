And then if you start sending these versions to others, e.g. expecting feedback, all hell breaks loose.<p>- There is still something about sitting with a stack of papers in your hand&#x2F;on your desk - no digital device involved. Most people can&#x27;t focus on a digital version the same way they do on a physical paper. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the ReMarkable (2), but simply put every (even awesome) attempt so far has failed.<p>Then add to that all the hick-ups that are simply never to leave. Software incompatibilities, sharing tools not working with all devices, walled-gardens, ... the problems are still endless and just get worse with every tool you add.<p>How are you going to print exams for students? Forms for residents to fill out? We are not going to demand of every citizen to fill out everything online at all times, are we? That would leave the most vulnerable even more stranded than they are now.')
