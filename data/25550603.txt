It&#x27;s where a lot of the discussion happens nowadays. If you have any questions about the game, you can just ask in #dominion and there will usually be people willing to help. There are also dedicated strategy discussion channels (e.g. #kingdom-analysis), there&#x27;s a bot through which you can access data about competitive play (with some really neat and detailed stat sheets about individual cards, made by a member of the community), and you can learn by watching high level players play and commentate on their games.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;qdFEjxkgQE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;qdFEjxkgQE</a>')
