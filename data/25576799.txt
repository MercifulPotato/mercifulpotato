[0] I literally followed google maps and rode my motorcycle into the jungle.<p>It started off a reasonable road and quickly became dangerous and then deadly. I rolled down the mountain side with the motorcycle and got very, very lucky that I was only mildly hurt (on top of the brutal sunburn I got on the ride). I ran into the local village (more like hobbled) and the first two people didn&#x27;t believe that anyone could be stupid enough to do that (pantomiming because no one spoke English). I needed to find a teenage boy before anyone thought it plausible.<p>Happy to live to tell the tale, and I certainly won&#x27;t be following maps blindly anymore.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cultofquality.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;on-glory-and-failure&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cultofquality.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;on-glory-and-...</a>')
