There is no such thing as a perfect representation of the world on film: they are compressing the dynamic range and adjusting the color&#x2F;brightness profiles through the film they use, the exposure settings and any added filters on the camera, the development process for the film (chemicals, timing, pushing&#x2F;pulling), the paper for the print (photography) or the film for the positive print (movies), the dodging&#x2F;burning of the print, and others.<p>It&#x27;s not about correcting the image to match what their eyes see, it&#x27;s an artistic and creative act because a photograph&#x2F;movie can never represent what the eyes see, and photographers&#x2F;filmmakers have to interpret the image to get their message across.')
