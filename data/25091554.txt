Xi isn&#x27;t going to know everything that&#x27;s going on.<p>It&#x27;s just seems odd that it&#x27;s a speech (and a relatively benign one from a layman&#x27;s perspective) that set it all off. This was a world record setting IPO and I can&#x27;t see China&#x27;s leadership not knowing about it well in advance considering the international media attention it was getting far before it all blew up.<p>It just feels like there must be a lot more to the story.<p>Was Jack told he could have his IPO as long as he kept his mouth shut?<p>Was there something in the speech that directly contradicted what either Jack was told by leadership?  Or what leadership had been telling the Chinese financial industry?')
