I&#x27;d add the caveat that due to the fact that C is a tiny language with a tiny standard library, most code you&#x27;ll see in the wild uses custom concepts&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;object models on top of C. So for most practical purposes, there isn&#x27;t really &quot;C&quot; as much as there is &quot;unix programming C&quot;, or &quot;embedded C&quot;, or whatever else have you, and all of them add a thick layer on top of the core language.')
