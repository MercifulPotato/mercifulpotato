I&#x27;ve been thinking a bit about following up with that.<p>The generated dataset consists of a few thousand colors. The hue dataset is using 15 different hues only. Some more data there could definitely be useful.<p>I think the biggest problem is that there isn&#x27;t that much experimental data overall, especially for wide gamut colors. The hue data is from experiments with sRGB displays if I remember correctly, and CIECAM I think has mostly been derived based on surface paints, which makes it fairly limited.<p>Comprehensive experiments done using modern calibrated wide gamut displays would be fantastic.<p>Thanks, will have a look at the typos!')
