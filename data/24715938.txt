Imagine earth moving from pay2win to pay2die in the next 5 years once global warming becomes too hard to ignore. &#x27;EA&#x27;<p>Splitting companies will ensue an uncontrollable chain reaction no single government is ready for, sadly the bureaucracy kept in place to have adequate restrictions on the fast moving giants, is also a problem which communism can solve, but leaves a dangerous precedent on the social classes with power to the political elite and leaves room for uncertainty. Let&#x27;s say congress finally gets their shit together and they have this iron clad policy, yay? These monopolies would&#x27;ve run extensive simulations foreseeing these things and begun to course correct by the time govt enforces those policies.<p>Now the important thing here is the constant nudge by the govt with morally&#x2F;ethically aware elected representatives who showcase a level of empathy beyond acting, false promises but rather a part of their moral fiber (they usually get assassinated and replaced) who choose to look beyond &#x27;$&#x27;signs and more at humanity and the environment as an entity to be nurtured, not to be exploited and taken advantage. This is again subjective to one&#x27;s place in the social hierarchy pyramid, but let&#x27;s have this discussion from the bottom rungs of the ladder for dramatic effect.<p>Governments should never give up, not bend to serve these monopolies through lobbying, they should keep fighting always until the end of time, this is like yin-yang, one cannot exist without the other, so there will never be a future where monopolies do not exist and we have a completely decentralized system in place. NOPE they both co-exist and no one thing can become powerful without the other opposing force. For every ton of CO2 offset, someone-somewhere is planning extensive afforestation unbeknownst to  the majority of us and keep this Type 1 Civilization afloat (open for discussion and knowledge)')
