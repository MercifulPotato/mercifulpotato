I&#x27;d argue they were&#x2F;are not even a monopsonist with regard to their suppliers. They might be a strong regional force but they have failed (or chosen) to move out of their regional power position. That&#x27;s not a bad thing and in fact is a strength. I&#x27;m pretty sure they were cited as an example of good strategy for exactly that in &quot;Competition Demistified&quot; but don&#x27;t have the book with me right now.<p>However, in the day and age of modern logistics I&#x27;d argue that their suppliers could have sold to other customers in other states.<p>Ultimately I suppose it depends on how we define a market (ultra regional or wider) and how high the transaction costs (+other extra costs) of the suppliers would be to move to another customer. The classical example in &quot;The Economics of Imperfect Competition&quot; was the labor force in a small town (mining iirc., once again not at my bookshelf). I suppose that would give precedent to the fact that small markets &quot;count&quot;. However most studies on the topic I am aware of are about labor not supply&#x2F;demand structures. And I&#x27;d argue it is &quot;easier&quot; for a supplier to move their wares to another customer than for a (specialized) worker to move to another company (uproot family etc.).<p>Additionally some of the suppliers of Walmart are in pretty strong negotiating positions themselves (Unilever etc.).<p>At least there&#x27;s enough doubt in my mind to say Walmart&#x27;s supplier relations are &quot;a textbook example of a monopsonist&quot;.')
