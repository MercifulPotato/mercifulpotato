Python interpreters are created in other languages like C where memory does need to be described. How can this &#x27;abstract Python machine&#x27; even be implemented? Python or any higher level interpreted language will always have the same limitations of the language it&#x27;s implemented in and like anything we do on modern computers, can be reduced to assembly where again memory has to be &#x27;described&#x27;. Python may hide it for us but it&#x27;s there.')
