But their work, like Ron Mueck&#x27;s still looks cool IRL, it&#x27;s just a different experience without the Uncanny Valley.<p>I&#x27;d like to know if anyone has actually made something that actually is the &quot;Uncanny Valley&quot; in 3 dimensions. I assume it&#x27;s possible, but perhaps not. I&#x27;d be hard to advertise.<p>Perhaps you need to tap the part of the brain that extrapolates from 2 dimensions to 3 to get the horror.')
