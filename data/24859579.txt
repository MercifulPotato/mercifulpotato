They&#x27;re all dead and I can&#x27;t bring myself to order another one, now that I&#x27;m used to li-ion packs in modern cameras. There&#x27;s one German company that makes a compatible li-ion pack but they don&#x27;t sell to the U.S. for some reason.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of blog posts about how to take one of these old battery packs and jerry-rig it to accept a couple of rechargeable li-ion cells. But it looks like a pain--cutting open the old pack with a razor blade, gluing in battery tabs, etc. Maybe 3D printing would offer a better way to do the same thing...')
