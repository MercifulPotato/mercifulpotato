There are fundamentally two families of exclusion strategies that can be used: formal and informal. Formal exclusion is when you exclude bad software through formal constructions, like proof systems. This works great but is expensive. Informal exclusion is when you exclude bad software through social pressure. This works well and is cheap. Any organization that successfully leverages informal exclusion will inevitably be perceived as &quot;toxic&quot; in the modern jargon. If you&#x27;ve been in open source for a while I&#x27;m sure you can think of some examples.')
