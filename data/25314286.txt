However it seems like this assumes 1 commit per feature, which I think is not the conventional wisdom. Am I missing something?<p>For example, the feature is to add a new page to the site where the user can view all their posts. That should break down into several commits: add new route, add parser on frontend, add html structure, etc. But each of those commits would have to start with `feat: add route to fetch user&#x27;s posts` and so on. Wouldn&#x27;t that result in a unhelpfully verbose changelog, when the changelog should really feature one line: &quot;Allow users to view all of their posts in one place&quot;')
