Item(by='jrockway', descendants=None, kids=[25395748, 25395386], score=None, time=1607736048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390352, text='I&#x27;ve used Emacs for over 20 years and I have been meaning to switch to vi keybindings for a while (but haven&#x27;t yet :).  I just find myself executing long commands with only 4 of my fingers engaged, because one of them is holding a modifier key, and it&#x27;s somewhat uncomfortable.  Not injury-causing uncomfortable, but enough to make me think &quot;hey, I think the other team got this right.&quot;  I would not mind switching between command and insert modes; I can keep the state in my head instead of in my finger.<p>The barrier to switching, for me, is that the vi-like modes are set up by default to have vi-like keybindings, and I just don&#x27;t care to go in and change them all to Emacs-alike keys, and I worry how flexible other software with &quot;vi mode&quot; will be about that.  I am past the point where I&#x27;m going to use hjkl to move the cursor around, I use npfb.  I can easily change the details in Emacs&#x2F;Viper, but then how am I going to use anything else, like the shell?  That is my main worry.')
