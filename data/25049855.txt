Yes, you can hear from and read comments by all kinds of wildly successful people here, and that can be really cool. You can also hear from people who think $3.7M (I assume this relates to the Basemetrics post) isn&#x27;t a lot of money even though, for most people and - let&#x27;s be honest - for most of us, it&#x27;s a huge and utterly life-changing sum that we&#x27;d be happy to walk away with for 7 years work.<p>From my own perspective, my side-project makes just about enough money that it looks like from August&#x2F;September most months I can now expect a payment from Google Adsense. Net hosting expenses I&#x27;m still not making any money (at all!)[0] but it feels pretty good that the project substantially pays for itself: hosting is getting close to covered, CDN and domain expenses not yet.<p>I also don&#x27;t have any time to work on it at the moment because I&#x27;m working on my house, but I do have plenty of ideas about how I can grow that revenue into something that perhaps ends up being more substantial. Not mega money, but maybe enough to cover the mortgage after hosting expenses and taxes. That&#x27;s nice because it will make me a bit less dependent on earning a regular paycheck every month.<p><i>[0] I don&#x27;t really want to get into this but, to pre-empt possible questions about why this is so expensive (greater than the Â£60&#x2F;mo threshold for an Adsense payout), I host it on a physical machine that&#x27;s way more powerful than strictly necessary at the moment. This is primarily because I want to also use that machine for other things, but also because even a few months ago the site was getting hit infrequently enough that on (e.g.) Azure there&#x27;d be this horrible startup delay for most users if I went ultra-cheap, and I didn&#x27;t want that. I went dedicated with Azure a couple of years or so back, which worked out more expensive than the machine I rent from OVH, so I switched to a much beefier physical box. I also use Cloudflare because I serve up a reasonable number of media assets, and using a CDN really reduces the bandwidth hit on my own box. Yes, I could do this more cheaply, but I don&#x27;t want to because it would yield a worse experience for a non-trivial proportion of my userbase.</i>')
