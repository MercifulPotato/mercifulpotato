Abuse reports can of course happen and are needed, but sending a single email and then suspending domains is utterly a horrible practice since many domains will have significant user uploaded content.<p>On the other hand my experience with Amazon abuse team has been positive. They send an email and follow up, without something as ridiculous as suspending domain automatically.<p>I would avoid Godaddy and Namecheap for domain usage in any significant business.')
