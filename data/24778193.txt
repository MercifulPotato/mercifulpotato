They have nothing to do with <i>membership</i> or <i>joining</i>.<p>Data was obtained from these companies <i>without their particpation</i>, and they have taken measures to harden their systems since this was made public, for example in Google’s case prism obtained data by intercepting their underground fiber optic cables.  Data was previously sent unencrypted between data centers along these, but after the intrusion was discovered, Google moved to encrypting this traffic.<p>If you can find evidence that either of these companies willingly became members of prism, then please present it.<p>Otherwise, you are repeating false claims.')
