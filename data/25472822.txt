The case fatality rate of the black death was 30-60% pretty much across the board for the bubonic variant.<p>Covid 19 is 0.4% and really that is heavily skewed by those over the age of 70 and especially 80.<p>Covid 19, while enormously disruptive due to its infectiousness and tendency to put a big chunk of people in hospital, doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to what the plague did. Not far off of half of western Europe died. It was unimaginably catastrophic.<p>It&#x27;s pertinent because people are not learning the biggest lesson of covid - this was nothing but a trial run for a serious pandemic. Bird flus can get up to the 40% mark or more and without the age variation.<p>The reality is if a black death like disease hit the modern world civilisation would likely more or less totally collapse.<p>The fact people are so incredibly lackadaisical about the origins of and behaviour around the outbreak not to mention any future efforts to at least reduce the odds of another novel virus pandemic seriously scares me.')
