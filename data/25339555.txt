Effectively taking a business unit that was 5-10 years behind Waymo and Cruise and dumping it off on someone who might be able to turn it in to something in exchange for a piece of the future upside. But the real win for Uber shareholders here is that it isn&#x27;t costing Uber R&amp;D dollars anymore.')
