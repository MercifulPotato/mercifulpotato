That completely invalidates any argument, since the Chinese you&#x27;re talking about, are not brains in a jar.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no reason to assume an experience like love can&#x27;t be replicated<p>There&#x27;s all the reason, if only because a &quot;brain in a jar&quot; lacks organs for hormone production (e.g., adrenaline and testosterone). And no, you even haven&#x27;t got an idea of how create an artificial adrenal gland or scrotum, and how to hook them up to an brain in a jar. There&#x27;s all the reason to assume it can&#x27;t be easily replicated.<p>And even if it could theoretically be replicated, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to assume Xiaoice can do that.')
