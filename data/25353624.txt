Any idea that this would work for a broad audience should be thrown away, because your friend Steve in sales doesn’t give a shit about writing their own CSS.<p>I think what you have left after that is serving two different versions of your content. One has its own styling and the other does not. Don’t pretend that the markup isn’t tied to the CSS, and that the unstyled version just doesn’t apply CSS, because there will always be coupling between the two for any moderately complex site. Just have two deliverables and be done with it.<p>Of course, duplicating the content is suboptimal. You could have a source of truth for the actual content of the site that is used to build deliverables with, employing a clever build process.<p>I mean, I’ll just stop there because this sounds like way too much work, being put on the content creator to satisfy an insanely small number of their users. If you want to style the content on your own, just do it. Delete all style sheets and inline styles and apply your own. It’ll be hard work, and the markup will be all wrong for that type of work, but it can be done if it’s really really necessary.')
