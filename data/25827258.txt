Gists are so broadly useful, but relatively few developers actually use them. Personally, I found that incorporating gists into my daily workflow just wasn’t very convenient, and so I ended up creating a VS Code extension that allowed me to create, edit, and comment on gists within the editor: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad</a>.<p>I’m not sure if ease-of-use is a reason for others to not use gists more frequently, but I’ve definitely become a bit of a gists “advocate”, after appreciating just how useful&#x2F;flexible it is as a “developer cloud storage” solution.')
