It has many advantages, but that means that it is hard to give it high quality support and development (which generally requires paying people) if you cannot monetize something about the software -- be it support, or hosting, or selling some close-source product that depends on it.<p>If the licensing terms let someone <i>else</i> monetize your investment to the detriment of your own revenues, that&#x27;s a problem.
