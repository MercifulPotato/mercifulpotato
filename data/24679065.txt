I&#x27;ve used one (I forget the brand - possibly Electrolux) with a wheel that does have haptic feedback on every tick and is actually very nice to use. As the absolute value increases, the increment for every tick also increases in a way that feels natural to me, so you don&#x27;t have to turn it as much as you would an analog wheel for the same precision .')
