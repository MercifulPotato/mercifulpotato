So I&#x27;ve just searched my emails for the receipt from when I bought my current laptop:<p><pre><code>  &gt; Delivery: 23 Jul, 2013 - 25 Jul, 2013 by Standard Shipping\n  &gt; 11-inch MacBook Air\n  &gt; £1,159.00\n  &gt; With the following configuration:\n  &gt; 1.7GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz\n  &gt; 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM\n  &gt; 512GB Flash Storage\n</code></pre>\nWhich according to this site [0] means I&#x27;ve had it =&gt; 2708 days. Which averages out to =&gt; 42p&#x2F;day or =&gt; £156&#x2F;year.<p>The only deteriorations I&#x27;ve noticed over those 7 1&#x2F;2 years is that; the battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge for much more than an hour [not a problem, as I tend to work with it plugged in all the time], the screen has a couple of pock-marks [made of soft plastic, rather than glass], the fraying adaptor cable is held together with glue, screen hinges are a bit floppy and I had to replace the keyboard [although that was down to &#x27;wine error&#x27;]<p>Other than that, My MBA still works fine and feels quick enough for anything I need to do on it. And that includes a lot of graphics work in Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as all the other less demanding &#x27;stuff&#x27; I do on it. So, all things considered, I reckon that&#x27;s a pretty good return on my investment!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timeanddate.com&#x2F;date&#x2F;durationresult.html?d1=24&amp;m1=07&amp;y1=2013&amp;d2=21&amp;m2=12&amp;y2=2020&amp;ti=on" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timeanddate.com&#x2F;date&#x2F;durationresult.html?d1=24&amp;m...</a><p>Further thoughts:<p>Given that the guy&#x27;s &#x27;raison d&#x27;être&#x27; seems to be about sustainability and green energy, it seems quite ironic that:<p>1: He abandoned his first fully functional laptop to land-fill and bought a new one just because the adaptor died. Rather than just buy a new adaptor [non-Apple ones are available at a fraction of the cost of OEM, if the price was too much to stomach].<p>2: He abandoned his second fully functional laptop to landfill and bought a new one just because the version of WindowsXP he had running on it was no longer supported. Rather than just install Linux on it, instead.')
