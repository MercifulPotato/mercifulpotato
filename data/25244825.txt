I hate emails, no matter if it is work or my personal life. I don’t like to check, manage and reply to them. I feel anxious when people send them to me. In a team setting I would also hate that the sender, not the recipient decides what they want to read.<p>At the same time I love endless chats (within proper channels). They don’t distract me from my work. I don’t participate when I need to focus and other than that, well the communication is <i>also</i> my work, just as important as writing code.<p>As to your community question, how about a subreddit?')
