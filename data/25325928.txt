Islamic finance heavily encourages proper economic growth through correct risk sharing. Want to open a business? Get VC funding and grow the company, if it succeeds, all parties profit, if it fails, all parties share the risk. This is in line with capitalism, just without the immoral and parasitic practices that make it unstable, as we see today.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that the SEC banned short selling during the 2008 economic crisis, I wonder why. Not to mention that without interest bearing loans and selling debt for debt, there wouldn&#x27;t have been a 2008 crisis to begin with.<p>The solution is less taxation, while removing the parasitic practices that underly the economy today.')
