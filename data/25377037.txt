Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[25377151], score=None, time=1607626544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376879, text='&gt;&gt; <i>the cost to fix would be peanuts</i><p>&gt; <i>If you fix them all they add up to not peanuts and then you don&#x27;t have any money left</i><p>The initial criticism is worthwhile in its original context (0.02% of the agency&#x27;s budget). By scaling it up, you took it out of that context so that it runs up against worries about the total budget, implying a shortfall even though the argument is about the same 0.02%. The obvious answer to your comment is &quot;well then it&#x27;s easy to cut a little from $ELSEWHERE&quot;, which will inevitably devolve into overt zero-sum partisan bickering.')
