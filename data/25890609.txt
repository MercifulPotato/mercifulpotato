Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=[25893354], score=None, time=1611480401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888164, text='&gt; this is nonsense and a touch of wine snobbery,<p>I think you&#x27;re in more agreement with GP than you realise - as I read it they&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s a good system, but we (collectively&#x2F;on average&#x2F;&#x27;Big Wine&#x27;) don&#x27;t want it to change, so box wine is mostly at the low end.<p>Naked (vintner in the UK, and I think recentlyish launched in the US too) has started doing some boxes though, so some of the more popular (and again, cheaper, but it&#x27;s a higher starting point than a supermarket) stuff they sell is starting to be available boxed instead of bottles.<p>I think Naked actually does all the bottling itself in the UK, so if it&#x27;s popular it&#x27;ll probably be quite easy for them to expand (i.e. bag and box more instead of bottling it) maybe just needing agreement from the vineyard.<p>I would have quite mixed feelings about it becoming standard though, even if I know it&#x27;s better on paper.')
