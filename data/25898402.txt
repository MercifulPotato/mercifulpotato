I bet they didn&#x27;t read the privacy notice update and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they got their information from some Whatsapp forward that misinformed them about the actual contents of the privacy update, ironically. \nTurns out there&#x27;s a lot of misguided and uninformed people too perhaps worse off now than when they used Whatsapp in terms of privacy considering telegram isn&#x27;t end to end encrypted.')
