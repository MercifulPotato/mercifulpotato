The notion that you can&#x27;t just steal a large part a song and it&#x27;ll be legal because it&#x27;s not the full work is a pretty obvious one. Beyond that a ship-of-Theseus type ambiguity kicks in regarding to how much is needed to be taken for it to be thefth, as it does for most things  that can be taken apart.<p>I guess it is worrying that the trial didn&#x27;t decide if bits that small are protected or not before going on to decide if infringement happened, but I think this is mostly worrying for Katy Perry as it indicates that the hired lawyers are bad at their job.')
