Also generally speaking good odds that industries like airlines and such can successfully lobby for more bailouts.  So I buy the S&amp;P will be up and we&#x27;ll just all be ignoring the total gutting of small businesses.<p>Plus if say you&#x27;re a chain restaurant right now, the future probably looks bright.  You had the credit to weather a year of takeout only.  Meanwhile three of the four family restaurants nearby that you competed with are dead and gone.<p>Basically very few folks who trade on the S&amp;P went out of business, but a lot of their competitors did.  Sure you&#x27;ll have an entire cohort of newly impoverished that can&#x27;t spend, but a bunch of your competitors went away.
