It&#x27;s booming at present and will be very rich 20 years from now (most likely). It has a bad transportation network because it was underdeveloped for the prior decades as with much of Texas. The question going forward is what they&#x27;ll do with their growth and rising affluence, how they&#x27;ll utilize that (or not).')
