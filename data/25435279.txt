I have many years of experience of managing it by first and foremost not exposing myself to germs rather than cavalierly exposing myself and hoping a little cloth over my face will somehow fix it.<p>But based on this comment and all the downvotes, it seems the decision to not pursue a blog in earnest promoting the idea &quot;That maybe we can find a better-er answer&quot; was the correct decision as a means to protect myself from people who don&#x27;t want a better answer, they just want a dog to kick.<p>I&#x27;m trying to say something like &quot;Instead of promoting condoms and prophylactic drugs for HIV and other diseases while saying casual sex is fine, we could suggest (alternatives like) celibacy and monogamy as better solutions.&quot;<p>But I imagine that would also be just as hated on. Can&#x27;t tell anyone &quot;Maybe keeping it in your pants sometimes when not doing so could kill you is a better answer.&quot;<p>Edit:<p>TLDR: Maybe adults should aspire to more sophisticated answers than ones even a five year old could come up with rather than attacking other adults as idiots for (supposedly) &quot;not seeing something so obvious even a child could dream it up as a solution.&quot;')
