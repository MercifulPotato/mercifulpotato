We have some pull-down blinds that are almost always in the up position. And I have to be honest: I only care about walking in front of my windows naked to the extent that it would bother my neighbors. I couldn&#x27;t care any less. I only ever pull them down to spare my neighbors any embarrassment.<p>Which is just to say: a lot of privacy talk is mere question-begging. It&#x27;s assumed we all feel the same privacy-based emotions (and pro-privacy arguments like yours attempt to appeal to those emotions), but I find that I rarely share my interlocutor&#x27;s intuitions on this topic, so your argument is still ahead of you.')
