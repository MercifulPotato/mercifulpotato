The case I have top of mind is Korea, which has very little arable land and can only import via boats from China (quality worries). Japan is probably similar to a lesser scale. I believe the economics of vertical farming in these regions make a lot more sense, and 2020 has created huge price hikes in food in Korea because of too much rain and expensive imports.<p>Also hi  , I&#x27;ve been curious for years what happened with your farming plans. I can guess you walked away from them!')
