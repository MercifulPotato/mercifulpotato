Item(by='hnick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607902359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409511, text='&gt; Screen time itself shouldn&#x27;t cause eyestrain. Reading is the most likely culprit.<p>I think this is true, because for me when I&#x27;m having a bad eye day I can play games for hours but struggle to read through a paragraph.<p>I had laser eye surgery and almost regret it, my eyes get dry easily now (I seem to get recurring blepharitis which I lessen with a heat pack) and one eye in particular almost always feels like it has grit in it. But I can play games or watch videos and it&#x27;s engaging enough that I forget all that, while reading is a completely different story.<p>Dark mode and larger fonts definitely help, as does a downward eye angle. My work laptop screen does not help, I don&#x27;t know what it is but I just feel worse at the end of a day that I use it. I think the text is probably too small but I don&#x27;t realise because in proportion to the smaller screen size it looks large.')
