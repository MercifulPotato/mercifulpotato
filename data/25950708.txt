Most retail investors are watching from the sidelines and scarfing down popcorn, not actively participating. You&#x27;re hearing about a very small portion of the market and extrapolating that out to everyone, but that&#x27;s simply not the case.<p>Market manipulation is not new, and it&#x27;s not impacting most retail investment strategies, which are much longer term. This is exposing inequities in the market that have existed for a long time, but I would be shocked if it has a significant impact on the assets of retail investors. As others have said, what other options are there? The game is imperfect, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone stops playing all the sudden.')
