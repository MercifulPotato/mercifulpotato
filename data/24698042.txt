If I don’t struggle through and go to bed then, it will screw up my sleep schedule. During the 2 weeks of COVID, it was way worse and I could sleep 3&#x2F;4s of an entire day and still be tired.<p>This is getting better - I push myself everyday just a little more and now can exercise for 2 hours straight and carry on, but it’s night and day different to pre-COVID behavior and I imagine it will be through to Christmas before I am back to “normal” (touch wood).')
