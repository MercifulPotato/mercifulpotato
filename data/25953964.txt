Item(by='dataflow', descendants=None, kids=[25954102], score=None, time=1611894938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953886, text='&gt; But it&#x27;s also useless without the service provider, and the store specifically asked me if the app was good at trading stocks, linking bank accounts, tracking stocks.<p>This confirms what I said though. You tell the store &quot;this app isn&#x27;t good at trading stocks&quot; because &quot;GME was made unavailable for trading&quot;? For that logic to follow, it would mean the app misled you or confused you when GME wasn&#x27;t available for trading. But that&#x27;s obviously not what happened here. Blaming it on the app for this seems very much like blaming your bus driver because the transit company changed the schedule.')
