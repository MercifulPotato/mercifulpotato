That means the other 35% is 2.4x earnings.<p>2.4x earnings is equivalent to saving something like at least 15% of your <i>gross</i> salary for 10 years, assuming a 7% annual investment return (which in itself is unobtainable, but lets be generous).<p>15% of gross salary is going to be 20-25% of take-home for most people...not exactly obtainable when you&#x27;re already spending 40-50% of your take-home on rent.<p>When you finally get the mortgage the monthly payments might be affordable, but getting there is the problem for the vast majority.<p>So no, most people are still looking at 3-4% mortgages with the equity they have at hand.')
