If you want to work 8 AM to 5 PM, set one side of the clock to 8 when you start work and start that side. Let&#x27;s call this side of the clock the &quot;work&quot; clock.<p>When you stop work for something that you would not have stopped for if you were not working remotely, stop the work clock. Start it again when you resume work.<p>Work until the work clock reaches 5.<p>This might help in a couple ways.<p>1. It will make you more aware during the work day day how much time you spent so far on non-work stuff. That may make it easier to do things like help your wife or run errands without inadvertently doing so many of those things on the same day that you don&#x27;t get enough work done.<p>2. When you do stop work to do something else, knowing that you&#x27;ll make up the time later that day might make it more guilt free.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;BETTERLINE-Professional-Analog-Chess-Clock&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07K4HNHKZ&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;BETTERLINE-Professional-Analog-Chess-...</a>')
