He never experienced it. He raised venture capital in the 1990s when anyone could. He sold a bunch of Lisp code to Yahoo. Good for him. He got to experience what most of us wish was the real world, as the real world.<p>I expected to read a more focused breakdown of Paul Graham and why he isn&#x27;t a public intellectual but instead the author claims PG is wrong on his views about society because of his own unique experiences within it. But then the author goes on to make the same broad generalizations for the rest of the essay.<p>&gt; People end up in “regular” (non-executive) corporate jobs for a variety of reasons— low socioeconomic status of origin, wrong educational choices, and bad luck— but the system is set up to tell them it’s their fault. They’re told they should expect no better than these demeaning jobs because they “aren’t entrepreneurial”— whatever the fuck that means, because the private-sector apparatchiks who boss them around aren’t entrepreneurs— enough for a better spot.<p>People also end up in these &quot;regular&quot; corporate jobs from high socioeconomic status of origin as well. I also know many people who are from low socioeconomic status of origin who have escaped corporate jobs or avoided them entirely. The vocabulary used by this author seems to suggest that certain people are given corporate jobs against their will and they can never leave. In reality, people apply to jobs that they have the skills (but more likely the qualifications) to get so they can support themselves but they could always try to start their own small business or a company. My parents are both uneducated and from poor socioeconomic backgrounds yet were both very successful as small business owners and while it&#x27;s fair to say the world today is not the same as it was back then, technology and online resources make it easier than ever to start a business. Not everything needs to be a venture or enterprise scale company either.<p>The point is that this author paints a picture where workers are just forced into cubicles against their will every day and forced to work 40 hours per week when they only have 5 hours of actual work to do (which is again, a massive generalization) when that&#x27;s just not the case.')
