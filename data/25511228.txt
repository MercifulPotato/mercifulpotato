All our teachers said good luck getting a job and I was only three out 60 that I heard got a job out of college in the field.<p>Once I moved from Nashville to NYC for my label job I met a ton of other men and women whom this same guy gave them a chance too.  That&#x27;s how his career started .. he met a label head at a concert in the 80s who gave him a chance.<p>Great guy who helped found many popular artist careers in the 90s.')
