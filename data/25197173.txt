It was all tunnelled and secure. It was genuinly useful in the days before 4G mobile and widespread wifi in shops and cafes, I used it a lot.<p>With this I just don&#x27;t see what devices would be using it. It isn&#x27;t something you can just piggyback on to check your email. It feels like this is preperation for some new device or service.<p>Or am I underestimating the number of people who want to put an Alexa device somewhere that they don&#x27;t have a network, but which is close to someone elses network?')
