So it is incorrect to say &quot;the app wasn&#x27;t used&quot;.  It was obviously used, just maybe not in a long time.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not trying to nitpick.  But it seems like all you&#x27;ve said so far is &quot;An app which I downloaded and enabled push notifications for sent me a push notification recommending a video I didn&#x27;t agree with politically&quot;. The term &quot;extremist content&quot; can mean basically anything depending on who is speaking.')
