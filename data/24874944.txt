Getting just a factor-of-two increase in sensitivity is significant--getting 4-5 orders of magnitude better would be incredible and also next to impossible, given the other factors to account for.<p>The author considers environmental gravitational noise, but you have to also consider that any movement of the instrument in a non-uniform gravitational field will create a signal.  If you consider Earth as a perfect sphere, the gravitational signal of a B-2 that the author considers is equivalent to the change in gravity from a vertical displacement of 0.2nm.  This is about the size of a water molecule.  Vertical stability at that level is unachievable.')
