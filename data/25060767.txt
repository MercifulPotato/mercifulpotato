Perhaps is it that two-parent families are better for raising kids? Or is it a function of household income?<p>It&#x27;s hard to separate those, and there&#x27;s plenty of intuition for why two parents might be better in addition to household income: e.g., availability of at least one parent at any given time.<p>&gt; Is marriage just being treated as shorthand for a lot of things it isn&#x27;t necessary for?<p>I agree that these benefits are more likely the result of two-parent families rather than anything to do with the ritual of marriage.')
