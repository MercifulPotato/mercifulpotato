I have even posted twice about it (and related issues) myself a few times:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfconservancy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;oct&#x2F;16&#x2F;mongodb-copyleft-drafting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfconservancy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;oct&#x2F;16&#x2F;mongodb-copyleft-...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfconservancy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;06&#x2F;copyleft-equality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfconservancy.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;06&#x2F;copyleft-equality...</a><p>The only thing I haven&#x27;t seen said succinctly, although it&#x27;s been hinted at by many, is this:<p>There is no one on the planet yet who has agreed that they will run a project under the SS Public License and be <i>themselves</i> bound by the SS Public License.<p>That really says it all.  Whatever your view about copyleft licenses generally: legitimate and well-intentioned copyleft licenses (e.g., CC-BY-SA, GPL, and Affero GPL) have many projects that use the license in an inbound=outbound contributor licensing fashion.  All (two of the) SS Public License uses have a strict CLA that give the publishing entity non-SS-Public-Licensed rights to the contributions.  We shouldn&#x27;t take anyone seriously who promulgates a license but won&#x27;t use it themselves in an inbound=outbound way.  Period.  I suggest we all try to not give further interest to this clearly risible licensing proposals from MongoDB and Elastic.<p>If there&#x27;s energy to focus here, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s toward figuring out how to handle good governance of forks of these two projects.  I hope folks can maintain the discipline to discern and bifricate these two very different issues.')
