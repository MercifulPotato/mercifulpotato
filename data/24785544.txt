This is inspired by Smalltalk, Lisp machines, and OpenDoc.  Another aspect of this desktop environment is its support for very flexible user interfaces that can be easily modified.  This project is motivated by my frustrations with existing desktop environments (I lament the stagnation of macOS) and my desire to see something like a modern Lisp machine.<p>Below is a document that describes my ideas:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmcthrow-musings.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;a-proposal-for-flexible-composable.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmcthrow-musings.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;a-proposal-for-...</a><p>I&#x27;m still in the very early phases of this project; there&#x27;s no code available, and I&#x27;m currently in the process of learning Wayland and graphics programming (I have a background in systems programming and I&#x27;ve been getting up to speed on graphics programming in order to carry out this project).')
