I think 8 of them were made in Thailand and 3 were made in Japan.  They all work fine.  One of the Thailand cameras had a shutter issue after 2 years and I had it repaired.  All of the other cameras have been flawless.  Even my D70 from 2005 was made in Thailand and still works today although I converted it to infrared use.')
