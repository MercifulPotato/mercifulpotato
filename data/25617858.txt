After thinking about it for 30 seconds, I would say add a negative power rail go from there.  All gates are analog circuits at the lowest level, so it would not be very difficult to come up a circuit design.<p>I think the main obstacle would be the lack of ternary logic designers.  VHDL&#x2F;Verilog could probably be extended&#x2F;enhanced to support ternary logic, but there would be a learning curve for the designers.')
