It&#x27;s crazy to have someone happily doing X hours of work, wishing they could do X+10 hours of work per week, and their boss also wishes they could do X+10 hours of work per week, but then the position would have to be paid more and they don&#x27;t have the money. It&#x27;s just cruel to take someone working a minimum wage job, which sucks enough already, and then make them get TWO minimum wage jobs, two bosses, two schedules to work around, all because they can get a contractor job but not a full time job.<p>So if we say, if you employ someone at a normal 40 hour a week job, you have to provide them with benefit X. Then if you pay a contractor 20 hours a week you should have to provide them with something that&#x27;s half the cost of benefit X. It just sucks to incentivize companies to hire two thousand 20-hour-a-week positions instead of one thousand 40-hour-a-week positions.')
