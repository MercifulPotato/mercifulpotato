Forms are full of such questions, presenting themselves as straightforward logic gates, which on closer inspection turn out to be impossibly multivalent.<p>This is actually a huge problem, particularly in the age of computer systems. If the form is electronic and not designed properly, you can&#x27;t even leave a note.<p>Software developers often love being smart and validating all inputs, with disastrous consequences. In my opinion, 99% of validations, at least for data that&#x27;s not going to be directly processed by computers, email addresses for example, shouldn&#x27;t be validated at all, and most validation errors should be replaced with warnings instead.')
