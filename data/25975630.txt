Stadia has always been &quot;you have to buy the games separately&quot; for pretty much all titles. That was the big knock against it at launch, and has been an impediment to its growth.<p>FWIW I consider Stadia and the ilk oversold to the mass market akin to VR. There may be a market for people who want to play AAA games, will pay several hundreds per year and yet have never bothered to pay ~$300 for a game console (tail end of last gen). I&#x27;m just skeptical it&#x27;s actually as huge as it&#x27;s hyped to be.')
