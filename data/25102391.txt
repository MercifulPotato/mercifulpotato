A refigerator usually only needed a single driver.<p>In the sales showroom they were giving free microwave cooking lessons to introduce the skills needed to make the transition.  A factory representative would come regularly to conduct a culinary demo.  In hindsight more of an appliance enthusiast than a food enthusiast.  In the advanced classes they would prepare an entire holiday dinner, and we could partake in the surplus.<p>Few foresaw that more often younger unskilled family members than ever would one day be conveniently using ovens without supervision.')
