It&#x27;s easy for a community like this to default into a toxic culture where people simply rip each other to shreds. It takes an effort to avoid that. If you&#x27;d please review <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and be willing to make that effort, we&#x27;d appreciate it. \nThere&#x27;s nothing that you wrote here which couldn&#x27;t be expressed as thoughtful feedback.<p>I know it happens that one encounters 99 annoyances in a row and then runs into #100 and the built-up frustration boils over. But it&#x27;s important not to use a forum like this to discharge such a payload.')
