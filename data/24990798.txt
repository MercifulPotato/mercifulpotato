Item(by='ictebres', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604509311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24989749, text='&gt; Customers buying multiple flavours of a product with the same price but different UPCs, which the cashier rings up by scanning the first product then hitting &quot;times 10&quot;<p>I worked at retail (Uniqlo to be specific) and it was definetely a rule to not do this. They wanted us to scan everything one by one even if they were the same color and size. This allowed for a pretty accurate information on stock, e.g. we could see how many of a given sweater in given size and color is still in storage etc.<p>Probably this is too tedius for some retail (groceries with very small unit price) but very smart rule in general.')
