Some will say yes, but overall the language is more praised for them than damned.<p>So highly regarded are Lisp macros that many languages will eagerly proclaim that they have macros too -- even if they&#x27;re not homoiconic and so harder to work with than in Lisp.  Few if any are the languages that proudly proclaim that they don&#x27;t have macros because they thought Lisp macros were a big mistake.<p>C++ fans themselves often point out that C++ templates can be as powerful as Lisp macros.<p>So which is it?  Is giving users the power to radically transform their language a bug or a feature?')
