Item(by='Zancarius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606943971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278375, text='&gt; In my experience, that particular substitute is not a challenge.<p>It&#x27;s not. Some of the TVP products are pretty decent (and surprisingly so). And honestly, it&#x27;s off-putting enough that it&#x27;d be worth using a substitute for. I eat hamburgers only rarely, so most of my ground beef consumption is in other dishes that are heavily seasoned enough that using a substitute is no problem (e.g. taco meat).<p>Otherwise, my problem is if I&#x27;m fixing chicken breasts for something and miss some connective tissue when I&#x27;m preparing it. I can guarantee with near certainty that if I do, I <i>will</i> be the one to find it. :)<p>(Sorry to gross you out if you&#x27;re vegan.)')
