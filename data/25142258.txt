I can imagine that might mean less lactose, but maybe something in the fake cheese is giving you problems.<p>In the Netherlands most milk is pasteurized. I can imagine this is the case in the US too. In the Netherlands there is a special protected branding of cheese that is not pasteurized (boerenkaas). Pasteurizing milk reduces the calcium level. I can imagine Italians might prefer using unpasteurized milk products more than people in other countries.')
