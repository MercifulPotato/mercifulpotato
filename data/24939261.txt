What&#x27;s stopping you from having empathy for people that feel that way currently?<p>That the current approach is playing right into the hands of the bullies.<p>Or do you think it is the awkward ones who are sitting on the CoC tribunal?<p>As far as I can see this is yet another place for the socially and politically strong ones to get their way.<p>&gt; One aspect of this newfangled definition of safe is that women can feel confident existing in a space without fear of being sexually harassed. Is that worth considering? Is that a political game?<p>I&#x27;m absolutely fine with women feeling safe. In fact there are at least a couple of women around who are thankful because I have fixed them a job or something. (To be clear, I help everyone, not only women.)<p>It is absolutely worth considering such things, which is why we (at least were I live) have laws against such things, and also why I am in favour of those laws.<p>What I am not in favour of is independent kangaroo courts popping up everywhere, making up rules as they go, combining the role of judge, jury and executioner etc.<p>Kangaroo courts are for war, and even then only when there&#x27;s no other option.')
