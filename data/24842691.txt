You <i>really</i> have to go out of your way to access private fields in Java -- I can only recall about 3-5 instances of doing that in my 15+ years programming in Java. You have to look up a field by name, and call setAccessbile(true) on its reflection... and this is definitely going to raise eyebrows in code review. Some of the DI frameworks do it as a matter of course, but that&#x27;s kind of a different thing...<p>(Now, package-private is a different matter. In that case you can[0], just put a class in the same package and access from there. I&#x27;ve done that... twice or so?)<p>What is your recollection in terms of doing the same thing in Python? Obviously, this is just going to be anecdata, but it could be kind of interesting.<p>[0] Modules change this a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t seem modules are really a thing outside the standard library yet. (I&#x27;m programming in Scala these days, so haven&#x27;t kept up with Java practices.)')
