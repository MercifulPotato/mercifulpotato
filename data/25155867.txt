And privacy is a problem here. You cannot enforce a privacy policy (if there only was one) or data protection law against an anonymous website, so expect all your data to go to the highest bidder. Naively, maybe, I would expect that to be unacceptable, although there seem to be people in favour of this. It&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;ll get enough data later in the ordering process, but it&#x27;s still highly unusable (compared to e.g. rsync.net and all the other big clouds).')
