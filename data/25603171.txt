What you imagine to be the intention&#x2F;argument on the other end isn&#x27;t the one intended, so a comment like this one ends up dismissing the real issues brought up by people pointing out it&#x27;s not FOSS.<p>There is no shortage of discussion these days about independent devs feeling suckered into doing free support for corporations by way of FOSS.  At least in that situation those programmers get some form of equity out of the bargain, given the terms of the actually-FOSS licenses.  In the case of Defold, they&#x27;ve taken the Apache license and changed it to diminish even that in a way that&#x27;s directly meant to benefit Defold.  There&#x27;s also the matter of people just not wanting companies to be able to reap undue rewards out of association with FOSS if they&#x27;re not actually <i>doing</i> FOSS.<p>It&#x27;s honestly not a reaction that should be considered surprising.  Want to hawk your wares as FOSS?  Okay, FOSS licenses exist.  Want to take one of those licenses and then alter it in such a way that it&#x27;s no longer FOSS?  Okay, then don&#x27;t call it FOSS.  It&#x27;s a pretty fair deal.')
