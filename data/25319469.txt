Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25319728], score=None, time=1607211307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318492, text='<i>&gt; When your sector makes up like three of the five most valuable companies on the planet, we probably should be taxing it more.</i><p>The problem is that increasing the corporate income tax rate just doesn&#x27;t provide enough revenue. Corporate income taxes are only 7% of the US government&#x27;s annual tax revenue, for example. Even if we doubled the corporate income tax rate, that&#x27;s still only another 7% of the total tax revenue, which is way too small to make up for the annual US budget deficit.<p><i>&gt; Jeff Bezos does not need more money.</i><p>While I don&#x27;t disagree with this, taxing the wealth of the rich also just doesn&#x27;t provide enough revenue. Suppose we set a hard cap on personal wealth of $1 billion--everything over that, the government takes in tax at a rate of 100%. The net worth of the 400 richest people in the world is around $3 trillion, so we&#x27;d be taking $2.6 trillion of it. And that would fund...the US government for about 6 months. Or all 50 US states for...a little more than a year. And then the wealth is gone, and what do you do next?<p>In other words, all the complaining about low corporate tax rates and wealth inequality is complaining about something that, even if it were &quot;fixed&quot; (and fixed without depressing wealth creation, which is highly implausible), would not do much of anything about the real problem: that we expect governments to do far too much and give them far too much power. And that translates into chronic overspending and deficits, which end up being paid by the middle class, because that&#x27;s the only source of revenue large enough to pay it.')
