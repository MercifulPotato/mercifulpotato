I believe Netflix made this idea popular with sidecar containers as a way to add<p>&gt; “non-intrusive platform capabilities” [0]<p>to container stacks.<p>I understand that the idea might be popular among developers as it is easier to just add a database container to your stack rather than dealing with the db admin. I don&#x27;t know if Netflix ever recommended databases as sidecar containers. But I have seen it in the wild where dev followed the Netflix model. I sometimes hear people arguing that they have to manage containers anyway so it would be less overhead to manage the db as a container as well.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;prana-a-sidecar-for-your-netflix-paas-based-applications-and-services-258a5790a015" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;prana-a-sidecar-for-your-netflix...</a>')
