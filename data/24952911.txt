Item(by='H8crilA', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604162847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952613, text='Bitcoin is clearly not appropriate for &quot;savings&quot;, just look at the realised volatility. It may become appropriate in the future, but when that happens the &quot;put on financial system&quot; will be realised, i.e. the convexity proposition will be gone. In fact if &quot;Bitcoin is now appropriate for savings&quot; in the sense that The Economist and other mainstream is not ashamed to write about it and central banks have Bitcoin holdings next to their gold holdings then that precisely means that the convex bet has paid off :)<p>I used to hold Bitcoin at various times in the past, and I would absolutely not recommend Bitcoin to anyone unless they truly can stomach total loss on the &quot;investment&quot;. This means appropriate position sizing, alignment with current personal financial situation and personal plans&#x2F;goals&#x2F;objectives. And don&#x27;t even think about leverage here.')
