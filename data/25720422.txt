Free speech only means you can’t be arrested for saying “let’s kill mike pence”.<p>It doesn’t mean that the people who’s property you’re saying it can’t boot you off. property being a physical or internet property e.g “my house, AWS, Apple, Twitter, google, FB”<p>They all have terms of service, they can boot you off if you violate them. They don’t even have to uniformly enforce the terms of service.<p>If you want to say “hang mike pence” then host your own site on a server with a DNS provider who is complicit with your activity.<p>thedonald.win is a great clone of Trump subreddit.
