Where have Oxford&#x2F;AZ shared their testing protocol? Indeed,  I was surprised to learn that the Pfizer and Moderna trials did <i>not</i> test participants unless they showed symptoms. Meaning: we donâ€™t know if their vaccines prevent transmission of the virus. It specifically was not the measuring stick for their definition of efficacy.<p>I believe Moderna is currently conducting a new trial to ascertain the transmission question. Until we know for sure, all the talk about herd immunity may be moot.')
