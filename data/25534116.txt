Would it be acceptable to test employee susceptibility to extortion by taking compromising photos and then threatening them with it?<p>In my opinion no. Any sort of experimentation on employees needs to be ethical. If you screw people over in the name of security, you have now become the security risk. Making the security team be the enemy that the employees hate because they have been hurt by them, will lead to very poor outcomes.')
