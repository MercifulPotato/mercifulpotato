They are trained to think cagy people are guilty.<p>They know that guilty people are highly likely to incriminate themselves if they talk because the story they tell won&#x27;t be self-consistent or with other evidence and testimony.<p>It is absolutely a bad idea to lie to the police.<p>That kind of advice may cause white people to get increased legal bills but I think anything that increases mistrust between the population and police is outright dangerous to black people.')
