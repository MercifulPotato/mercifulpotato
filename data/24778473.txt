Sure, it takes means but it&#x27;s nontrivial. And yes, many are left behind but should we all be forced to stay on a sinking ship, when there are lifeboats?  If anyone must perish, we all must perish?  I&#x27;m headed toward the exit with my family. It&#x27;s a long process and if I didn&#x27;t have a kid, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be doing it. My kid&#x27;s life is more important than mine and I&#x27;ll leave everyone behind for them. It&#x27;s not easy but it&#x27;s important.')
