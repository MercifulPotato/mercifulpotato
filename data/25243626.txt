Leaving very specific solutions like alias mv=&#x27;mv -i&#x27; aside..<p>A bare minimum first step would be to stop using mv directly and wrap it in a shell script with appropriate error checking&#x2F;environment setup&#x2F;etc. This will take 5 minutes to develop and immediately prevents a whole class of operator errors from happening again. It also makes for just one place to put all the logic needed, so when the process to expose a file becomes mv and something else the operator’s interface remains unchanged.')
