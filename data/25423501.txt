I have been frustrated by how poorly we use energy in northern climates; we simply replace common sense with petroleum and electricity. There is solar, there&#x27;s thermal mass of dirt, there is geothermal.<p>Northern homes could be surrounded by glass, and&#x2F;or sunk into the ground&#x2F;hills. Black should be more common for exteriors. Solar water heating should be more common.<p>With a bit of earth moving and ingenuity we could build greenhouse orchards into the sides of hills and save on shipping costs for fresher produce.')
