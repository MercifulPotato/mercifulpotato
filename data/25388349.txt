Those people will be carrying USB-C to USB-C cables because that&#x27;s what their MacBook and&#x2F;or iPad Pro uses.<p>I&#x27;m not really what&#x27;s contrived about the other poster&#x27;s comment. If these headphones look good <i>and</i> sound good <i>and</i> have good noise cancelling, why would I only want to use them with my iPhone? I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll sound great whether I use them with my MacBook, or iPhone, or my Dell XPS, or my Windows desktop, or my smart TV.<p>The lightning port isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, but it can be an ergonomic annoyance. I&#x27;ve recently been favoring on Galaxy S9 over my newer iPhone because all of my other devices charge via USB-C and the iPhone is the odd duck that requires extra work. I have a USB-C to lighting cable so it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad, but it&#x27;s still extra annoyance I would rather not deal with.')
