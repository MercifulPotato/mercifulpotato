That doesn&#x27;t really leave a whole lot of options. So what exactly do you think his statement was? All you seem to be doing is repeating the statement and gesturing wildly at it going &quot;See? See????? Bad!&quot;<p>To me it sounds like Bannon is just a pompous blowhard who&#x27;s making outrageous claims he will never, in a million years, be able to back up.<p>But that&#x27;s not my point. My point is that <i>I</i> get to read his words myself and make up my own mind about them. I can decide he&#x27;s a pompous blowhard or a serious threat to democracy and direct my own actions accordingly. I don&#x27;t have to get a secondhand account from Facebook who tells me what to think about Bannon. Do you see the difference?<p>If you read Bannon&#x27;s word and decide he&#x27;s a threat then you can go around warning people about him if you like, or starting some counter-advocacy movement, or whatever (legal) action you want to take. If you have to rely on Facebook telling you which people are threats and which people are not, that gives them a power to  direct the public discourse to their whims. The public needs to have the ability to view primary sources and make up their own minds about them.<p>I&#x27;m not concerned about the specific details of this one piece of speech, I&#x27;m concerned about the general principle of where the power to decide which speech is appropriate lies.')
