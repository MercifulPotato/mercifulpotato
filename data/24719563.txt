So best case scenario we can achieve herd immunity with roughly 100M infections&#x2F;recovered. USA is currently at ~8M infections&#x2F;recovered, so that means we are roughly 8% of the way to herd immunity (best case).<p>At the current rate of +50K infections per day, that&#x27;s 20 days per 1M infections, so we need 20 days * 92 = 5 years before we achieve herd immunity (best case, assuming no vaccines)? That doesn&#x27;t seem right.')
