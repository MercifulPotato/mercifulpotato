America&#x2F;Biden&#x27;s socialism is the equivalent of progressive conservatism in Europe.<p>Observations about the left&#x2F;right alignment of American politicians are, naturally, made in the context of American politics. It makes little sense to compare Joe Biden&#x27;s politics to European candidates. He is compared to Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Compared to them (even compared to Clinton and Obama), he is significantly farther left.<p>Imagine how well the converse of the argument would track for a European. &quot;You know that candidate on the Right who wants to abolish your state-run healthcare system? You can tell that&#x27;s not a radical position--just look at how many Americans prefer a private system!&quot;')
