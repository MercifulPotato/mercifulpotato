Most people &#x27;feel&#x27; a certain way and get taught a certain ideology (in school, media, friends, parents) which then shapes their worldview. Instead of questioning the world view they already have, they simply live in it and project wrongdoing and rightdoing (morality) onto others and the world.<p>It&#x27;s like being taught to walk barefoot, pricking your foot and deciding small prickly objects need to be gotten rid of. It never occurs to them to wear shoes.')
