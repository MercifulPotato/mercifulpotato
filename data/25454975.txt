While self taught developers have been around from the beginning, until a few years ago, most companies wanted only those with a CS degree regardless of what they were to actually do. DB admin - CS Degree; maintain a Wordpress site - CS degree; write ML algorithms from scratch - CS degree.<p>It is changing now.
