I am not making this up.<p>In Bangladesh, a well-regarded study found that 45% of people in Dhaka, one of the most densely populated regions in the world, had antibodies. This study was conducted between <i>April 18 and July 5</i>. I&#x27;m sure the number is much higher now. And most people around me seem to agree with this- our total deaths so far is 1&#x2F;50 of USA, despite having 1&#x2F;2 population. Even if we multiply our total deaths by 5 to account for maybe government cover-up, our death rate&#x2F;infection rate still seems too low. Widespread immunity appears to be the only explanation for this disparity.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bdnews24.com&#x2F;bangladesh&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;45-percent-of-dhaka-residents-carry-covid-19-antibodies-study" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bdnews24.com&#x2F;bangladesh&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;45-percent-of-dha...</a>')
