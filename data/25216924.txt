Someone who would write &quot;if (foo != true)&quot; very likely didn&#x27;t know that, and should have written &quot;if (!foo)&quot;.<p>On the other hand, blindly fixing bugs like that has a good chance of changing the program&#x27;s behavior, and possibly breaking it.<p>(All this assumes that the identifier &quot;true&quot; is visible. In C, this requires &quot;#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;&quot; -- unless the programmer defined it explicitly.)')
