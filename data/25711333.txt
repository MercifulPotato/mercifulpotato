I thought having a dog would help pass the time, motivate me to keep the habit, maybe keep me safe. The dog we adopted loves running, but play sprinting is not the same as endurance running. I want to complete this mile sub-10, she wants to mark every rock and pole on the block. Sheâ€™d be much happier if she could run trails with me off-leash, though she can be wonderful on walks and does make walking a daily habit.')
