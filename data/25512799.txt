I&#x27;ve been in the space for years too, I&#x27;ve encountered many pro-XRP folk. Every single one either didn&#x27;t know anything about it and bought because they wanted to get rich quick, or was aware the network is controlled by a consortium of banks.<p>Could you share the text of an email someone sent you that shows what they weren&#x27;t aware of?<p>Edit:<p>&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy for people to fall down the rabit hole of only reading content authored by people pumping it.<p>I also don&#x27;t even deny this. But it doesn&#x27;t excuse the irresponsible decision to buy something without understanding the most critical aspects of what it is and how it works. We should expect people to be responsible when investing, and to be able to do proper research for themselves, and to let them lose their money when they fail to do so. We don&#x27;t need to waste tax dollars babying and protecting irresponsible investors.')
