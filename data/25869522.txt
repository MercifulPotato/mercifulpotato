OS [2] a breeze of fresh air. This hardware&#x2F;software combination gives me an Apple-like experience while committing to free software. The OS’s UX is very developer friendly as windows can be moved around and tiled using keyboard shortcuts. It comes with their own app store (pop shop) which makes discovering and installing more apps dead simple. And the notebook’s build quality and performance is really good.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;system76.com&#x2F;laptops" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;system76.com&#x2F;laptops</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pop.system76.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pop.system76.com&#x2F;</a>')
