I just checked now for US prices:<p>13â€‘inch MacBook Pro (Intel Core i5) 32GB = $2059<p>13-inch Dell XPS (Intel Core i7) 32GB = $2099<p>These are both the cheapest options available for my desired configuration (32GB RAM and 13-inch screen), and MacBook has far superior build quality, trackpad and OS.<p>Probably for different specs MacBooks are comparatively more expensive (if you need powerful CPU or GPU) but for a &quot;developer&quot; use (where my main constraint is RAM, i.e. the number of apps I can have open at once) Apple isn&#x27;t actually that expensive.')
