Many of which are roughly equivalent to this in practice.  For example, using a computed strategy for distributing data among various nodes on a server.  In such a situation, a master node can run a computation on an indexed value to identify the node(s) in the cluster which contain the data and send a query request to only the nodes containing that information.<p>I would think the biggest drawback to this particular strategy is, often times, you need to analyze the data in the index to get an answer anyway.  So it&#x27;s not really beneficial to throw away the index data.  For example, if the indexed field is a timestamp, and the result set is often sorted on that field, then it makes total sense to keep the index values and use that to perform sorting while a separate thread fetches the data needed to flesh out the query.')
