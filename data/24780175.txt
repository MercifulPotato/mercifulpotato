I&#x27;ve been using a HomePod&#x2F;HomeKit for a while already, but was curious if there was a way I could get my cheapo IP cameras&#x27; feeds into the Home app. I was using Zoneminder, but that was kind of overkill and a pain to use for my use case.<p>After seeing your comment I setup HomeBridge and the homebridge-camera-ffmpeg plugin in about 10 minutes, and now I&#x27;ve got what I wanted. Thanks!')
