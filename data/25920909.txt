Item(by='franga2000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611694373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25918728, text='&gt; Mozilla can&#x27;t ethically constantly talk about privacy out of one side of its mouth while collecting data that can be used to track users who have explicitly requested them not to do that out of the other side.<p>1. They can if they&#x27;re an order of magnitude better than everyone else, just like electric car makers can talk about being environmentally friendly despite the fact lithium isn&#x27;t renewable<p>2. Are you sure it&#x27;s tracking? What data is actually sent? Crash reports, update checks, network tests, motd fetching, cache preloading... don&#x27;t count as &quot;tracking users&quot;. Hell, even reporting on statistics (version, OS, platform, region...) isn&#x27;t actually tracking users, but FF lets you disable that regardless because they know some people don&#x27;t like it.')
