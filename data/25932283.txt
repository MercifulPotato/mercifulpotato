Some coworkers don&#x27;t like it but I think the majority likes it.<p>We use eslint with a set of airbnb and unicorn rules. We went from the recommended rules and changed a few settings. Most of the rules will reformat or fix the code automatically so it&#x27;s not a huge problem during development. If it&#x27;s not automatically fixed, you will still have a link to the documentation explaining why the rule exists. You also cannot merge to the main branch if the linter is not happy.<p>And I recently started to write custom eslint rules too, it&#x27;s not very difficult and it&#x27;s fun.')
