I imagine this can be a feature in some cases and a limitation in others.<p>I tend to only use an IDE when refactoring, and a text editor for everything else. So far I haven’t had to write or work on code which I can’t keep all in my head; maybe I have just been lucky with the codebases I have worked on?')
