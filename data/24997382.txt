I was very sick in december and still have bad lungs because of it. Wether it was &quot;COVID&quot; or just multiple types of the flu hitting me relentlessly I don&#x27;t know, but the short story is that you basically are not taken serious by doctors if you come up to them and say &quot;My lungs feel really bad after that thing you said was simply the flu one year ago&quot;. And I live in Denmark, the exemplary of free medical health care...<p>Governments seem more keen on burning an uncountable amount of money on dubious PCR testing instead of treating or at least debunking any concerns of long term issues.<p>Its obvious that MY government really has no clue what they are doing. They have given themselves absolute power in this state of emergency, they make decisions and then announe them before other parties have a chance to say anything about the material handed to them.\nFirst our government sold The state serum institute to a rediculous low price to some sheikh from Saudi Arabia, and now they pay BILLIONS every month to that very same company and take all the advice they give as unconditional fact.<p>But fact is they are a private company with a stake in government funded PCR testing.')
