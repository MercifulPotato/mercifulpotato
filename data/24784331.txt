We just passed a guy in a jet pack,” an American Airlines pilot stated in a call to the control tower.<p>“American 1997, OK, thank you. Were they off to your left or right side?” the tower operator asked.<p>“Off the left side, maybe 300 yards or so, about our altitude,” the pilot responded.<p>“We just saw the guy pass us by in the jet pack,” a pilot from Jet Blue Airways then told the tower, which warned another pilot about the sighting.<p>“Only in L.A.,” the air traffic controller said at one point.</i>')
