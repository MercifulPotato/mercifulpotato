Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605029711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045731, text='&gt; There are certainly cases of that being the truth, but if you look at the time constraints and all other details, it&#x27;s hard to just blame the system. How do you actually fix the system?<p>Yeah, given all the constraints, I agree completely. My complaint is that there is a giant emphasis on testing in really scalable manners that take people and dialogue out of it. So which constraint is the system (the way things are taught and tested) most sensitive to? I expect that it&#x27;s teacher to student ratios, which my thesaurus says is a synonym for money, simultaneously the easiest and hardest constraint to change :-(')
