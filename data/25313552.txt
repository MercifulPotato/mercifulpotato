Obviously, the real divide is between &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; countries, but it&#x27;s too &quot;cruel&quot; or &quot;crass&quot; to call things what they are. It seems that the poor don&#x27;t mind that much, but the term is especially offensive for the rich, as it induces guilt in some of them and a fear of retribution in others. Anyway, whatever else is used in place of rich&#x2F;poor, is bound to comically fall flat on its face, i.e.:<p>- &quot;third world&quot; should include Switzerland and Austria, as they were neutral during the cold war<p>- &quot;developing countries&quot; should not include places in major wars or civil wars (such as for example not Yemen), as they&#x27;re clearly not developing, but rather deteriorating.<p>- as you point out, &quot;global south&quot; should include the wealthy Australia.<p>It also expands into other examples of hypocrisy, such as the term &quot;African-American&quot;, which is just an euphemism for black Americans (which itself suggest that being black is bad somehow), but due to its clumsiness also includes lots of non-black people, such as Tunesian-Americans (no black people there).')
