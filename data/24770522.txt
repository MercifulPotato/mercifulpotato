The letter of the service being offered<p>2. The spirit of the service being offered<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve always thought #2 was more important than #1.  Unfortunately, #1 is often the one that gets enforced, especially when lawyers get involved, which is why legalese exists because when you know people argue from the standpoint of #1, you have to make sure there aren&#x27;t any loopholes.  But I&#x27;m digressing a bit here...<p>Look, just because a company offers something &quot;unlimited&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it can&#x27;t be abused.  To argue otherwise is bad faith, IMO.  We can argue over where the line is, but that&#x27;s just a pointless distraction.<p>But I think everyone would agree that storing a petabyte of data with a service that offers &quot;unlimited&quot; storage for $12&#x2F;month is abuse.')
