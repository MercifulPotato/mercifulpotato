Github only hosts projects publicly for people who want to host their project publicly.<p>They don&#x27;t have a mantra of all information wants to be free, and indeed their entire business model relies on hosting private repos.<p>I understand people wanting to host their open source on a server that&#x27;s also open source. There&#x27;s an argument it makes business sense if the closed source setup creates a long-term drift to GitLab or elsewhere. Nevertheless, I don&#x27;t see the closed source as a contradiction.<p>You can love open source while producing a mix of open and closed source. Building a sustainable business often means being selective about it and seeing open source as a tool you can benefit from (enlightened self-interest), rather than an ideology you must adhere to at all times.')
