Is this a new general policy they&#x27;re going to implement for every account that&#x27;s associated with a position rather than a person?  If it&#x27;s one off, special thing then it&#x27;s a really bad idea.  If it&#x27;s a new policy is fine too archive to mark the change of ownership but they should never drop the followers.')
