But these days it&#x27;s just so expensive, both in terms of money and time, that I gave most of that up.<p>And that&#x27;s a lot of paper to have around, so I generally just read stuff online these days.<p>I agree with several of the other commenters here in suggesting you go to a real book&#x2F;magazine store and look around.  Then check out the online versions magazines you identified and make sure it&#x27;s something in which you&#x27;re willing to invest time and money.<p>I&#x27;d give an extra plug to The Economist, as it&#x27;s generally really well written and will spur you to think even if you disagree with some of their positions.')
