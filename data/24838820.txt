That was may be 2 years ago.<p>Except HSGT is still everywhere. And I know people demand HGST. I think partly due to Backblaze&#x27;s numbers. Even the Western Digital UltraStar still has HGST in labels, stickers or description somewhere. Retailers simply call them HGST WD most likely because that is what customers want or are looking for.<p>It seems Western Digital did at one point try to move their marketing material to focus on <i>UltraStar</i>, but my suspicious is that people still want HGST. Again, may be due to Backblaze quarterly report cause they dont show any UltraStar branding, they use HGST.')
