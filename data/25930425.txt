Item(by='ihsw', descendants=None, kids=[25930878, 25931317, 25930737, 25930666], score=None, time=1611766110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930251, text='There is only so much money for businesses to allocate towards labor, it is not infinite.<p>Eg: $15K per month for staffing translates to $3750 per week, which translates to $125 per hour at 30 hours per week on average, which translates to ~10 staff at $12 per hour.<p>At $15 per hour that is reduced to 8 staff. Alternatively the hours for 10 staff would be reduced from 30 hours per week to 24 hours per week.<p>The money doesn&#x27;t come from thin air, raising minimum wage for 10 staff at $12 per hour to $15 doesn&#x27;t mean there will be no layoffs or reduction in hours.<p>Increasing prices of products sold or services rendered would result in a reduction in products sold or services rendered. Again, the money doesn&#x27;t come from thin air -- either prices are raised or staff costing is reduced through cut hours or cut headcount.<p>Who gets cut is another question too -- more than likely it is tied to appearance, education, likeability, or seniority. Who gets hired is another question too -- if the bar is too high for an uneducated black youth then they will simply not get hired. An increase in the minimum wage can result (and has historically resulted in) in higher unemployment among black youth.')
