Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611809836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938027, text='&gt; This was a affluent suburb of a Canadian city.<p>Same, but in SoCal; it was easier to get high grade weed than it was to get beer, so most house parties were always well stocked with weed they seldom had alcohol unless they knew or were paying off certain places that sold them to minors in large quantities which carried lots of costs and risks, so a house party of 200+ guests would always be a challenge<p>Culturally weed was way more tolerated than alcohol as a result growing up, but still had a negative stigma as a &#x27;losers drug of choice&#x27; despite its wide legal use, which is what made me gravitate toward hard alcohol as it had some exclusivity but also just better experience in a social setting than weed.<p>Flash forward a decade and I get involved in the hemp Industry and travel all over Europe and then return to the US (Colorado) where Hemp was starting to make inroads, and I realized a lot of the people in the Industry were former MJ (including my cofounder) and weren&#x27;t &#x27;lazy stoners with no ambition&#x27; as they were farmers as well as entrepreneurs, but they simply used a drug that I associated with decompression and relaxation in what I regarded a hyper competitive social setting like a conference or Industry party.<p>My point is that I think it varies culturally now that its been decriminalized and legalized in many parts of the World, and to be honest asking people if they want to smoke a bowl is just as common in some cities if they want a cup of coffee, and since I don&#x27;t like caffeine and have a low THC tolerance I usually have to carry high CBD&#x2F;CBN&#x2F;CBG strains so as to no completely fall asleep due to the high THC strains most regular users smoke.<p>It&#x27;s odd because in my teens and early 20s I felt that DARE indoctrination creep in and felt were were doing &#x27;something bad&#x27; and we were going to get caught despite living and working in a legal state (CA or CO), but upon further analysis the truth is what I was putting into my body during a 2-3 Martini &#x27;power lunch meeting&#x27; followed by a double espresso as a pick me up somewhere in between was way worse for me personally than if we had just took a drag from a joint outside before diving in and talking business and finalizing deals.<p>It&#x27;s odd, and the stoner reputation is real in many cases, but I think a lot of it as in most sweeping generalizations, is conflated with a lot of misguided stereotypes.<p>I have been outpaced by 50+ year old couple with kids who drank and smoked weed on a regular basis as a a fit 20 something with no real responsibilities other than myself. Nothing I could do short of not sleeping made me as productive as that couple, even on an individual basis and I learned a lot about my own preconceived biases and confirmation biases. Most of it forced upon me by convention but also personal experiences that I&#x27;m glad to say I challenged and have become a better a person as a result.')
