To my mind, that was analogous to a major city gone amok: unprecedented competition with everyone vying for attention.<p>One guy paints his sign on his window. The next guy lights up his sign. The next backlights a plexiglass sign. The next uses neon. The next blinks his neon. And so on.<p>It took some time, but we&#x27;re about at the point of maximum stimulus on the internet. And so to compete, the messaging follows a similar pattern. And eventually some people believe what they read. And others believe what they write.<p>Those that believe what they write become desensitized. Those that believe what they read become indoctrinated. And you&#x27;re left with this emergent characteristic of a chaotic system stuck in feedback loops.<p>What you read as overstated, others will read as gospel and damn you for underplaying the emergency. And they will try to shout louder than the next, because everyone is a storefront for something; profit, or power, or ego, or social status.<p>So what&#x27;s an apocalypse?<p>Not global climate change.<p>The apocalypse is what you witness as you try to decipher and pick apart the insanity that has become not only the internet, but soon the whole of humanity.<p>The climate change cathedral had it right all along: we are the apocalypse. But they got wrong the cause.<p>The cause is not climate change. Or fascism. Or racism. Or even hatred.<p>The cause of our apocalypse is us, by virtue of our connected hyper-competition. The apocalypse is the &quot;human superhighway.&quot;')
