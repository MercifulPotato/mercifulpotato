I don&#x27;t think nix is inherently going to help with the other half, which is to leave gotchas for what <i>is</i> visible&#x2F;accessible (i.e. lots of files with spaces in their names, maybe a few files named ex. `-h` or `-rf` sitting in common directories, or for that matter have something available by the same name, but a different version, ex. your PATH contains <i>a</i> grep, but it&#x27;s from busybox, not GNU).')
