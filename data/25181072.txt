Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606078953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179761, text='No, Bain has a unique history of acquiring companies that are doing fine pre-acquisition which struggle post-acquisition because they are saddled with acquisition-financing debt placed on them by Bain and thus cannot afford to invest in product development, renovating stores, or other necessary business expenses.<p>Worse, Bain takes the money that would have been used on corporate reinvestment in the absence of an acquisition, and which should be used to pay down the acquisition debt arising from the acquisition, and uses it to pay themselves hundreds of millions in &quot;management fees&quot; despite not actually managing anything. Also, PR to congratulate themselves for the wonderful job they&#x27;ve done &quot;cutting expenses,&quot; meaning the tens of thousands of jobs that were cut so that Bain could get paid.<p>Bain is parasite. They&#x27;ve <i>always</i> been a parasite, to the point that they even found ways to turn their few successes (like Staples) into failures.')
