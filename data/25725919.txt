Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610351005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719781, text='&gt; This is a strange characterization of the increase in CO2 and resultant heat retention. It&#x27;s not itself &quot;unstable&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you got this from what I wrote. I specifically said &quot;changing the chemistry of the atmosphere&quot;, which is not a strange characterization of an &quot;increase of CO2&quot; in the atmosphere, it is word for word a correct description of that action. I have no idea what you mean by &quot;It&#x27;s not itself &quot;unstable&quot;, especially in the context. If you mean that changing the chemical makeup of the atmosphere doesn&#x27;t make climate patterns unstable, then you&#x27;re just wrong.<p>&gt; Selecting only a specific set of events in specific areas is, by definition, cherry picking data.<p>This also literally has nothing to do with what I said. Are you some kind of weird GPT bot or something? I&#x27;d assume you accidentally wrote back to the wrong comment, but you quoted me... If you&#x27;d go ahead and reread my post, and not skip the big words, you&#x27;ll see that I was trying to convey that because we have such limited data, and it&#x27;s data from a system that&#x27;s ridiculously large and dynamic compared to the data, any purely statistical analysis is going to be absolute garbage. Hence, you also need to use logical reasoning about cause and effect, what types of chemical shifts in the atmosphere will cause what types of outcomes.<p>But really, you need to stay a little more on task if you&#x27;d like to discuss and debate. Just confusing at this point, and I&#x27;m still not sure if you&#x27;re trolling or a bot or just flailing.')
