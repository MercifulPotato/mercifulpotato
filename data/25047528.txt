I really only use the client to launch the games though, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the other issues.<p>As far as the games go, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how well Proton works so far! I was thinking about running Windows in a VM and doing GPU passthrough when I get a desktop next year, but with how well Proton has been working on my laptop (with only integrated gpu), I may not need to -- Proton may work perfectly well. In X11 (sadly, since I use Sway for my non-gaming use).')
