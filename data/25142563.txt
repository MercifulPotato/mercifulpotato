The new tensorflow_macos fork of TensorFlow 2.4 leverages ML Compute to enable machine learning libraries to take full advantage of not only the CPU, but also the GPU in both M1- and Intel-powered Macs for dramatically faster training performance.<p>It sounds like the performance gains are because they are now using GPU and CPU instead of just CPU.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;updates&#x2F;ml-compute-training-on-mac" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;updates&#x2F;ml-compute-trainin...</a>')
