The only way to measure mass in free-fall is to spin the entire craft and measure where the center of rotation is compered to before the sample capture. The difference is then used to calculate the sample mass.<p>With the sample at the end of a long arm, the spacecraft doesn&#x27;t have to rotate very fast to get a large enough difference in rotation to measure the sample. If the sample is in the return capsule, the moment is so much smaller that it&#x27;s probably below the sensitivity of the instruments they were planning to use.')
