And I don&#x27;t mean that as an insult - I mean that when confronted with that they&#x27;re clearly irrational. And something&#x27;s gotta be going on their heads that makes them cling to this hypothesis. Don&#x27;t know if mental illness is going up or down - our understanding and perception of it has changed so there&#x27;s hardly reliable data on it. I&#x27;d have to go through a similar thought process as this article. But I think it&#x27;s a factor, beyond &quot;new media&quot;. I suspect that the toxic politics in the US is a similar phenomenon, the way people are controlled by confirmation bias and can twist their way into believing &quot;my guy good, other guy bad&quot; under almost any circumstances.')
