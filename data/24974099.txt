Alternatives like GCS?  Or actual on-premises hardware? Or what? When you &quot;move clients off AWS every chance you get&quot;, you are moving them to what instead?<p>I&#x27;m having trouble following your theory of why having clients stay on AWS ends up leading to more consultant billable hours, I think because I don&#x27;t understand what alternatives you are comparing it to. I am pretty sure it is not heroku, as in the earlier part of the thread?<p>Or are you talking about compared to simpler &quot;vps&quot; hosts like, say, linode?  Doesn&#x27;t that require a lot more ops skillset and time to set up and run compared to aws, or you don&#x27;t think it does?')
