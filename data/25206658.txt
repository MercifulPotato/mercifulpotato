Then if the task takes longer, throttle down as needed to regulate heat dissipation. Since there are a lot of small tasks when using a computer that would be also better for responsiveness. It&#x27;s not like a car that takes a lot of energy to accelerate, you can just change the CPU clock speed as you want. What I&#x27;d like to see is a benchmark of the actual amount of energy used to perform tasks in various conditions.')
