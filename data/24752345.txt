Just this morning I was reading this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.city-journal.org&#x2F;california-race-coding-criteria-for-reopening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.city-journal.org&#x2F;california-race-coding-criteria...</a><p><i>Public health authorities in California have unveiled a “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” that requires counties to meet new “health equity metrics” in order to emerge from the current Covid-19 lockdowns. It’s a broad experiment in social justice. Under the plan, counties must reduce “disparities in levels of transmission” in “low-income, Black, Latino, [and] Pacific Islander” communities before they can move forward with reopening. In effect, local businesses must remain closed until local bureaucrats are satisfied that ill-defined racial quotas have been met.</i><p>The American left can&#x27;t normally push too hard against free markets because they lost that argument conclusively and completely when the USSR collapsed (really, a long time before). But now they see an opening, so suddenly businesses and markets are being held hostage: implement the left&#x27;s current social agenda or else your businesses will be kept closed indefinitely for &quot;health reasons&quot;. These are not the actions of people who see value in private enterprise.')
