I was in high school and Mandelbrot and my father were collaborating on something. They both worked at IBM TJ Watson and were the product of the same &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; French educational system. He would call really late at night (midnight), and once I answered the phone simply to fetch my father. My understanding from, several sources -- I met one other person who worked for him at IBM, is that he was not the easiest person to work with. Anyway, I was an early fan of fractals thanks to this &quot;inside connection&quot;, so to speak.')
