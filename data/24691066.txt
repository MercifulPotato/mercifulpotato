Item(by='USNetizen', descendants=None, kids=[24691144], score=None, time=1601925753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24690782, text='Having done the same thing myself (bootstrapped a services company from $0 to over $8M&#x2F;year in revenue in 5 years and grown a SaaS product from $0 to ~$800k ARR in 16 months completely bootstrapped), you can go into debt for a short time while bootstrapping, but generally not 3.5+ years unless you are independently wealthy or have a retirement nest egg you&#x27;ve been saving for a few decades you&#x27;re prepared to liquidate.<p>At some point your access to capital dries up when banks see your level of risk increase. You might be able to survive moderate losses for a year or two and cover it with personal debt financing, depending on how much money and access to capital you have personally, but 3.5 to 4 years covering losses with personal debt is REALLY pushing it. You&#x27;re most likely talking several hundred thousand dollars at that point even for a small startup.<p>And $1M ARR is only enough to support a team of 9 if the average salary being paid is around $50k-$55k&#x2F;year (or if 2 or more people aren&#x27;t even drawing a salary). Which makes sense because, in their blog, they describe hiring someone for marketing that was much less &quot;senior&quot; - i.e. cheaper - and not being happy with it. Taxes, fees, registrations, legal&#x2F;accounting, benefits (if any), insurance, hosting, technical infrastructure, etc. can easily eat up over $300k&#x2F;yr for a team of 9 - not including direct payroll.')
