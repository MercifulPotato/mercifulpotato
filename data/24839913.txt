I believe Apple could have prevented FB Messenger from being a thing, had they released an Android client along with a browser extension. Apple&#x27;s best move was releasing iTunes for Windows, something they are scared to repeat, and shouldnt be.<p>I wonder what the numbers are on WhatsApp vs FB Messenger, because people of all socioeconomic levels, languages, ages, country, and tech literacy use WhatsApp in my experience, whereas only Americans of a certain age group use FB Messenger.')
