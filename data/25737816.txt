I had pre-ordered this game a long time ago and it was genuinely fun on release, there are some bugged quests and I don&#x27;t have a card capable of rendering ridiculously good graphics but it&#x27;s playable and fun.<p>From what I&#x27;ve heard the PS release is absolutely worth getting mad over - it&#x27;s likely that CDPR should have just given up on even attempting a PS release given how poor the performance is but it probably needs some serious investigation to see what pressure Sony was putting on them to make sure it was available.')
