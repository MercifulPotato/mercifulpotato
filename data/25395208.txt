It&#x27;s based on 1-1&#x2F;R0.  If R0 is 3, then you need 66.7% to no longer be susceptible before cases start to decay.  If the vaccine is 95% effective, then you need about 70% vaccinated to get 66.7% no longer susceptible.<p>But: 1-1&#x2F;R0 assumes universal, uniform susceptibility and uniform contact graph, which aren&#x27;t true-- so it&#x27;s pessimistic.  And some people have caught the virus already and are no longer susceptible through that means.<p>Many computational models put it at about `25% of people infected will result in herd immunity with normal behavior, and the US is presently at about 16%.  Unfortunately, getting the &quot;right&quot; additional 9% of people will require vaccinating much more than 9% of the population (we&#x27;re not as good at selecting the most susceptible and most involved in spreading as the virus itself), but substantially less than 70%.<p>Further, R0 is based on <i>baseline</i> behavior.  I suspect a decent chunk of us will be much more careful for some time, which effectively changes the required decrease in susceptibility to cause a case count decay.<p>&gt; Latest COVID-19 infection totals come to about 16 million. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;us&#x2F;coronavirus-us-c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;us&#x2F;coronavirus-us-c</a>...<p>Current COVID-19 infection total estimate per CDC is about 53 million infections so far. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;cases-updates&#x2F;burd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;cases-updates&#x2F;burd</a>...')
