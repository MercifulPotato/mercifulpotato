If I understand correctly, Apple&#x27;s using their old standby of 256Kbps AAC and Spotify uses 320Kbps Vorbis, so Spotify is slightly better on the technical merits -- but they&#x27;re both at sufficiently high quality that audio nerds would be demanding anyone who claims a definitive difference do some blind ABX testing to prove it.<p>I ended up sticking with Apple Music after my Spotify Premium trial ran out, but I suspect that&#x27;s largely because it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;ve seen lots of &quot;Apple Music&#x27;s recommendation engine is crap,&quot; but that&#x27;s not actually been my experience -- their &quot;New Music Mix&quot; isn&#x27;t great, but the whole of their &quot;For You&quot; page almost always has stuff I&#x27;m interested in and I really like digging through their curated playlists. It&#x27;s been a much more rewarding service for just digging around exploring in than either Spotify or Tidal have been for me. (Although Tidal undoubtedly has the best sound quality if you&#x27;re willing to pony up for the lossless&#x2F;MQA tier.)')
