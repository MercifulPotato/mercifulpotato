For example, a fine hotel in Aspen compared with homelessness on the streets of San Francisco.<p>It is an obvious conjecture that the vigilance ought to persist in the higher risk environment.  If so, I wonder (a) how the effect might vary over time in the high risk environment, and (b) what health consequences ensue from chronic FNE?')
