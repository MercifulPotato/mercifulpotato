He&#x27;s ascribing to the maximalist interpretation of open source licensing. Licensing which never had any idea that Open Source would one day take over the world, licensing which never could&#x27;ve imagined that cloud providers would begin to undermine and influence projects to their own ends.<p>The problem that Drew is willfully ignoring here is that corporations see an opportunity in open source licensing to hijack projects, which I would remind you is <i>exactly</i> what is happening with Kibana. The control shifts away from the <i>thousands of contributors</i> and gets a board of engineers employed by corporations. Once these projects land in corporate control there&#x27;s no denying that their culture and terms change. The CLA&#x27;s he wrote about will surely be enforced, and if everyone ascribes to his belief system then the project will delve into chaos.<p>Corporations like ElasticSearch <i>were</i> setup to sustain the project that <i>is</i> ElasticSearch. If you destroy them, then you will get Amazon&#x27;s vision of ElasticSearch, not what the contributors chose, certainly not what the creators chose. When forks happen, they happen. There is a big difference between some random or influential person forking Elastic Search and a conglomerate, who is really only forking it because they intend to undermine the business that was setup to sustain the project in the first place. Want to see a fork I was completely fine with? Look at Gogs versus Gitea.<p>The fact that they cleared a billion dollars is so arbitrary. At what threshold should anyone with principals and a backbone stop caring? At what point should someone like me not care if a conglomerate comes along to replicate and wipe out SourceHut? This has nothing to do with ElasticSearch and has everything to do with corporations flexing power, power which has repeatedly been used to influence and undermine projects in the open landscape that doesn&#x27;t make it quite so open anymore.')
