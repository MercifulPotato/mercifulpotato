This is a shameless self plug but we - that is Pimoroni - are working on 32blit which is an STM32F750-based microcontroller games console that should be up for general sale <i>soooon</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;pimoroni&#x2F;32blit-retro-inspired-handheld-with-open-source-fi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;pimoroni&#x2F;32blit-retro-i...</a><p>Our beta backer tier have been godlike in their ability to make the STM32 do things I&#x27;d never thought we&#x27;d see... much less see before it&#x27;s even launched.
