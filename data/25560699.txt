Nothing but houses for as far as you can see.<p>That certainly exists in some places, I&#x27;m sure.  But some of us grew up in places like Portland, Oregon, which is essentially one big suburban city (sure, there is an urban core, but it&#x27;s tiny).  Lots of single family houses, but lots of retail, industrial, and office space intermixed.  Very walkable in most areas.<p>I think a lot of the break down of suburban discussion happens because of this.  There&#x27;s a pretty wide range of perception based on different life experience.')
