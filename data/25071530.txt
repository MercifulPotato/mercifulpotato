But now my main laptop runs Linux, and my Android phone&#x2F;tablet both have SD slots, so it&#x27;s much easier to me just to pop in a 128GB SD card into both and opt for local storage.<p>I guess if I ever switch to Pixel phones again, the loss of SD slot might be a problem, so again, it&#x27;s sort of a Google fix to a problem Google caused in the first place...')
