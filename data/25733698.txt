Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610390218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731964, text='There was a discussion here on HN perhaps 8 or 10 years ago that led me to realize I was doing essentially that. I <i>talked</i> about getting in shape and other goals, and got an emotional high (of a sort) from the response I got and from thinking about what I would do to get in shape and be able to do once I was in shape. But I never followed through.<p>Then I shut up about it, and actually got in shape. And when I ran into some people who I rarely saw, and they were shocked by my 40+ lb weight loss and how good I looked, I got that same emotional reward but also the actual reward of being in shape and being able to do the things I&#x27;d only imagined being able to do.<p>Now I discuss what I&#x27;m doing with some like minded friends and we keep each other accountable (Hey, how&#x27;s the running going? Made it a full 10k yet?). But I don&#x27;t discuss it with other people in general unless it&#x27;s brought up by them. A kind of happy-medium between the talk-too-much and just-shut-up-and-work modes of operation.')
