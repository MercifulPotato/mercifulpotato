From 11pm-7am, the cost is a penny per kilowatt hour, so practically free. Outside of those hours, the cost is either seven cents or twenty cents per kwh depending on the time of day and season. A 20X difference in charging cost is a pretty good incentive to plan things out so the car can be charged overnight.')
