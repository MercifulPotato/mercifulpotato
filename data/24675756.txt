If someone is predicted to commit a crime it makes radically more sense (as far as avoiding acting on false positives) to surveil them in a clandestine fashion and simply allow them to commit the crime while you record the evidence. An arresting officer can be dispatched later to make the arrest without any need to risk escalating an in-progress crime.')
