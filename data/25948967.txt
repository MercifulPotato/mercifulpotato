The reason I know this is because I was on the phone with a friend at 9am Central and neither him nor I were able to purchase $GME, $BB or $GMC (he&#x27;s on Ally and I&#x27;m on Etrade). Around the same time I started seeing messages on social media that TD was also blocking traders. I think you&#x27;re right that the order likely came from MMs and everyone followed through.')
