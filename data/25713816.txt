Work hard is Good. It&#x27;s deep in the US culture. There&#x27;s even a quote from Wesley about work in another comment here!<p>So deep that in the recent &quot;i was fired from X&quot; articles, the subject points out that their colleagues were lazy and they worked hard. Whereas a southern (or culturally Catholic) European would see that this shows their colleagues also hated the place, and that there&#x27;s no shame in being lazy.<p>It&#x27;s not an obsession and not something that can be stopped. It&#x27;s utterly integral in all of American society even the left wing radical side.<p>Progressivism is basically the belief that doing hard good work brings Good things.<p>(A non protestant culture would emphasise belief and being a better person more than doing good works)')
