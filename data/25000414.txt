Software that helps the prefetchers, due to how AMD has arranged the branch predictors, can now process three prefetch commands per cycle. The other element is the introduction of a hardware accelerator with parallel bits: latency is reduced 99% and throughput is up 250x.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<p>It talks about pdep&#x2F;pext and links them to prefetchers - what? Weirder yet &quot;is the introduction of a hardware accelerator with parallel bits&quot; all that&#x27;s happened, and backed up by earlier info in the article, is that these were trapped+emulated before, hence their hideous cost, and now they&#x27;re in hardware[0]. It comes across as if someone didn&#x27;t understand that.<p>[0] calling it a &#x27;hardware accelerator&#x27; is just peculiar.')
