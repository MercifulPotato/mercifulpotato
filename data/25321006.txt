Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607228443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319887, text='&quot;Back in my day&quot; we just set up card skimmers in the places that tended to attract the most law enforcement attention.  Nobody blinks twice when &quot;campus PD carded into X at 1:44AM&quot; shows up in the logs.  We also exploited the dining hall unlimited meals (if you pay a stupid amount, supposedly limited to only the individual who paid) program to the benefit of several dozen people (and there was at least one frat doing the same in parallel).  We were smart but not geniuses.  I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s thousands of college students out there exploiting the various ineptitude of colleges.  Colleges have a very adversarial relationship with their undergrads so it&#x27;s no surprise.')
