There needs to be a solid handle allowing to pull a sticky door with as much force as a first responder might be able to summon up. While not hiding, the handles of the Model 3 are not great either, because they don&#x27;t allow much pulling force. Also, the opening of the door on the inside could be much better designed with a larger and more obvious lever. No idea what issues Tesla has with designing proper door handles.')
