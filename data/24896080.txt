About 10 years ago, I was pulled into a situation where PET imaging patients were setting off radiation detectors coming back into the US at border crossings.  Now, it&#x27;s not unusual for patients who have been given radioisotopes to set off detectors at airports, etc, what was unusual is that PET isotopes usually have very short half-lives.  In this case, the patients had been given Rb-82, which has a half-life just over 1 minute.  Yet they were setting off detectors weeks after getting PET scans.<p>What was happening was that there was contamination of the isotope.  They were getting more than the allowable amount of Sr-82 along with the Rb-82.  Sr-82 has a half life of about 25 days.<p>The way that Rb-82 is made, is the pharmacy is provided with a generator or &#x27;cow&#x27;, which is a bunch of Sr-82 which decays to make Rb-82.  The &#x27;cow&#x27; is &#x27;milked&#x27;, which means passing saline through it, and if all goes well the Rb-82 comes out with the saline and the Sr-82 stays in the cow.  Some Sr-82 always gets out but usually it is a small amount.<p>Now, Sr-82 is not easy to measure, and the limits are very small.  Sr-82 only has a few very low energy gammas.  I happen to be an expert in the type of device normally used to measure it (a re-entrant dose calibrator).  The QA check used in the clinics was, shall we say, optimistic about the ability to detect it.<p>Here&#x27;s an article about the situation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;drug-safety-and-availability&#x2F;fda-drug-safety-communication-planned-return-cardiogen-82-market-new-boxed-warning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;drug-safety-and-availability&#x2F;fda-d...</a>')
