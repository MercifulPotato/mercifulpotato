People seem to have taken up cycling in cities due to the risk of riding on public transit. And as someone else said, taking a 50+lbs (25kg) e-bike inside or even upstairs is a pain.<p>But I think most of all, this is sort of a &quot;halo&quot; product - the best bike they could build, probably very expensive, but &quot;sexy&quot; and definitely news-worthy - as this HN submission has shown. And in the future they can launch cheaper alu-framed versions of this bike when this bike has established LeMond&#x27;s e-bike reputation.')
