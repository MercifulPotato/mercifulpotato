Intel had USB for almost two years yet PC&#x27;s still shipped with serial&#x2F;parallel ports.  Then the candy colored iMacs hit, and all the accessory makers started chasing them with candy colored USB accessories and then all the sudden the PC vendors woke up to USB.  USB was a disaster on Windows 95, Marginally better on Windows 2000 but didn&#x27;t get decent until XP.<p>Wifi - Apple not only released wifi on their laptop but a whole ecosystem - Access points too.  One app to configure and manage everything.  Push button simplicity.  Wifi thrashed around on PC vendors and was relegated to PCMCIA cards with dorky external antennas before Apple baked it in and pretty much embarrassed the rest of the industry to stop nickel and dimeing everyone as an add on and just include it as base tech. Or at least bury the antennas in every laptop and still charge people for an optional internal card.  How long did that continue for?<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some others I could think two but I vividly remember living through both of those as I had a foot in each camp at the time (actually I was more PC back then since before the iMac is was the craptastic, uninspired and overprice Performa years for the Mac - the PowerPC iMacs brought me back into the Mac fold).<p>PC has always been focused on high volume, low margin, least common denominator hardware.  Big bins of unremarkable but functional interchangeable parts.  Major Pro&#x27;s of that strategy are pricing and choice.  Major Con&#x27;s are instability&#x2F;incompatibility&#x2F;driver issues and lack of moving innovation forward.<p>Apple has never (and will never) play in the value market.  Remember how Apple was supposedly doomed because they didn&#x27;t have a netbook?  Who still uses netbooks (or even remembers them other than us geeks?) By not playing in the value market (or race to the bottom) it frees them up to do things like the M1.<p>Fast&#x2F;Good&#x2F;Cheap.  Pick any <i>two</i>')
