There is nothing in the statute that allows this. Only after the expiration of the copyright does the work go into public domain.<p>Copyright stays with the author (or heirs) and is subject to license termination after 35 years. This would mean the declaration of &quot;use freely&quot; can be revoked. Which is why these works cannot treated as if they are in the public domain.')
