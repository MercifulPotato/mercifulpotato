Either can be acceptable depending on the time and place. My time is functionally invaluable, as is yours. What is the salary range of engineers for this position at your company?&quot;<p>Then dovetail that conversation into the larger compensation package talk. Shares, vesting schedule, valuation&#x2F;cap table, bonuses, signing bonus, moving expenses, hardware provided, healthcare, 401k, etc. I like to talk about bonuses and the specifics of the bonus determination and request 30&#x2F;60&#x2F;90 day review as I start to get adjusted to company culture. No one EVER does the 30&#x2F;60&#x2F;90, but they enthusiastically agree to it. Also no one ever shares specifics on how they determine bonuses. But they like to pretend that a standard exist and you can gain a lot by talking about it, even if all you get is an clear picture of how totally nuts the place is that you&#x27;re about to work for.')
