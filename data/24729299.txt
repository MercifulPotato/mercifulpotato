In his Revelation Space universe, Alastair Reynolds categorises AI as Alphas (full brain simulations), Betas (non-conscious mimics which are based on a person’s behaviour over an unspecified but very long time period), and Gammas (which I read as being mere apps with voice interfaces).<p>If the goal is to make it seem like your present when you aren’t, I can believe we’re only a few years away from Reynolds‘ Betas — a Markov chain can’t mimic a human <i>well</i>, but it can mimic a human; GPT3 can do better, and while it still isn’t <i>great</i>, the main reason it feels like it might not be enough for public figures is how easy it is to get it to answer as if it were someone else rather than as The Right Honourable Sir Obvious Madeupname, MP for Oxbridge-upon-Wells who is paying for the chatbot to mimic him in particular.')
