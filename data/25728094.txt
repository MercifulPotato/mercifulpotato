Item(by='Timpy', descendants=None, kids=[25728225], score=None, time=1610368670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719796, text='&gt; Why was there a Windows monopoly? I think it’s a stretch to just blame it on OEM bundling. No, it’s legit because there isn’t anything else.<p>I agree GNOME-3 is blocked toilet, but Windows 10 is also a blocked toilet.  I have a file that I would like to open on my Windows 10 computer &quot;passport.pdf&quot;, I hit the winkey and type &quot;passport [enter]&quot; to open the file.  Windows launched a Bing search on Edge for the word &quot;passport&quot;, but Edge has to go through its welcome dialog because I&#x27;ve never opened it before.  This is only one example; all in all using Windows 10 is like taking a hike with a rock in your shoe.<p>Windows WAS a monopoly because of its usability, but now it&#x27;s ubiquitous because we&#x27;re path dependant.  Having to use Windows 10 for me is having to walk downstairs to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.  I wish I could stay on Windows 7 forever, but I&#x27;m very happy with Mint Cinnamon DE for now.')
