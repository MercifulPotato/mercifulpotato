And how much you have to pay is based upon how often you do.  If your codebase has certain dark corners you never have to visit, then you are never paying interest on that debt.<p>If someone has to tweak something there once per month you pay basically no interest.<p>But when the debt lies within the core of your system it can be very painful.  If you have some side submodule that has debt in it, no big deal.  But if the core of how your system works is debt-ridden, it will grow like a cancer and reach its tendrils in to every aspect of the project.')
