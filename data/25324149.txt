These properties are probably not what you want for most practical applications.<p>For most practical applications a git repo where you have some set of trusted notaries and at least M of N notaries must sign each commit is probably closer to what you want. (Or something that is similar logically but still does not fit the standard definition of blockchain, which again is trustless.)')
