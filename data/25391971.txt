Conflating the two doesn&#x27;t help anything.<p>The author&#x27;s link to support the structure that collects sales tax at every step is really gross receipts. Perhaps there&#x27;s a better site with a good example and a link to a sales tax structure that exists as they depict it in this article. Even if it did work that way, the primary drivers for vertical integration would be the option to shrink the margins at each step and supply chain control (quality, moating, etc).<p>Is there an article discussing the differences in policies and rates of vertical integration between counties and the effects of it? It might be better to show that, rather than this article.')
