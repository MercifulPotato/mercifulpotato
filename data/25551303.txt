There&#x27;s no rule that you need to make a strategy game that focuses so much on fast clicking - games like Wargame series, original Company of Heroes, Dawn of War and even Age of Empires II have significantly less of a &quot;mad clicking&quot; requirement and focus more on economic and strategy aspects of the game.<p>It&#x27;s kinda ironic that &quot;strategy&quot; genre has ended up bogged down in small unit tactics, with units too stupid to actually use correct weapons by themselves. No wonder we all lost interest into the genre.')
