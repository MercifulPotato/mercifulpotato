There&#x27;s currently no other company that can offer services that match the quality of the product TikTok is giving. The US government&#x27;s solution? Force ByteDance to divest unless it wants to get banned. This is Big Tech protectionism, perfected.<p>In the same vein, the US is going to force Google to break itself into fragments. This can also be seen as a Big Tech protectionist measure, because Google has no incentive to improve its monopolistic byproducts. In fact, it routinely kills them. Spinoff companies of Google will compete with each other and undoubtedly yield much better (and pro-consumer) products, no matter which way you look at it.')
