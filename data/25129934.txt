Judging by the lack of sanitation in many of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods, my uninformed guess is that there was already a lack of such funds before COVID hit.<p>The impact of this flight on the tax base could be even more severe if the people leaving are higher-than-average earners (which, given their mobility, my guess is they are).<p>Moving to a new city is a non-trivial life change, and once people move, they&#x27;re unlikely to move back anytime soon.  At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if we&#x27;ll be comparing San Francisco with Detroit in 5 years.  I hope I&#x27;m wrong.')
