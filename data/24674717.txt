I&#x27;d expect more future uses of xdp over dpdk. As for max performance (I saw a Linux server max out multiple 10 GbE ports years ago) I&#x27;m not sure anyone right now knows what it is. We&#x27;ve recently added XDP, io_uring, BPF congestion control algorithms, and more. There are performance numbers for these in isolation, but I don&#x27;t think anyone has performance tested (and tuned) them all working together yet.<p>And that poses a problem: to reach maximum performance requires many engineering hours to learn and configure all of these. You&#x27;d need a large gain to justify doing this: E.g., for a system doing over 1M packets&#x2F;s.<p>This complexity may change. Look at BPF for observability: we built BCC and bpftrace so that using it was trivial. What trivial front-end&#x2F;technology could we build upon XDP and io_uring to make deployment easy?')
