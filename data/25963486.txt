Item(by='harikb', descendants=None, kids=[25963528], score=None, time=1611958853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963204, text='&quot;15 minutes&quot; to settle cash for next trade is enough &quot;instant&quot; for most traders I think. The part that irritates people is the &quot;2 business days&quot; problem in the regular account.<p>I have heard it is complicated, but can someone elaborate the &quot;computing cost&quot; of a regular (non-coin) digital transfer?<p>Btw, transfers within 15 minutes are being done all over the world without the fancy blockchain and coin. I do understand the need for some transfers to be delayed , say liquidating all of one&#x27;s investment to take a few days just for security reasons.')
