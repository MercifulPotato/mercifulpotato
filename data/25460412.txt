It&#x27;s a fascinating time to be a spectator from the sidelines.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the &quot;aggressive&quot; setting on my retirement fund, paying 0.08% annual fee (that&#x27;s $0.80 per $1,000) with an average return of 7%-10% over the last 20 years. I&#x27;ll wind it down to less aggressive as I get older.<p>Apart from that, I have little trust in myself to, on average, make decisions that will outperform the above. My tolerance for risk of that sort is pretty low, and I&#x27;m not particularly motivated by money beyond the comfortable lifestyle I have now: It&#x27;s zero debt, will see college tuition paid for my 3 kids, a reasonable retirement ready in a few more decades, and some assets to leave to my children to make their lives slightly easier when I ultimately pass away. I guess I&#x27;d like to have more money, but it&#x27;s not a burning desire and I don&#x27;t see a path to it that doesn&#x27;t risk either quality of life, lots of stress, or both.')
