Trucks wear out roads orders of magnitude more than cars. In the US trucks pay much less than cars, in total, for road maintenance. It is likely the same in Australia. Simply rebalancing the taxation to the amount of road wear would eliminate the need to tax EV road use without it being a significant subsidy of EVs.<p>Diesel trucks are also the dirtiest vehicles on the road. It makes absolutely no sense to subsidize trucking.')
