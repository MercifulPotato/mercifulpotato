Its long term efficacy on the other hand is yet unknown and the supply chain issues are significant (it&#x27;s a result of mRNA being an ephemeral cellular product being stored artificially).<p>Of course if you made an mRNA virus to produce some sort of toxic cellular protein then safety would be an issue - which is what the phase 1 and 2 trials are about.  Phase 4 is about finding the one in a million adverse reactions.')
