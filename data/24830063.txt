It&#x27;s generally easy to find what you&#x27;re looking for, but you&#x27;re always &quot;figuring it out&quot;; it&#x27;s hard to pin things down as having a concrete, spatial location. You never quite have a stable notion of &quot;where you are&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I don&#x27;t feel this way about Slack (mostly). It has a clear visual hierarchy of Servers &gt; Channels&#x2F;DMs &gt; Messages [&gt; Threads]. Discord has things linked every-which-way; someone will start a group call and it&#x27;s somehow separate from the shared server you&#x27;re on, living in a whole separate subtree of the interface.<p>Maybe the difference is that Discord accounts are cross-server? So you have conversations that live in a server, and conversations that live outside of any particular server?')
