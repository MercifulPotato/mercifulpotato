Powell and Clayton L. Thyne provide a definition:<p>A coup attempt includes illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.<p>There are two key components of this definition. The first is that it is illegal. Powell and Thyne note that this “illegal” qualifier is important to include &quot;because it differentiates coups from political pressure, which is common whenever people have freedom to organize.&quot;<p>In other words, protests, or threats of protest don’t count as coups. Neither do legal efforts such as a vote of no confidence or an impeachment.<p>But an even more critical aspect of Powell and Thyne’s definition is that it requires the involvement of elites.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uky.edu&#x2F;~clthyn2&#x2F;powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uky.edu&#x2F;~clthyn2&#x2F;powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf</a><p>&gt;&quot;Nonetheless, we should not be surprised that the media has rushed to apply the term to the riot. This phenomenon was examined in a November 2019 article titled “Coup with Adjectives: Conceptual Stretching or Innovation in Comparative Research?,” by Leiv Marsteintredet and Andres Malamud. The authors note that as the incidence of real coups has declined, the word has become more common but with modifiers attached.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0032321719888857" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0032321719888857</a>')
