I do agree with the wisdom part. ;)<p>I also like to consider the experience of time in relation to total life lived.<p>e.g. A month to a five year-old is the equivalent of a year to a 60 year-old.<p>So as we experience more time, we feel that time passes more quickly. Although I sure hope there is a plateau to it as we get older.')
