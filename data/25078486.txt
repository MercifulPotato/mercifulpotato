And compared to Google&#x27;s overall value, they don&#x27;t particularly need the sale price.<p>The other problem is that if it&#x27;s a dead or dead-end service then who would buy it?  Maybe VC is easier than I thought...  Perhaps Google values services more than most. They certainly spend a lot when acquiring other companies.  Who would pay $2B for Google Reader or Daydream?<p>I think the other thing that was unstated in my last comment is that a lot of Google products are not much more than a veneer over material design and a bigtable or spanner backend.  What is there to sell aside from the concept, glue code, and design work? The data?  Now there&#x27;s something that would <i>really</i> get people up in arms.<p>If you want to argue that the data Google has is very valuable then I agree wholeheartedly.  It&#x27;s also not going to sell that data which would be suicide from a privacy perspective.  Letting new products use existing data is also pretty valuable, but doesn&#x27;t make the resulting product as useful to anyone else.')
