I use it for work and it makes me fast.<p>But I find a ton of value in strongly typed languages like Haskell, Elm, F#, Ocaml, ReasonML etc. Also the promise of closed-loop system where type errors can be caught at compile time is something I look up to.<p>Is there any pure functional language with Clojure like dev. experience? Especially the REPL. Ideally something first class and baked into the core.')
