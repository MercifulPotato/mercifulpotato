This translated to more than 1kg weight loss per week, pretty reliably. Overall I lost 17kg. I adjusted the TDEE and calorie values as needed to maintain the weight loss speed.<p>The weight loss was extremely fast, but so was the rate at which I lost lean mass. This makes sense, as I didn&#x27;t exercise much, aside from occasional long walks &#x2F; 1 mile run. According to this study [0], exercising should maintain lean muscle mass.<p>My personal observations are in line with the studies I have read about IF.<p>Some other observations I have made:<p>* The rate at which I gained 75% of the weight back was stunning to me. It was as fast as I lost it.<p>* My partner does not feel well when fasting, so IF doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I think it worked well for me. I did supplement with vitamins to account for the decreased amount of food intake.<p>* I noticed that whenever I had alcohol, while still adhering to the daily calorie limit, my weight would not go down until about 3 days have passed. I had assumed alcohol would only contribute its caloric energy, but, sure enough, every time I had a beer, I could see in the weight graph a bump that lasted for about 3 days, then the weight would suddenly jump down to where I was expecting it to be, based on the weight loss slope.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7468742&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7468742&#x2F;</a>')
