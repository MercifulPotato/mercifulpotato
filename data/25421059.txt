Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25421931], score=None, time=1607969912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418277, text='I&#x27;m not a hardware review expert but I think one of the biggest advantages of the Ryzen 5000 series vs the 3900x is the CPU performance for apps that don&#x27;t take advantage of parallelism across many cores. The 5000 series has a completely new architecture and is supposedly WAY faster than the 3000 series for single core tasks. That&#x27;s partly why gaming performance is so much better with the 5000 series since it often comes down to execution speed on 1 core, but that would also apply to many programming benchmarks too.<p>It would be interesting to see the same benchmarks with the 5000 series. I know the author said he didn&#x27;t have that CPU to test it against, but IMO it would be a more fair comparison considering the 3900x is using an older CPU architecture that has been drastically improved upon with hardware that&#x27;s available today (ie. the 5000 series isn&#x27;t the next gen, it&#x27;s the current gen).')
