I am in a marriage with four kids and my in-laws are divorced. MY marriage and family life is <i>exponentially</i> more difficult because of my in-laws&#x27; divorce. E.g. think holidays are hard? Just wait until you have to simultaneously manage holidays with kids while not insulting your in-laws with who gets time when.<p>Don&#x27;t @ me with &quot;but what about the wife-beater junkie?!&quot; Yes, safety and sanity of course require separation in cases. But barring safety and the extremes, remember that any &quot;other spouse&quot; out there likewise has flaws and will also <i>change</i> with the passage of time. Also, you are likely very flawed and suck in many ways that only relationships will bring to surface. There is no such thing as a perfect spouse because there is a common weakness that will be brought to each relationship: YOU.<p>Lastly, lest you think of marriage as just a relationship with two people, have some bloody perspective on our species and society and realize that the stability of society will come from each new generation. Stability is not built into human civilization; it is won by blood, sweat, and tears. One of the greatest indicators of success in a child, in the future who you depend on, is a stable two-parent household.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;m not advocating that people stay in abusive relationships. I am aware of how common abuse can be. I am also not advocating that you just &quot;stick it out&quot; while fighting like dogs for decades.<p>What I am advocating for is for spouses in a strained relationship not to consider divorce a solution that removes a problem from their life. Put in the work (which may a long time!) to see if you can make it work.<p>What can happen very often is that divorce removes the problem from the spouses and places the burden of the problem onto the children.And then, of course, the children cannot complain about it because it is the child&#x27;s fault that they have issues with their parents divorce (which is <i>always</i> very friendly and amicable).')
