Counting hours from sunrise or sunset (instead of noon) was common in the ancient world. (They were often rubber hours so there were always 12 hours of day and 12 of night regardless of the season.)<p>Some years ago I sketched a way to do smoothed DST based on when the sun rises. The trick is to avoid time zone differences due to differences in latitude (as well as longitude). I chose to use sunrise at the nearest tropic as the benchmark, which gives you a gradual DST adjustment of about an hour and a half between winter and summer, changing by up to a minute or two each day. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catless.ncl.ac.uk&#x2F;Risks&#x2F;search?query=Sunrise+time+Finch" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catless.ncl.ac.uk&#x2F;Risks&#x2F;search?query=Sunrise+time+Fin...</a>')
