For that reason alone, it should be a nonstarter, it is really sad to see it flourishing when we already have a variety of types of money. A government could make a crypto currency without the hashing part, and save us a lot of energy. I donâ€™t care about the libertarian part of this, because we cannot escape the need to create and enforce rules and work together, so we will always need government.')
