They soak water into the ground, which dissolves the chemicals, then they pump water up from a well and spray it in the air to evaporate and dissipate the chemicals. Exposure to oxygen and ultraviolet light from daylight breaks up the molecules, over time.<p>It is not healthy to be around that spray. That has not stopped people from building housing complexes around exhausts from similar operations in SV.')
