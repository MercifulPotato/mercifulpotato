Usually I find partners in my classes to review the lecture with and work on the assignment in parallel. I get so much drive, energy and fun just by not being alone and discussing concepts together. Since I am in my masters, I can freely choose the lectures I want and often don&#x27;t know anyone in class and rely on making friends in the first week(s). So I am way more on my own during corona and feel like I am fighting alone against the quite demanding lectures. It&#x27;s not easy and it&#x27;s just not as fun anymore. I feel like I am only trying to survive the exams without the drive to learn and explore.')
