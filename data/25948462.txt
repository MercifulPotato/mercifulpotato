And when all those shorts run out, the short-sellers need to have bought shares back again. With share prices this high, they&#x27;re going to have to pay a lot of money for them, and people holding shares could make a ton of profit.<p>But it&#x27;s definitely risky. You could lose a lot of money. Many of the people buying are also doing it to stick it to the hedge funds and give them a taste of their own medicine.')
