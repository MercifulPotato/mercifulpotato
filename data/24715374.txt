The speed of his recovery and the fact that him having Coronavirus isn&#x27;t even part of the news cycle anymore seems like a strong indicator that the treatment is probably a game changer.<p>&gt;A lot of really smart people with decades of experience in the field, and a direct clinical role have collected a variety of approaches that seem to work. Unfortunately, none of them have characterized Vit D as a &#x27;game changing drug.&#x27;<p>Sorry - I&#x27;m more impressed by a single randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial than I am by argument by authority.  Perhaps we can check back here in a couple of years time ...<p>I can&#x27;t help remembering how actual doctors in the field were telling us back in February to &quot;get a flu shot&quot;, or &quot;masks only work for doctors who&#x27;ve been trained to put them on properly&quot;.  I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;d already purchased my N95 masks in January while you guys were asleep.')
