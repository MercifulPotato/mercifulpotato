I couldn&#x27;t believe how snappy it is.<p>This is the common refrain I tend to see.  I know I was certainly in the &quot;Can&#x27;t believe it&quot; category, since I&#x27;d tried wayland about 4 years ago and ended up moving back to X.<p>That said, I had exactly the same reaction 2 years ago when I gave it a shot on my new machine.<p>It was fast, didn&#x27;t show any tearing or flickering, handled automatic configuration of most monitors correctly, and made my touchpad genuinely nice to use.<p>Just the touchpad support alone won me over pretty much immediately.<p>I went from &quot;Eh, Wayland isn&#x27;t ready&quot; to &quot;Holy shit, I&#x27;m never going back!&quot;')
