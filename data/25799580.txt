Item(by='frozenlettuce', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610765837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799374, text='&quot;piscoso&quot; is a very specific term (if I google that I get just dictionary entries, almost no actual use). Replacing it with &quot;cheio de peixe&quot; (full of fish) would make the translation much easier')
