It&#x27;s basic human nature.<p>Instead of decrying that mechanism, be happy that people tell you to shut up&#x2F;stop inviting you to parties&#x2F;block you on Twitter.<p>Because all those are low-intensity interventions. They give you essential feedback, and do so rather early in the process.<p>Most importantly, they make it unnecessary to use the <i>other</i> method society has to enforce common rules: the criminal justice system.<p>If you believe society today is less free than it was in the past, just remember that until the 80s, most Americans lived in small towns. <i>Nothing</i> I see people today complaining about compares to the essential small-town experience of your church community (i. e. &quot;the town&quot;) ostracising you for wearing white after Labor day, or having disabled child, or being too friendly to &lt;anyone they don&#x27;t like&gt;.<p>And that&#x27;s the premium experience reserved for the John Sinclairs. If you happen not to white and&#x2F;or a man, your life had to follow a template like a MySpace page: you get to decide on decorations, and it&#x27;s horrible either way.')
