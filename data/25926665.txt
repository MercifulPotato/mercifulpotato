Flatpak can make use of that to isolate applications from the system but many (and I&#x27;m using that to account for recent changes -- last time I looked into it, it was <i>most</i>) applications on Flathub are packaged with full access to $HOME and&#x2F;or the root filesystem.<p>It&#x27;s not just a matter of technical difficulty, but also a problem of getting users on board: lots of them look at Flathub and -- quite understandably -- wonder why you&#x27;d want to jump through fifty sandboxing hoops to sandbox applications like Gimp and VLC, whose developers they trust and for which they get sandboxed packages out of their distributions&#x27; repos. The obvious retort that this isn&#x27;t <i>aimed</i> at applications like Gimp and VLC feels a bit unsubstantiated because... what applications is it actually aimed at, then? Closed-source, potentially malicious applications like... what, if Linux had a lot of those, &quot;the year of Linux on the desktop&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be a joke. And why not just run those in a virtual machine, which is likely to be a lot harder to escape from and also means you get to keep a &quot;normal&quot; *nix system as a host.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get people on-board with sandboxing when most of them shrug and say they don&#x27;t need it, and when -- if you squint a little -- it kindda turns out they&#x27;re not entirely wrong, either.')
