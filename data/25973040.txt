If your job pays 11&#x27;000$, your take-home pay is 11+12 = 23&#x27;000$. If you do very well and get a 2000$ raise, your income is now 13&#x27;000$, so you don&#x27;t get the welfare, and your take-home pay is now 13&#x27;000$, meaning you <i>lost</i> 23-13 = 10&#x27;000$ of effective income by getting a raise.')
