All I really had left at this point was Google Play Music and Google Keep (apart from android itself and gmail, which I&#x27;m working on). If they  phase these two products out, they will have alienated me out of every product of theirs I&#x27;ve ever used. They&#x27;re already consolidating google play with youtube music (which is bizarre to me).<p>The hardest to cut will probably be gmail, but the fact that they slip advertisements into my inboxes has been pretty motivating. Youtube is also difficult, but as a resource it seems to somehow become less and less useful to me every year. I know that subscribing to youtube channels via RSS and using a program to automatically download the videos doesn&#x27;t count as &#x27;not using youtube,&#x27; but these days I&#x27;m starting to feel like content creators will get there eventually wrt video hosting alternatives')
