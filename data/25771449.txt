Item(by='colejohnson66', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610594397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770682, text='I’ve reported so many comments that are clearly TOS breaking (such as ones saying it’s ok to be violent against politicians who failed us (or even ones saying one of them should be <i>shot</i>)), but they say they “don’t violate their community standards”. It’s garbage. And when you “appeal”, they say “no, we looked at it again, and it’s still ok”. I’ve given up on hoping FB moderation improves. They need to be smacked down <i>hard</i>. What good is “community standards” if they’re not enforced?<p>Instagram, interestingly, it a lot more heavy handed (still not great though). Joan Cornella[0], who makes surrealist(?) comic strips, has posted on his IG story about his posts being removed for “violence” or whatever.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;sirjoancornella" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;sirjoancornella</a>')
