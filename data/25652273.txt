Good for users, but not so good for us.<p>This sounds like the crux of the problem. Your company has prioritized rapid fixes over sustainable engineering. The bandaid may be repeatable, but that doesn&#x27;t make it sustainable with growth. The most simple solution, is that for every amount of time spent on call 2x as much time should be spent in resolving any tech debt that leads to such a situation.<p>&gt; IMO compensation or extra time off would be ideal<p>I think that you should negotiate this based solely on the fact that you can no longer sleep. Aka, you should take off days for every night you work')
