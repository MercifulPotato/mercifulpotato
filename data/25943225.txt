It ought to be made very clear in README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md or something too.<p>I do wish people weren&#x27;t completely closed to PRs though. I think companies are often misled when they think they&#x27;ll get free labor out of open source, etc. and I think the free-as-in-libre aspect is more important relative to community aspect than a lot of people, but still - I hate it when my only option if I want a bug fixed is to wait for the company to do it themselves or fork. Even if I have to sign over all my rights of the code, I&#x27;d so much rather they at least consider taking my PR and be done with it. They don&#x27;t have to do it for features they don&#x27;t like or fixes that have downsides. But for a straightforward fix, at least look at it. It might be all the free help you ever get from the community.')
